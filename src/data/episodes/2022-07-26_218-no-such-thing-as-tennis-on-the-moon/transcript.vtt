00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 It's a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.360
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.240
 and Anichesinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.320
 facts of the last seven days at a no particular order.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.840
 Here we go.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.080
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact this week, my fact is that in an attempt

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.520
 to work out who the murderer and Charles Dickens' last unfinished novel was, the lead character

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.000
 was put on trial.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.920
 So this is the mystery of Edwin Druid.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.320
 Yeah, this was the final novel of Charles Dickens that he was serializing in a newspaper

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.920
 that were meant to be 12 installments.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.200
 He only got as far as six before he passed away.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.600
 And as it was, the lead character, Edwin Druid, goes, he disappears.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.960
 And so we never know what happened to him.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.120
 And people ever since have been trying to work it out by looking for clues within it.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.120
 And so on.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.360
 And in 1914, a mock trial was put on as part of an attempt to try and work out who might

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.360
 have murdered him.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.600
 And the lead character of the book, John Jasper, was put on trial.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.240
 And it was full of celebrities. The judge of the trial was G.K. Chesterton.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.720
 The foreman of the jury was George Bernard Shaw.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.120
 It was a very, very cool trial.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.240
 And did they find him innocent or guilty or?

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.720
 No, they, I think they wanted to go for manslaughter in the end.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.280
 But then, yeah, G.K. Chesterton and got a very impatient with everyone and found everyone

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.560
 guilty of contempt of court by the end of the day.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.560
 Nice.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 Except himself, right?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.560
 Except himself.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.560
 Yeah, but when do you get a judge finding himself guilty of contempt of court, that's super

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560
 rare.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.560
 That's happened.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.360
 I remember that happening in America in the last few years.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.360
 Really?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.360
 Yeah.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.360
 Wow.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.480
 Is that a really good moral judge or an extremely immoral judge?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 It's hard to say.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.720
 Because he just looked to himself and gone, "God, even I can see that I'm terrible."

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.000
 My feeling is, and I might be wrong about this, maybe a judge had his mobile phone on or

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 something.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.600
 And then he got a call and he kind of found himself in contempt or something.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.600
 That rings a bell, yeah.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.600
 It's really good.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.000
 So fans of this novel are called Drew Idz, which I think is very clever.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Yes.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.880
 Or "Drewdians," or "Drewdists."

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.880
 Yeah.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.880
 Yeah.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.560
 There's a whole website where you can read every single possible scenario or sort of outcome

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.480
 of what might have happened to Edwin Druid.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.720
 And there's hundreds of over the years, just so many people have been trying to work it

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.720
 out.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.760
 There's been four movies that have been made of the book where different outcomes have

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.760
 been revealed at the end.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.320
 There was a Broadway musical whereby the audience actually voted on who they thought it

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.120
 was at the end of the show.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.120
 It wasn't only that, was it?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.600
 So this musical was a really big deal.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.480
 I'd never actually heard of it, but it won five Tony Awards.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.040
 I think it won Best Musical in the 80s and Best Actor, I think.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.240
 But the audience got to vote on who killed Edwin Druid, and they also got to vote on various

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.240
 other things.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.740
 So they got to vote on what was the identity of Dick Dattery, which was unknown at the

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.200
 time Dick and Stop Writing, and they got to vote on which couple would become romantically

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.600
 involved in the end.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.160
 And all the actors had to train up to be able to perform any scene of any of these possible

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.160
 outcomes.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.400
 When I was a child, I had a computer game called Star Wars Chess, and there obviously there

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.120
 was a good team and an evil team, all characters from Star Wars, and every single possible move

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.920
 combination that you made, there was a little cutscene showing you how R2D2 defeated Darth

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920
 Vader.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.720
 Yeah, but not for every single possible game of chess, because it's like trillions.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720
 No, trillions.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720
 For every piece combo.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720
 Right.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.840
 So you would always have a good rook defeating an evil pawn or you would have it.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840
 It was brilliant.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.360
 Yeah, I have surprised actually because it sounds very geeky that, and you never really

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.960
 struck me as a kind of person who would like that kind of thing.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.960
 Yeah, weird, isn't it?

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.960
 I'm thinking of which.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.760
 Has anyone else been in a mock trial in their life?

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.760
 No.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.760
 Yes.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.760
 Have you?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.760
 What?

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.760
 A wide school.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.760
 Yeah, same.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.760
 Yeah.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.760
 For what, what did you both do?

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.760
 I'm asking it turned out, and I was livid.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760
 No, I'm joking.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.760
 I was a lawyer in the mock trial.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760
 Yeah, me too.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.760
 It's really fun.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.760
 That's so fun.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.760
 And what?

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.120
 In fact, about a case, so mine was a fight in a pub, so I'm going to have been hit with a

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120
 poor queue, I think.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.160
 And they give you lots of different eyewitness accounts, and you have to then hold a trial.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.280
 And you sometimes, I think we went to an actual court to do this.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280
 Did you?

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.280
 Very exciting.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.280
 Wow.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.280
 Yeah.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.600
 Are you just, you were a juvenile delinquent and you've kind of hospitalized it as a game?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 That's it.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.600
 Yeah.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.480
 And we went to a court when we were kids at school.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.480
 Yeah.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.120
 And I remember it because we were there basically a load of kids, and these people just kept coming

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.680
 up, and they'd all be beating each other up the night before, because it was like, wow,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.960
 it was basically people who'd been locked up that night for assault, and then they were

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.320
 coming in doing their pleas and stuff like that.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.440
 This is your school trip.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.400
 What else went to old towers, but yeah, probably me.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.960
 We sort of went to the Battle of Hastings site, and I mean, that, in a sense, was a lot

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.400
 of people beating each other up, so I think maybe it was just, um, to prepare a

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400
 service for the future.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400
 God.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.680
 It's weird that they felt they need to investigate it though, because Dickens did actually finish

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.680
 at Wendru, didn't he?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.680
 What?

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680
 Did he?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.680
 He finished it, um, no.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680
 No.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:34.440
 Yeah, he finished it in 1873, um, so he died in 1870, but he did finish it him with a medium,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.000
 but it was, but it was with a medium called Thomas Power James, which I think is really

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.680
 cool, and this book, oh, it was the mystery of everyone drew part two, and he published

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.320
 part one, kind of cockily, under his own name now, Thomas Power James, and then part two was

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.760
 what the meat, what he'd learned from Dickens' ghost, and it had two prefaces at the start of

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.640
 it, one from Thomas Power James, who was saying this is such a privilege to be able to write

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.960
 with Dickens, and then the other from Dickens himself, saying, "You'll notice my suit."

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.280
 So there is a story that Dickens wrote to Queen Victoria a few months before his death,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.520
 and he was saying to her, "Would you like a spoiler of what happened to Edwin Druid,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.880
 and she wrote back, and she said, 'No, I'm fine, thank you.'"

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.640
 Out, she offered her a little more of it in advance of her subjects, and she said, "That's

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.360
 cool, I'm enjoying the instruments," or whatever she said, but we could have had Queen Victoria

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.560
 solving the mystery of what happened to Edwin Druid, which would have been very cool.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.560
 Wow.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.200
 Well, supposedly the illustrator of the book claimed to have known who the murderer was,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.480
 so his name was Luke Fields, and he had given instructions by Dickens that John Jasper,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.160
 he wear a net tie, and the idea was that Jasper strangles Edwin Druid with it, and he used

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.000
 to have a close collaboration obviously with Dickens because he liked to seed things that

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.160
 would appear later in the story, so maybe he did do it.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.800
 We didn't even know that Edwin Druid died, though.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800
 No, we don't.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.920
 At the time the book ends, he has just disappeared, he might come back.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.160
 Most people at the time kind of thought that he was just, he hadn't died, didn't they?

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.160
 Yeah.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.320
 That was like prevailing theory at the time.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.600
 Well, there's another character.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.600
 Did you mention him?

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.600
 Dick Dachery.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600
 Yeah.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600
 I know.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.360
 That would mean so much more to me if I knew that the story was.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.360
 Have you guys read this?

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.360
 I haven't.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.360
 I started reading it today and I was too hung up.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.360
 I got about five pages.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.360
 I would have thought you would.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360
 Anna, because you read loads of Dickens.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:31.840
 I chose not to read the one that's only half finished, but I do really want to now, partly

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.120
 because people say that it's so impossible to work out what might have happened, like

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.880
 there was one woman who adapted it for the BBC and she had to finish it a few years

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.880
 ago.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.960
 And she said, a lot of people know that Dickens didn't finish Erwin Druid.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.840
 What they don't know is that he died intentionally so that he didn't have to, because he literally

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.000
 had no idea how to tie up all these new sets.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.920
 Stephen King hasn't unfinished work.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.880
 Now, he's still alive, obviously, but he hasn't unfinished work.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.560
 Is it just a thing he's working on at the moment?

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.560
 It's called The Plant.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.440
 It's a really interesting experiment he did, so he published it chapter by chapter online

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.440
 just like Dickens.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.160
 And he asked people to pay for it online, a dollar per chapter.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.600
 And he said, if the number of people paying for this dips below 75% of the people who are downloading

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.840
 it and reading it, then I will stop writing it.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.360
 And that's exactly what happened after about five chapters.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360
 Really?

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.080
 Yeah, so some people were really annoyed, because they'd paid six or seven dollars and they

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.280
 didn't get a finished story, but by part four, only 46% of people who downloaded it were

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.280
 paying for it.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.280
 Really?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.280
 Is it bad?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.280
 Have you looked at it?

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280
 I haven't.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280
 Do you know what it's about?

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.760
 It's an author who I think receives a creepy gift of a plant.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.560
 I mean, it doesn't exactly sound like a shining dog.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.560
 Yeah.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.880
 No, I've heard it's very good, and it was just for that reason.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.320
 He was testing the internet model of commerce.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.360
 It didn't work for him, but he did release, if you remember, his book The Green Mile, which

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.640
 was transformed, was made into a movie.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.640
 Transformed.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.240
 Logistically into the film.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.600
 We don't have the book anymore, because it was transformed into a film.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.600
 Transformed into the film, transform it.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.000
 So, The Green Mile, he did that with the Dickens model as well.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 He put out single chapters, and because the idea was, Dickens always used to end on a cliffhanger,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.200
 and he thought, could I do that?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.200
 And could I generate a whole book where I was forcing myself month by month to reveal the

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.200
 next chapter?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.800
 And yeah, so that's what The Green Mile is.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.480
 There's one book that we'll never read, so I looked at it a bit on published novels.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.400
 And Evelyn War wrote his first novel, actually, called The Temple at Thatch in 1925.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.200
 And then he gave a draft to his friend, Harold Ackton, and Ackton gave it quite bad review.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.640
 So, he wrote a letter to Evelyn War, suggesting that he'd do it in a few elegant copies for

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.440
 the friends who really love you, and then he gave a list of the suggested friends, and

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.760
 they were all the idiots they knew.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:54.640
 And Evelyn War was so upset by this, so devastated that he walked down to the sea, he took

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.760
 all his clothes off, he left a note with a Euripides quote about how the sea can wash

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.440
 away all ills, and then he swam into the sea intending to commit suicide, and he was stung

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.520
 by a jellyfish, so he gave up and returned ashore.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.520
 Wow.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.080
 So, yeah, it was for a jellyfish.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.120
 We would not have Bride said revisited.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.120
 You don't hear people taking off all their clothes and going into the sea these days, do

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.120
 you?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.120
 No, it used to be.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120
 No, that used to be a thing, didn't it?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.120
 I think so.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.520
 Craig Venter, who's famous for sequencing DNA, he did that as well.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.280
 He, I think he was fighting in the Vietnam War, and he wasn't a clever tactic, was it?

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.440
 Right, what we'll do is we'll all leave our clothes at the shore, they'll think they've

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.440
 won.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.000
 Actually, we've gone around in a big boat.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.480
 No, he, that's not what happened Andy.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480
 You weren't there, man.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480
 Yeah, you weren't there, man.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.760
 No, he got very depressed, and he swam out to sea.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.800
 I think he did exactly that, took all of his clothes off, and then while he was quite

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.840
 far out, he suddenly had an epithet that he wanted to live and that he had, he wanted to do

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.920
 well in science and so on, and he turned around to come back, and that supposedly is the big

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.000
 problem when you swim too far out, and people have a change of mind.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.320
 You're too far out to have the energy to swim all the way back.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.960
 And so he said that was the hardest struggle of anything, but yeah, because he lost all

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.960
 his energy.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.080
 And then in this moment of sort of near death, he realized he wanted to live.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.680
 You don't have into Terry Pratchett's unfinished works.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.280
 I think he had about ten novels on the go at the time he died in sort of in various stages

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.100
 of completion, obviously, so so much place in the others, but they were crushed by a steam

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.100
 roller after he died.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.100
 Oh, by accident?

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.100
 No, it was deliberate.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.100
 All right.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.440
 He decreed in his world that he wanted them to be crushed by a steam roller.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.440
 But it's paper.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.440
 No, it's a hard time.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.440
 No, it's a hard time.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.440
 He's got it.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440
 Yeah.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.440
 I mean, how's this piece of paper?

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.880
 Oh no, this piece of paper is completely flammable.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:50.920
 It's done by a vintage steam roller or a steam fair, and it was called Lord Jericho, the

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.920
 steam roller.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.920
 Sounds quite cool.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.920
 Good name for a steam roller.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.920
 Yeah, it is.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.920
 Yeah.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.160
 And it's now, it was done as part of a celebration of opening of an exhibition for all his work,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.200
 and that's now part of the exhibition, his broken hard drive.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.800
 I think Dickens didn't know what happened to the end of Edwin Druid, because I didn't realize

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.240
 that the ending of great expectations, I think quite famously originally was different,

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.640
 which is so satisfying, because it's always been kind of an annoying ending where spoilers

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.880
 guys close your ears if you haven't read it.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.000
 So Estella and Pip obviously end up together, quite abruptly at the end, sort of end up together.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.560
 They walk off into the sun set together and the last line is something like, I saw no

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.680
 more shadow of her leaving my side, something like that.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.760
 But in his original one, he properly sent it off to the publishers and stuff, and they'd

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.960
 split up Estella heard, she was widowed, she then married someone else, they had a little

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.160
 meeting and he went, oh how sad, I guess we'll never be together.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.800
 And then he sent that to the publishers, went on holiday with his mate, who was a guy called

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.600
 Edward Bulla-Litten, and went on holiday with him, showed him this, and he's his friend said,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.320
 that's too miserable, you've got to change it immediately.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.600
 And so he immediately, quickly, hurriedly changed it and had them end up together.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.160
 It's quite good as an author, if someone says that's crap, you need to change it to actually

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.160
 do it, isn't it?

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160
 I know.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.720
 He would have just gone, nope, salt off mate, yeah.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.200
 Bulla-Litten was kind of the leading author of his time and his word, no one really reads

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.640
 him anymore, but he came up with the phrases, the great unwashed and the pen is mightier

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.640
 than the sword.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.480
 Two phrases I use every day.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.280
 Andy, why don't you not get on the bus?

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.240
 Because I haven't had my show yet, and so I am feeling a bit like the great unwashed.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.240
 Okay.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.080
 That's never the context in which it is.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:38.200
 You're just using non-metaphorically idiotic.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.320
 Why are you attacking that person with a pen?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.000
 Well, the thing is James, the pen is mightier than the sword, right?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 My sword is absolutely tiny, but I've had this special novelty samurai pen belt.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.920
 I could take your head off.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:14:00.880
 Okay, is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.400
 My fact this week is that in the past 10 years, the number of registered pinball players worldwide

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.680
 has gone from 500 to over 100,000.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.080
 That's a big increase.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.080
 It's a big jump.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.080
 How?

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.640
 People have got really into it.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.640
 Why do you have to register?

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.920
 You were allowed to play pinball without being officially registered, but then there is

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.120
 the International Flip of Pinball Association, which is where you officially register if you

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.600
 want to take part in competitions or just be recognised as a player.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:34.320
 I think it was measured by them in 2006, and there were 500 official players, and then NBC

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.960
 reported last year, there were over 100,000.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.960
 And this is huge comeback.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.800
 Do you have to sign the register of pinballers?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800
 What do you mean?

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.440
 Well, just normally when there's a register, you have to sign the register.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.440
 Do you?

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440
 Yeah.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.440
 No.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.440
 You don't have to sign the sex offender's register, do you?

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.440
 Well, I don't know, but that's...

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.080
 Why have you got special circumstances?

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.920
 But in the register at school, they just say your name, and you say here.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.920
 Yeah.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.920
 That's true.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920
 But they don't do that.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

 That's not a register of pinballers.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:16.920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:35.000
 That's not a register of pinballers.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.040
 That's not a register of pinballers.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.040
 That's not a register of pinballers.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.040

 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:53.040

 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040

 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.040
 It's not a register of pinballers.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.040
 When I last time I played Darts, it was against my wife and she beat me.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.040
 I kind of thought that maybe it was a game of luck.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.040
 That's absolutely right.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.040
 This band was absolutely mad.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.040
 So, Mayor La Guardia, Fiorrello La Guardia,

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.040
 who the main airport in New York is named after now.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.040
 He said that people who pushed pinball

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.040
 were slimy crews of tin horns well dressed

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.040
 and living in luxury on penny thievery.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.040
 He was photographed with a sled chair

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.040
 and a smashing up pinball machines.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.040
 He ordered the police to make prohibition-style raids

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.040
 on pinball machines their top priority.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.040
 Top priority. New York.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.040
 It was 1942 as well. Total war.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.040
 It was the methamphetamine of its day.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.040
 Yeah, but they did ritualistic things to the pinball machines.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040
 So he said...

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:56.040
 Basically, they said it was a waste of metals,

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.040
 which could be turned into elements and bullets.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.040
 So, 5,000 machines were confiscated and destroyed.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.040
 They were dumped into Long Island Sound.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.040
 But the metal in the balls was confiscated

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.040
 and supposedly it was enough to build four 2,000 pound bombs.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:13.040
 And the police carved the pinball table legs into cudgles

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.040
 and presented them to Mayor La Guardia.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.040
 But then they dropped the bomb on some enemies,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.040
 but they just flexed it away.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.040
 That's what the damn busters was basically.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.040
 And the...

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.040
 Basically, even though it was illegal, they still used them.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.040
 They just moved them to pornography shops.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.040
 Right.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.040
 So, if you wanted to play pinball, you had to go to a pornography shop.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.040
 So you'd send your 7-year-old like, "Okay, you can play the game."

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.040
 But...

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.040
 God, that's terrible.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.040
 That's very funny idea.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.040
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.040
 Very distracting.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.040
 It would be much harder to focus, I think, on your pinball game,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.040
 if you're surrounded by porn.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.040
 Yeah, that's true.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:56.040
 Maybe if I ever join this association and do it professionally.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.040
 Yeah, I can see you doing that.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.040
 Then when the other guys are playing, I'm just going to put porn into it.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.040
 I'm trying to make it like the 40s for you.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.040
 It's this classic pinball.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.040
 I really like La Guardia.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.040
 As in, I've never really...

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.040
 I've known his name through the airport.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.040
 I didn't know he was the mayor.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.040
 I had no idea.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.040
 And I saw photos of him, and he looks like a mafia Batman villain.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.040
 Like, he looks amazing.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.040
 So I thought, "Okay, I'll just quickly look into him."

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.040
 So they're all this stuff of him being against the pinballing

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.040
 and sledgehammering and the prohibition-style raids.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.040
 He was someone who was sort of kind of against the alcoholic prohibition

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.040
 that was going on and actively protested it.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.040
 And so he invited 20 newspaper reporters

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.040
 to his congressional office in Washington, DC.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.040
 And there, he drank it in front of them.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.040
 And he had a beer that was admittedly, it had low alcohol.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.040
 So I think it was almost on the edge of legality.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.040
 And he mixed it with some tonic.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.040
 And he drank it in front of the reporters with a straight face

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.040
 to say, "Look at this."

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.040
 I just think that's really pathetic.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.040
 I think if you're going to make a statement by drinking beer

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.040
 during prohibition, don't drink low alcohol beer.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.040
 This was tonic.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.040
 I just have a proper point.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.040
 I can just see you if there's prohibition in this country.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.040
 And you're an MP, drinking a full bottle of gin

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.040
 on the steps of the House of Commons.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.040
 This is the point I am making.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.040
 What was I saying?

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.040
 Where are my keys?

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.040
 Okay, so given that pinball was banned for such a long time,

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040
 this is a nice thing.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.040
 The Museum of Pinball is in a place called "Banning" in California.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.040
 That's very good.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.040
 That's really good.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.040
 And I think the guy who won the World Championships last year

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.040
 was 13 years old.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.040
 So this is a guy called Esha Lefkov.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.040
 And he plays it with his dad, I think.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.040
 But it really is attracting all ages.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.040
 It's one's just opened up in London, actually.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.040
 In December 2017, we've got our first proper devoted pinball.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040
 Let's go.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.040
 I think we definitely should go.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.040
 That's cool.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.040
 Oh.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040
 Yeah.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.040
 We'll put on the back burner.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.040
 Do you know what a gobble hole is?

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.040
 Nope.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.040
 I think I do.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:01.040
 It's just a hole in the playing field of a pinball machine

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.040
 which the ball can fall and ending that hole.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.040
 That's rough.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.040
 That's a mean move to have in the middle of a pinball.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.040
 I think the ball can fall down.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.040
 Do you know what a thrust magnet is?

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.040
 A thrust magnet.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.040
 These are all names of magazines

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.040
 that used to surround the pinball machines in there.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.040
 A thrust magnet is just an electromagnet

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.040
 that accelerates the ball through a tube.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.040
 Okay.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.040
 Do you know what a drain automatic is?

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.040
 No.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.040
 I've got 300 of these.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.040
 I'll just keep going until we get one.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.040
 No, a drain automatic is a pinball game

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.040
 where the balls are lost too easily.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.040
 So it's like you just keep losing all the time

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.040
 because your money comes.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040
 Oh, no.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.040
 Like when you go on a fruit machine

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.040
 but someone's already won it loads

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.040
 and so it just eats up all your money.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.040
 Yeah, mine that.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040
 Because it doesn't have any left.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.040
 Damn, the cheating machines.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.040
 In Japan, arcade games are very much more popular than they are here.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.040
 And they've got such a good array of them.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.040
 Have you guys come across the tablecloth hour game?

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.040
 No.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.040
 I really like this.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.040
 It's an arcade game.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.040
 But instead of coming like a joystick or buttons that you press,

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.040
 it's got a sticking out bit that's like the edge of a tablecloth

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.040
 like something hanging over a table.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.040
 And then on the screen there's lots of crockery

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.040
 and you just pull the tablecloth up.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.040
 That sounds really good.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.040
 And see if you can avoid breaking the crock.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.040
 That's incredible.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.040
 And then on that in real life tried to do that in real life.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.040
 No, I didn't get that.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.040
 It's really hard.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.040
 Yeah.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.040
 Because I used to work in a restaurant.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.040
 I used to try all the time.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.040
 Not for long, I bet.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.040
 Your wages were dogged every week.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.040
 Bolton smasher fired from 10th restaurant in a row.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.040
 But of course you have lots of crockery

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.040
 and you have tablecloths of what else you're going to do

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.040
 if you're a teenager.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.040
 You're going to try it.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.040
 Can it really be done?

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.040
 I guess it can be done if you're really, really fast, right?

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.040
 It could be done like for just one object.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040
 You could kind of do it.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.040
 But more often than not, it would just go flying.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.040
 So funny.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.040
 Have we said before there's a Japanese arcade game

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.040
 where you have to poke a robot bottom?

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.040
 Yes, with your finger.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.040
 Yes.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.040
 This is a game where it's a sort of prank on your friend

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.040
 to stick your finger at the bottom.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.040
 Yeah.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.040
 Because there is a prank in Japan known as the enumer.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.040
 I can't remember what their word for it is.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.040
 And you go through all the different games

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.040
 and you have to do it to the teacher

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.040
 and then to the policeman and then someone else.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.040
 And the game is just to poke them in life.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.040
 In real life.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040
 No, it's a game.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.040
 Oh, it's in the game.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.040
 But the prank is a real life thing.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.040
 Right.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.040
 It's like you know like a wet willy way.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.040
 You put your finger in someone's ear.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.040
 It's like that, but with an anus.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.040
 For the anus.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.040
 It's much harder to shove your finger up someone's anus, I think.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.040
 Yeah.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.040
 Especially when everyone's wearing clothes.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.040
 Also.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.040
 You say the words wet willy before you do it as well.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.040
 Sounds a bit bad.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040
 Yeah.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.040
 I think you're all going to have to sign the register.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:50.040
 Okay, as time to move on to fact number three.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040
 And that is James.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.040
 Okay, my fact this week is that the Victorians

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.040
 had better reaction times than we do today.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.040
 Did they?

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040
 What?

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.040
 Did they?

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.040
 That's a good question, Ella, because did they?

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.040
 The thing is, some people think they may have done.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.040
 Okay.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.040
 And this is because we have, we can work out what people's

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.040
 reactions times are now by doing studies and stuff.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.040
 And we have some old results done by friend of the podcast,

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.040
 Francis Goulton, who you talk about lots of times.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.040
 I mean, Major Eugenics is probably an acquaintance of the podcast, I'd say.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.040
 But it was in a time when Eugenics was cool, wasn't it?

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.040
 Yeah, it was.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.040
 Which is not now, of course.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.040
 But his statistics show that people who he studied

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.040
 had quicker reactions than people today.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:44.040
 And so it could be that his data are wrong.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.040
 Or it could be that people have gotten less quick.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.040
 Yeah.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.040
 And a lot of, which do you think it is?

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.040
 I think people have come up with reasons why it might be that we're slower.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.040
 Like maybe there's a lot more contaminants in the air

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.040
 and your brains have got more mercury in them or whatever.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.040
 Your brains have got more stuff in them that are making them slower.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.040
 Oh, wow.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.040
 There are a lot of serious people who think this is true.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.040
 Yeah.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.040
 And my favorite one is in the 20th century,

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.040
 there was a scholar called Erwin W. Silverman, who believed the reason

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.040
 that we got slower reactions is because hype has increased.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:20.040
 Therefore, it's taken longer for things to travel to the brain or from the brain.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.040
 So it's that extra bit of time.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.040
 Does that not sort of make sense a bit?

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.040
 I think they found that tall people are just as fast.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.040
 Oh, okay.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040
 Yeah.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.040
 But like from work, as most reactions are based on you seeing something

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.040
 and responding to it and your eyes don't get further from your brain

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.040
 as you get taller.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.040
 Yeah.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.040
 No, that's true.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.040
 I wonder if someone starts on your foot.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.040
 Maybe it takes you a bit longer now to back away,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.040
 but it doesn't make sense at all.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.040
 I will track my earlier comment.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.040
 Actually, I don't think that does make sense.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:55.040
 My favorite guy who studied this was the 93rd most cited psychologist

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.040
 of the 20th century.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.040
 He is called Edwin Boring.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.040
 He's my favorite psychologist.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.040
 I just love him.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.040
 One day, maybe we'll talk about him.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.040
 But his most famous thing that he did was work out one reason

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:14.040
 why moons look bigger when they're on the horizon than when they're up in the sky.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.040
 I just like the idea that he was cited in so many papers

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.040
 because his name was Boring.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.040
 I think he must be.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.040
 People slagging him off indirectly by just putting a little asterisk

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.040
 in at the bottom saying, "Boring!"

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.040
 I read that one of the things to help.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.040
 This is done a team of Japanese scientists and researchers

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.040
 came out with these results saying,

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.040
 "A way of getting your reactions to be better is to chew gum."

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.040
 Which is really interesting.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.040
 Yeah, I'd not heard that before.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:49.040
 They did this experiment where they said that chewing on gum

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.040
 improves the participants' reaction time by 7%,

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.040
 which is an average of 36 milliseconds.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.040
 It doesn't sound like a lot,

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.040
 but it is made that in, say, like, sport where it takes less than half a second

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.040
 for a baseball pitcher to pitch a ball to the mitt.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.040
 That's obviously a huge amount of time.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.040
 So what they say is that it only takes 10 seconds of chewing

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.040
 to activate the brain regions that are responsible for improving your reactions.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.040
 And after you've done the 10 seconds,

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.040
 it keeps it active for 15 minutes.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.040
 Wow.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.040
 You buy 15 minutes of extra reaction time of 10 seconds of chewing gum.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.040
 You are chewing steroids.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.040
 Congratulations, by the way, on the Tour de France win, Dan.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.040
 Do we know what the mechanism is?

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.040
 Is it that chewing saliva means that you're...

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.040
 According to this, it says,

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.040
 "Your jaw muscles, when you chew, stimulate certain regions of your brain,

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.040
 including the pre-mator cortex."

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.040
 Mmm. Okay.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.040
 What do you mean? That sounds like science.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.040
 I got it from science.com.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:57.040
 So, on reaction times, you know the thing of gum fights in films,

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.040
 where there are two cowboys facing each other,

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.040
 and obviously the bad guy draws first because he uses an evil trickster

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.040
 and he's trying to legitimately gain an advantage of the gum fight by shooting first,

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.040
 and then the good guy draws second but always wins.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.040
 So, Nils Ball, one of the most famous physicists of all time,

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.040
 was obsessed with this, and he theorized that gunslingers who draw second,

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.040
 they draw faster because they're not thinking.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.040
 It's just, it's an instinctive reaction.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.040
 It's like a separate circuit that works.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.040
 It's almost like a reflex reaction.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.040
 Interesting. And he staged mock duels with toy guns at his lab

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.040
 in between all the other important stuff he was doing,

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.040
 and his partner, George Gamau, drew first and lost every time.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:39.040
 However, it's recently been proved by a University of Birmingham study

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.040
 that he was partially right, but it wouldn't quite help.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.040
 So, if you draw second, if you draw responding to...

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.040
 If I'm facing you, Anna, and you draw, I see you drawing and I draw first.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.040
 You're about 10% faster when you draw second than when you draw first.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.040
 But the difference that it would make is only 21 milliseconds.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.040
 That's enough.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.040
 And is that not, yeah?

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.040
 If someone's already pulled the gun on you, it's likely that you won't be able to...

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:07.040
 I will be 21 milliseconds faster, but the gap in time between Anna starting and me starting

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.040
 will still be longer than 21 milliseconds, so I'll still die.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.040
 So, the scientist who studied this, Andrew Welchman, he said, "You'll die satisfied that you are quicker,

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040
 but that's not much to you."

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.040
 I don't understand how if you're using fake guns, not real guns,

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.040
 you can tell who got hit first.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.040
 I think they kind of had a...

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.040
 It's a paintball.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.040
 A paintball or something.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.040
 Paintballs.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.040
 You know the paintballs are edible.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.040
 So, if you got a shot in the mouth, you're laughing.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.040
 Yeah, and you're pulled.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.040
 It's just...

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.040
 Are they not edible?

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.040
 No, they're really not nice.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:46.040
 They're made of food coloring, and the outer shell is some kind of plant-based material.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:51.040
 After you were fired from every restaurant in Bolton, James actually went to work at a paintball place

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.040
 from when she was sacked by eating the ammo.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:59.040
 You got to get away with it because you just had red stuff on the radio now.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.040
 No.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:07.040
 Well, that by the way, the only two scientists we've cited so far are boring and boring.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:14.040
 So, other reaction time things in running races.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:20.040
 If you're doing a sprinting race, then if you move within 0.1 seconds of the starting gun going off,

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.040
 that counts as a full start, so even if you move after the starting gun going off,

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.040
 you've made a full start because it's thought that...

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.040
 Well, it's known that you can't possibly have reacted that fast to the gun going off.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.040
 So, you must have started before you heard it go off.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:40.040
 But that 0.1 is based on an experiment that was done in 1865 and it still stands today.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:45.040
 So, it was done in 1865 by a scientist called Franciscus Cornelis Dondas,

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.040
 who was actually an ophthalmologist.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.040
 But he also worked out reaction times, he gave electric shocks to people's feet,

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.040
 and then he had them squeeze stuff with their hands with the corresponding hand.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.040
 And it was how quick it was for people to go, "Oh, fuck you!"

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.040
 And they took it with my feet!

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:06.040
 The interesting thing about that was really, really short people actually reacted much, much faster than really tall people.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.040
 Which is why the best sprinters are so short. Look at his own boat, he's only three foot nine.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.040
 I spent all day on the internet just testing my reaction time.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.040
 And I agree that I don't think you can get quicker than 0.1 seconds.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.040
 Right, it's kind of impossible.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.040
 Because you can't.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.040
 Well, it's so far away from my best.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.040
 It's hard to imagine anyone.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.040
 You're on eight or nine seconds.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.040
 Look, we had a very heavy night last night.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.040
 Can I just add a little bit of a trivia about Dondas, which I quite like.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.040
 He's apparently also known very well in the world of dentistry,

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.040
 as well as being an ophthalmologist and a reaction time experimenter,

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.040
 because he named the space between the Dawson, the back of your tongue,

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.040
 and the hard palate, so the gap when you're at rest between the back of your tongue

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.040
 and the roof of your mouth is called the space of Dondas.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.040
 Cool!

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.040
 Wow, that's very cool. That's awesome.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.040
 I know.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.040
 Andy, you mentioned Usain Bolt a second ago.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.040
 I was looking into Sprinters as well.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:06.040
 And there's an article written by this guy who claims that Usain Bolt could have broken

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:11.040
 his world record speed times for the 100 meters, not by running faster.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.040
 He could have run at the consistent time that he was doing and still beat it.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.040
 It was his starting point.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.040
 It was his reaction to the gun.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.040
 He's famously as a slow start, doesn't he?

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.040
 Incredibly slow start.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:27.040
 So when he was in the Beijing Olympics, he was the slowest of all the finalists to leave.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.040
 What do you call it?

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.040
 The starting blocks.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:36.040
 So this guy worked out that at Beijing, his starting time, his reaction was 0.165.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:41.040
 If he was able to bring that down to 0.13, he would have brought his world record

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:46.040
 from 9.58 to 9.56, so he would have shaved two milliseconds off that.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.040
 And that's not even a hard one to get.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.040
 That's sort of your average finalist will sprint at that speed off the starting blocks.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:57.040
 And the reason is, so if you go online now, if you're listening to this and you try these games,

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:02.040
 where it's like you're looking at it and it changes color and you have to press the button as quickly as you can,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.040
 it's different to seeing things as to hearing things.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.040
 And I think you're quicker at hearing things than you are at seeing things, I believe.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.040
 Yes, you are.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.040
 So your audio response time is usually lower than your...

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.040
 Yeah, that's true.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.040
 I know a really weird thing about audio response times.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.040
 So athletes who are closer to the starting gun do better.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.040
 Now, that's partly because you're closer.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:28.040
 So you get an advantage of about 15 milliseconds in the closest lane compared with all the other lanes on average, right?

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040
 That's quite a lot.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.040
 It is quite a lot, but there's another reason for this.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:36.040
 Sorry, just to say, I thought they had speakers behind the blocks.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.040
 I think you're right, they now have speakers behind the blocks.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:42.040
 So this was in races where you would have just one gun at the side being fired.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.040
 But the weird thing is, it's not just that you're closer, it's that.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:50.040
 The louder you hear the gunshot, the faster your reaction time, the volume hasn't effect.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.040
 You react to loud noises faster.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.040
 I think you're like scared of it, do you think?

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.040
 I think it must be, because it's like an evolutionary thing.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.040
 Yeah.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.040
 How cool is that?

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.040
 That's really cool.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.040
 Otherwise, they wouldn't have to do it nearly as loud.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.040
 So actually, it's an advantage in running a race if you have a big ear trumpet,

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.040
 which you carry next to your other starting blocks.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.040
 But do you think that's it?

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.040
 It's less than, by the fact, you have to carry your ear trumpet.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:17.040
 It never did me any home on school sports day.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.040
 I was actually looking at if sports, because I was thinking,

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.040
 this thing about reaction time is sort of based on IQ.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.040
 So a lot of people seem to think, or that's very contentious,

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.040
 that reaction time is related to IQ or how smart you are.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.040
 So the idea is that the Victorians might have been cleverer than us.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.040
 So I was thinking sports people often have very fast reactions

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.040
 if you're like a table tennis player or something.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.040
 So I was wondering if they were cleverer.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.040
 And this is a long window way of saying,

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.040
 I ended up finding out that Marion Bartoli, who was my favorite tennis player for a while,

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.040
 has an IQ that is almost off the charts.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.040
 So she has an IQ of 175, which as soon as you're over 140, then you're very bright.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.040
 If you're over 160, you're proper genius.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.040
 And she's there.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.040
 And she said, I'm not really someone that's into telling people about how smart I am.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.040
 I'm kind of trying to hide it.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.040
 And that's what she said to reporters.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.040
 When she published her IQ results.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.040
 Not that smart, is she?

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:13.040
 There's a fly which has the fastest reaction time I think of any animal.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.040
 So it's called the Condola Stylus fly.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:20.040
 And it's so fast that it's almost impossible to take a photo of it lying still.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.040
 So it has a startle reflex of about two milliseconds.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.040
 And it's scared of cameras.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.040
 It's the flash.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040
 It's scared of the flash.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.040
 So just do it without a flash.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.040
 Well, yeah, you're okay.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.040
 Well, that's this bit.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.040
 Yeah, oh my god, fine.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.040
 It's got this reflex of about two milliseconds.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.040
 So if you take a photo with a shutter speed of one two hundredth of a second,

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.040
 which is a very fast shutter speed as they go,

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.040
 you will almost always capture it in flight because that's five milliseconds.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.040
 So nine out of ten times you take the picture.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.040
 You just get the flight in movement.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.040
 You know how when you take a photo of a lot of people,

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.040
 there's always someone with their eyes kind of half closed.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.040
 Yeah.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.040
 These guys, like if they want a family photo of all these flies.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.040
 It's just a blur.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.040
 The chances of them all be in there is pretty low.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.040
 So there's a possible reason for it, which is that they're so brightly coloured.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.040
 They're really brightly coloured flies.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.040
 And we think this is because they are trying to teach predators not to bother trying to hunt them.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.040
 Because they always get away.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.040
 So they're trying to teach the predator to associate that bright colouring on them with...

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.040
 No, that doesn't make any sense.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.040
 If you can really get away that fast, then you don't need something that warns them.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.040
 That sounds like they're bluffing.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.040
 Like, honestly, don't worry about it.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.040
 It would be a waste of effort.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:37.040
 But then again, like you get these really poisonous frogs, don't you, that are really brightly coloured.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.040
 Yeah, they're all predators.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.040
 Why are they all thinking in the best interest of the predators?

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:46.040
 I'm a bit sweet, but...

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:55.040
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.040
 My fact is that the first people to live on the moon might be cavemen.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.040
 Might be.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.040
 Might be.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.040
 Might not be.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.040
 Yeah, my notes actually begin.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.040
 Well, they might.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.040
 So why might they?

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:12.040
 Because it's obviously going to be very uncomfortable living on the moon.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.040
 No one's going to have a great time, but if we want to get into space and colonise somewhere,

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.040
 the moon is not a terrible candidate.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:23.040
 And a Japanese space probe called Celine has just found a massive cave on the moon,

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.040
 which would solve a load of the problems of living on the moon.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.040
 It's 31 miles long.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.040
 It's 100 metres wide.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.040
 It's a huge cave.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.040
 We could get loads of lunar cities in there if we wanted to.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.040
 It's got a 31 miles by 100 metres.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.040
 What did I say, sorry?

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.040
 Yeah, no, you said that.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.040
 I just think you can't get that many cities.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.040
 You're still going to be a bit cramped.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:46.040
 It's going to be small, and London is like what, 40 miles in diameter?

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.040
 I guess, yeah.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.040
 But like the M25 is about that.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.040
 So just doing a bit of a Sleezier State Agent job here.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.040
 It's very roomy, lovely.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:00.040
 You could put a partition wall in here if you wanted to.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.040
 So they think it's a lava tube created during volcanic activity.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.040
 And the problem with living on the moon, one of many problems, is there are so many.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:13.040
 But the temperature is 107 degrees Celsius in daytime, and minus 153 Celsius at night.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.040
 So any equipment is going to have to deal with that, which is a real pain.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.040
 And all the radiation from space, and all the asteroids hitting you all the time.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.040
 So it's not a great place to live.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.040
 But if you're in a cave, you get much less radiation and the temperature.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:30.040
 There is no pinball in these tunnels.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.040
 And until there is, I'm not going.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.040
 Yeah, it's because the moon has no atmosphere, obviously.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.040
 So the reason that we're at this point...

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.040
 Like I don't know.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.040
 No, you drew first days.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.040
 All that reaction time practice you put in as paid off James.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.040
 You're miles ahead of me.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.040
 So the moon has no atmosphere.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.040
 It's temperature fluctuates massively.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:57.040
 So Earth's temperature is quite stable because the heat from the sun is dispersed a bit by the air particles.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.040
 But don't have it on the moon.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.040
 So the sun's not on you.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.040
 Then you say your eyes are cold.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.040
 It's a nightmare.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.040
 But I don't really understand this asteroid thing.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.040
 So asteroids hit the moon far more often.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.040
 They do make out like that's going to be a big issue.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040
 Just little dies.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.040
 Like little asteroids that would kind of burn up.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.040
 Burn up in the Earth's atmosphere.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.040
 The little pebble.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.040
 That would be quite awkward, wouldn't it?

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.040
 Like I know they're small, but if you came hit by them all the time.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.040
 It's so annoying.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.040
 Yeah, imagine.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.040
 And the damage they can do, it's like with the stuff that's going around our planet.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:30.040
 If it even something the size of a bullet hits the International Space Station,

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.040
 it could shatter it.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.040
 The speeds that they're going at.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.040
 So yeah, I mean a bullet is traditionally a harmful thing to be hit by as well.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.040
 Yeah, I know.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.040
 Even a bullet.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.040
 Let's imagine.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:44.040
 One of the problems though, if you live inside one of these tubes,

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.040
 is that the moon constantly suffers from moon quakes.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.040
 I think they believe that these lava tubes can suffer a huge internal damage

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.040
 off the back of it, collapse and so on.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.040
 Just with my estate agent's hat on, I'd like to say this one's absolutely fine.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.040
 The previous tenants, no complaints.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.040
 Screaming from under the rubble.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:07.040
 And cosmic radiation is a problem on the moon.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.040
 And that's something that we're trying to deal with.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.040
 So this is kind of, it gets hit by all sorts of stuff that we've talked about before.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:16.040
 So the moon gets caught in the solar wind, the solar tail sometimes,

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.040
 and gets hit by all these damaging particles.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:23.040
 And I think the lunar reconnaissance orbiter, which went up to the moon from NASA

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.040
 a few years ago, sent a plastic replica of human skin,

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.040
 which measured how much damage this kind of radiation will do.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.040
 Wow.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.040
 And it worked out that it is quite a bit of damage.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.040
 So human bodies.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.040
 Why would we not just send up human skin?

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.040
 Because I think human skin's not alive, I guess.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.040
 Oh, okay.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.040
 And maybe it's hard.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.040
 Maybe we send up a candle.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.040
 Yes, because that is the perfect replica of the human body.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.040
 It's a plastic replica of human skin.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.040
 Yeah, but then you won't see what happens to genitals.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.040
 Oh, that's true.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:57.040
 Which is important, because it might make you infertile if you have all this radiation

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.040
 passing through you.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.040
 Yeah.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.040
 But a day on the moon is 14 Earth days and a night is 14 Earth nights,

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.040
 if you're on the equator.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.040
 So it's just not going to be fun, isn't it?

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.040
 Well, a nice long line in the morning.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.040
 Yeah, that's true.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.040
 But then a long day at work.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.040
 Oh, true.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.040
 There's not that much work to do there, I don't think, yet.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.040
 No, but why would anyone want to live on the moon?

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.040
 Like, what is the point?

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.040
 Well, I've watched some interviews with those people who were sign up for the Mars mission

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.040
 to go to Mars and a lot of them say things like

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.040
 I haven't really been able to find a girlfriend,

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.040
 so I don't really see any point.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.040
 I might find one of the Mars.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.040
 Mum, Dad, nice to see you on the video.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.040
 Like, this is Janice, she's a dead microbe, but she's mine and I love her.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.040
 She's a plastic replica of human skin.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.040
 I think it would be scientists, right?

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.040
 It's like the same as Antarctica.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.040
 No one lives in Antarctica apart from scientists.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.040
 So it would be the same, right?

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.040
 Yes.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.040
 But I read one article that said one of the advantages of going to the moon

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.040
 is it might be so terrible that it will force us to accept

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.040
 that the Earth is the only decent place to live,

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.040
 and we'll make us look after the Earth better.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.040
 That is a good idea.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.040
 I mean, the Earth is so much better than the moon.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.040
 It's better at some things.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.040
 No, one thing the moon's better at.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.040
 It's got better craters, I think.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.040
 That's what you're into.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.040
 We've got craters.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.040
 It's got better ones.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.040
 It's got bigger mountains.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.040
 I'm not booking my ticket just yet, guys.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.040
 You guys are telling us the travel agents.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.040
 The sky is always black as well,

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.040
 which I don't think I would like, just because I guess I'm not used to it.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.040
 But even in daytime, the 14 day day, the sky is totally black.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.040
 I think that's really creepy, because the only reason the sky is blue

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:39.040
 is because I can't even conceive of total broad daylight,

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.040
 but with the black sky.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.040
 No, that doesn't make any sense.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.040
 It doesn't work.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.040
 I think that'd be right.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.040
 Because it's bright, but it's dark.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.040
 Bright, but it's black.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.040
 I think that can't be true.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040
 That's weird.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040
 It's true.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.040
 You can't compute it, but it's the case.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.040
 Because what other...

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.040
 I mean, what are the colours that are going to be?

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.040
 I don't believe you, I'm actually.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.040
 But it's too much for my brain to manage.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.040
 Do you know what the main problem would be if we...

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.040
 I mean, sorry, we've just been through about 15 of the main problems.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.040
 But according to Eugene Sernan, who's the last man to walk on the moon,

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.040
 the main problem would be the dust.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:14.040
 They spent most of their time dusting on that last mission to the moon.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:19.040
 Yeah, because they had like a vacuum cleaner to get all the dust off their stuff

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.040
 and it clogged up the black vacuum cleaner.

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.040
 Really?

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.040
 But you know what the main problem is.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.040
 So spots are going to be very difficult.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.040
 And the reason is, you can jump and throw balls much better.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.040
 This is according to an article on space.com.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:39.040
 So you can throw a ball maybe like 10 to 6 times higher or 6 times further.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.040
 But that means that your American football field,

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.040
 which is what they were talking about,

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.040
 would have to be 600 yards long.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.040
 And so you need that space.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.040
 Yeah, that's true.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.040
 You don't have the space because it's a small like planet.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:54.040
 Tennis will be quite crap as well, because top spin doesn't work.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.040
 So all the best, like in a Darls game is going to go completely to pot

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.040
 because the reason top spin works is because of the,

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.040
 it's the Bernouille effect that I think we've mentioned before.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:07.040
 It's about how air pressure acts differently on one side of a spinning ball to the other.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:12.040
 And so that means that top spin brings the ball down into the court faster than it would otherwise go.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.040
 Because of this effect.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.040
 And with no atmosphere on the moon, again,

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.040
 you're not having top spin working.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.040
 So all of them Darls shots go out.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.040
 What about cricket?

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.040
 Is this possibly the one place where we can have a time we're going to have a fair cricket match?

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.040
 Because there's no Australians.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:32.040
 And by the way guys our Brisbane date has really not so far.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.040
 We don't know why.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.040
 But Marion Bartoli might be able to work it out before anyone else.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.040
 That's why I'm thinking because she's so smart.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.040
 You're right.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.040
 Like she would be able to work out the trajectories and stuff.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.040
 The perfect way to hit it.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:49.040
 I'm actually interested in going to the moon a bit more now that we know that top spin doesn't work.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.040
 Because it just levels that playing field when I'm playing a little bit.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:58.040
 So there wasn't going in 1964 who made a bet.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.040
 He was a British man called David Thrillfall.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:05.040
 And you remember President Kennedy promised in about 1961 we're going to get to the moon by the end of the decade.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.040
 Yes.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.040
 And they squeaked in in 1969.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:14.040
 He bet in 1964 that a man would get to the moon before the end of the decade.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.040
 And William Hill gave mods of a thousand to one.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.040
 But they did take the bet.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.040
 And when they landed on the moon he was taken to a TV studio and he became a minor celebrity.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.040
 He was presented with a check for £1,000 which was a lot of money at the time.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.040
 It was about £180,000 in today's money.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:34.040
 And the really tragic thing was he died the next year in a crash of the car that he bought with the winnings.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.040
 No.

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.040
 Oh, that's awful.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.040
 It's just that story.

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.040
 Oh, thank you for telling us.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.040
 Should we end on that?

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.040
 I looked into if you moved to the moon.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:52.040
 There's a lot of stuff that is left there by previous missions that you can collect to make your house a bit more interesting.

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:57.040
 It's not interesting enough that you're the only person living on the moon.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.040
 I need to have a space.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.040
 Some boots.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.040
 Some bagged up pieces.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.040
 Well, come around to my house town.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.040
 You can have bagged up pieces in your own home.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.040
 Very easy.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.040
 You've got a baby.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.040
 You should know all about that.

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.040
 My house is bagged up pieces of the moon.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.040
 There's some Andy Wool warhol art up on the moon.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.040
 Oh, wow.

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.040
 Yeah.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040
 There's a cock and balls that he drew.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.040
 He drew a cock and balls.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.040
 He paraded it as his initials and A and a W.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.040
 It artistically done.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.040
 The W was upside down and the A.

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.040
 Well, that sounds like an M and an A.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.040
 And it's what it looks like as well.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.040
 Yeah.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.040
 Yeah.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.040
 Excuse me, confusing.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.040
 Andy Murray's painting.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.040
 Yeah.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.040
 If you do it like that.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.040
 Andy Wool.

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.040
 Yes.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.040
 You're right.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.040
 Yeah.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.040
 So that's how it comes.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.040
 And that's why I thought it looked like an M.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.040
 But he's right.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.040
 No, you've just been having that work of our upside down.

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.040
 I've been looking at an upside down.

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.040
 You've hung it wrong.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.040
 It's badly hung.

00:47:54.040 --> 00:48:00.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.040
 Yeah.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.040
 So this was a kind of, it was a mini little piece of art

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.040
 where six different artists contributed to it.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.040
 Andy Warhol was one of them.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:11.040
 And it was put on this way for a small size little thing

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.040
 that was meant to be taken up.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.040
 But NASA disagreed for it.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.040
 So what's happening?

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.040
 Let's just try.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.040
 Why are you drawing more cock and balls?

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.040
 Well, I've just worked out.

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.040
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.040
 And look at that.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.040
 That's an A and an M.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.040
 And it also looks like it.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.040
 I think I've got a new signature for the next book.

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.040
 My driving license.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.040
 People are going to be so happy.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.040
 Put that down, Andy.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.040
 Go on down.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:41.040
 Yeah, so they submitted it as wanting to take it to the moon.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.040
 But it was rejected.

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.040
 But it was actually smuggled up there.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.040
 A lot of smuggling happened, yeah.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.040
 In the early days, like Buzz Aldrin, I think,

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.040
 smuggled up the communion that he brought up to the moon

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.040
 and so on.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.040
 People did like to smuggle stuff.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.040
 So you can get a communion.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.040
 How do you communion?

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.040
 He's called it.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.040
 How do you communion?

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.040
 You're right.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.040
 Very nice.

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.040
 So Andy Warhol art is up there.

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:05.040
 There's also a feather from a falcon up there.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.040
 Just a single feather, which is really cool.

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.040
 It was done as part of an experiment.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.040
 Oh, yeah, I remember that.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.040
 Yeah, the Apollo 12 experiment.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.040
 What they wanted to do was recreate the idea of seeing

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.040
 whether or not the idea of a bowling ball.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.040
 And what was it?

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:22.040
 So Galileo supposedly dropped two balls

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.040
 from the leaning tower of pizza.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.040
 Yeah.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.040
 And they landed at the same time because it's independent of mass.

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.040
 And they tried it with the bowling ball and the feather.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.040
 He proved that it was true.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.040
 Yeah, a hammer and a feather on the moon.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.040
 Yeah.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.040
 I mean, to take it, yeah, if the most powerful rocket

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.040
 can only take three men and a bit of a kit to the moon,

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.040
 taking a bowling ball seems like it needed to be fabulous.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:48.040
 But yeah, it was the Air Force Academy's falcon mascot.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.040
 They have the mascots and they plucked off one of its feathers.

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.040
 And that still lives on the moon.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.040
 So I could be part of your house.

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.040
 So just to be clear, is that because there's no air resistance?

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.040
 Because obviously if you drop hammer and a feather,

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.040
 the feather will float down because of air resistance.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.040
 It's on Earth, it would, yeah.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.040
 But on the moon, they drop at the same.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.040
 That's cool.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.040
 Yeah.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.040
 I was just looking at things that we'd have to train to learn

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.040
 to do when we get to the moon.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.040
 And I don't think we've mentioned before that all astronauts

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.040
 at the moment who go into space have to do toilet training.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.040
 So you have to be read toilet trained.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.040
 Really?

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.040
 Have we talked about this?

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.040
 No.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.040
 Because I didn't know that.

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.040
 So they've forgotten how to do it.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.040
 It makes you forget how to urinate.

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.040
 Yeah.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.040
 So you can't have the same design lose in space because stuff

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.040
 might kind of get out of them.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:33.040
 So when you sit on the loo, it's a very, very small aperture

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.040
 that you have to aim your stuff into.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.040
 So the opening of a toilet in space is four inches wide.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.040
 And usually I lose 18 inches wide, like 15 to 18 inches wide.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.040
 That's not four inches, Andy.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.040
 No.

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.040
 Oh, I thought it was.

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:52.040
 Disappointing the ale around.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:58.040
 So NASA has specially designed toilet training room

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.040
 is at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:03.040
 And it's actually got two different toilets in it.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.040
 So in this room it's got a positional toilet.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.040
 And that's not functional.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.040
 That's just so you learn how to position yourself properly on the toilet.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.040
 And actually that's--

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.040
 Oh, no.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:14.040
 I'm sure some training astronauts have mistaken the position

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.040
 of one way or just practicing for the function of life

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.040
 when you go at the showroom, at the bathroom showroom.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.040
 I don't know.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.040
 Is that a thing?

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.040
 And I just try this one out.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.040
 That's a comedy trope, isn't it?

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.040
 Is it?

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.040
 That's where you've got kicked out of IKEA that time.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.040
 It's true.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.040
 So yeah, you've got the show toilet and that tests your aim

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.040
 and it's got a little camera inside it that looks up at you.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.040
 So you can then review the footage afterwards to check

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.040
 that you've aimed right.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.040
 And then when you're ready for it, you can turn this on

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:44.040
 to the actual function on toilet, which is also in the training room

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:46.040
 where you can practice how to flash and stuff.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.040
 Okay, I have a question.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.040
 Are there any astronauts who have aced every single other metric

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.040
 but just haven't been allowed to go to space for the toilet?

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.040
 That's not.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.040
 That's not.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.040
 Always ends up on the floor.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.040
 I don't know.

00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.040
 That must be right.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.040
 Like if you can't do that.

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.040
 That's true.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.040
 You have to pass.

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.040
 You have to-- that's one of them.

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.040
 Actually, that's probably one of the more important things

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.040
 to get right in a spaceship.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.040
 Well, flying the rocket is quite important.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.040
 Come on.

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.040
 They've probably got autopilot stuff today.

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:15.040
 But if you've got a cabin full of poo floating around,

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.040
 that is a hooster and we have a big problem.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:23.040
 Okay, that's it.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.040
 That is all of our facts.

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.040
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.040

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.040
 No such thing as a fish or no such thing as a fish.com,

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.040
 which is our website.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.040
 We have links to our tours, our books,

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.040
 all of the previous episodes that are up online.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.040
 We will be back again next week with another podcast.

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.040
 We'll see you then.

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.040
 Goodbye.
