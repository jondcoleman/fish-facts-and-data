00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,880
 It's a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

2
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,360
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

3
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,240
 and Anichesinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,320
 facts of the last seven days at a no particular order.

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,840
 Here we go.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,080
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact this week, my fact is that in an attempt

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,520
 to work out who the murderer and Charles Dickens' last unfinished novel was, the lead character

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,000
 was put on trial.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
 So this is the mystery of Edwin Druid.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,320
 Yeah, this was the final novel of Charles Dickens that he was serializing in a newspaper

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,920
 that were meant to be 12 installments.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,200
 He only got as far as six before he passed away.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,600
 And as it was, the lead character, Edwin Druid, goes, he disappears.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,960
 And so we never know what happened to him.

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,120
 And people ever since have been trying to work it out by looking for clues within it.

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
 And so on.

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,360
 And in 1914, a mock trial was put on as part of an attempt to try and work out who might

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
 have murdered him.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,600
 And the lead character of the book, John Jasper, was put on trial.

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,240
 And it was full of celebrities. The judge of the trial was G.K. Chesterton.

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,720
 The foreman of the jury was George Bernard Shaw.

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,120
 It was a very, very cool trial.

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,240
 And did they find him innocent or guilty or?

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,720
 No, they, I think they wanted to go for manslaughter in the end.

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,280
 But then, yeah, G.K. Chesterton and got a very impatient with everyone and found everyone

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,560
 guilty of contempt of court by the end of the day.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
 Nice.

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
 Except himself, right?

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
 Except himself.

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,560
 Yeah, but when do you get a judge finding himself guilty of contempt of court, that's super

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
 rare.

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
 That's happened.

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,360
 I remember that happening in America in the last few years.

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
 Really?

35
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
 Yeah.

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
 Wow.

37
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,480
 Is that a really good moral judge or an extremely immoral judge?

38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
 It's hard to say.

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,720
 Because he just looked to himself and gone, "God, even I can see that I'm terrible."

40
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,000
 My feeling is, and I might be wrong about this, maybe a judge had his mobile phone on or

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 something.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,600
 And then he got a call and he kind of found himself in contempt or something.

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
 Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
 That rings a bell, yeah.

45
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
 It's really good.

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,000
 So fans of this novel are called Drew Idz, which I think is very clever.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Yes.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,880
 Or "Drewdians," or "Drewdists."

49
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
 Yeah.

50
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
 Yeah.

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,560
 There's a whole website where you can read every single possible scenario or sort of outcome

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
 of what might have happened to Edwin Druid.

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,720
 And there's hundreds of over the years, just so many people have been trying to work it

54
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
 out.

55
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,760
 There's been four movies that have been made of the book where different outcomes have

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,760
 been revealed at the end.

57
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,320
 There was a Broadway musical whereby the audience actually voted on who they thought it

58
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,120
 was at the end of the show.

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
 It wasn't only that, was it?

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,600
 So this musical was a really big deal.

61
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,480
 I'd never actually heard of it, but it won five Tony Awards.

62
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,040
 I think it won Best Musical in the 80s and Best Actor, I think.

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,240
 But the audience got to vote on who killed Edwin Druid, and they also got to vote on various

64
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
 other things.

65
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,740
 So they got to vote on what was the identity of Dick Dattery, which was unknown at the

66
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,200
 time Dick and Stop Writing, and they got to vote on which couple would become romantically

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
 involved in the end.

68
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,160
 And all the actors had to train up to be able to perform any scene of any of these possible

69
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
 outcomes.

70
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,400
 When I was a child, I had a computer game called Star Wars Chess, and there obviously there

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,120
 was a good team and an evil team, all characters from Star Wars, and every single possible move

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,920
 combination that you made, there was a little cutscene showing you how R2D2 defeated Darth

73
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
 Vader.

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,720
 Yeah, but not for every single possible game of chess, because it's like trillions.

75
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
 No, trillions.

76
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 For every piece combo.

77
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
 Right.

78
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,840
 So you would always have a good rook defeating an evil pawn or you would have it.

79
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
 It was brilliant.

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,360
 Yeah, I have surprised actually because it sounds very geeky that, and you never really

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,960
 struck me as a kind of person who would like that kind of thing.

82
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
 Yeah, weird, isn't it?

83
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
 I'm thinking of which.

84
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,760
 Has anyone else been in a mock trial in their life?

85
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
 No.

86
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
 Yes.

87
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
 Have you?

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,760
 What?

89
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
 A wide school.

90
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
 Yeah, same.

91
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
 Yeah.

92
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
 For what, what did you both do?

93
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
 I'm asking it turned out, and I was livid.

94
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
 No, I'm joking.

95
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
 I was a lawyer in the mock trial.

96
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
 Yeah, me too.

97
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
 Yeah, yeah.

98
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
 It's really fun.

99
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
 That's so fun.

100
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
 And what?

101
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,120
 In fact, about a case, so mine was a fight in a pub, so I'm going to have been hit with a

102
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
 poor queue, I think.

103
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
 Oh, yeah.

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,160
 And they give you lots of different eyewitness accounts, and you have to then hold a trial.

105
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,280
 And you sometimes, I think we went to an actual court to do this.

106
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
 Did you?

107
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
 Very exciting.

108
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
 Wow.

109
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
 Yeah.

110
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,600
 Are you just, you were a juvenile delinquent and you've kind of hospitalized it as a game?

111
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
 That's it.

112
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
 Yeah.

113
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,480
 And we went to a court when we were kids at school.

114
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
 Yeah.

115
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,120
 And I remember it because we were there basically a load of kids, and these people just kept coming

116
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,680
 up, and they'd all be beating each other up the night before, because it was like, wow,

117
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,960
 it was basically people who'd been locked up that night for assault, and then they were

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,320
 coming in doing their pleas and stuff like that.

119
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,440
 This is your school trip.

120
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,400
 What else went to old towers, but yeah, probably me.

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,960
 We sort of went to the Battle of Hastings site, and I mean, that, in a sense, was a lot

122
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,400
 of people beating each other up, so I think maybe it was just, um, to prepare a

123
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
 service for the future.

124
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
 God.

125
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,680
 It's weird that they felt they need to investigate it though, because Dickens did actually finish

126
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
 at Wendru, didn't he?

127
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680
 What?

128
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
 Did he?

129
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
 He finished it, um, no.

130
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
 No.

131
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:34,440
 Yeah, he finished it in 1873, um, so he died in 1870, but he did finish it him with a medium,

132
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,000
 but it was, but it was with a medium called Thomas Power James, which I think is really

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,680
 cool, and this book, oh, it was the mystery of everyone drew part two, and he published

134
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,320
 part one, kind of cockily, under his own name now, Thomas Power James, and then part two was

135
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,760
 what the meat, what he'd learned from Dickens' ghost, and it had two prefaces at the start of

136
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,640
 it, one from Thomas Power James, who was saying this is such a privilege to be able to write

137
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,960
 with Dickens, and then the other from Dickens himself, saying, "You'll notice my suit."

138
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,280
 So there is a story that Dickens wrote to Queen Victoria a few months before his death,

139
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,520
 and he was saying to her, "Would you like a spoiler of what happened to Edwin Druid,

140
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,880
 and she wrote back, and she said, 'No, I'm fine, thank you.'"

141
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,640
 Out, she offered her a little more of it in advance of her subjects, and she said, "That's

142
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,360
 cool, I'm enjoying the instruments," or whatever she said, but we could have had Queen Victoria

143
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,560
 solving the mystery of what happened to Edwin Druid, which would have been very cool.

144
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
 Wow.

145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,200
 Well, supposedly the illustrator of the book claimed to have known who the murderer was,

146
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,480
 so his name was Luke Fields, and he had given instructions by Dickens that John Jasper,

147
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,160
 he wear a net tie, and the idea was that Jasper strangles Edwin Druid with it, and he used

148
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,000
 to have a close collaboration obviously with Dickens because he liked to seed things that

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,160
 would appear later in the story, so maybe he did do it.

150
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,800
 We didn't even know that Edwin Druid died, though.

151
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
 No, we don't.

152
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,920
 At the time the book ends, he has just disappeared, he might come back.

153
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,160
 Most people at the time kind of thought that he was just, he hadn't died, didn't they?

154
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
 Yeah.

155
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,320
 That was like prevailing theory at the time.

156
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,600
 Well, there's another character.

157
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
 Did you mention him?

158
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
 Dick Dachery.

159
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
 Yeah.

160
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
 I know.

161
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,360
 That would mean so much more to me if I knew that the story was.

162
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
 Have you guys read this?

163
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
 I haven't.

164
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
 I started reading it today and I was too hung up.

165
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
 I got about five pages.

166
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
 I would have thought you would.

167
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
 Anna, because you read loads of Dickens.

168
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:31,840
 I chose not to read the one that's only half finished, but I do really want to now, partly

169
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,120
 because people say that it's so impossible to work out what might have happened, like

170
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,880
 there was one woman who adapted it for the BBC and she had to finish it a few years

171
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
 ago.

172
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,960
 And she said, a lot of people know that Dickens didn't finish Erwin Druid.

173
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,840
 What they don't know is that he died intentionally so that he didn't have to, because he literally

174
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,000
 had no idea how to tie up all these new sets.

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,920
 Stephen King hasn't unfinished work.

176
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,880
 Now, he's still alive, obviously, but he hasn't unfinished work.

177
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,560
 Is it just a thing he's working on at the moment?

178
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
 It's called The Plant.

179
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
 Oh, yeah.

180
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,440
 It's a really interesting experiment he did, so he published it chapter by chapter online

181
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
 just like Dickens.

182
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,160
 And he asked people to pay for it online, a dollar per chapter.

183
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,600
 And he said, if the number of people paying for this dips below 75% of the people who are downloading

184
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,840
 it and reading it, then I will stop writing it.

185
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,360
 And that's exactly what happened after about five chapters.

186
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
 Really?

187
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,080
 Yeah, so some people were really annoyed, because they'd paid six or seven dollars and they

188
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,280
 didn't get a finished story, but by part four, only 46% of people who downloaded it were

189
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
 paying for it.

190
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
 Really?

191
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
 Is it bad?

192
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
 Have you looked at it?

193
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
 I haven't.

194
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
 Do you know what it's about?

195
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,760
 It's an author who I think receives a creepy gift of a plant.

196
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,560
 I mean, it doesn't exactly sound like a shining dog.

197
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
 Yeah.

198
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,880
 No, I've heard it's very good, and it was just for that reason.

199
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,320
 He was testing the internet model of commerce.

200
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,360
 It didn't work for him, but he did release, if you remember, his book The Green Mile, which

201
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,640
 was transformed, was made into a movie.

202
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
 Transformed.

203
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,240
 Logistically into the film.

204
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,600
 We don't have the book anymore, because it was transformed into a film.

205
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
 Transformed into the film, transform it.

206
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,000
 So, The Green Mile, he did that with the Dickens model as well.

207
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 He put out single chapters, and because the idea was, Dickens always used to end on a cliffhanger,

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,200
 and he thought, could I do that?

209
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,200
 And could I generate a whole book where I was forcing myself month by month to reveal the

210
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 next chapter?

211
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
 And yeah, so that's what The Green Mile is.

212
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,480
 There's one book that we'll never read, so I looked at it a bit on published novels.

213
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
 Oh, yeah.

214
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,400
 And Evelyn War wrote his first novel, actually, called The Temple at Thatch in 1925.

215
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,200
 And then he gave a draft to his friend, Harold Ackton, and Ackton gave it quite bad review.

216
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,640
 So, he wrote a letter to Evelyn War, suggesting that he'd do it in a few elegant copies for

217
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,440
 the friends who really love you, and then he gave a list of the suggested friends, and

218
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,760
 they were all the idiots they knew.

219
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,640
 And Evelyn War was so upset by this, so devastated that he walked down to the sea, he took

220
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,760
 all his clothes off, he left a note with a Euripides quote about how the sea can wash

221
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,440
 away all ills, and then he swam into the sea intending to commit suicide, and he was stung

222
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,520
 by a jellyfish, so he gave up and returned ashore.

223
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
 Wow.

224
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,080
 So, yeah, it was for a jellyfish.

225
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,120
 We would not have Bride said revisited.

226
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,120
 You don't hear people taking off all their clothes and going into the sea these days, do

227
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
 you?

228
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
 No, it used to be.

229
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
 No, that used to be a thing, didn't it?

230
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
 I think so.

231
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,520
 Craig Venter, who's famous for sequencing DNA, he did that as well.

232
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,280
 He, I think he was fighting in the Vietnam War, and he wasn't a clever tactic, was it?

233
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,440
 Right, what we'll do is we'll all leave our clothes at the shore, they'll think they've

234
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
 won.

235
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,000
 Actually, we've gone around in a big boat.

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,480
 No, he, that's not what happened Andy.

237
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
 You weren't there, man.

238
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 Yeah, you weren't there, man.

239
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,760
 No, he got very depressed, and he swam out to sea.

240
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,800
 I think he did exactly that, took all of his clothes off, and then while he was quite

241
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,840
 far out, he suddenly had an epithet that he wanted to live and that he had, he wanted to do

242
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,920
 well in science and so on, and he turned around to come back, and that supposedly is the big

243
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,000
 problem when you swim too far out, and people have a change of mind.

244
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,320
 You're too far out to have the energy to swim all the way back.

245
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,960
 And so he said that was the hardest struggle of anything, but yeah, because he lost all

246
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
 his energy.

247
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,080
 And then in this moment of sort of near death, he realized he wanted to live.

248
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,680
 You don't have into Terry Pratchett's unfinished works.

249
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,280
 I think he had about ten novels on the go at the time he died in sort of in various stages

250
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,100
 of completion, obviously, so so much place in the others, but they were crushed by a steam

251
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,100
 roller after he died.

252
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
 Oh, by accident?

253
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
 No, it was deliberate.

254
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,100
 All right.

255
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,440
 He decreed in his world that he wanted them to be crushed by a steam roller.

256
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
 But it's paper.

257
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
 No, it's a hard time.

258
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
 No, it's a hard time.

259
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
 He's got it.

260
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
 Yeah, yeah.

261
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
 Yeah.

262
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,440
 I mean, how's this piece of paper?

263
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,880
 Oh no, this piece of paper is completely flammable.

264
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,920
 It's done by a vintage steam roller or a steam fair, and it was called Lord Jericho, the

265
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
 steam roller.

266
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
 Sounds quite cool.

267
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
 Good name for a steam roller.

268
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
 Yeah, it is.

269
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
 Yeah.

270
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,160
 And it's now, it was done as part of a celebration of opening of an exhibition for all his work,

271
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,200
 and that's now part of the exhibition, his broken hard drive.

272
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,800
 I think Dickens didn't know what happened to the end of Edwin Druid, because I didn't realize

273
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,240
 that the ending of great expectations, I think quite famously originally was different,

274
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,640
 which is so satisfying, because it's always been kind of an annoying ending where spoilers

275
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,880
 guys close your ears if you haven't read it.

276
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,000
 So Estella and Pip obviously end up together, quite abruptly at the end, sort of end up together.

277
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,560
 They walk off into the sun set together and the last line is something like, I saw no

278
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,680
 more shadow of her leaving my side, something like that.

279
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,760
 But in his original one, he properly sent it off to the publishers and stuff, and they'd

280
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,960
 split up Estella heard, she was widowed, she then married someone else, they had a little

281
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,160
 meeting and he went, oh how sad, I guess we'll never be together.

282
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,800
 And then he sent that to the publishers, went on holiday with his mate, who was a guy called

283
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,600
 Edward Bulla-Litten, and went on holiday with him, showed him this, and he's his friend said,

284
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,320
 that's too miserable, you've got to change it immediately.

285
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,600
 And so he immediately, quickly, hurriedly changed it and had them end up together.

286
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,160
 It's quite good as an author, if someone says that's crap, you need to change it to actually

287
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
 do it, isn't it?

288
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
 I know.

289
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,720
 He would have just gone, nope, salt off mate, yeah.

290
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,200
 Bulla-Litten was kind of the leading author of his time and his word, no one really reads

291
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,640
 him anymore, but he came up with the phrases, the great unwashed and the pen is mightier

292
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
 than the sword.

293
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,480
 Two phrases I use every day.

294
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,280
 Andy, why don't you not get on the bus?

295
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,240
 Because I haven't had my show yet, and so I am feeling a bit like the great unwashed.

296
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
 Okay.

297
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,080
 That's never the context in which it is.

298
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,200
 You're just using non-metaphorically idiotic.

299
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,320
 Why are you attacking that person with a pen?

300
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,000
 Well, the thing is James, the pen is mightier than the sword, right?

301
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 My sword is absolutely tiny, but I've had this special novelty samurai pen belt.

302
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,920
 I could take your head off.

303
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:00,880
 Okay, is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

304
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,400
 My fact this week is that in the past 10 years, the number of registered pinball players worldwide

305
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,680
 has gone from 500 to over 100,000.

306
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,080
 That's a big increase.

307
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
 It's a big jump.

308
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
 How?

309
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,640
 People have got really into it.

310
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,640
 Why do you have to register?

311
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,920
 You were allowed to play pinball without being officially registered, but then there is

312
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,120
 the International Flip of Pinball Association, which is where you officially register if you

313
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,600
 want to take part in competitions or just be recognised as a player.

314
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,320
 I think it was measured by them in 2006, and there were 500 official players, and then NBC

315
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,960
 reported last year, there were over 100,000.

316
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
 And this is huge comeback.

317
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,800
 Do you have to sign the register of pinballers?

318
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
 What do you mean?

319
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,440
 Well, just normally when there's a register, you have to sign the register.

320
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
 Do you?

321
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
 Yeah.

322
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
 No.

323
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
 You don't have to sign the sex offender's register, do you?

324
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
 Well, I don't know, but that's...

325
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,080
 Why have you got special circumstances?

326
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,920
 But in the register at school, they just say your name, and you say here.

327
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
 Yeah.

328
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
 That's true.

329
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
 But they don't do that.

330
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

331
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

332
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

333
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

334
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
 That's not a register of pinballers.

335
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
 It's not a register of pinballers.

336
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920

458

 When I last time I played Darts, it was against my wife and she beat me.

459
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,040
 I kind of thought that maybe it was a game of luck.

460
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
 That's absolutely right.

461
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,040
 This band was absolutely mad.

462
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
 So, Mayor La Guardia, Fiorrello La Guardia,

463
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,040
 who the main airport in New York is named after now.

464
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
 He said that people who pushed pinball

465
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,040
 were slimy crews of tin horns well dressed

466
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
 and living in luxury on penny thievery.

467
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
 He was photographed with a sled chair

468
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
 and a smashing up pinball machines.

469
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,040
 He ordered the police to make prohibition-style raids

470
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,040
 on pinball machines their top priority.

471
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
 Top priority. New York.

472
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,040
 It was 1942 as well. Total war.

473
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
 It was the methamphetamine of its day.

474
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,040
 Yeah, but they did ritualistic things to the pinball machines.

475
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
 So he said...

476
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,040
 Basically, they said it was a waste of metals,

477
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
 which could be turned into elements and bullets.

478
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,040
 So, 5,000 machines were confiscated and destroyed.

479
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
 They were dumped into Long Island Sound.

480
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
 But the metal in the balls was confiscated

481
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,040
 and supposedly it was enough to build four 2,000 pound bombs.

482
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,040
 And the police carved the pinball table legs into cudgles

483
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
 and presented them to Mayor La Guardia.

484
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,040
 But then they dropped the bomb on some enemies,

485
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
 but they just flexed it away.

486
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,040
 That's what the damn busters was basically.

487
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
 And the...

488
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,040
 Basically, even though it was illegal, they still used them.

489
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
 They just moved them to pornography shops.

490
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
 Right.

491
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,040
 So, if you wanted to play pinball, you had to go to a pornography shop.

492
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,040
 So you'd send your 7-year-old like, "Okay, you can play the game."

493
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
 But...

494
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
 God, that's terrible.

495
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
 That's very funny idea.

496
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
 Yeah, that's amazing.

497
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
 Very distracting.

498
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
 It would be much harder to focus, I think, on your pinball game,

499
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
 if you're surrounded by porn.

500
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
 Yeah, that's true.

501
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,040
 Maybe if I ever join this association and do it professionally.

502
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
 Yeah, I can see you doing that.

503
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,040
 Then when the other guys are playing, I'm just going to put porn into it.

504
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
 I'm trying to make it like the 40s for you.

505
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
 It's this classic pinball.

506
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
 I really like La Guardia.

507
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
 As in, I've never really...

508
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
 I've known his name through the airport.

509
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
 I didn't know he was the mayor.

510
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
 I had no idea.

511
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,040
 And I saw photos of him, and he looks like a mafia Batman villain.

512
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
 Like, he looks amazing.

513
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
 So I thought, "Okay, I'll just quickly look into him."

514
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,040
 So they're all this stuff of him being against the pinballing

515
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
 and sledgehammering and the prohibition-style raids.

516
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,040
 He was someone who was sort of kind of against the alcoholic prohibition

517
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,040
 that was going on and actively protested it.

518
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
 And so he invited 20 newspaper reporters

519
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,040
 to his congressional office in Washington, DC.

520
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
 And there, he drank it in front of them.

521
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
 And he had a beer that was admittedly, it had low alcohol.

522
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
 So I think it was almost on the edge of legality.

523
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,040
 And he mixed it with some tonic.

524
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,040
 And he drank it in front of the reporters with a straight face

525
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
 to say, "Look at this."

526
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
 I just think that's really pathetic.

527
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
 I think if you're going to make a statement by drinking beer

528
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,040
 during prohibition, don't drink low alcohol beer.

529
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
 This was tonic.

530
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
 I just have a proper point.

531
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,040
 I can just see you if there's prohibition in this country.

532
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,040
 And you're an MP, drinking a full bottle of gin

533
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
 on the steps of the House of Commons.

534
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,040
 This is the point I am making.

535
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
 What was I saying?

536
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,040
 Where are my keys?

537
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
 Okay, so given that pinball was banned for such a long time,

538
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
 this is a nice thing.

539
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,040
 The Museum of Pinball is in a place called "Banning" in California.

540
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
 That's very good.

541
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
 That's really good.

542
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 And I think the guy who won the World Championships last year

543
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
 was 13 years old.

544
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,040
 So this is a guy called Esha Lefkov.

545
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
 And he plays it with his dad, I think.

546
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
 But it really is attracting all ages.

547
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,040
 It's one's just opened up in London, actually.

548
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,040
 In December 2017, we've got our first proper devoted pinball.

549
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
 Let's go.

550
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
 I think we definitely should go.

551
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
 That's cool.

552
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
 Oh.

553
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
 Yeah.

554
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
 We'll put on the back burner.

555
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,040
 Do you know what a gobble hole is?

556
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
 Nope.

557
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
 I think I do.

558
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:01,040
 It's just a hole in the playing field of a pinball machine

559
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,040
 which the ball can fall and ending that hole.

560
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
 That's rough.

561
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,040
 That's a mean move to have in the middle of a pinball.

562
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
 I think the ball can fall down.

563
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
 Do you know what a thrust magnet is?

564
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
 A thrust magnet.

565
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
 These are all names of magazines

566
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,040
 that used to surround the pinball machines in there.

567
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,040
 A thrust magnet is just an electromagnet

568
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,040
 that accelerates the ball through a tube.

569
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
 Okay.

570
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
 Do you know what a drain automatic is?

571
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
 No.

572
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
 I've got 300 of these.

573
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
 Yeah, yeah.

574
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
 I'll just keep going until we get one.

575
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
 No, a drain automatic is a pinball game

576
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
 where the balls are lost too easily.

577
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
 So it's like you just keep losing all the time

578
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
 because your money comes.

579
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
 Oh, no.

580
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
 Like when you go on a fruit machine

581
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
 but someone's already won it loads

582
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
 and so it just eats up all your money.

583
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
 Yeah, mine that.

584
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
 Because it doesn't have any left.

585
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
 Damn, the cheating machines.

586
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,040
 In Japan, arcade games are very much more popular than they are here.

587
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,040
 And they've got such a good array of them.

588
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,040
 Have you guys come across the tablecloth hour game?

589
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
 No.

590
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
 I really like this.

591
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
 It's an arcade game.

592
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,040
 But instead of coming like a joystick or buttons that you press,

593
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,040
 it's got a sticking out bit that's like the edge of a tablecloth

594
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
 like something hanging over a table.

595
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,040
 And then on the screen there's lots of crockery

596
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,040
 and you just pull the tablecloth up.

597
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
 That sounds really good.

598
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
 And see if you can avoid breaking the crock.

599
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
 That's incredible.

600
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
 And then on that in real life tried to do that in real life.

601
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
 No, I didn't get that.

602
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
 It's really hard.

603
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
 Yeah.

604
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
 Because I used to work in a restaurant.

605
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
 I used to try all the time.

606
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
 Not for long, I bet.

607
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,040
 Your wages were dogged every week.

608
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,040
 Bolton smasher fired from 10th restaurant in a row.

609
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,040
 But of course you have lots of crockery

610
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,040
 and you have tablecloths of what else you're going to do

611
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
 if you're a teenager.

612
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
 You're going to try it.

613
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
 Can it really be done?

614
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
 I guess it can be done if you're really, really fast, right?

615
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,040
 It could be done like for just one object.

616
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
 You could kind of do it.

617
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,040
 But more often than not, it would just go flying.

618
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
 So funny.

619
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,040
 Have we said before there's a Japanese arcade game

620
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,040
 where you have to poke a robot bottom?

621
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
 Yes, with your finger.

622
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
 Yes.

623
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
 This is a game where it's a sort of prank on your friend

624
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
 to stick your finger at the bottom.

625
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
 Yeah.

626
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
 Because there is a prank in Japan known as the enumer.

627
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
 I can't remember what their word for it is.

628
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
 And you go through all the different games

629
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
 and you have to do it to the teacher

630
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,040
 and then to the policeman and then someone else.

631
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
 And the game is just to poke them in life.

632
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
 In real life.

633
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
 No, it's a game.

634
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
 Oh, it's in the game.

635
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
 But the prank is a real life thing.

636
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
 Right.

637
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
 It's like you know like a wet willy way.

638
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
 You put your finger in someone's ear.

639
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
 It's like that, but with an anus.

640
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
 For the anus.

641
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,040
 It's much harder to shove your finger up someone's anus, I think.

642
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
 Yeah.

643
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
 Especially when everyone's wearing clothes.

644
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
 Also.

645
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,040
 You say the words wet willy before you do it as well.

646
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
 Sounds a bit bad.

647
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
 Yeah.

648
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,040
 I think you're all going to have to sign the register.

649
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:50,040
 Okay, as time to move on to fact number three.

650
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
 And that is James.

651
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,040
 Okay, my fact this week is that the Victorians

652
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,040
 had better reaction times than we do today.

653
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
 Did they?

654
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
 What?

655
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,040
 Did they?

656
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,040
 That's a good question, Ella, because did they?

657
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,040
 The thing is, some people think they may have done.

658
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
 Okay.

659
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,040
 And this is because we have, we can work out what people's

660
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,040
 reactions times are now by doing studies and stuff.

661
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,040
 And we have some old results done by friend of the podcast,

662
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
 Francis Goulton, who you talk about lots of times.

663
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,040
 I mean, Major Eugenics is probably an acquaintance of the podcast, I'd say.

664
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,040
 But it was in a time when Eugenics was cool, wasn't it?

665
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
 Yeah, it was.

666
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,040
 Which is not now, of course.

667
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,040
 But his statistics show that people who he studied

668
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,040
 had quicker reactions than people today.

669
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,040
 And so it could be that his data are wrong.

670
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,040
 Or it could be that people have gotten less quick.

671
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
 Yeah.

672
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
 And a lot of, which do you think it is?

673
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,040
 I think people have come up with reasons why it might be that we're slower.

674
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,040
 Like maybe there's a lot more contaminants in the air

675
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,040
 and your brains have got more mercury in them or whatever.

676
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,040
 Your brains have got more stuff in them that are making them slower.

677
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
 Oh, wow.

678
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
 There are a lot of serious people who think this is true.

679
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
 Yeah.

680
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
 And my favorite one is in the 20th century,

681
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,040
 there was a scholar called Erwin W. Silverman, who believed the reason

682
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,040
 that we got slower reactions is because hype has increased.

683
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,040
 Therefore, it's taken longer for things to travel to the brain or from the brain.

684
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
 So it's that extra bit of time.

685
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,040
 Does that not sort of make sense a bit?

686
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
 I think they found that tall people are just as fast.

687
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
 Oh, okay.

688
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
 Yeah.

689
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,040
 But like from work, as most reactions are based on you seeing something

690
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,040
 and responding to it and your eyes don't get further from your brain

691
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
 as you get taller.

692
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
 Yeah.

693
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
 No, that's true.

694
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,040
 I wonder if someone starts on your foot.

695
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,040
 Maybe it takes you a bit longer now to back away,

696
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
 but it doesn't make sense at all.

697
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
 I will track my earlier comment.

698
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
 Actually, I don't think that does make sense.

699
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,040
 My favorite guy who studied this was the 93rd most cited psychologist

700
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
 of the 20th century.

701
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
 He is called Edwin Boring.

702
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,040
 He's my favorite psychologist.

703
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,040
 I just love him.

704
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
 One day, maybe we'll talk about him.

705
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,040
 But his most famous thing that he did was work out one reason

706
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,040
 why moons look bigger when they're on the horizon than when they're up in the sky.

707
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
 Oh, yeah.

708
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,040
 I just like the idea that he was cited in so many papers

709
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,040
 because his name was Boring.

710
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
 I think he must be.

711
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,040
 People slagging him off indirectly by just putting a little asterisk

712
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,040
 in at the bottom saying, "Boring!"

713
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,040
 I read that one of the things to help.

714
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,040
 This is done a team of Japanese scientists and researchers

715
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
 came out with these results saying,

716
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,040
 "A way of getting your reactions to be better is to chew gum."

717
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
 Which is really interesting.

718
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
 Yeah, I'd not heard that before.

719
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,040
 They did this experiment where they said that chewing on gum

720
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,040
 improves the participants' reaction time by 7%,

721
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,040
 which is an average of 36 milliseconds.

722
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
 It doesn't sound like a lot,

723
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,040
 but it is made that in, say, like, sport where it takes less than half a second

724
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,040
 for a baseball pitcher to pitch a ball to the mitt.

725
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,040
 That's obviously a huge amount of time.

726
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,040
 So what they say is that it only takes 10 seconds of chewing

727
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,040
 to activate the brain regions that are responsible for improving your reactions.

728
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
 And after you've done the 10 seconds,

729
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
 it keeps it active for 15 minutes.

730
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
 Wow.

731
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,040
 You buy 15 minutes of extra reaction time of 10 seconds of chewing gum.

732
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
 You are chewing steroids.

733
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,040
 Congratulations, by the way, on the Tour de France win, Dan.

734
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
 Do we know what the mechanism is?

735
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,040
 Is it that chewing saliva means that you're...

736
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,040
 According to this, it says,

737
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,040
 "Your jaw muscles, when you chew, stimulate certain regions of your brain,

738
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
 including the pre-mator cortex."

739
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
 Mmm. Okay.

740
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
 What do you mean? That sounds like science.

741
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,040
 I got it from science.com.

742
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,040
 So, on reaction times, you know the thing of gum fights in films,

743
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
 where there are two cowboys facing each other,

744
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,040
 and obviously the bad guy draws first because he uses an evil trickster

745
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,040
 and he's trying to legitimately gain an advantage of the gum fight by shooting first,

746
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,040
 and then the good guy draws second but always wins.

747
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,040
 So, Nils Ball, one of the most famous physicists of all time,

748
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,040
 was obsessed with this, and he theorized that gunslingers who draw second,

749
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,040
 they draw faster because they're not thinking.

750
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
 It's just, it's an instinctive reaction.

751
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
 It's like a separate circuit that works.

752
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
 It's almost like a reflex reaction.

753
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,040
 Interesting. And he staged mock duels with toy guns at his lab

754
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,040
 in between all the other important stuff he was doing,

755
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,040
 and his partner, George Gamau, drew first and lost every time.

756
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,040
 However, it's recently been proved by a University of Birmingham study

757
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,040
 that he was partially right, but it wouldn't quite help.

758
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
 So, if you draw second, if you draw responding to...

759
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,040
 If I'm facing you, Anna, and you draw, I see you drawing and I draw first.

760
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,040
 You're about 10% faster when you draw second than when you draw first.

761
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,040
 But the difference that it would make is only 21 milliseconds.

762
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
 That's enough.

763
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
 And is that not, yeah?

764
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,040
 If someone's already pulled the gun on you, it's likely that you won't be able to...

765
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,040
 I will be 21 milliseconds faster, but the gap in time between Anna starting and me starting

766
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,040
 will still be longer than 21 milliseconds, so I'll still die.

767
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,040
 So, the scientist who studied this, Andrew Welchman, he said, "You'll die satisfied that you are quicker,

768
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
 but that's not much to you."

769
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,040
 I don't understand how if you're using fake guns, not real guns,

770
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,040
 you can tell who got hit first.

771
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
 I think they kind of had a...

772
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
 It's a paintball.

773
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
 A paintball or something.

774
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
 Paintballs.

775
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
 You know the paintballs are edible.

776
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,040
 So, if you got a shot in the mouth, you're laughing.

777
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
 Yeah, and you're pulled.

778
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
 It's just...

779
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
 Are they not edible?

780
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
 No, they're really not nice.

781
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:46,040
 They're made of food coloring, and the outer shell is some kind of plant-based material.

782
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,040
 After you were fired from every restaurant in Bolton, James actually went to work at a paintball place

783
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,040
 from when she was sacked by eating the ammo.

784
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,040
 You got to get away with it because you just had red stuff on the radio now.

785
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
 No.

786
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:07,040
 Well, that by the way, the only two scientists we've cited so far are boring and boring.

787
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:14,040
 So, other reaction time things in running races.

788
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:20,040
 If you're doing a sprinting race, then if you move within 0.1 seconds of the starting gun going off,

789
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,040
 that counts as a full start, so even if you move after the starting gun going off,

790
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,040
 you've made a full start because it's thought that...

791
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,040
 Well, it's known that you can't possibly have reacted that fast to the gun going off.

792
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,040
 So, you must have started before you heard it go off.

793
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:40,040
 But that 0.1 is based on an experiment that was done in 1865 and it still stands today.

794
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,040
 So, it was done in 1865 by a scientist called Franciscus Cornelis Dondas,

795
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
 who was actually an ophthalmologist.

796
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,040
 But he also worked out reaction times, he gave electric shocks to people's feet,

797
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,040
 and then he had them squeeze stuff with their hands with the corresponding hand.

798
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,040
 And it was how quick it was for people to go, "Oh, fuck you!"

799
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
 And they took it with my feet!

800
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:06,040
 The interesting thing about that was really, really short people actually reacted much, much faster than really tall people.

801
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,040
 Which is why the best sprinters are so short. Look at his own boat, he's only three foot nine.

802
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,040
 I spent all day on the internet just testing my reaction time.

803
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,040
 And I agree that I don't think you can get quicker than 0.1 seconds.

804
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
 Right, it's kind of impossible.

805
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
 Because you can't.

806
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,040
 Well, it's so far away from my best.

807
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
 It's hard to imagine anyone.

808
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,040
 You're on eight or nine seconds.

809
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,040
 Look, we had a very heavy night last night.

810
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,040
 Can I just add a little bit of a trivia about Dondas, which I quite like.

811
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,040
 He's apparently also known very well in the world of dentistry,

812
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,040
 as well as being an ophthalmologist and a reaction time experimenter,

813
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,040
 because he named the space between the Dawson, the back of your tongue,

814
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,040
 and the hard palate, so the gap when you're at rest between the back of your tongue

815
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,040
 and the roof of your mouth is called the space of Dondas.

816
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
 Cool!

817
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,040
 Wow, that's very cool. That's awesome.

818
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
 I know.

819
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,040
 Andy, you mentioned Usain Bolt a second ago.

820
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
 I was looking into Sprinters as well.

821
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:06,040
 And there's an article written by this guy who claims that Usain Bolt could have broken

822
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,040
 his world record speed times for the 100 meters, not by running faster.

823
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,040
 He could have run at the consistent time that he was doing and still beat it.

824
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
 It was his starting point.

825
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
 It was his reaction to the gun.

826
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
 He's famously as a slow start, doesn't he?

827
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
 Incredibly slow start.

828
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:27,040
 So when he was in the Beijing Olympics, he was the slowest of all the finalists to leave.

829
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
 What do you call it?

830
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
 The starting blocks.

831
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,040
 So this guy worked out that at Beijing, his starting time, his reaction was 0.165.

832
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:41,040
 If he was able to bring that down to 0.13, he would have brought his world record

833
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,040
 from 9.58 to 9.56, so he would have shaved two milliseconds off that.

834
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
 And that's not even a hard one to get.

835
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,040
 That's sort of your average finalist will sprint at that speed off the starting blocks.

836
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:57,040
 And the reason is, so if you go online now, if you're listening to this and you try these games,

837
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,040
 where it's like you're looking at it and it changes color and you have to press the button as quickly as you can,

838
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,040
 it's different to seeing things as to hearing things.

839
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,040
 And I think you're quicker at hearing things than you are at seeing things, I believe.

840
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
 Yes, you are.

841
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,040
 So your audio response time is usually lower than your...

842
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
 Yeah, that's true.

843
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
 I know a really weird thing about audio response times.

844
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,040
 So athletes who are closer to the starting gun do better.

845
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
 Now, that's partly because you're closer.

846
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:28,040
 So you get an advantage of about 15 milliseconds in the closest lane compared with all the other lanes on average, right?

847
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
 That's quite a lot.

848
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,040
 It is quite a lot, but there's another reason for this.

849
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,040
 Sorry, just to say, I thought they had speakers behind the blocks.

850
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
 I think you're right, they now have speakers behind the blocks.

851
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,040
 So this was in races where you would have just one gun at the side being fired.

852
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,040
 But the weird thing is, it's not just that you're closer, it's that.

853
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,040
 The louder you hear the gunshot, the faster your reaction time, the volume hasn't effect.

854
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
 You react to loud noises faster.

855
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
 I think you're like scared of it, do you think?

856
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,040
 I think it must be, because it's like an evolutionary thing.

857
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
 Yeah.

858
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
 How cool is that?

859
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
 That's really cool.

860
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
 Otherwise, they wouldn't have to do it nearly as loud.

861
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,040
 So actually, it's an advantage in running a race if you have a big ear trumpet,

862
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
 which you carry next to your other starting blocks.

863
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,040
 But do you think that's it?

864
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,040
 It's less than, by the fact, you have to carry your ear trumpet.

865
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,040
 It never did me any home on school sports day.

866
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
 I was actually looking at if sports, because I was thinking,

867
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,040
 this thing about reaction time is sort of based on IQ.

868
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,040
 So a lot of people seem to think, or that's very contentious,

869
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,040
 that reaction time is related to IQ or how smart you are.

870
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
 So the idea is that the Victorians might have been cleverer than us.

871
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,040
 So I was thinking sports people often have very fast reactions

872
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
 if you're like a table tennis player or something.

873
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
 So I was wondering if they were cleverer.

874
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
 And this is a long window way of saying,

875
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,040
 I ended up finding out that Marion Bartoli, who was my favorite tennis player for a while,

876
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
 has an IQ that is almost off the charts.

877
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,040
 So she has an IQ of 175, which as soon as you're over 140, then you're very bright.

878
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
 If you're over 160, you're proper genius.

879
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
 And she's there.

880
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,040
 And she said, I'm not really someone that's into telling people about how smart I am.

881
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
 I'm kind of trying to hide it.

882
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
 And that's what she said to reporters.

883
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
 When she published her IQ results.

884
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,040
 Not that smart, is she?

885
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:13,040
 There's a fly which has the fastest reaction time I think of any animal.

886
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
 So it's called the Condola Stylus fly.

887
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,040
 And it's so fast that it's almost impossible to take a photo of it lying still.

888
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,040
 So it has a startle reflex of about two milliseconds.

889
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
 And it's scared of cameras.

890
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
 It's the flash.

891
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
 It's scared of the flash.

892
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
 So just do it without a flash.

893
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
 Well, yeah, you're okay.

894
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
 Well, that's this bit.

895
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
 Yeah, oh my god, fine.

896
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,040
 It's got this reflex of about two milliseconds.

897
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,040
 So if you take a photo with a shutter speed of one two hundredth of a second,

898
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
 which is a very fast shutter speed as they go,

899
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,040
 you will almost always capture it in flight because that's five milliseconds.

900
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
 So nine out of ten times you take the picture.

901
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
 You just get the flight in movement.

902
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
 You know how when you take a photo of a lot of people,

903
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,040
 there's always someone with their eyes kind of half closed.

904
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
 Yeah.

905
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,040
 These guys, like if they want a family photo of all these flies.

906
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,040
 It's just a blur.

907
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,040
 The chances of them all be in there is pretty low.

908
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,040
 So there's a possible reason for it, which is that they're so brightly coloured.

909
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,040
 They're really brightly coloured flies.

910
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,040
 And we think this is because they are trying to teach predators not to bother trying to hunt them.

911
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
 Because they always get away.

912
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,040
 So they're trying to teach the predator to associate that bright colouring on them with...

913
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
 No, that doesn't make any sense.

914
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,040
 If you can really get away that fast, then you don't need something that warns them.

915
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
 That sounds like they're bluffing.

916
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,040
 Like, honestly, don't worry about it.

917
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
 It would be a waste of effort.

918
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,040
 But then again, like you get these really poisonous frogs, don't you, that are really brightly coloured.

919
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
 Yeah, they're all predators.

920
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,040
 Why are they all thinking in the best interest of the predators?

921
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,040
 I'm a bit sweet, but...

922
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:55,040
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

923
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,040
 My fact is that the first people to live on the moon might be cavemen.

924
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
 Might be.

925
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
 Might be.

926
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
 Might not be.

927
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
 Yeah, my notes actually begin.

928
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
 Well, they might.

929
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
 So why might they?

930
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,040
 Because it's obviously going to be very uncomfortable living on the moon.

931
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,040
 No one's going to have a great time, but if we want to get into space and colonise somewhere,

932
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
 the moon is not a terrible candidate.

933
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,040
 And a Japanese space probe called Celine has just found a massive cave on the moon,

934
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,040
 which would solve a load of the problems of living on the moon.

935
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
 It's 31 miles long.

936
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
 It's 100 metres wide.

937
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
 It's a huge cave.

938
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,040
 We could get loads of lunar cities in there if we wanted to.

939
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,040
 It's got a 31 miles by 100 metres.

940
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
 What did I say, sorry?

941
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
 Yeah, no, you said that.

942
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
 I just think you can't get that many cities.

943
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
 You're still going to be a bit cramped.

944
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,040
 It's going to be small, and London is like what, 40 miles in diameter?

945
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
 I guess, yeah.

946
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
 But like the M25 is about that.

947
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,040
 So just doing a bit of a Sleezier State Agent job here.

948
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
 It's very roomy, lovely.

949
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,040
 You could put a partition wall in here if you wanted to.

950
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,040
 So they think it's a lava tube created during volcanic activity.

951
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,040
 And the problem with living on the moon, one of many problems, is there are so many.

952
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,040
 But the temperature is 107 degrees Celsius in daytime, and minus 153 Celsius at night.

953
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,040
 So any equipment is going to have to deal with that, which is a real pain.

954
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,040
 And all the radiation from space, and all the asteroids hitting you all the time.

955
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,040
 So it's not a great place to live.

956
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,040
 But if you're in a cave, you get much less radiation and the temperature.

957
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,040
 There is no pinball in these tunnels.

958
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,040
 And until there is, I'm not going.

959
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
 Yeah, it's because the moon has no atmosphere, obviously.

960
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
 So the reason that we're at this point...

961
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
 Like I don't know.

962
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
 No, you drew first days.

963
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,040
 All that reaction time practice you put in as paid off James.

964
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,040
 You're miles ahead of me.

965
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
 So the moon has no atmosphere.

966
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
 It's temperature fluctuates massively.

967
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,040
 So Earth's temperature is quite stable because the heat from the sun is dispersed a bit by the air particles.

968
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,040
 But don't have it on the moon.

969
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
 So the sun's not on you.

970
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,040
 Then you say your eyes are cold.

971
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
 It's a nightmare.

972
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
 But I don't really understand this asteroid thing.

973
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,040
 So asteroids hit the moon far more often.

974
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
 They do make out like that's going to be a big issue.

975
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
 Just little dies.

976
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
 Like little asteroids that would kind of burn up.

977
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,040
 Burn up in the Earth's atmosphere.

978
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
 The little pebble.

979
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
 That would be quite awkward, wouldn't it?

980
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,040
 Like I know they're small, but if you came hit by them all the time.

981
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
 It's so annoying.

982
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
 Yeah, imagine.

983
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,040
 And the damage they can do, it's like with the stuff that's going around our planet.

984
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,040
 If it even something the size of a bullet hits the International Space Station,

985
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
 it could shatter it.

986
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,040
 The speeds that they're going at.

987
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,040
 So yeah, I mean a bullet is traditionally a harmful thing to be hit by as well.

988
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
 Yeah, I know.

989
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,040
 Even a bullet.

990
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
 Let's imagine.

991
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,040
 One of the problems though, if you live inside one of these tubes,

992
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,040
 is that the moon constantly suffers from moon quakes.

993
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:52,040
 I think they believe that these lava tubes can suffer a huge internal damage

994
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
 off the back of it, collapse and so on.

995
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,040
 Just with my estate agent's hat on, I'd like to say this one's absolutely fine.

996
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,040
 The previous tenants, no complaints.

997
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,040
 Screaming from under the rubble.

998
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,040
 And cosmic radiation is a problem on the moon.

999
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,040
 And that's something that we're trying to deal with.

1000
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,040
 So this is kind of, it gets hit by all sorts of stuff that we've talked about before.

1001
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,040
 So the moon gets caught in the solar wind, the solar tail sometimes,

1002
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,040
 and gets hit by all these damaging particles.

1003
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,040
 And I think the lunar reconnaissance orbiter, which went up to the moon from NASA

1004
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,040
 a few years ago, sent a plastic replica of human skin,

1005
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,040
 which measured how much damage this kind of radiation will do.

1006
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
 Wow.

1007
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
 And it worked out that it is quite a bit of damage.

1008
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,040
 So human bodies.

1009
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,040
 Why would we not just send up human skin?

1010
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,040
 Because I think human skin's not alive, I guess.

1011
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
 Oh, okay.

1012
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
 And maybe it's hard.

1013
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
 Maybe we send up a candle.

1014
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,040
 Yes, because that is the perfect replica of the human body.

1015
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
 It's a plastic replica of human skin.

1016
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,040
 Yeah, but then you won't see what happens to genitals.

1017
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,040
 Oh, that's true.

1018
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,040
 Which is important, because it might make you infertile if you have all this radiation

1019
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
 passing through you.

1020
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
 Yeah.

1021
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,040
 But a day on the moon is 14 Earth days and a night is 14 Earth nights,

1022
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
 if you're on the equator.

1023
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
 So it's just not going to be fun, isn't it?

1024
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,040
 Well, a nice long line in the morning.

1025
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
 Yeah, that's true.

1026
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,040
 But then a long day at work.

1027
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
 Oh, true.

1028
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,040
 There's not that much work to do there, I don't think, yet.

1029
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
 No, but why would anyone want to live on the moon?

1030
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,040
 Like, what is the point?

1031
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,040
 Well, I've watched some interviews with those people who were sign up for the Mars mission

1032
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,040
 to go to Mars and a lot of them say things like

1033
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
 I haven't really been able to find a girlfriend,

1034
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,040
 so I don't really see any point.

1035
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,040
 I might find one of the Mars.

1036
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,040
 Mum, Dad, nice to see you on the video.

1037
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,040
 Like, this is Janice, she's a dead microbe, but she's mine and I love her.

1038
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,040
 She's a plastic replica of human skin.

1039
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,040
 I think it would be scientists, right?

1040
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
 It's like the same as Antarctica.

1041
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
 No one lives in Antarctica apart from scientists.

1042
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,040
 So it would be the same, right?

1043
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
 Yes.

1044
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,040
 But I read one article that said one of the advantages of going to the moon

1045
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,040
 is it might be so terrible that it will force us to accept

1046
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,040
 that the Earth is the only decent place to live,

1047
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,040
 and we'll make us look after the Earth better.

1048
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,040
 That is a good idea.

1049
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,040
 I mean, the Earth is so much better than the moon.

1050
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
 It's better at some things.

1051
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
 No, one thing the moon's better at.

1052
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,040
 It's got better craters, I think.

1053
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,040
 That's what you're into.

1054
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
 We've got craters.

1055
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,040
 It's got better ones.

1056
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,040
 It's got bigger mountains.

1057
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
 I'm not booking my ticket just yet, guys.

1058
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,040
 You guys are telling us the travel agents.

1059
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,040
 The sky is always black as well,

1060
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,040
 which I don't think I would like, just because I guess I'm not used to it.

1061
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,040
 But even in daytime, the 14 day day, the sky is totally black.

1062
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,040
 I think that's really creepy, because the only reason the sky is blue

1063
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,040
 is because I can't even conceive of total broad daylight,

1064
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,040
 but with the black sky.

1065
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,040
 No, that doesn't make any sense.

1066
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
 It doesn't work.

1067
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,040
 I think that'd be right.

1068
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
 Because it's bright, but it's dark.

1069
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
 Bright, but it's black.

1070
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,040
 I think that can't be true.

1071
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
 That's weird.

1072
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,040
 It's true.

1073
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,040
 You can't compute it, but it's the case.

1074
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
 Because what other...

1075
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
 I mean, what are the colours that are going to be?

1076
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
 I don't believe you, I'm actually.

1077
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,040
 But it's too much for my brain to manage.

1078
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
 Do you know what the main problem would be if we...

1079
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,040
 I mean, sorry, we've just been through about 15 of the main problems.

1080
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,040
 But according to Eugene Sernan, who's the last man to walk on the moon,

1081
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,040
 the main problem would be the dust.

1082
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,040
 They spent most of their time dusting on that last mission to the moon.

1083
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:19,040
 Yeah, because they had like a vacuum cleaner to get all the dust off their stuff

1084
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
 and it clogged up the black vacuum cleaner.

1085
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,040
 Really?

1086
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,040
 But you know what the main problem is.

1087
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,040
 So spots are going to be very difficult.

1088
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,040
 And the reason is, you can jump and throw balls much better.

1089
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,040
 This is according to an article on space.com.

1090
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,040
 So you can throw a ball maybe like 10 to 6 times higher or 6 times further.

1091
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
 But that means that your American football field,

1092
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,040
 which is what they were talking about,

1093
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,040
 would have to be 600 yards long.

1094
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,040
 And so you need that space.

1095
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,040
 Yeah, that's true.

1096
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,040
 You don't have the space because it's a small like planet.

1097
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,040
 Tennis will be quite crap as well, because top spin doesn't work.

1098
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,040
 So all the best, like in a Darls game is going to go completely to pot

1099
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,040
 because the reason top spin works is because of the,

1100
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
 it's the Bernouille effect that I think we've mentioned before.

1101
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,040
 It's about how air pressure acts differently on one side of a spinning ball to the other.

1102
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,040
 And so that means that top spin brings the ball down into the court faster than it would otherwise go.

1103
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,040
 Because of this effect.

1104
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,040
 And with no atmosphere on the moon, again,

1105
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
 you're not having top spin working.

1106
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,040
 So all of them Darls shots go out.

1107
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,040
 What about cricket?

1108
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,040
 Is this possibly the one place where we can have a time we're going to have a fair cricket match?

1109
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
 Because there's no Australians.

1110
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:32,040
 And by the way guys our Brisbane date has really not so far.

1111
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,040
 We don't know why.

1112
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,040
 But Marion Bartoli might be able to work it out before anyone else.

1113
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,040
 That's why I'm thinking because she's so smart.

1114
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,040
 You're right.

1115
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,040
 Like she would be able to work out the trajectories and stuff.

1116
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,040
 The perfect way to hit it.

1117
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,040
 I'm actually interested in going to the moon a bit more now that we know that top spin doesn't work.

1118
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,040
 Because it just levels that playing field when I'm playing a little bit.

1119
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:58,040
 So there wasn't going in 1964 who made a bet.

1120
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,040
 He was a British man called David Thrillfall.

1121
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:05,040
 And you remember President Kennedy promised in about 1961 we're going to get to the moon by the end of the decade.

1122
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,040
 Yes.

1123
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,040
 And they squeaked in in 1969.

1124
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:14,040
 He bet in 1964 that a man would get to the moon before the end of the decade.

1125
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,040
 And William Hill gave mods of a thousand to one.

1126
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,040
 But they did take the bet.

1127
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:23,040
 And when they landed on the moon he was taken to a TV studio and he became a minor celebrity.

1128
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,040
 He was presented with a check for £1,000 which was a lot of money at the time.

1129
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,040
 It was about £180,000 in today's money.

1130
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:34,040
 And the really tragic thing was he died the next year in a crash of the car that he bought with the winnings.

1131
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,040
 No.

1132
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,040
 Oh, that's awful.

1133
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,040
 It's just that story.

1134
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,040
 Oh, thank you for telling us.

1135
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,040
 Should we end on that?

1136
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,040
 I looked into if you moved to the moon.

1137
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:52,040
 There's a lot of stuff that is left there by previous missions that you can collect to make your house a bit more interesting.

1138
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:57,040
 It's not interesting enough that you're the only person living on the moon.

1139
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,040
 Oh, yeah.

1140
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,040
 I need to have a space.

1141
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,040
 Some boots.

1142
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,040
 Some bagged up pieces.

1143
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,040
 Well, come around to my house town.

1144
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,040
 You can have bagged up pieces in your own home.

1145
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,040
 Very easy.

1146
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,040
 You've got a baby.

1147
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,040
 You should know all about that.

1148
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,040
 My house is bagged up pieces of the moon.

1149
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,040
 There's some Andy Wool warhol art up on the moon.

1150
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,040
 Oh, wow.

1151
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,040
 Yeah.

1152
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,040
 There's a cock and balls that he drew.

1153
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,040
 He drew a cock and balls.

1154
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,040
 He paraded it as his initials and A and a W.

1155
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,040
 It artistically done.

1156
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,040
 The W was upside down and the A.

1157
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,040
 Well, that sounds like an M and an A.

1158
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,040
 And it's what it looks like as well.

1159
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
 Yeah.

1160
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,040
 Yeah.

1161
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,040
 Excuse me, confusing.

1162
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,040
 Andy Murray's painting.

1163
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,040
 Yeah.

1164
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,040
 If you do it like that.

1165
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,040
 Andy Wool.

1166
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,040
 Yes.

1167
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,040
 You're right.

1168
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,040
 Yeah.

1169
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,040
 So that's how it comes.

1170
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,040
 And that's why I thought it looked like an M.

1171
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,040
 But he's right.

1172
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,040
 No, you've just been having that work of our upside down.

1173
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
 I've been looking at an upside down.

1174
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,040
 You've hung it wrong.

1175
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,040
 It's badly hung.

1176
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:00,040
 [LAUGHTER]

1177
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,040
 Yeah.

1178
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,040
 So this was a kind of, it was a mini little piece of art

1179
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,040
 where six different artists contributed to it.

1180
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,040
 Andy Warhol was one of them.

1181
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,040
 And it was put on this way for a small size little thing

1182
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,040
 that was meant to be taken up.

1183
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,040
 But NASA disagreed for it.

1184
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,040
 So what's happening?

1185
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,040
 Let's just try.

1186
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,040
 Why are you drawing more cock and balls?

1187
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,040
 Well, I've just worked out.

1188
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,040
 My name is Andrew Murray.

1189
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,040
 And look at that.

1190
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,040
 That's an A and an M.

1191
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,040
 And it also looks like it.

1192
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,040
 I think I've got a new signature for the next book.

1193
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,040
 My driving license.

1194
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,040
 People are going to be so happy.

1195
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,040
 [LAUGHTER]

1196
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,040
 Put that down, Andy.

1197
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,040
 Go on down.

1198
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:41,040
 Yeah, so they submitted it as wanting to take it to the moon.

1199
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,040
 But it was rejected.

1200
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,040
 But it was actually smuggled up there.

1201
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,040
 A lot of smuggling happened, yeah.

1202
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,040
 In the early days, like Buzz Aldrin, I think,

1203
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,040
 smuggled up the communion that he brought up to the moon

1204
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,040
 and so on.

1205
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,040
 People did like to smuggle stuff.

1206
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,040
 So you can get a communion.

1207
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,040
 How do you communion?

1208
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,040
 He's called it.

1209
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,040
 How do you communion?

1210
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,040
 You're right.

1211
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,040
 Very nice.

1212
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,040
 So Andy Warhol art is up there.

1213
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,040
 There's also a feather from a falcon up there.

1214
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,040
 Just a single feather, which is really cool.

1215
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,040
 It was done as part of an experiment.

1216
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,040
 Oh, yeah, I remember that.

1217
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,040
 Yeah, the Apollo 12 experiment.

1218
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,040
 What they wanted to do was recreate the idea of seeing

1219
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,040
 whether or not the idea of a bowling ball.

1220
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,040
 And what was it?

1221
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,040
 So Galileo supposedly dropped two balls

1222
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:26,040
 from the leaning tower of pizza.

1223
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,040
 Yeah.

1224
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,040
 And they landed at the same time because it's independent of mass.

1225
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,040
 And they tried it with the bowling ball and the feather.

1226
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,040
 He proved that it was true.

1227
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,040
 Yeah, a hammer and a feather on the moon.

1228
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,040
 Yeah.

1229
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,040
 I mean, to take it, yeah, if the most powerful rocket

1230
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,040
 can only take three men and a bit of a kit to the moon,

1231
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,040
 taking a bowling ball seems like it needed to be fabulous.

1232
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,040
 But yeah, it was the Air Force Academy's falcon mascot.

1233
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,040
 They have the mascots and they plucked off one of its feathers.

1234
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,040
 And that still lives on the moon.

1235
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,040
 So I could be part of your house.

1236
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,040
 So just to be clear, is that because there's no air resistance?

1237
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,040
 Because obviously if you drop hammer and a feather,

1238
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,040
 the feather will float down because of air resistance.

1239
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,040
 It's on Earth, it would, yeah.

1240
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,040
 But on the moon, they drop at the same.

1241
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,040
 That's cool.

1242
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,040
 Yeah.

1243
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,040
 I was just looking at things that we'd have to train to learn

1244
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,040
 to do when we get to the moon.

1245
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,040
 And I don't think we've mentioned before that all astronauts

1246
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,040
 at the moment who go into space have to do toilet training.

1247
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,040
 So you have to be read toilet trained.

1248
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,040
 Really?

1249
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,040
 Have we talked about this?

1250
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,040
 No.

1251
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,040
 Because I didn't know that.

1252
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,040
 So they've forgotten how to do it.

1253
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,040
 It makes you forget how to urinate.

1254
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,040
 Yeah.

1255
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,040
 So you can't have the same design lose in space because stuff

1256
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,040
 might kind of get out of them.

1257
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,040
 So when you sit on the loo, it's a very, very small aperture

1258
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,040
 that you have to aim your stuff into.

1259
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,040
 So the opening of a toilet in space is four inches wide.

1260
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,040
 And usually I lose 18 inches wide, like 15 to 18 inches wide.

1261
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,040
 That's not four inches, Andy.

1262
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,040
 No.

1263
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,040
 Oh, I thought it was.

1264
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:52,040
 Disappointing the ale around.

1265
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:58,040
 So NASA has specially designed toilet training room

1266
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,040
 is at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston.

1267
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,040
 And it's actually got two different toilets in it.

1268
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,040
 So in this room it's got a positional toilet.

1269
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,040
 And that's not functional.

1270
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,040
 That's just so you learn how to position yourself properly on the toilet.

1271
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,040
 And actually that's--

1272
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,040
 Oh, no.

1273
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,040
 I'm sure some training astronauts have mistaken the position

1274
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,040
 of one way or just practicing for the function of life

1275
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,040
 when you go at the showroom, at the bathroom showroom.

1276
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,040
 I don't know.

1277
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,040
 Is that a thing?

1278
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
 And I just try this one out.

1279
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,040
 That's a comedy trope, isn't it?

1280
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
 Is it?

1281
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,040
 That's where you've got kicked out of IKEA that time.

1282
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,040
 It's true.

1283
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,040
 So yeah, you've got the show toilet and that tests your aim

1284
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,040
 and it's got a little camera inside it that looks up at you.

1285
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,040
 So you can then review the footage afterwards to check

1286
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,040
 that you've aimed right.

1287
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,040
 And then when you're ready for it, you can turn this on

1288
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,040
 to the actual function on toilet, which is also in the training room

1289
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,040
 where you can practice how to flash and stuff.

1290
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,040
 Okay, I have a question.

1291
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,040
 Are there any astronauts who have aced every single other metric

1292
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,040
 but just haven't been allowed to go to space for the toilet?

1293
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,040
 That's not.

1294
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
 That's not.

1295
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,040
 Always ends up on the floor.

1296
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,040
 I don't know.

1297
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,040
 That must be right.

1298
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,040
 Like if you can't do that.

1299
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,040
 That's true.

1300
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,040
 You have to pass.

1301
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,040
 You have to-- that's one of them.

1302
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,040
 Actually, that's probably one of the more important things

1303
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,040
 to get right in a spaceship.

1304
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,040
 Well, flying the rocket is quite important.

1305
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,040
 Come on.

1306
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,040
 They've probably got autopilot stuff today.

1307
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,040
 But if you've got a cabin full of poo floating around,

1308
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,040
 that is a hooster and we have a big problem.

1309
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,040
 Okay, that's it.

1310
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,040
 That is all of our facts.

1311
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,040
