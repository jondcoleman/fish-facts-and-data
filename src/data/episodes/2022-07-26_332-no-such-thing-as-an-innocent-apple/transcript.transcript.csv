00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, James here. Now, before we start this week's show, I just want to tell you one"
00:00:04,00:00:09,"little thing about it, and that is that it was actually recorded quite a long time ago,"
00:00:09,00:00:15,"all the way back in February, in fact. And the reason I want to tell you that is because,"
00:00:15,00:00:22,"first of all, it's obviously in the office and we're all still in our homes at the moment."
00:00:22,00:00:26,"And also because there'll be a few things that we might say in there that might really,"
00:00:26,00:00:32,"perhaps, give away that we didn't record it this week, for instance. I do talk about Jasper"
00:00:32,00:00:36,"Carrot for a while, and that probably would have been a dated reference any time that we'd"
00:00:36,00:00:43,"said it in the last five years. But hey, when you listen, you'll get the idea. So enjoy the show"
00:00:43,00:00:51,"and just marvel about how young we all sounded back in February. Okay, on with the podcast."
00:00:51,00:01:06,[Music]
00:01:06,00:01:11,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to"
00:01:11,00:01:16,you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James
00:01:16,00:01:21,"Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anna Chazinski. And once again, we have gathered around the"
00:01:21,00:01:26,"microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order,"
00:01:26,00:01:33,"here we go. Starting with you, Anna. My fact this week is that in the 18th century, women"
00:01:33,00:01:39,expressed their political beliefs by wearing decorative stickers on their faces. Wow. That's
00:01:39,00:01:45,"cool. What kind of stickers did they say, like, vote labor or? Yeah, screw you, Boris. I just"
00:01:45,00:01:50,rolled all over their forehead. Very prescient of them. Women have amazing foresight.
00:01:50,00:01:58,"And full heads. Sticker, huh? No, this one's so facial stickers were this huge fashion for about"
00:01:58,00:02:05,"sort of 200 years. And about the turn of the 18th century, they suddenly became political."
00:02:05,00:02:08,"And so there was one commentator, for instance, who said that he went to the opera and he saw"
00:02:08,00:02:14,"two parties of very fine women, as he said, arranged in battle formation against each other."
00:02:14,00:02:19,"And he said, one group was wearing patches and stickers on the left side of their foreheads"
00:02:19,00:02:23,and the other on the right. It became apparent they were wig supporters and Tory supporters.
00:02:23,00:02:30,"And I looked into this and this was a thing. So it wasn't the stickers were just like little,"
00:02:30,00:02:33,"like beauty spots or something, but it was where you wore them that was important. Is that it?"
00:02:33,00:02:38,"Yes, that seems to be it. Yes. So they started off as for decoration, but it got to the extent"
00:02:38,00:02:43,that there were some marriage contracts where women would insist before they married their husband
00:02:43,00:02:48,"that regardless of the husband's political opinions, the wife should be able to patch as she pleased."
00:02:48,00:02:54,"And so you would have one or two things, but did it get to the point where people,"
00:02:54,00:02:58,"you know, when you see full face tattoos, did you ever see people just completely?"
00:02:58,00:03:03,"You would see not completely the full face, but you might see lots of these like fake beauty spots."
00:03:03,00:03:08,And you could supposedly identify prostitutes because their faces had so many of these patches
00:03:08,00:03:12,"on them. Was that a sign of being sexy, though, having lots of stickers?"
00:03:12,00:03:18,"Well, having one sticker was supposed to be. And the reason is supposedly Venus,"
00:03:18,00:03:25,"the goddess of beauty, she had one mole on her face. And it was by that one imperfection"
00:03:25,00:03:29,that you could see how beautiful the rest of her face was. And the idea was that they were kind
00:03:29,00:03:34,"of copying that. And by having like one little beauty spot, it would show the paleness of your"
00:03:34,00:03:37,"skin, perhaps, or, you know, show off the rest of your skin. So if you have lots and lots of"
00:03:37,00:03:41,"stickers, that means you're really, really beautiful because you've got you need so many"
00:03:41,00:03:46,imperfections to disguise how fit you are. You wouldn't believe what I look like without
00:03:46,00:03:49,"these stickers on, because I look really nice. It could have been that you are covering the"
00:03:49,00:04:00,"symptoms of STDs. It's a real gamble. So sorry, I didn't think that we had glue sticker technology"
00:04:00,00:04:06,"in the, when is this, 18th century? We had glue. Sure. Okay. Were they kind of fuzzy felt"
00:04:06,00:04:12,"stickers, that kind of thing? I actually don't think we had fuzzy felt. They would be made of"
00:04:12,00:04:18,various things. So they could be made of silk or taffeta or leather sometimes. And then they'd
00:04:18,00:04:25,"have mouth fur, apparently. Mouth fur? On your tongue? No. I suddenly developed a lisp."
00:04:25,00:04:30,"It sounded like mouse from where I was sat, but. Okay. Oh, mouse fur. Okay. I heard mouth as well."
00:04:31,00:04:38,"Okay. Right in and tell us what you heard. So, and then they'd have on the back, often a surface"
00:04:38,00:04:41,that you could lick. So women tended to take them out of their handbags and lick them to attach
00:04:41,00:04:45,"them to their face. So you get very thin paper that does that. Well, they had adhesive. So they'd"
00:04:45,00:04:49,just stick it on with some glue. Yeah. But sometimes the adhesive wasn't so great. So there was an
00:04:49,00:04:54,"article in the spectator that spoke about a woman who had a beauty spot on her forehead, but by the"
00:04:54,00:05:02,"end of the evening, it had gone to her chin. They got more and more elaborate as well, didn't they?"
00:05:02,00:05:08,"Is it caught on? So I think it started in France and the French called them moosh, which is for"
00:05:08,00:05:15,"flies because they look like little flies landing on your face. But yeah, they expanded to be weird"
00:05:15,00:05:20,"shapes. So by the end of the 18th century, you'd have them cut into stars or sort of moons or"
00:05:20,00:05:25,"crown shapes or any shape you wanted, really. You still get those, don't you? On small children."
00:05:25,00:05:32,Adults who like a bit of fun. Yeah. Why are you wearing that with the puppy dog on the middle
00:05:32,00:05:37,"of your forehead? I was so considering doing it this morning by bottling out of it. But yeah,"
00:05:37,00:05:43,"no, you do get them like little kind of, I don't know, stars and yeah, I've been very brave at the"
00:05:43,00:05:51,"dentist today. Stick those on your forehead though, didn't I? No, actually, I've got, I used to have"
00:05:51,00:05:54,"one of those, but it was a safety pin one. So that's not for the forehead. That's for the clothes."
00:05:54,00:06:00,"Safety pin, really? Oh, it was a badge. I'm describing a badge. But what's interesting about"
00:06:00,00:06:04,that is I think you're only brave at the dentist once. So you don't need it to be a badge. You
00:06:04,00:06:08,only need it to be a sticker. Do you know what? You're right. I'm confusing it with my I've been
00:06:08,00:06:13,"to a party at Pizza Hut badge, which is a badge because that's the thing that lasts a life if"
00:06:13,00:06:18,"you go to a party at Pizza Hut in the early 90s. Yeah, you want to show off about that, don't you?"
00:06:18,00:06:21,That's why you wear badges. You don't want to be wearing a badge that says I've been brave at the
00:06:21,00:06:27,"dentist just to show off. You feel pretty silly at the military parade, wouldn't you, next to all"
00:06:27,00:06:33,the other medals? Just being brave at the dentist award. I got this one for bravery.
00:06:36,00:06:39,I saw there's some drawings that people have done of some of the designs and there was a
00:06:39,00:06:43,"horse and carriage one and I think that's been questioned a bit. That was satire, was it?"
00:06:43,00:06:48,That was someone taking a piss out of the power of said they've gone. I thought that was real too.
00:06:48,00:06:52,"Yeah, I was really hoping that that would be because I just thought how interesting heads"
00:06:52,00:06:56,"must have been back then. I don't know what you mean. Well, just wait a minute. If you're sitting"
00:06:56,00:06:59,on the tube and someone sat across from me with a horse and carriage drawn on their head and they
00:06:59,00:07:04,"had other cartoons, you know, I wouldn't need the paper. But people still have tattoos these"
00:07:04,00:07:08,"days. So do you just, when you're sat on the tube, just read people's tattoos? I do, but they give"
00:07:08,00:07:14,"me a look that says I'm not friendly. Oh, well, this is the thing about other kinds of stickers"
00:07:14,00:07:21,"is that they can be indicators of how friendly or not someone is. So bumper stickers, if people"
00:07:21,00:07:26,"have bumper stickers on their car, they tend to be more aggressive and territorial drivers."
00:07:26,00:07:32,"Yeah, makes sense. Yeah, study in 2008 by Colorado State University and they surveyed people saying,"
00:07:32,00:07:36,"do you have bumper stickers on your car? And do you drive like a bastard? And basically,"
00:07:36,00:07:40,"people who said yes to one said yes to the other. They said, yeah, I drive more territorially,"
00:07:40,00:07:46,"more aggressively, I do not respond constructively on the road when people get in my way."
00:07:46,00:07:51,"And how often are these the baby on board stickers? Well, I read that article and actually it said"
00:07:51,00:07:55,"that it doesn't matter what's on the sticker, right? So you might have a sticker that says"
00:07:55,00:07:59,everyone needs to be kind to each other and you're still going to drive like a maniac.
00:07:59,00:08:03,"Yeah, so baby on board as well. Yeah, more likely to be aggressive."
00:08:03,00:08:09,Just one more thing on an alternative use for stickers for yourself for decoration is to cover
00:08:09,00:08:13,blemishes. And so I think that's that's sort of where facial stickers might have come from
00:08:13,00:08:19,originally. But men wore them quite a lot to cover blemishes or to accentuate them. And so
00:08:19,00:08:24,"if men had been to war, for instance, it became quite common for them to come back and they'd"
00:08:24,00:08:27,"put a scar sticker over their scar. I think if a scar started to fade or something,"
00:08:27,00:08:32,"then you'd put a big black scar there. And so there's, for instance, there's a bit in all's"
00:08:32,00:08:36,"well that ends well, which now makes sense. If you know where Bertram comes back from war,"
00:08:36,00:08:40,"and it says he's got a patch of velvet on his face, and it's unclear if there's a scar underneath."
00:08:40,00:08:44,"And it was sort of a thing that people did if they hadn't really seen much military action,"
00:08:44,00:08:47,"and they were a bit of a coward, and they'd run away at the first sign anyway,"
00:08:47,00:08:52,is that they'd suddenly put a big blemish on their face to imply that they'd been shot in the head.
00:08:52,00:08:56,"Wow, that's amazing. I've got a little scar on my face. Maybe I'll try and accentuate it."
00:08:56,00:09:02,Have you? With some mouse fur. I want to do one of the sides. I'm not sure which side.
00:09:02,00:09:04,"Oh yeah, little one, yeah, yeah. It's somewhere you got shot in the Civil War,"
00:09:04,00:09:11,isn't it? Obscene bumper stickers can sometimes be a matter for the law.
00:09:11,00:09:16,"Okay, so there are all these lawsuits that happen in the USA over whether you're allowed a"
00:09:16,00:09:20,"particular bumper sticker or not, or whether it's basically creating a public disturbance just by"
00:09:20,00:09:26,"having it on your car. So in 2008, a guy went to the Georgia Supreme Court because he had a"
00:09:26,00:09:34,"""Shit happens"" bumper sticker, and he won. And then, more recently, this bit is very rude by the way,"
00:09:34,00:09:38,"but the police in Florida arrested and charged a man who had a bumper sticker which said,"
00:09:38,00:09:43,"""I eat ass."" And that was really big and it's right in the middle of his back windscreen as well,"
00:09:43,00:09:46,so there's no way if you're driving along that you won't see it.
00:09:46,00:09:48,"And was he referring to donkey meat, do we know?"
00:09:48,00:09:52,"I'm not sure. That wasn't his defence, actually."
00:09:52,00:09:57,"I mean, it absolutely should have been. But the police pulled him over and they said,"
00:09:57,00:10:00,"""Can you amend it?"" So it wasn't offensive. And he said, ""Well, how do you suggest I do that?"""
00:10:00,00:10:05,"And they said, ""Can you remove the second S from ass?"" So it would be, ""I eat ass."""
00:10:05,00:10:08,But then the grammar police come at you on the other side.
00:10:08,00:10:12,"Guys, who's the grandfather, the god of stickers?"
00:10:12,00:10:15,The god of stickers. The god of stickers. You all know this.
00:10:15,00:10:19,"Football albums. Panini. Oh, no, I was thinking of Mr Avery."
00:10:19,00:10:21,"Oh, Avery, yeah. Oh, Avery. Stanton."
00:10:21,00:10:27,"Sorry. Well, because you never do any of the office admin, Andy,"
00:10:27,00:10:32,"you are not familiar with Avery stickers, but those of us who post letters every once in a while."
00:10:32,00:10:36,This feels like more of a grudge. It feels like this whole fact has been building up to a grudge.
00:10:36,00:10:43,"No, so Stanton Avery, mate, was the inventor of the self-adhesive sticker, as in you didn't need"
00:10:43,00:10:47,"to lick it, you didn't need to add glue to it. And he still dominates the label market today,"
00:10:47,00:10:53,so I was looking into him. So he built his first sticker machine.
00:10:53,00:10:59,"I love this, by marrying together a motor from a washing machine and a sewing machine,"
00:10:59,00:11:04,sewing machine parts. So we smushed them together and generated a shed load of stickers.
00:11:04,00:11:08,"His company was initially called Cum Clean Products, spelling cum K-U-M,"
00:11:08,00:11:13,which I think is a good thing was changed. How did he make his glue?
00:11:16,00:11:20,He was actually very cagey about the process. He was so pretty tired.
00:11:20,00:11:31,He was super poor. And so he really like dragged himself up from the bottom. He lived in a rented
00:11:31,00:11:38,chicken coop. He couldn't even afford the deposit on a chicken coop. Did he pay the chickens?
00:11:38,00:11:43,I don't know if the chickens own the coop. I think they were also renting.
00:11:43,00:11:48,Oh wow. Terrible flatmates. I think I get eggs every morning.
00:11:48,00:11:55,Do you want to eat an egg if your flatmate has just laid it before your horrified eyes?
00:11:55,00:11:59,I refuse to eat food that's come out of any of my friends arses.
00:11:59,00:12:08,"That's amazing. Yeah, it's so cool. He could have written, I eat and then in brackets,"
00:12:08,00:12:12,"eggs that have come out of a chicken. Clothes, brackets, ass."
00:12:12,00:12:17,Another strong defense. So many arguments are going out before.
00:12:17,00:12:23,So he tried a bunch of business. How did he get a washing machine in the chicken coop?
00:12:23,00:12:30,So I think this was post chicken coop. And he got it because he married a slightly wealthier lady
00:12:30,00:12:33,"who lent him a bit of money. And he thought, I need a washing machine."
00:12:33,00:12:37,We got back to your place tonight. Chickens out tonight.
00:12:37,00:12:43,So anyway. Did she invite them to the hen do?
00:12:43,00:12:49,You got laid that night.
00:12:49,00:12:59,"Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that the very"
00:12:59,00:13:04,first print run of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn had to be pulped after a bookstore owner
00:13:04,00:13:09,discovered someone had sneaked a drawing of a penis into one of the illustrations.
00:13:09,00:13:13,"The first suspect has to be the illustrator, is she?"
00:13:13,00:13:18,"Yes, we genuinely don't know. We don't know if it was the illustrator. We don't know if it was"
00:13:18,00:13:24,the photo engraver at the actual factory where they were printing the book. What we do know is
00:13:24,00:13:30,"when these books came out at the end of Chapter 32, Huck Finn is meeting his aunt Sally and Uncle"
00:13:30,00:13:37,"Silas. And Uncle Silas has a big erect penis drawn in in the illustration itself. And as a result,"
00:13:37,00:13:44,"30,000 copies had to be pulped. And did they definitely check the plot and they don't,"
00:13:44,00:13:48,it's not part of the storyline that references Uncle Silas's erect penis?
00:13:48,00:13:52,Weirdly. Weirdly. I read the book and I can confirm there isn't a bit where
00:13:52,00:13:56,Uncle Silas has an erection and is showing it off to his family.
00:13:56,00:13:58,That must have been very disappointing when you got to the end of that.
00:13:58,00:14:01,It's the only reason I bought the book in the first place.
00:14:01,00:14:09,"So this is obviously, it's a very important book in American literature. Ernest Hemingway said"
00:14:09,00:14:13,all modern American literature comes from one book and it's called Huckleberry Finn. And the
00:14:13,00:14:17,idea was it was the first book that used the vernacular of Americans. At that point Americans
00:14:17,00:14:23,"were really writing in the tone of British and European authors, not using the day-to-day language"
00:14:23,00:14:30,"and he kind of set the tone. Unfortunately, it's also a book that's laced with racism and that's"
00:14:30,00:14:36,caused huge problems basically since publication. It's not a book that's sort of not been controversial
00:14:36,00:14:39,"throughout the years. The language use is difficult and racist and we should say that it's set,"
00:14:39,00:14:43,"Mark Twain wrote it in the 80s, but it's set about 40 years earlier in the 1840s, isn't it?"
00:14:44,00:14:48,"And the main plot of Huckleberry Finn, for anyone who hasn't read it, is basically it's about Huck Finn"
00:14:48,00:14:56,who is this kind of poor kid who held a seat 12 or 13 and he runs away along with a runaway slave
00:14:56,00:15:01,who is called Jim and they run away together and they are good friends and Jim is a very
00:15:01,00:15:06,"sympathetic character but at the same time very problematically drawn. Yeah, one of the..."
00:15:06,00:15:09,"Not drawn with an erect penis like Uncle Silas, we should say."
00:15:10,00:15:14,People have objected to stuff other than that so it was extremely controversial as soon as it was
00:15:14,00:15:19,published largely because of the kind of crudeness of some of the language and that was written in
00:15:19,00:15:25,"this native dialect. It wasn't just like ordinary American dialect, it was proper Mississippi 1840s"
00:15:25,00:15:30,dialect and it was banned for bad grammar and employment of inelegant expressions.
00:15:30,00:15:37,Things like in 1905 a Brooklyn library banned it because Huck not only itched but he scratched.
00:15:37,00:15:42,"So apparently that's disgusting and he said ""sweet"" when he should have said ""perspiration""."
00:15:42,00:15:46,So Mark Twain had been kind of unhappy with the way that publishing had been going and he
00:15:46,00:15:52,decided he didn't want to have normal publishers like before and get the money that way. He wanted
00:15:52,00:15:58,"to have a subscription service so he sent people door to door with like, you know, the first chapter"
00:15:58,00:16:02,"and said, ""Look, there's this new book coming out. How do you fancy buying it and then we'll send you"
00:16:02,00:16:07,"all the chapters in future?"" And he basically, because he did this, it meant he could have full"
00:16:07,00:16:13,"control of it, which meant he had full control of all of the illustrations and it meant that when"
00:16:13,00:16:17,"the illustrator kept sending him stuff he was like, ""Don't like that, don't like that, don't like that,"
00:16:17,00:16:24,"don't like that, do like that."" Love that penis! So is that maybe why they pranked him? That's one"
00:16:24,00:16:28,theory that the illustrator hated him so much because he kept asking him to change things
00:16:28,00:16:33,"that he's like, ""Right, fine."" But they offered a massive reward to the press men working on the"
00:16:33,00:16:38,"novel and a $500 reward, which would have been a lot of money today and no one fessed up, so we"
00:16:38,00:16:46,"still, there's no culprit. And is the investigation still open? I think the office, the reward is"
00:16:46,00:16:50,still available. He had a terrible relationship with his sort of typesetters and proofreaders
00:16:50,00:16:54,"and everyone like that, didn't he? Which might be why they were so pissed off with him. He hated them"
00:16:54,00:16:58,"and it does sound like they kept on trying to improve his punctuation and grammar, which was"
00:16:58,00:17:03,deliberately vernacular. And once upon getting a text back and seeing the corrections that had been
00:17:03,00:17:08,"made, he wrote to a friend, ""I've telegraphed orders to have the proofreader shot without giving him"
00:17:08,00:17:13,"time to pray."" So it was tense, I think. If someone wrote that about, ""Hey, I draw a penis on their picture."""
00:17:13,00:17:20,It wasn't the most successful book that he published with that firm. So the first two
00:17:20,00:17:25,"books that that firm published were Huckleberry Finn and The Memoirs of Ulysses S Grant,"
00:17:25,00:17:29,"ex-president, and it was pretty much the last thing Grant did was write this book."
00:17:29,00:17:36,And it was so successful that he gave Grant's widow the biggest ever royalty check in American
00:17:36,00:17:40,publishing history. It was absolutely massive. And it was thanks to that door-to-door technique
00:17:40,00:17:45,"that James mentioned, because it was war veterans. So it was silver war veterans going door-to-door"
00:17:45,00:17:50,"selling the book. And that's a pretty strong sell, you know? I might be wrong in saying this, but"
00:17:50,00:17:56,"from the story that I know about that, it's that when Ulysses S Grant died, his wife was really"
00:17:56,00:18:02,struggling financially and was not given any help from anyone. And Mark Twain published the book
00:18:02,00:18:07,and gave her that high amount of royalties before he knew it was going to be successful so that she
00:18:07,00:18:13,"had money to live off for the rest of her life. Apparently, it's an extraordinary book, that"
00:18:13,00:18:19,autobiography. Really? Yeah. I've read so many things about it being the best book by anyone in
00:18:19,00:18:24,"government ever as a solid, it's just incredible, apparently. Surely not better than the art of"
00:18:24,00:18:31,the deal. Surely. Surely not better than Jacob Rees Mogg's book about the Victorians.
00:18:31,00:18:37,"Can't be better than that, can it? Now, if we want to talk about offensive landings and things."
00:18:37,00:18:43,Mark Twain wrote the first book on a typewriter in America. There's a bit of dispute over whether
00:18:43,00:18:49,it was Tom Sawyer or another one of his books. It's usually credited as Tom Sawyer. But he
00:18:49,00:18:54,used to love writing on a typewriter and no one really had it at the time. So people used to write
00:18:54,00:18:58,him letters and he would write letters back on his typewriter. They would then write back to him
00:18:58,00:19:03,asking about the typewriter and that got so annoying with so many people writing back to him
00:19:03,00:19:07,"asking him, ""Holy moly, what is this? This is incredible,"" that he stopped writing letters"
00:19:07,00:19:12,using his typewriter. Really? She's got inundated. Yeah. I really love his correspondence because
00:19:12,00:19:17,"he didn't really much like getting them a lot of the time, did he? I read one that he got in 1901"
00:19:18,00:19:22,"and the letter said, ""Dear Mr. Mark Twain, I am a little girl six years old. I have read"
00:19:22,00:19:27,your stories ever since they first came out. I have a cat named Kitty and a dog named Pop.
00:19:27,00:19:32,I like to guess puzzles. Did you write a story for the Herald competition? I hope you will answer
00:19:32,00:19:39,"my letter. Yours truly Augusta Kortrecht."" To which he replied, ""Well, no."" He didn't reply. He just"
00:19:39,00:19:44,"wrote a comment on it saying, ""Labor tempt of a middle-aged liar to pull an autograph."""
00:19:44,00:19:57,"He invented one game for kids, which I think sounds pretty cool. He measured out a 817 foot path"
00:19:57,00:20:03,of his driveway and he marked every single foot and that was supposed to be a year and it was
00:20:03,00:20:09,the year from 1066 when William the Conqueror arrived in Britain and the idea is you would
00:20:09,00:20:15,"walk along the path and at each point when there was a new king or queen in England or Britain,"
00:20:15,00:20:19,"then you would stake in the ground and you would be like, ""Oh, this is Edward the first,"
00:20:19,00:20:25,"this is Henry the second, blah, blah, blah."" It was a way of having fun but also learning"
00:20:25,00:20:29,your kings and queens because in those days education was very much rote learning. You
00:20:29,00:20:32,just had to learn all these things and this was a fun way of doing it.
00:20:32,00:20:36,Or a very annoyingly slow way of getting to the front door after a long day in the office.
00:20:36,00:20:41,"But he turned it into a board game, didn't he? Or he tried to."
00:20:41,00:20:45,It sounds really complicated. I didn't fully understand it even after reading it.
00:20:45,00:20:49,"I thought it sounded quite, it sounded a bit like battleship. Basically, it was another"
00:20:49,00:20:53,sort of history date memorization game and essentially you'd have a chart with a series of
00:20:53,00:21:01,dates on it and each player would say a date. You say 1918 and then the other player has to
00:21:01,00:21:05,"say an event that happened on that date to say the end of the First World War. See,"
00:21:05,00:21:09,I cleverly chose my date in advance so I'd have something to say for it.
00:21:09,00:21:12,"I mean, you also chose a date that was nearly 10 years after Twain died when no one could possibly"
00:21:12,00:21:18,have guessed what was going to happen. True. But then a player puts a pin in that date if they
00:21:18,00:21:22,"get it right and if they don't get it right, they don't get a pin and I guess when you've"
00:21:22,00:21:25,covered up all your dates you've won. Sounds quite fun for a nerd.
00:21:29,00:21:33,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy."
00:21:33,00:21:39,"My fact is that before vaccination was invented, the main method of inoculation against smallpox"
00:21:39,00:21:42,was to powder scabs and blow them up your nose.
00:21:42,00:21:46,Lovely. Or to get someone else to blow them up your nose.
00:21:46,00:21:52,It's very hard to blow up your own nose. And this was how inoculation worked for a long time.
00:21:52,00:21:56,It was done in China a thousand years ago. This was the method they knew about this.
00:21:56,00:22:02,"And it did work, didn't it? It worked reasonably well. So if you were healthy,"
00:22:02,00:22:10,you would get some smallpox scabs and you would leave them for a little while because fresh
00:22:10,00:22:16,"scabs were likely to give you the infection properly. So they would be dried, aged smallpox"
00:22:16,00:22:22,scabs and they would be powdered up and then they would be blown up your nose with a special
00:22:22,00:22:27,silver blowpipe for the procedure as well. The Chinese doctors had special blowpipes to do this.
00:22:27,00:22:31,And then apparently the right nostril was used for boys and the left for girls.
00:22:31,00:22:37,And you would maybe get some mild symptoms and some people did actually just then get
00:22:37,00:22:42,"full blown smallpox. But most people then got it, you know, some mild symptoms and then were"
00:22:42,00:22:45,"resistant to any following exposure. There's a low percentage, wasn't it?"
00:22:45,00:22:51,So this was a really decent way of doing it before we had the method of vaccination.
00:22:51,00:22:56,"And we didn't know about this, is that right? It took about 700 years to get over."
00:22:56,00:23:03,"And it works by the same method as vaccination, right? Which is that it's an attenuated or weakened"
00:23:03,00:23:09,version of the disease in a scab. And your body then makes antibodies that can fight against that
00:23:09,00:23:12,"and then it can fight against the main thing, is that right? There was another version where"
00:23:12,00:23:18,you had some powdered scab as well or you had some pus from a smallpox pustule and you would
00:23:18,00:23:23,"make a little scratch on your skin and then you would just pour that pus or, you know,"
00:23:23,00:23:29,rub that powdered scab into your skin and that worked too. And that's called variolation
00:23:29,00:23:35,"because variola was the Latin for smallpox. In 2011, the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond"
00:23:35,00:23:42,had some things from its collection. And one of them was a letter from the 1870s that had
00:23:42,00:23:48,a smallpox scab in it. And the idea was that the person who wrote the letter in the 19th
00:23:48,00:23:53,century was sending it to his father. It had been taken from the arm of a child and his father was
00:23:53,00:24:00,going to make it into dust and inoculate people. But then it never got to the recipient. And so
00:24:00,00:24:05,"they just found this letter. And of course, immediately, the Census for Disease Control came"
00:24:05,00:24:11,"in the hazmat suits and said, holy shit, you don't need to be having this, that the public can see"
00:24:11,00:24:17,"this because smallpox has been eradicated, basically, hasn't it? And so, yeah, in the end,"
00:24:17,00:24:22,"there was some of the virus on this scab still, but it wasn't deadly enough. I mean,"
00:24:22,00:24:28,it must have attenuated pretty hard by that time. How when was it? It was from 1876 and they found
00:24:28,00:24:34,"it in 2011. Wow. That is really spooky, finding it and not knowing what it is. You just think you"
00:24:34,00:24:39,found a little button or something. Or maybe it's like a little sticker to put on your face.
00:24:41,00:24:44,But all these doctors had their own different methods of doing variolation. And there were
00:24:44,00:24:50,"some celebrity doctors in Britain in the 17th, 18th century who worked this out. So have you"
00:24:50,00:24:54,heard of Johnny Notions? No. Johnny Notions. Sounds like he's got some weird ideas.
00:24:54,00:25:00,"Well, he was a Scottish doctor and he had a really successful method for variolating,"
00:25:00,00:25:05,"because he would collect the pus, first of all. And everyone had their own method of making it"
00:25:05,00:25:10,"a bit less deadly, basically. So he would dry it with peat smoke. So he had a lovely sort of"
00:25:10,00:25:16,"smoky flavour for the pus, very nice. And then he would bury it in the ground between sheets of"
00:25:16,00:25:22,"glass, okay, with some campfire. And then he would keep it there for seven or eight years."
00:25:22,00:25:27,"This is like he's making a whiskey, isn't it? Yeah, in genuine years. And then he would"
00:25:27,00:25:32,insert it and he would then put a cabbage leaf on top as a plaster. And this was apparently a
00:25:32,00:25:36,really good way of doing it. And it just gave you the nice amount. I suppose it does take the edge
00:25:36,00:25:41,"off the urn pus, doesn't it? It's a nice, peachy, cabergy flavour to it."
00:25:41,00:25:48,"Apparently, you were more likely to get a job if you could be seen to have smallpox scars,"
00:25:48,00:25:51,"because then the suggestion was, oh, great, you can work with us. You're not going to pass it on."
00:25:51,00:25:59,"You've had it already. That was seen as a sort of great, safe workmate. So two of the earliest"
00:25:59,00:26:05,people who worked with inoculation were Robert Koch in Germany and Louis Pasteur in France.
00:26:05,00:26:14,And they fell out with each other because Pasteur once was doing a talk and he used the phrase
00:26:14,00:26:22,"""Rekui Allemande"", which means a collection of German writing, but the translator translated"
00:26:22,00:26:30,"it as ""Augui Allemande"", which means German arrogance. And so Koch never forgave him for"
00:26:30,00:26:34,"that because he thought that Pasteur was calling him arrogant. Although I think that before that,"
00:26:34,00:26:38,"they loathe each other. If you read the dialogues that they had, the letters they wrote each other,"
00:26:38,00:26:44,"it's just basically spitting with rage, you know, Koch writing letters to Pasteur accusing him"
00:26:44,00:26:50,"of stealing all of his ideas and vice versa, saying you're a fraud, you know, really foul language,"
00:26:50,00:26:54,because there was this huge fight basically when we suddenly discovered the power of
00:26:54,00:26:57,"the idea of vaccination between a few scientists, wasn't there?"
00:26:58,00:27:06,"So that was after Jenna? Yes, it was. So Edward Jenna is the person who kind of we"
00:27:06,00:27:12,"give the, we say, created vaccinations today, right? He got it from milkmates."
00:27:12,00:27:18,"Did he? Yeah, because there were milkmates near him and he noticed that they got a thing called"
00:27:18,00:27:24,"cowpox, which is a disease that cows got, and they would only get one single pustule on their hands,"
00:27:24,00:27:28,"which is where they've been touching the cows because of all the milking. And he theorized,"
00:27:28,00:27:32,"maybe this is a milder version of smallpox. So then he did this amazing gamble, Jenna,"
00:27:32,00:27:41,"he took some pus from a milkmate and he injected it into a child. Yeah. And six, yeah,"
00:27:41,00:27:45,"not his child, by the way, although he did also do it with his own child actually later on, so fair"
00:27:45,00:27:51,"play. I think when he knew it worked. And then he, six weeks later, he injected the child with full"
00:27:51,00:27:57,"blown smallpox. And he didn't know how it worked. And yeah, and then, but later in life, they became"
00:27:57,00:28:03,"friends. So, yeah, James Phipps, he was the son of Edward Jenna's gardener, which if it hadn't"
00:28:03,00:28:07,"worked, would have made the gardening very, very awkward, I think for a long time. I think he would"
00:28:07,00:28:14,"have ruined your rose bush after that. He had smallpox when he was a child, Jenna. And one of the"
00:28:14,00:28:19,reasons that he kind of went into getting rid of it later is because he had such a bad time of it.
00:28:19,00:28:27,He was varialated. So they gave him some of the pus or some scabs or something. But he was prepared
00:28:27,00:28:33,"for that by being starved, purged and bled and locked in a stable with other infected boys."
00:28:33,00:28:38,"With other infected boys? Yeah. So they kind of varialated all these people, gave them like very"
00:28:38,00:28:43,"mild symptoms and then put them all in a stable. Meanwhile, Stanton Avery's outside of a checking"
00:28:43,00:28:53,"coop. Don't know you're born, mate. Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show. And that is"
00:28:53,00:28:59,"James. Okay, my fact this week is that you can tell if a movie character is a goodie or a baddie"
00:28:59,00:29:06,"by the kind of phone they use. That sucks now that I know that and I'm watching movies. I know,"
00:29:06,00:29:12,"sorry, this is not just a spoiler of one movie, this is a spoiler of all movies. So this came up"
00:29:12,00:29:17,"in my RSS feed. And thanks to the blog Nitarama, which I follow. And it was an interview with"
00:29:17,00:29:24,"Rian Johnson, who is the director of the film Knives Out. And he said that Apple have forbid"
00:29:24,00:29:29,filmmakers from letting villains use their iPhones on the screen. And so if one of your
00:29:29,00:29:34,"characters is using an Apple product, then they must be a good guy. Oh, thank you. So you can't"
00:29:34,00:29:38,"tell who's the good guy in the good, the bad and the ugly, for instance. It's a wonderful life."
00:29:38,00:29:43,I'm not sure any of them had mobile phones in those. They've been edited in.
00:29:43,00:29:50,"But sometimes it's not clear who is a goodie and who's a baddie. If someone is, if someone pushes"
00:29:50,00:29:54,"one person in front of a train to say five people, who will be allowed an iPhone in the"
00:29:54,00:29:59,"situation? You're absolutely right. In any decent story, everyone has a mixture of good and bad."
00:29:59,00:30:04,"Everyone has one iPhone and one Android. That's a good point. Actually, that saves it for me,"
00:30:04,00:30:08,"because the movie might have been sponsored by Samsung, for example. Yeah, so that's good. Okay,"
00:30:08,00:30:15,"great. I'll stop googling which phone sponsored all my movies. But yeah, and there was also an"
00:30:15,00:30:20,article in The Verge that says that Apple says that its products should only be used in the best
00:30:20,00:30:27,"light that reflects favorably on Apple products. And they don't, according to Apple, they don't pay"
00:30:27,00:30:32,to have their phones in movies. But what they do do is give lots of free phones and MacBooks and
00:30:32,00:30:38,stuff to the people who are making the movies in return for them being nice. But they wouldn't
00:30:38,00:30:46,show someone looking up on the internet how to kill orphans on a MacBook. On a MacBook. You couldn't
00:30:46,00:30:51,"do that on a MacBook. No. Yeah, were to inject this person to God in the sun. They wouldn't do that."
00:30:51,00:30:58,"But this is a thing called product displacement, which is the kind of like product displacement."
00:30:58,00:31:02,"Product displacement is where you replace a real brand with a fictional one, because the original"
00:31:02,00:31:07,"brand are really annoyed about. Oh, okay. So there's a film called Flight, which stars Denzel"
00:31:07,00:31:13,Washington as an alcoholic pilot who somehow he manages to pull off a crazy movie. The plane's
00:31:13,00:31:18,"about to crash to you to, you know, it's all gone wrong on the plane. And he manages to fly it in"
00:31:18,00:31:22,upside down and then land it the right way up at the very last moment. I've got to say the first
00:31:22,00:31:28,five minutes of that movie is one of the best things I've ever seen. It's so tense. It's so amazing.
00:31:28,00:31:32,"Okay. And the rest is terrible, right? You didn't want to say it out loud. I've seen it too. It's"
00:31:32,00:31:38,"shit. Damn, things. The film is bad. God, it tells you not to watch it, especially now the ending"
00:31:38,00:31:42,"has been spoiled anyway. Well, the rest of the film is, I gather, just a lengthy legal process"
00:31:42,00:31:47,about whether he was right to save the plane. It's a legal drama. Imagine if you got to watch
00:31:47,00:31:58,that film and you're five minutes late. That would be the worst together. Oh my God. They should
00:31:58,00:32:03,"make it into a short and release it in short films. Anyway, it's Robert Zemeckis who gave us"
00:32:03,00:32:10,"back to the future. He is an alcoholic pilot, Denzel Washington. The character, sorry, not"
00:32:10,00:32:15,"Robert Zemeckis, not Denzel Washington, the character, but he drinks Budweiser and a vodka"
00:32:15,00:32:20,"that Budweiser own either while he's flying the plane or shortly before. I mean, you guys have"
00:32:20,00:32:24,"seen the film, so you'll know. But Budweiser were furious about this and they said, ""Can you not show"
00:32:24,00:32:29,"this drunk pilot singing a bud before he flies the plane?"" And they refused. They said, ""There's"
00:32:29,00:32:34,"nothing you can do."" But it's so, that happens. Sometimes movies do have to buckle to these"
00:32:34,00:32:38,"bigger companies. So Slumdog Millionaire, when Danny Boyle made that, he gave an interview where he"
00:32:38,00:32:44,"talked about the fact that he had some criminal gangs drinking Coca-Cola at one point, ice cold"
00:32:44,00:32:51,"Coca-Cola and, I don't know what to say. Are you personally sponsored by Coca-Cola today?"
00:32:51,00:33:00,"Wow. It was a refreshing ice cold Coca-Cola. So, yeah, available in all shops. But yeah,"
00:33:00,00:33:04,they're drinking in that and Coca-Cola took a sort of stand against it and so they had to paint
00:33:04,00:33:10,it out in the post-production of it. Slumdog Millionaire was the most bizarre film. I hadn't
00:33:10,00:33:14,"realised this, but obviously at the time it was so huge and it won the Oscar, didn't it? And it was"
00:33:14,00:33:18,massive. I hadn't realised it was made by the same company that makes Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.
00:33:18,00:33:25,So it was one huge piece of product placement. Wow. Yeah. Isn't that Jasper Carrot who makes that?
00:33:25,00:33:31,"Yes, it is. It is. Well, he wrote Slumdog Millionaire. It might be. It's called Kellador."
00:33:31,00:33:35,"Yes. He's pretty hands off with it, but yeah, he's a direct beneficiary of both those things."
00:33:35,00:33:41,"I think it's Kellador, isn't it? It is. It's a company called Kellador. Of course it's like"
00:33:41,00:33:46,Kellador. I don't think it's deliberately named to be like the Kellador. It might be. It's
00:33:46,00:33:51,Jasper Carrot. He does love his punks. What's the metaphor behind that? Don't look behind the
00:33:51,00:33:58,Kellador. It's actually Jasper Carrot. Any international listeners who are wondering who
00:33:58,00:34:03,"Jasper Carrot is, there's no time. So, Kellador made this, who made Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"
00:34:03,00:34:08,and then they decided to make Slumdog to sort of advertise Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.
00:34:08,00:34:14,And the screenwriter for Slumdog Millionaire was one of the co-creators of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.
00:34:14,00:34:18,"But the only thing that they stipulated was that at the end, and this is a spoiler where he's"
00:34:18,00:34:24,"being accused of cheating, the hero is being accused of cheating, the host of Millionaire sort of"
00:34:24,00:34:28,"tortures him backstage. And at that point, they said, we can't have it look like the show is"
00:34:28,00:34:32,torturing this boy because that's going to make us look bad. So it's just got to be the host.
00:34:32,00:34:35,So it's like Chris Tarrant's got out on a limb. It wasn't Chris Tarrant in the film.
00:34:35,00:34:40,"Again, any international listeners who were clinging on after Jasper Carrot were now given"
00:34:40,00:34:48,"up at Chris Tarrant. So, hang on, wow, torture equipment does the host of Who Wants to Be a"
00:34:48,00:34:52,"Millionaire have access to backstage? Like, you couldn't do more than a quick Chinese burn or a"
00:34:52,00:34:58,"wedgie, could you? He's got that tension music. Yeah, he's got a super long advert break without"
00:34:58,00:35:04,"telling him. I found out, just looking at product placement stuff, I found out one of the first"
00:35:04,00:35:12,ever examples of product placement on a podcast. Okay. So this was in 2005. There was a show called
00:35:12,00:35:17,The Dawn and Drew Show. Okay. And it was the newspapers at the time had to explain what a
00:35:17,00:35:23,"podcast was, which is the report I read said a podcast is, or this particular podcast is a"
00:35:23,00:35:27,program filled with strong language that is available only in a digital format and downloaded
00:35:27,00:35:32,on iPods and other devices that play MP3 files. Okay. So that's what a podcast is. And this one
00:35:32,00:35:38,"was The Dawn and Drew Show. And it was sponsored, it was product placement did by Durex. Okay. And"
00:35:38,00:35:43,Durex had inserted their product into the show because it was hosted by a husband and wife.
00:35:43,00:35:49,And the show featured the husband and the wife and their dog Hercules tasting flavoured condoms.
00:35:49,00:35:55,That was the first ever product placement podcast. Okay. The firm said they were delighted and they
00:35:55,00:35:59,"said, this is quotes exactly how we want to position the branch."
00:35:59,00:36:02,Were they condoms for dogs and humans alike?
00:36:02,00:36:07,"Like, no, because you'd have to have a dog meat flavoured condom."
00:36:07,00:36:10,"Oh, they don't love strawberry today."
00:36:10,00:36:14,"Oh my God, that's incredible."
00:36:14,00:36:18,"So anyway, I'm just saying we've got further to sink before we hit rock bottom."
00:36:18,00:36:24,"You know, your, this has not been a product placement, but we're recording this podcast on"
00:36:24,00:36:26,Mac computer. And we're all good guys.
00:36:26,00:36:32,"Now, if you were to close that and don't close it because we might lose the recording,"
00:36:32,00:36:36,but you would see that the Apple is upside down as you're looking at it. So maybe if you half
00:36:36,00:36:42,"close it, you see it's kind of upside down as you're looking. Now, the reason that is is for"
00:36:42,00:36:50,"product placement reasons. So it was in Legally Blonde, which is a properly great film. She is"
00:36:50,00:36:55,"using an Apple Mac, but the Apple is upside down to what we have it today, because that's the way"
00:36:55,00:36:59,"it used to be. Because it makes much more sense that if you have it closed and you're looking at it,"
00:36:59,00:37:04,the Apple is the right way up. And that's how it used to be. But then there was an employee
00:37:04,00:37:08,"called Joe Moreno who said to Steve Jobs, look, if we're going to put these in movies, what we need"
00:37:08,00:37:12,"is when it's open and you're looking at it, the Apple is the right way up. So they changed it."
00:37:12,00:37:16,"Or if someone's just like watching you in a cafe, of course you've got to put it the right"
00:37:16,00:37:18,way out for the people looking at it. Not the one who owns it already.
00:37:18,00:37:23,That's really interesting. So basically the Apple on your Apple Mac is not for you. It's for
00:37:23,00:37:30,"everyone else. Wow. Some advertisers, this is sort of the next step they're doing for advertising"
00:37:30,00:37:35,and things. So advertisers in soap operas are now selling billboards inside the fictional locations
00:37:35,00:37:41,"in the soap operas. So Coronation Street is a fictional street, but it's a fictional street"
00:37:41,00:37:47,with advertising billboards on it. And jewellery shops and other shops are buying up advertising
00:37:47,00:37:52,space in fictional Coronation Street. And there's a new thing also that other advertisers are doing
00:37:52,00:37:58,where you know you'll be able to digitally alter what viewers see on screen when they're streaming.
00:37:58,00:38:05,"So different people see different things. So if you are watching, let's say you drink whiskey"
00:38:05,00:38:09,"and your TV knows that you drink whiskey, there might be billboards for whiskey brands in the"
00:38:09,00:38:17,background. Whereas if you... But what if you're a person who like secretly buys dog meat flavored
00:38:17,00:38:26,condoms? And you're watching Coronation Street with your parents. That's such a good point.
00:38:26,00:38:33,That's such a good point. The whole family looking at each other suspiciously. It's like an Agatha
00:38:33,00:38:39,"Christie. Yeah, exactly. Wow. Well, they might do it based on the time of day even. So if you're"
00:38:39,00:38:43,"watching late at night, there'll be adverts for... That's what y'all do. Watch Coronation Street"
00:38:43,00:38:48,"late at night. Absolutely. Have another late night set. Yeah, there'll be adverts for I guess late"
00:38:48,00:38:54,"night stuff like swearing or cocaine. Well, if you're watching in the morning, there'll just be"
00:38:54,00:39:01,adverts for cereal and orange juice. Or whiskey. Just one ironic thing about this fact is that
00:39:01,00:39:08,"apples are a sign that someone's a villain. What? In films, apparently people have spotted this."
00:39:08,00:39:13,"If you're the baddie, you're always eating an apple. Not always. This is a few cross films."
00:39:13,00:39:19,"Yep. So, Mr Bond. The bad guys in Doctor Who do that, don't they? Because an apple a day keeps"
00:39:19,00:39:26,the doctor away. This is true. Please send in more if you've seen them. But Draco Malfoy does it.
00:39:26,00:39:30,Jeffrey Rush in Poe Rats of the Caribbean. It's kind of crunches down an apple. Colin Farrell
00:39:30,00:39:36,when he's playing a vampire and something or other. And it's got a name. It's the arrogant apple.
00:39:36,00:39:41,Sometimes it's really just to show your dominance because it's kind of showing you're so aloof.
00:39:41,00:39:45,I can eat an apple as well as talking to you. I don't give enough of a crap about what you're
00:39:45,00:39:50,saying to stop eating my apple. I wonder if there's like the history of the poisoned apple in fairy
00:39:50,00:39:56,"tales and things. That's been theorized on the internet, James. You should check the internet"
00:39:56,00:40:04,out for more on that. Garden of Eden? Again. And apple was eaten there. It's all on the forums.
00:40:04,00:40:08,"It sounds like we could think of everything on the internet, Anna, so I'm not worried."
00:40:08,00:40:18,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get"
00:40:18,00:40:22,"in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over the course of this podcast,"
00:40:22,00:40:28,"we can be found on our Twitter accounts. I'm on @Sriberland, James. At James Harkin. Andy."

00:40:34,00:40:38,"group account at no such thing or our website, no such thing as a fish.com. Why not check the"
00:40:38,00:40:43,internet out as well while you're there? And we'll be back again next week with another episode. We'll
00:40:43,00:40:54,"see you then. Goodbye. Anyway, I was sponsored this week of the new Durex range of pedigree chum."
00:40:55,00:41:08,Stop the podcast.
