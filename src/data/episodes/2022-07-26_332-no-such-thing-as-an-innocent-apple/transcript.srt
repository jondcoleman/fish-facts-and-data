00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 Hi everyone, James here. Now, before we start this week's show, I just want to tell you one

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,760
 little thing about it, and that is that it was actually recorded quite a long time ago,

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,440
 all the way back in February, in fact. And the reason I want to tell you that is because,

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,080
 first of all, it's obviously in the office and we're all still in our homes at the moment.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,320
 And also because there'll be a few things that we might say in there that might really,

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,000
 perhaps, give away that we didn't record it this week, for instance. I do talk about Jasper

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,800
 Carrot for a while, and that probably would have been a dated reference any time that we'd

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,520
 said it in the last five years. But hey, when you listen, you'll get the idea. So enjoy the show

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,200
 and just marvel about how young we all sounded back in February. Okay, on with the podcast.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:01:06,000
 [Music]

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,520
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,720
 you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,680
 Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anna Chazinski. And once again, we have gathered around the

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,480
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order,

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:33,280
 here we go. Starting with you, Anna. My fact this week is that in the 18th century, women

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,280
 expressed their political beliefs by wearing decorative stickers on their faces. Wow. That's

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,280
 cool. What kind of stickers did they say, like, vote labor or? Yeah, screw you, Boris. I just

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,000
 rolled all over their forehead. Very prescient of them. Women have amazing foresight.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,880
 And full heads. Sticker, huh? No, this one's so facial stickers were this huge fashion for about

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,280
 sort of 200 years. And about the turn of the 18th century, they suddenly became political.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,960
 And so there was one commentator, for instance, who said that he went to the opera and he saw

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,400
 two parties of very fine women, as he said, arranged in battle formation against each other.

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,680
 And he said, one group was wearing patches and stickers on the left side of their foreheads

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
 and the other on the right. It became apparent they were wig supporters and Tory supporters.

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,400
 And I looked into this and this was a thing. So it wasn't the stickers were just like little,

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,920
 like beauty spots or something, but it was where you wore them that was important. Is that it?

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,880
 Yes, that seems to be it. Yes. So they started off as for decoration, but it got to the extent

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,920
 that there were some marriage contracts where women would insist before they married their husband

29
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,720
 that regardless of the husband's political opinions, the wife should be able to patch as she pleased.

30
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,320
 And so you would have one or two things, but did it get to the point where people,

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,240
 you know, when you see full face tattoos, did you ever see people just completely?

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,840
 You would see not completely the full face, but you might see lots of these like fake beauty spots.

33
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,480
 And you could supposedly identify prostitutes because their faces had so many of these patches

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,720
 on them. Was that a sign of being sexy, though, having lots of stickers?

35
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,960
 Well, having one sticker was supposed to be. And the reason is supposedly Venus,

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,280
 the goddess of beauty, she had one mole on her face. And it was by that one imperfection

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,440
 that you could see how beautiful the rest of her face was. And the idea was that they were kind

38
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,000
 of copying that. And by having like one little beauty spot, it would show the paleness of your

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
 skin, perhaps, or, you know, show off the rest of your skin. So if you have lots and lots of

40
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,520
 stickers, that means you're really, really beautiful because you've got you need so many

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,080
 imperfections to disguise how fit you are. You wouldn't believe what I look like without

42
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,120
 these stickers on, because I look really nice. It could have been that you are covering the

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:04:00,720
 symptoms of STDs. It's a real gamble. So sorry, I didn't think that we had glue sticker technology

44
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,880
 in the, when is this, 18th century? We had glue. Sure. Okay. Were they kind of fuzzy felt

45
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,720
 stickers, that kind of thing? I actually don't think we had fuzzy felt. They would be made of

46
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,000
 various things. So they could be made of silk or taffeta or leather sometimes. And then they'd

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,440
 have mouth fur, apparently. Mouth fur? On your tongue? No. I suddenly developed a lisp.

48
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,960
 It sounded like mouse from where I was sat, but. Okay. Oh, mouse fur. Okay. I heard mouth as well.

49
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,160
 Okay. Right in and tell us what you heard. So, and then they'd have on the back, often a surface

50
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,200
 that you could lick. So women tended to take them out of their handbags and lick them to attach

51
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,120
 them to their face. So you get very thin paper that does that. Well, they had adhesive. So they'd

52
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,760
 just stick it on with some glue. Yeah. But sometimes the adhesive wasn't so great. So there was an

53
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,400
 article in the spectator that spoke about a woman who had a beauty spot on her forehead, but by the

54
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:02,560
 end of the evening, it had gone to her chin. They got more and more elaborate as well, didn't they?

55
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,320
 Is it caught on? So I think it started in France and the French called them moosh, which is for

56
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,120
 flies because they look like little flies landing on your face. But yeah, they expanded to be weird

57
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,560
 shapes. So by the end of the 18th century, you'd have them cut into stars or sort of moons or

58
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,760
 crown shapes or any shape you wanted, really. You still get those, don't you? On small children.

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:32,640
 Adults who like a bit of fun. Yeah. Why are you wearing that with the puppy dog on the middle

60
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,600
 of your forehead? I was so considering doing it this morning by bottling out of it. But yeah,

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,360
 no, you do get them like little kind of, I don't know, stars and yeah, I've been very brave at the

62
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:51,120
 dentist today. Stick those on your forehead though, didn't I? No, actually, I've got, I used to have

63
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,720
 one of those, but it was a safety pin one. So that's not for the forehead. That's for the clothes.

64
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,320
 Safety pin, really? Oh, it was a badge. I'm describing a badge. But what's interesting about

65
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,960
 that is I think you're only brave at the dentist once. So you don't need it to be a badge. You

66
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,880
 only need it to be a sticker. Do you know what? You're right. I'm confusing it with my I've been

67
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,840
 to a party at Pizza Hut badge, which is a badge because that's the thing that lasts a life if

68
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,080
 you go to a party at Pizza Hut in the early 90s. Yeah, you want to show off about that, don't you?

69
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,680
 That's why you wear badges. You don't want to be wearing a badge that says I've been brave at the

70
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,200
 dentist just to show off. You feel pretty silly at the military parade, wouldn't you, next to all

71
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,360
 the other medals? Just being brave at the dentist award. I got this one for bravery.

72
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,920
 I saw there's some drawings that people have done of some of the designs and there was a

73
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,760
 horse and carriage one and I think that's been questioned a bit. That was satire, was it?

74
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,080
 That was someone taking a piss out of the power of said they've gone. I thought that was real too.

75
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,000
 Yeah, I was really hoping that that would be because I just thought how interesting heads

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,320
 must have been back then. I don't know what you mean. Well, just wait a minute. If you're sitting

77
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,360
 on the tube and someone sat across from me with a horse and carriage drawn on their head and they

78
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,320
 had other cartoons, you know, I wouldn't need the paper. But people still have tattoos these

79
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,160
 days. So do you just, when you're sat on the tube, just read people's tattoos? I do, but they give

80
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,400
 me a look that says I'm not friendly. Oh, well, this is the thing about other kinds of stickers

81
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,600
 is that they can be indicators of how friendly or not someone is. So bumper stickers, if people

82
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,080
 have bumper stickers on their car, they tend to be more aggressive and territorial drivers.

83
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,640
 Yeah, makes sense. Yeah, study in 2008 by Colorado State University and they surveyed people saying,

84
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,880
 do you have bumper stickers on your car? And do you drive like a bastard? And basically,

85
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,880
 people who said yes to one said yes to the other. They said, yeah, I drive more territorially,

86
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,080
 more aggressively, I do not respond constructively on the road when people get in my way.

87
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,520
 And how often are these the baby on board stickers? Well, I read that article and actually it said

88
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,840
 that it doesn't matter what's on the sticker, right? So you might have a sticker that says

89
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,360
 everyone needs to be kind to each other and you're still going to drive like a maniac.

90
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,360
 Yeah, so baby on board as well. Yeah, more likely to be aggressive.

91
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,280
 Just one more thing on an alternative use for stickers for yourself for decoration is to cover

92
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,440
 blemishes. And so I think that's that's sort of where facial stickers might have come from

93
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,600
 originally. But men wore them quite a lot to cover blemishes or to accentuate them. And so

94
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,160
 if men had been to war, for instance, it became quite common for them to come back and they'd

95
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,920
 put a scar sticker over their scar. I think if a scar started to fade or something,

96
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,080
 then you'd put a big black scar there. And so there's, for instance, there's a bit in all's

97
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
 well that ends well, which now makes sense. If you know where Bertram comes back from war,

98
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,800
 and it says he's got a patch of velvet on his face, and it's unclear if there's a scar underneath.

99
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,880
 And it was sort of a thing that people did if they hadn't really seen much military action,

100
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,840
 and they were a bit of a coward, and they'd run away at the first sign anyway,

101
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,080
 is that they'd suddenly put a big blemish on their face to imply that they'd been shot in the head.

102
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,720
 Wow, that's amazing. I've got a little scar on my face. Maybe I'll try and accentuate it.

103
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,080
 Have you? With some mouse fur. I want to do one of the sides. I'm not sure which side.

104
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,880
 Oh yeah, little one, yeah, yeah. It's somewhere you got shot in the Civil War,

105
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,440
 isn't it? Obscene bumper stickers can sometimes be a matter for the law.

106
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,480
 Okay, so there are all these lawsuits that happen in the USA over whether you're allowed a

107
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,240
 particular bumper sticker or not, or whether it's basically creating a public disturbance just by

108
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,560
 having it on your car. So in 2008, a guy went to the Georgia Supreme Court because he had a

109
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,400
 "Shit happens" bumper sticker, and he won. And then, more recently, this bit is very rude by the way,

110
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,000
 but the police in Florida arrested and charged a man who had a bumper sticker which said,

111
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,680
 "I eat ass." And that was really big and it's right in the middle of his back windscreen as well,

112
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,160
 so there's no way if you're driving along that you won't see it.

113
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
 And was he referring to donkey meat, do we know?

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,720
 I'm not sure. That wasn't his defence, actually.

115
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,040
 I mean, it absolutely should have been. But the police pulled him over and they said,

116
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,640
 "Can you amend it?" So it wasn't offensive. And he said, "Well, how do you suggest I do that?"

117
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,600
 And they said, "Can you remove the second S from ass?" So it would be, "I eat ass."

118
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,560
 But then the grammar police come at you on the other side.

119
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,720
 Guys, who's the grandfather, the god of stickers?

120
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,440
 The god of stickers. The god of stickers. You all know this.

121
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,040
 Football albums. Panini. Oh, no, I was thinking of Mr Avery.

122
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,280
 Oh, Avery, yeah. Oh, Avery. Stanton.

123
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,360
 Sorry. Well, because you never do any of the office admin, Andy,

124
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,320
 you are not familiar with Avery stickers, but those of us who post letters every once in a while.

125
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,160
 This feels like more of a grudge. It feels like this whole fact has been building up to a grudge.

126
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,040
 No, so Stanton Avery, mate, was the inventor of the self-adhesive sticker, as in you didn't need

127
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,440
 to lick it, you didn't need to add glue to it. And he still dominates the label market today,

128
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,760
 so I was looking into him. So he built his first sticker machine.

129
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,600
 I love this, by marrying together a motor from a washing machine and a sewing machine,

130
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,160
 sewing machine parts. So we smushed them together and generated a shed load of stickers.

131
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,000
 His company was initially called Cum Clean Products, spelling cum K-U-M,

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,760
 which I think is a good thing was changed. How did he make his glue?

133
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,320
 He was actually very cagey about the process. He was so pretty tired.

134
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:31,120
 He was super poor. And so he really like dragged himself up from the bottom. He lived in a rented

135
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,240
 chicken coop. He couldn't even afford the deposit on a chicken coop. Did he pay the chickens?

136
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,840
 I don't know if the chickens own the coop. I think they were also renting.

137
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,720
 Oh wow. Terrible flatmates. I think I get eggs every morning.

138
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,360
 Do you want to eat an egg if your flatmate has just laid it before your horrified eyes?

139
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,760
 I refuse to eat food that's come out of any of my friends arses.

140
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:08,800
 That's amazing. Yeah, it's so cool. He could have written, I eat and then in brackets,

141
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,960
 eggs that have come out of a chicken. Clothes, brackets, ass.

142
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,360
 Another strong defense. So many arguments are going out before.

143
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,520
 So he tried a bunch of business. How did he get a washing machine in the chicken coop?

144
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,160
 So I think this was post chicken coop. And he got it because he married a slightly wealthier lady

145
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,600
 who lent him a bit of money. And he thought, I need a washing machine.

146
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
 We got back to your place tonight. Chickens out tonight.

147
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,440
 So anyway. Did she invite them to the hen do?

148
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,280
 You got laid that night.

149
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:59,200
 Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that the very

150
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,720
 first print run of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn had to be pulped after a bookstore owner

151
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,440
 discovered someone had sneaked a drawing of a penis into one of the illustrations.

152
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,200
 The first suspect has to be the illustrator, is she?

153
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,400
 Yes, we genuinely don't know. We don't know if it was the illustrator. We don't know if it was

154
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,080
 the photo engraver at the actual factory where they were printing the book. What we do know is

155
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,640
 when these books came out at the end of Chapter 32, Huck Finn is meeting his aunt Sally and Uncle

156
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:37,280
 Silas. And Uncle Silas has a big erect penis drawn in in the illustration itself. And as a result,

157
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:44,640
 30,000 copies had to be pulped. And did they definitely check the plot and they don't,

158
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,160
 it's not part of the storyline that references Uncle Silas's erect penis?

159
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,880
 Weirdly. Weirdly. I read the book and I can confirm there isn't a bit where

160
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
 Uncle Silas has an erection and is showing it off to his family.

161
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,960
 That must have been very disappointing when you got to the end of that.

162
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,920
 It's the only reason I bought the book in the first place.

163
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,600
 So this is obviously, it's a very important book in American literature. Ernest Hemingway said

164
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,360
 all modern American literature comes from one book and it's called Huckleberry Finn. And the

165
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,920
 idea was it was the first book that used the vernacular of Americans. At that point Americans

166
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,520
 were really writing in the tone of British and European authors, not using the day-to-day language

167
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:30,880
 and he kind of set the tone. Unfortunately, it's also a book that's laced with racism and that's

168
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,320
 caused huge problems basically since publication. It's not a book that's sort of not been controversial

169
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,600
 throughout the years. The language use is difficult and racist and we should say that it's set,

170
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,840
 Mark Twain wrote it in the 80s, but it's set about 40 years earlier in the 1840s, isn't it?

171
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,640
 And the main plot of Huckleberry Finn, for anyone who hasn't read it, is basically it's about Huck Finn

172
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:56,720
 who is this kind of poor kid who held a seat 12 or 13 and he runs away along with a runaway slave

173
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,360
 who is called Jim and they run away together and they are good friends and Jim is a very

174
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,080
 sympathetic character but at the same time very problematically drawn. Yeah, one of the...

175
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,040
 Not drawn with an erect penis like Uncle Silas, we should say.

176
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,160
 People have objected to stuff other than that so it was extremely controversial as soon as it was

177
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,280
 published largely because of the kind of crudeness of some of the language and that was written in

178
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:25,040
 this native dialect. It wasn't just like ordinary American dialect, it was proper Mississippi 1840s

179
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,800
 dialect and it was banned for bad grammar and employment of inelegant expressions.

180
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,200
 Things like in 1905 a Brooklyn library banned it because Huck not only itched but he scratched.

181
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,880
 So apparently that's disgusting and he said "sweet" when he should have said "perspiration".

182
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,960
 So Mark Twain had been kind of unhappy with the way that publishing had been going and he

183
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,160
 decided he didn't want to have normal publishers like before and get the money that way. He wanted

184
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,000
 to have a subscription service so he sent people door to door with like, you know, the first chapter

185
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,880
 and said, "Look, there's this new book coming out. How do you fancy buying it and then we'll send you

186
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,440
 all the chapters in future?" And he basically, because he did this, it meant he could have full

187
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,040
 control of it, which meant he had full control of all of the illustrations and it meant that when

188
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,440
 the illustrator kept sending him stuff he was like, "Don't like that, don't like that, don't like that,

189
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:24,720
 don't like that, do like that." Love that penis! So is that maybe why they pranked him? That's one

190
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,480
 theory that the illustrator hated him so much because he kept asking him to change things

191
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,440
 that he's like, "Right, fine." But they offered a massive reward to the press men working on the

192
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,720
 novel and a $500 reward, which would have been a lot of money today and no one fessed up, so we

193
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:46,160
 still, there's no culprit. And is the investigation still open? I think the office, the reward is

194
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,960
 still available. He had a terrible relationship with his sort of typesetters and proofreaders

195
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,960
 and everyone like that, didn't he? Which might be why they were so pissed off with him. He hated them

196
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,400
 and it does sound like they kept on trying to improve his punctuation and grammar, which was

197
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,760
 deliberately vernacular. And once upon getting a text back and seeing the corrections that had been

198
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,560
 made, he wrote to a friend, "I've telegraphed orders to have the proofreader shot without giving him

199
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,920
 time to pray." So it was tense, I think. If someone wrote that about, "Hey, I draw a penis on their picture."

200
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:20,160
 It wasn't the most successful book that he published with that firm. So the first two

201
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,040
 books that that firm published were Huckleberry Finn and The Memoirs of Ulysses S Grant,

202
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,520
 ex-president, and it was pretty much the last thing Grant did was write this book.

203
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,160
 And it was so successful that he gave Grant's widow the biggest ever royalty check in American

204
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,160
 publishing history. It was absolutely massive. And it was thanks to that door-to-door technique

205
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,760
 that James mentioned, because it was war veterans. So it was silver war veterans going door-to-door

206
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,880
 selling the book. And that's a pretty strong sell, you know? I might be wrong in saying this, but

207
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,240
 from the story that I know about that, it's that when Ulysses S Grant died, his wife was really

208
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,240
 struggling financially and was not given any help from anyone. And Mark Twain published the book

209
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,360
 and gave her that high amount of royalties before he knew it was going to be successful so that she

210
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,680
 had money to live off for the rest of her life. Apparently, it's an extraordinary book, that

211
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,520
 autobiography. Really? Yeah. I've read so many things about it being the best book by anyone in

212
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,400
 government ever as a solid, it's just incredible, apparently. Surely not better than the art of

213
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,360
 the deal. Surely. Surely not better than Jacob Rees Mogg's book about the Victorians.

214
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,120
 Can't be better than that, can it? Now, if we want to talk about offensive landings and things.

215
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,920
 Mark Twain wrote the first book on a typewriter in America. There's a bit of dispute over whether

216
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,440
 it was Tom Sawyer or another one of his books. It's usually credited as Tom Sawyer. But he

217
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,320
 used to love writing on a typewriter and no one really had it at the time. So people used to write

218
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,560
 him letters and he would write letters back on his typewriter. They would then write back to him

219
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,120
 asking about the typewriter and that got so annoying with so many people writing back to him

220
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,280
 asking him, "Holy moly, what is this? This is incredible," that he stopped writing letters

221
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,000
 using his typewriter. Really? She's got inundated. Yeah. I really love his correspondence because

222
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,600
 he didn't really much like getting them a lot of the time, did he? I read one that he got in 1901

223
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,720
 and the letter said, "Dear Mr. Mark Twain, I am a little girl six years old. I have read

224
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,520
 your stories ever since they first came out. I have a cat named Kitty and a dog named Pop.

225
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,480
 I like to guess puzzles. Did you write a story for the Herald competition? I hope you will answer

226
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,120
 my letter. Yours truly Augusta Kortrecht." To which he replied, "Well, no." He didn't reply. He just

227
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,080
 wrote a comment on it saying, "Labor tempt of a middle-aged liar to pull an autograph."

228
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:57,040
 He invented one game for kids, which I think sounds pretty cool. He measured out a 817 foot path

229
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:03,920
 of his driveway and he marked every single foot and that was supposed to be a year and it was

230
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,360
 the year from 1066 when William the Conqueror arrived in Britain and the idea is you would

231
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,280
 walk along the path and at each point when there was a new king or queen in England or Britain,

232
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,680
 then you would stake in the ground and you would be like, "Oh, this is Edward the first,

233
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:25,280
 this is Henry the second, blah, blah, blah." It was a way of having fun but also learning

234
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,200
 your kings and queens because in those days education was very much rote learning. You

235
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,080
 just had to learn all these things and this was a fun way of doing it.

236
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,640
 Or a very annoyingly slow way of getting to the front door after a long day in the office.

237
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,360
 But he turned it into a board game, didn't he? Or he tried to.

238
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,200
 It sounds really complicated. I didn't fully understand it even after reading it.

239
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,360
 I thought it sounded quite, it sounded a bit like battleship. Basically, it was another

240
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,920
 sort of history date memorization game and essentially you'd have a chart with a series of

241
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:01,200
 dates on it and each player would say a date. You say 1918 and then the other player has to

242
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,120
 say an event that happened on that date to say the end of the First World War. See,

243
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,040
 I cleverly chose my date in advance so I'd have something to say for it.

244
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,960
 I mean, you also chose a date that was nearly 10 years after Twain died when no one could possibly

245
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,240
 have guessed what was going to happen. True. But then a player puts a pin in that date if they

246
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,080
 get it right and if they don't get it right, they don't get a pin and I guess when you've

247
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,360
 covered up all your dates you've won. Sounds quite fun for a nerd.

248
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,920
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

249
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,280
 My fact is that before vaccination was invented, the main method of inoculation against smallpox

250
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,000
 was to powder scabs and blow them up your nose.

251
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,160
 Lovely. Or to get someone else to blow them up your nose.

252
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:52,320
 It's very hard to blow up your own nose. And this was how inoculation worked for a long time.

253
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,560
 It was done in China a thousand years ago. This was the method they knew about this.

254
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,720
 And it did work, didn't it? It worked reasonably well. So if you were healthy,

255
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:10,240
 you would get some smallpox scabs and you would leave them for a little while because fresh

256
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,320
 scabs were likely to give you the infection properly. So they would be dried, aged smallpox

257
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,560
 scabs and they would be powdered up and then they would be blown up your nose with a special

258
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,440
 silver blowpipe for the procedure as well. The Chinese doctors had special blowpipes to do this.

259
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,680
 And then apparently the right nostril was used for boys and the left for girls.

260
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,200
 And you would maybe get some mild symptoms and some people did actually just then get

261
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,880
 full blown smallpox. But most people then got it, you know, some mild symptoms and then were

262
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,600
 resistant to any following exposure. There's a low percentage, wasn't it?

263
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,840
 So this was a really decent way of doing it before we had the method of vaccination.

264
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,720
 And we didn't know about this, is that right? It took about 700 years to get over.

265
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,200
 And it works by the same method as vaccination, right? Which is that it's an attenuated or weakened

266
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,040
 version of the disease in a scab. And your body then makes antibodies that can fight against that

267
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,880
 and then it can fight against the main thing, is that right? There was another version where

268
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,560
 you had some powdered scab as well or you had some pus from a smallpox pustule and you would

269
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,440
 make a little scratch on your skin and then you would just pour that pus or, you know,

270
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,200
 rub that powdered scab into your skin and that worked too. And that's called variolation

271
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,920
 because variola was the Latin for smallpox. In 2011, the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond

272
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:42,560
 had some things from its collection. And one of them was a letter from the 1870s that had

273
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,160
 a smallpox scab in it. And the idea was that the person who wrote the letter in the 19th

274
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,920
 century was sending it to his father. It had been taken from the arm of a child and his father was

275
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:00,560
 going to make it into dust and inoculate people. But then it never got to the recipient. And so

276
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,920
 they just found this letter. And of course, immediately, the Census for Disease Control came

277
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,920
 in the hazmat suits and said, holy shit, you don't need to be having this, that the public can see

278
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,680
 this because smallpox has been eradicated, basically, hasn't it? And so, yeah, in the end,

279
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,240
 there was some of the virus on this scab still, but it wasn't deadly enough. I mean,

280
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,640
 it must have attenuated pretty hard by that time. How when was it? It was from 1876 and they found

281
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,560
 it in 2011. Wow. That is really spooky, finding it and not knowing what it is. You just think you

282
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,280
 found a little button or something. Or maybe it's like a little sticker to put on your face.

283
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,480
 But all these doctors had their own different methods of doing variolation. And there were

284
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,000
 some celebrity doctors in Britain in the 17th, 18th century who worked this out. So have you

285
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,320
 heard of Johnny Notions? No. Johnny Notions. Sounds like he's got some weird ideas.

286
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,160
 Well, he was a Scottish doctor and he had a really successful method for variolating,

287
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,440
 because he would collect the pus, first of all. And everyone had their own method of making it

288
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,800
 a bit less deadly, basically. So he would dry it with peat smoke. So he had a lovely sort of

289
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,560
 smoky flavour for the pus, very nice. And then he would bury it in the ground between sheets of

290
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:22,720
 glass, okay, with some campfire. And then he would keep it there for seven or eight years.

291
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,840
 This is like he's making a whiskey, isn't it? Yeah, in genuine years. And then he would

292
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,720
 insert it and he would then put a cabbage leaf on top as a plaster. And this was apparently a

293
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,720
 really good way of doing it. And it just gave you the nice amount. I suppose it does take the edge

294
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,840
 off the urn pus, doesn't it? It's a nice, peachy, cabergy flavour to it.

295
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,560
 Apparently, you were more likely to get a job if you could be seen to have smallpox scars,

296
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,520
 because then the suggestion was, oh, great, you can work with us. You're not going to pass it on.

297
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:59,200
 You've had it already. That was seen as a sort of great, safe workmate. So two of the earliest

298
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,360
 people who worked with inoculation were Robert Koch in Germany and Louis Pasteur in France.

299
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:14,960
 And they fell out with each other because Pasteur once was doing a talk and he used the phrase

300
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:22,160
 "Rekui Allemande", which means a collection of German writing, but the translator translated

301
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:30,240
 it as "Augui Allemande", which means German arrogance. And so Koch never forgave him for

302
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,480
 that because he thought that Pasteur was calling him arrogant. Although I think that before that,

303
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,960
 they loathe each other. If you read the dialogues that they had, the letters they wrote each other,

304
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,480
 it's just basically spitting with rage, you know, Koch writing letters to Pasteur accusing him

305
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,080
 of stealing all of his ideas and vice versa, saying you're a fraud, you know, really foul language,

306
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,400
 because there was this huge fight basically when we suddenly discovered the power of

307
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,440
 the idea of vaccination between a few scientists, wasn't there?

308
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:06,800
 So that was after Jenna? Yes, it was. So Edward Jenna is the person who kind of we

309
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,880
 give the, we say, created vaccinations today, right? He got it from milkmates.

310
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,160
 Did he? Yeah, because there were milkmates near him and he noticed that they got a thing called

311
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:24,080
 cowpox, which is a disease that cows got, and they would only get one single pustule on their hands,

312
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,000
 which is where they've been touching the cows because of all the milking. And he theorized,

313
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,800
 maybe this is a milder version of smallpox. So then he did this amazing gamble, Jenna,

314
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:41,200
 he took some pus from a milkmate and he injected it into a child. Yeah. And six, yeah,

315
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,120
 not his child, by the way, although he did also do it with his own child actually later on, so fair

316
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,360
 play. I think when he knew it worked. And then he, six weeks later, he injected the child with full

317
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,680
 blown smallpox. And he didn't know how it worked. And yeah, and then, but later in life, they became

318
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,680
 friends. So, yeah, James Phipps, he was the son of Edward Jenna's gardener, which if it hadn't

319
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,280
 worked, would have made the gardening very, very awkward, I think for a long time. I think he would

320
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:14,960
 have ruined your rose bush after that. He had smallpox when he was a child, Jenna. And one of the

321
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,920
 reasons that he kind of went into getting rid of it later is because he had such a bad time of it.

322
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:27,440
 He was varialated. So they gave him some of the pus or some scabs or something. But he was prepared

323
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,040
 for that by being starved, purged and bled and locked in a stable with other infected boys.

324
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,640
 With other infected boys? Yeah. So they kind of varialated all these people, gave them like very

325
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,600
 mild symptoms and then put them all in a stable. Meanwhile, Stanton Avery's outside of a checking

326
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:53,520
 coop. Don't know you're born, mate. Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show. And that is

327
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,360
 James. Okay, my fact this week is that you can tell if a movie character is a goodie or a baddie

328
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:06,720
 by the kind of phone they use. That sucks now that I know that and I'm watching movies. I know,

329
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,320
 sorry, this is not just a spoiler of one movie, this is a spoiler of all movies. So this came up

330
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,200
 in my RSS feed. And thanks to the blog Nitarama, which I follow. And it was an interview with

331
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,080
 Rian Johnson, who is the director of the film Knives Out. And he said that Apple have forbid

332
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,120
 filmmakers from letting villains use their iPhones on the screen. And so if one of your

333
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,080
 characters is using an Apple product, then they must be a good guy. Oh, thank you. So you can't

334
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,640
 tell who's the good guy in the good, the bad and the ugly, for instance. It's a wonderful life.

335
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,360
 I'm not sure any of them had mobile phones in those. They've been edited in.

336
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:50,720
 But sometimes it's not clear who is a goodie and who's a baddie. If someone is, if someone pushes

337
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,320
 one person in front of a train to say five people, who will be allowed an iPhone in the

338
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,200
 situation? You're absolutely right. In any decent story, everyone has a mixture of good and bad.

339
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,080
 Everyone has one iPhone and one Android. That's a good point. Actually, that saves it for me,

340
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,880
 because the movie might have been sponsored by Samsung, for example. Yeah, so that's good. Okay,

341
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:15,120
 great. I'll stop googling which phone sponsored all my movies. But yeah, and there was also an

342
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,640
 article in The Verge that says that Apple says that its products should only be used in the best

343
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:27,200
 light that reflects favorably on Apple products. And they don't, according to Apple, they don't pay

344
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,720
 to have their phones in movies. But what they do do is give lots of free phones and MacBooks and

345
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,800
 stuff to the people who are making the movies in return for them being nice. But they wouldn't

346
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:46,720
 show someone looking up on the internet how to kill orphans on a MacBook. On a MacBook. You couldn't

347
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,840
 do that on a MacBook. No. Yeah, were to inject this person to God in the sun. They wouldn't do that.

348
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,000
 But this is a thing called product displacement, which is the kind of like product displacement.

349
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Product displacement is where you replace a real brand with a fictional one, because the original

350
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,520
 brand are really annoyed about. Oh, okay. So there's a film called Flight, which stars Denzel

351
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,760
 Washington as an alcoholic pilot who somehow he manages to pull off a crazy movie. The plane's

352
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,480
 about to crash to you to, you know, it's all gone wrong on the plane. And he manages to fly it in

353
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,720
 upside down and then land it the right way up at the very last moment. I've got to say the first

354
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,080
 five minutes of that movie is one of the best things I've ever seen. It's so tense. It's so amazing.

355
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,720
 Okay. And the rest is terrible, right? You didn't want to say it out loud. I've seen it too. It's

356
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,400
 shit. Damn, things. The film is bad. God, it tells you not to watch it, especially now the ending

357
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,960
 has been spoiled anyway. Well, the rest of the film is, I gather, just a lengthy legal process

358
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,040
 about whether he was right to save the plane. It's a legal drama. Imagine if you got to watch

359
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:58,000
 that film and you're five minutes late. That would be the worst together. Oh my God. They should

360
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,440
 make it into a short and release it in short films. Anyway, it's Robert Zemeckis who gave us

361
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:10,160
 back to the future. He is an alcoholic pilot, Denzel Washington. The character, sorry, not

362
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:15,440
 Robert Zemeckis, not Denzel Washington, the character, but he drinks Budweiser and a vodka

363
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,400
 that Budweiser own either while he's flying the plane or shortly before. I mean, you guys have

364
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,480
 seen the film, so you'll know. But Budweiser were furious about this and they said, "Can you not show

365
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,520
 this drunk pilot singing a bud before he flies the plane?" And they refused. They said, "There's

366
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,640
 nothing you can do." But it's so, that happens. Sometimes movies do have to buckle to these

367
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,960
 bigger companies. So Slumdog Millionaire, when Danny Boyle made that, he gave an interview where he

368
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,880
 talked about the fact that he had some criminal gangs drinking Coca-Cola at one point, ice cold

369
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,680
 Coca-Cola and, I don't know what to say. Are you personally sponsored by Coca-Cola today?

370
00:32:51,680 --> 00:33:00,160
 Wow. It was a refreshing ice cold Coca-Cola. So, yeah, available in all shops. But yeah,

371
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,960
 they're drinking in that and Coca-Cola took a sort of stand against it and so they had to paint

372
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,080
 it out in the post-production of it. Slumdog Millionaire was the most bizarre film. I hadn't

373
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,800
 realised this, but obviously at the time it was so huge and it won the Oscar, didn't it? And it was

374
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,720
 massive. I hadn't realised it was made by the same company that makes Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

375
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,280
 So it was one huge piece of product placement. Wow. Yeah. Isn't that Jasper Carrot who makes that?

376
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:31,520
 Yes, it is. It is. Well, he wrote Slumdog Millionaire. It might be. It's called Kellador.

377
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,840
 Yes. He's pretty hands off with it, but yeah, he's a direct beneficiary of both those things.

378
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,280
 I think it's Kellador, isn't it? It is. It's a company called Kellador. Of course it's like

379
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,480
 Kellador. I don't think it's deliberately named to be like the Kellador. It might be. It's

380
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,360
 Jasper Carrot. He does love his punks. What's the metaphor behind that? Don't look behind the

381
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,400
 Kellador. It's actually Jasper Carrot. Any international listeners who are wondering who

382
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,520
 Jasper Carrot is, there's no time. So, Kellador made this, who made Who Wants to Be a Millionaire

383
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,240
 and then they decided to make Slumdog to sort of advertise Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

384
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,640
 And the screenwriter for Slumdog Millionaire was one of the co-creators of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

385
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,880
 But the only thing that they stipulated was that at the end, and this is a spoiler where he's

386
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:24,080
 being accused of cheating, the hero is being accused of cheating, the host of Millionaire sort of

387
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,800
 tortures him backstage. And at that point, they said, we can't have it look like the show is

388
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,400
 torturing this boy because that's going to make us look bad. So it's just got to be the host.

389
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,840
 So it's like Chris Tarrant's got out on a limb. It wasn't Chris Tarrant in the film.

390
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,000
 Again, any international listeners who were clinging on after Jasper Carrot were now given

391
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:48,640
 up at Chris Tarrant. So, hang on, wow, torture equipment does the host of Who Wants to Be a

392
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,800
 Millionaire have access to backstage? Like, you couldn't do more than a quick Chinese burn or a

393
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,080
 wedgie, could you? He's got that tension music. Yeah, he's got a super long advert break without

394
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,560
 telling him. I found out, just looking at product placement stuff, I found out one of the first

395
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:12,160
 ever examples of product placement on a podcast. Okay. So this was in 2005. There was a show called

396
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,840
 The Dawn and Drew Show. Okay. And it was the newspapers at the time had to explain what a

397
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,200
 podcast was, which is the report I read said a podcast is, or this particular podcast is a

398
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,920
 program filled with strong language that is available only in a digital format and downloaded

399
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,720
 on iPods and other devices that play MP3 files. Okay. So that's what a podcast is. And this one

400
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,960
 was The Dawn and Drew Show. And it was sponsored, it was product placement did by Durex. Okay. And

401
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,920
 Durex had inserted their product into the show because it was hosted by a husband and wife.

402
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,200
 And the show featured the husband and the wife and their dog Hercules tasting flavoured condoms.

403
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,520
 That was the first ever product placement podcast. Okay. The firm said they were delighted and they

404
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,200
 said, this is quotes exactly how we want to position the branch.

405
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,720
 Were they condoms for dogs and humans alike?

406
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,280
 Like, no, because you'd have to have a dog meat flavoured condom.

407
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,000
 Oh, they don't love strawberry today.

408
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,400
 Oh my God, that's incredible.

409
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,000
 So anyway, I'm just saying we've got further to sink before we hit rock bottom.

410
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,720
 You know, your, this has not been a product placement, but we're recording this podcast on

411
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,880
 Mac computer. And we're all good guys.

412
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,000
 Now, if you were to close that and don't close it because we might lose the recording,

413
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,880
 but you would see that the Apple is upside down as you're looking at it. So maybe if you half

414
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,160
 close it, you see it's kind of upside down as you're looking. Now, the reason that is is for

415
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:50,000
 product placement reasons. So it was in Legally Blonde, which is a properly great film. She is

416
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,680
 using an Apple Mac, but the Apple is upside down to what we have it today, because that's the way

417
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,120
 it used to be. Because it makes much more sense that if you have it closed and you're looking at it,

418
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:04,000
 the Apple is the right way up. And that's how it used to be. But then there was an employee

419
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,160
 called Joe Moreno who said to Steve Jobs, look, if we're going to put these in movies, what we need

420
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,960
 is when it's open and you're looking at it, the Apple is the right way up. So they changed it.

421
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,160
 Or if someone's just like watching you in a cafe, of course you've got to put it the right

422
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
 way out for the people looking at it. Not the one who owns it already.

423
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,920
 That's really interesting. So basically the Apple on your Apple Mac is not for you. It's for

424
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,080
 everyone else. Wow. Some advertisers, this is sort of the next step they're doing for advertising

425
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,520
 and things. So advertisers in soap operas are now selling billboards inside the fictional locations

426
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,440
 in the soap operas. So Coronation Street is a fictional street, but it's a fictional street

427
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,280
 with advertising billboards on it. And jewellery shops and other shops are buying up advertising

428
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,720
 space in fictional Coronation Street. And there's a new thing also that other advertisers are doing

429
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,960
 where you know you'll be able to digitally alter what viewers see on screen when they're streaming.

430
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,040
 So different people see different things. So if you are watching, let's say you drink whiskey

431
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,680
 and your TV knows that you drink whiskey, there might be billboards for whiskey brands in the

432
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:17,280
 background. Whereas if you... But what if you're a person who like secretly buys dog meat flavored

433
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:26,400
 condoms? And you're watching Coronation Street with your parents. That's such a good point.

434
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,200
 That's such a good point. The whole family looking at each other suspiciously. It's like an Agatha

435
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,440
 Christie. Yeah, exactly. Wow. Well, they might do it based on the time of day even. So if you're

436
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,200
 watching late at night, there'll be adverts for... That's what y'all do. Watch Coronation Street

437
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,880
 late at night. Absolutely. Have another late night set. Yeah, there'll be adverts for I guess late

438
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,320
 night stuff like swearing or cocaine. Well, if you're watching in the morning, there'll just be

439
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:01,360
 adverts for cereal and orange juice. Or whiskey. Just one ironic thing about this fact is that

440
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:08,560
 apples are a sign that someone's a villain. What? In films, apparently people have spotted this.

441
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,280
 If you're the baddie, you're always eating an apple. Not always. This is a few cross films.

442
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,040
 Yep. So, Mr Bond. The bad guys in Doctor Who do that, don't they? Because an apple a day keeps

443
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:26,640
 the doctor away. This is true. Please send in more if you've seen them. But Draco Malfoy does it.

444
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,880
 Jeffrey Rush in Poe Rats of the Caribbean. It's kind of crunches down an apple. Colin Farrell

445
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,560
 when he's playing a vampire and something or other. And it's got a name. It's the arrogant apple.

446
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,040
 Sometimes it's really just to show your dominance because it's kind of showing you're so aloof.

447
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,600
 I can eat an apple as well as talking to you. I don't give enough of a crap about what you're

448
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,800
 saying to stop eating my apple. I wonder if there's like the history of the poisoned apple in fairy

449
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,080
 tales and things. That's been theorized on the internet, James. You should check the internet

450
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:04,400
 out for more on that. Garden of Eden? Again. And apple was eaten there. It's all on the forums.

451
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,480
 It sounds like we could think of everything on the internet, Anna, so I'm not worried.

452
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:18,160
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get

459
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:08,080
 Stop the podcast.
