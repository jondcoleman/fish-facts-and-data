00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 Hi everyone, James here. Now, before we start this week's show, I just want to tell you one

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.760
 little thing about it, and that is that it was actually recorded quite a long time ago,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.440
 all the way back in February, in fact. And the reason I want to tell you that is because,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.080
 first of all, it's obviously in the office and we're all still in our homes at the moment.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.320
 And also because there'll be a few things that we might say in there that might really,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.000
 perhaps, give away that we didn't record it this week, for instance. I do talk about Jasper

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.800
 Carrot for a while, and that probably would have been a dated reference any time that we'd

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.520
 said it in the last five years. But hey, when you listen, you'll get the idea. So enjoy the show

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.200
 and just marvel about how young we all sounded back in February. Okay, on with the podcast.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:01:06.000
 [Music]

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.520
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.720
 you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.680
 Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anna Chazinski. And once again, we have gathered around the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.480
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.280
 here we go. Starting with you, Anna. My fact this week is that in the 18th century, women

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.280
 expressed their political beliefs by wearing decorative stickers on their faces. Wow. That's

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 cool. What kind of stickers did they say, like, vote labor or? Yeah, screw you, Boris. I just

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.000
 rolled all over their forehead. Very prescient of them. Women have amazing foresight.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.880
 And full heads. Sticker, huh? No, this one's so facial stickers were this huge fashion for about

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.280
 sort of 200 years. And about the turn of the 18th century, they suddenly became political.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.960
 And so there was one commentator, for instance, who said that he went to the opera and he saw

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.400
 two parties of very fine women, as he said, arranged in battle formation against each other.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.680
 And he said, one group was wearing patches and stickers on the left side of their foreheads

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.760
 and the other on the right. It became apparent they were wig supporters and Tory supporters.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.400
 And I looked into this and this was a thing. So it wasn't the stickers were just like little,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.920
 like beauty spots or something, but it was where you wore them that was important. Is that it?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.880
 Yes, that seems to be it. Yes. So they started off as for decoration, but it got to the extent

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.920
 that there were some marriage contracts where women would insist before they married their husband

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.720
 that regardless of the husband's political opinions, the wife should be able to patch as she pleased.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.320
 And so you would have one or two things, but did it get to the point where people,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.240
 you know, when you see full face tattoos, did you ever see people just completely?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.840
 You would see not completely the full face, but you might see lots of these like fake beauty spots.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.480
 And you could supposedly identify prostitutes because their faces had so many of these patches

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.720
 on them. Was that a sign of being sexy, though, having lots of stickers?

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.960
 Well, having one sticker was supposed to be. And the reason is supposedly Venus,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.280
 the goddess of beauty, she had one mole on her face. And it was by that one imperfection

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.440
 that you could see how beautiful the rest of her face was. And the idea was that they were kind

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.000
 of copying that. And by having like one little beauty spot, it would show the paleness of your

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.840
 skin, perhaps, or, you know, show off the rest of your skin. So if you have lots and lots of

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.520
 stickers, that means you're really, really beautiful because you've got you need so many

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.080
 imperfections to disguise how fit you are. You wouldn't believe what I look like without

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.120
 these stickers on, because I look really nice. It could have been that you are covering the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:04:00.720
 symptoms of STDs. It's a real gamble. So sorry, I didn't think that we had glue sticker technology

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.880
 in the, when is this, 18th century? We had glue. Sure. Okay. Were they kind of fuzzy felt

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.720
 stickers, that kind of thing? I actually don't think we had fuzzy felt. They would be made of

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.000
 various things. So they could be made of silk or taffeta or leather sometimes. And then they'd

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.440
 have mouth fur, apparently. Mouth fur? On your tongue? No. I suddenly developed a lisp.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.960
 It sounded like mouse from where I was sat, but. Okay. Oh, mouse fur. Okay. I heard mouth as well.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.160
 Okay. Right in and tell us what you heard. So, and then they'd have on the back, often a surface

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.200
 that you could lick. So women tended to take them out of their handbags and lick them to attach

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.120
 them to their face. So you get very thin paper that does that. Well, they had adhesive. So they'd

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.760
 just stick it on with some glue. Yeah. But sometimes the adhesive wasn't so great. So there was an

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.400
 article in the spectator that spoke about a woman who had a beauty spot on her forehead, but by the

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:02.560
 end of the evening, it had gone to her chin. They got more and more elaborate as well, didn't they?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.320
 Is it caught on? So I think it started in France and the French called them moosh, which is for

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.120
 flies because they look like little flies landing on your face. But yeah, they expanded to be weird

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.560
 shapes. So by the end of the 18th century, you'd have them cut into stars or sort of moons or

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.760
 crown shapes or any shape you wanted, really. You still get those, don't you? On small children.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.640
 Adults who like a bit of fun. Yeah. Why are you wearing that with the puppy dog on the middle

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.600
 of your forehead? I was so considering doing it this morning by bottling out of it. But yeah,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.360
 no, you do get them like little kind of, I don't know, stars and yeah, I've been very brave at the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:51.120
 dentist today. Stick those on your forehead though, didn't I? No, actually, I've got, I used to have

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.720
 one of those, but it was a safety pin one. So that's not for the forehead. That's for the clothes.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.320
 Safety pin, really? Oh, it was a badge. I'm describing a badge. But what's interesting about

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.960
 that is I think you're only brave at the dentist once. So you don't need it to be a badge. You

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.880
 only need it to be a sticker. Do you know what? You're right. I'm confusing it with my I've been

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.840
 to a party at Pizza Hut badge, which is a badge because that's the thing that lasts a life if

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.080
 you go to a party at Pizza Hut in the early 90s. Yeah, you want to show off about that, don't you?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.680
 That's why you wear badges. You don't want to be wearing a badge that says I've been brave at the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.200
 dentist just to show off. You feel pretty silly at the military parade, wouldn't you, next to all

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.360
 the other medals? Just being brave at the dentist award. I got this one for bravery.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.920
 I saw there's some drawings that people have done of some of the designs and there was a

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.760
 horse and carriage one and I think that's been questioned a bit. That was satire, was it?

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.080
 That was someone taking a piss out of the power of said they've gone. I thought that was real too.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.000
 Yeah, I was really hoping that that would be because I just thought how interesting heads

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.320
 must have been back then. I don't know what you mean. Well, just wait a minute. If you're sitting

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.360
 on the tube and someone sat across from me with a horse and carriage drawn on their head and they

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.320
 had other cartoons, you know, I wouldn't need the paper. But people still have tattoos these

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.160
 days. So do you just, when you're sat on the tube, just read people's tattoos? I do, but they give

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:14.400
 me a look that says I'm not friendly. Oh, well, this is the thing about other kinds of stickers

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:21.600
 is that they can be indicators of how friendly or not someone is. So bumper stickers, if people

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.080
 have bumper stickers on their car, they tend to be more aggressive and territorial drivers.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.640
 Yeah, makes sense. Yeah, study in 2008 by Colorado State University and they surveyed people saying,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.880
 do you have bumper stickers on your car? And do you drive like a bastard? And basically,

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.880
 people who said yes to one said yes to the other. They said, yeah, I drive more territorially,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.080
 more aggressively, I do not respond constructively on the road when people get in my way.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.520
 And how often are these the baby on board stickers? Well, I read that article and actually it said

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.840
 that it doesn't matter what's on the sticker, right? So you might have a sticker that says

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.360
 everyone needs to be kind to each other and you're still going to drive like a maniac.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.360
 Yeah, so baby on board as well. Yeah, more likely to be aggressive.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.280
 Just one more thing on an alternative use for stickers for yourself for decoration is to cover

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.440
 blemishes. And so I think that's that's sort of where facial stickers might have come from

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.600
 originally. But men wore them quite a lot to cover blemishes or to accentuate them. And so

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.160
 if men had been to war, for instance, it became quite common for them to come back and they'd

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.920
 put a scar sticker over their scar. I think if a scar started to fade or something,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.080
 then you'd put a big black scar there. And so there's, for instance, there's a bit in all's

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.240
 well that ends well, which now makes sense. If you know where Bertram comes back from war,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.800
 and it says he's got a patch of velvet on his face, and it's unclear if there's a scar underneath.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.880
 And it was sort of a thing that people did if they hadn't really seen much military action,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.840
 and they were a bit of a coward, and they'd run away at the first sign anyway,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.080
 is that they'd suddenly put a big blemish on their face to imply that they'd been shot in the head.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.720
 Wow, that's amazing. I've got a little scar on my face. Maybe I'll try and accentuate it.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.080
 Have you? With some mouse fur. I want to do one of the sides. I'm not sure which side.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.880
 Oh yeah, little one, yeah, yeah. It's somewhere you got shot in the Civil War,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.440
 isn't it? Obscene bumper stickers can sometimes be a matter for the law.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.480
 Okay, so there are all these lawsuits that happen in the USA over whether you're allowed a

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.240
 particular bumper sticker or not, or whether it's basically creating a public disturbance just by

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.560
 having it on your car. So in 2008, a guy went to the Georgia Supreme Court because he had a

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:34.400
 "Shit happens" bumper sticker, and he won. And then, more recently, this bit is very rude by the way,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.000
 but the police in Florida arrested and charged a man who had a bumper sticker which said,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.680
 "I eat ass." And that was really big and it's right in the middle of his back windscreen as well,

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.160
 so there's no way if you're driving along that you won't see it.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.000
 And was he referring to donkey meat, do we know?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.720
 I'm not sure. That wasn't his defence, actually.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.040
 I mean, it absolutely should have been. But the police pulled him over and they said,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.640
 "Can you amend it?" So it wasn't offensive. And he said, "Well, how do you suggest I do that?"

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.600
 And they said, "Can you remove the second S from ass?" So it would be, "I eat ass."

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.560
 But then the grammar police come at you on the other side.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.720
 Guys, who's the grandfather, the god of stickers?

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.440
 The god of stickers. The god of stickers. You all know this.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.040
 Football albums. Panini. Oh, no, I was thinking of Mr Avery.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.280
 Oh, Avery, yeah. Oh, Avery. Stanton.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:27.360
 Sorry. Well, because you never do any of the office admin, Andy,

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.320
 you are not familiar with Avery stickers, but those of us who post letters every once in a while.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.160
 This feels like more of a grudge. It feels like this whole fact has been building up to a grudge.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:43.040
 No, so Stanton Avery, mate, was the inventor of the self-adhesive sticker, as in you didn't need

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.440
 to lick it, you didn't need to add glue to it. And he still dominates the label market today,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.760
 so I was looking into him. So he built his first sticker machine.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:59.600
 I love this, by marrying together a motor from a washing machine and a sewing machine,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.160
 sewing machine parts. So we smushed them together and generated a shed load of stickers.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.000
 His company was initially called Cum Clean Products, spelling cum K-U-M,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.760
 which I think is a good thing was changed. How did he make his glue?

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.320
 He was actually very cagey about the process. He was so pretty tired.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:31.120
 He was super poor. And so he really like dragged himself up from the bottom. He lived in a rented

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:38.240
 chicken coop. He couldn't even afford the deposit on a chicken coop. Did he pay the chickens?

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.840
 I don't know if the chickens own the coop. I think they were also renting.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.720
 Oh wow. Terrible flatmates. I think I get eggs every morning.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:55.360
 Do you want to eat an egg if your flatmate has just laid it before your horrified eyes?

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.760
 I refuse to eat food that's come out of any of my friends arses.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:08.800
 That's amazing. Yeah, it's so cool. He could have written, I eat and then in brackets,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.960
 eggs that have come out of a chicken. Clothes, brackets, ass.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.360
 Another strong defense. So many arguments are going out before.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.520
 So he tried a bunch of business. How did he get a washing machine in the chicken coop?

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:30.160
 So I think this was post chicken coop. And he got it because he married a slightly wealthier lady

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.600
 who lent him a bit of money. And he thought, I need a washing machine.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.680
 We got back to your place tonight. Chickens out tonight.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.440
 So anyway. Did she invite them to the hen do?

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:49.280
 You got laid that night.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:59.200
 Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that the very

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.720
 first print run of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn had to be pulped after a bookstore owner

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.440
 discovered someone had sneaked a drawing of a penis into one of the illustrations.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.200
 The first suspect has to be the illustrator, is she?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.400
 Yes, we genuinely don't know. We don't know if it was the illustrator. We don't know if it was

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:24.080
 the photo engraver at the actual factory where they were printing the book. What we do know is

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:30.640
 when these books came out at the end of Chapter 32, Huck Finn is meeting his aunt Sally and Uncle

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:37.280
 Silas. And Uncle Silas has a big erect penis drawn in in the illustration itself. And as a result,

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:44.640
 30,000 copies had to be pulped. And did they definitely check the plot and they don't,

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.160
 it's not part of the storyline that references Uncle Silas's erect penis?

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.880
 Weirdly. Weirdly. I read the book and I can confirm there isn't a bit where

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.480
 Uncle Silas has an erection and is showing it off to his family.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.960
 That must have been very disappointing when you got to the end of that.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.920
 It's the only reason I bought the book in the first place.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:09.600
 So this is obviously, it's a very important book in American literature. Ernest Hemingway said

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.360
 all modern American literature comes from one book and it's called Huckleberry Finn. And the

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.920
 idea was it was the first book that used the vernacular of Americans. At that point Americans

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.520
 were really writing in the tone of British and European authors, not using the day-to-day language

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:30.880
 and he kind of set the tone. Unfortunately, it's also a book that's laced with racism and that's

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.320
 caused huge problems basically since publication. It's not a book that's sort of not been controversial

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.600
 throughout the years. The language use is difficult and racist and we should say that it's set,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.840
 Mark Twain wrote it in the 80s, but it's set about 40 years earlier in the 1840s, isn't it?

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.640
 And the main plot of Huckleberry Finn, for anyone who hasn't read it, is basically it's about Huck Finn

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:56.720
 who is this kind of poor kid who held a seat 12 or 13 and he runs away along with a runaway slave

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.360
 who is called Jim and they run away together and they are good friends and Jim is a very

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.080
 sympathetic character but at the same time very problematically drawn. Yeah, one of the...

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.040
 Not drawn with an erect penis like Uncle Silas, we should say.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.160
 People have objected to stuff other than that so it was extremely controversial as soon as it was

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.280
 published largely because of the kind of crudeness of some of the language and that was written in

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:25.040
 this native dialect. It wasn't just like ordinary American dialect, it was proper Mississippi 1840s

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.800
 dialect and it was banned for bad grammar and employment of inelegant expressions.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:37.200
 Things like in 1905 a Brooklyn library banned it because Huck not only itched but he scratched.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.880
 So apparently that's disgusting and he said "sweet" when he should have said "perspiration".

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.960
 So Mark Twain had been kind of unhappy with the way that publishing had been going and he

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:52.160
 decided he didn't want to have normal publishers like before and get the money that way. He wanted

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:58.000
 to have a subscription service so he sent people door to door with like, you know, the first chapter

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.880
 and said, "Look, there's this new book coming out. How do you fancy buying it and then we'll send you

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.440
 all the chapters in future?" And he basically, because he did this, it meant he could have full

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:13.040
 control of it, which meant he had full control of all of the illustrations and it meant that when

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.440
 the illustrator kept sending him stuff he was like, "Don't like that, don't like that, don't like that,

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:24.720
 don't like that, do like that." Love that penis! So is that maybe why they pranked him? That's one

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.480
 theory that the illustrator hated him so much because he kept asking him to change things

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.440
 that he's like, "Right, fine." But they offered a massive reward to the press men working on the

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.720
 novel and a $500 reward, which would have been a lot of money today and no one fessed up, so we

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:46.160
 still, there's no culprit. And is the investigation still open? I think the office, the reward is

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.960
 still available. He had a terrible relationship with his sort of typesetters and proofreaders

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.960
 and everyone like that, didn't he? Which might be why they were so pissed off with him. He hated them

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.400
 and it does sound like they kept on trying to improve his punctuation and grammar, which was

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.760
 deliberately vernacular. And once upon getting a text back and seeing the corrections that had been

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.560
 made, he wrote to a friend, "I've telegraphed orders to have the proofreader shot without giving him

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.920
 time to pray." So it was tense, I think. If someone wrote that about, "Hey, I draw a penis on their picture."

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:20.160
 It wasn't the most successful book that he published with that firm. So the first two

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.040
 books that that firm published were Huckleberry Finn and The Memoirs of Ulysses S Grant,

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.520
 ex-president, and it was pretty much the last thing Grant did was write this book.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:36.160
 And it was so successful that he gave Grant's widow the biggest ever royalty check in American

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.160
 publishing history. It was absolutely massive. And it was thanks to that door-to-door technique

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.760
 that James mentioned, because it was war veterans. So it was silver war veterans going door-to-door

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.880
 selling the book. And that's a pretty strong sell, you know? I might be wrong in saying this, but

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.240
 from the story that I know about that, it's that when Ulysses S Grant died, his wife was really

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:02.240
 struggling financially and was not given any help from anyone. And Mark Twain published the book

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.360
 and gave her that high amount of royalties before he knew it was going to be successful so that she

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:13.680
 had money to live off for the rest of her life. Apparently, it's an extraordinary book, that

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:19.520
 autobiography. Really? Yeah. I've read so many things about it being the best book by anyone in

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.400
 government ever as a solid, it's just incredible, apparently. Surely not better than the art of

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:31.360
 the deal. Surely. Surely not better than Jacob Rees Mogg's book about the Victorians.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:37.120
 Can't be better than that, can it? Now, if we want to talk about offensive landings and things.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:43.920
 Mark Twain wrote the first book on a typewriter in America. There's a bit of dispute over whether

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.440
 it was Tom Sawyer or another one of his books. It's usually credited as Tom Sawyer. But he

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.320
 used to love writing on a typewriter and no one really had it at the time. So people used to write

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.560
 him letters and he would write letters back on his typewriter. They would then write back to him

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:03.120
 asking about the typewriter and that got so annoying with so many people writing back to him

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.280
 asking him, "Holy moly, what is this? This is incredible," that he stopped writing letters

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.000
 using his typewriter. Really? She's got inundated. Yeah. I really love his correspondence because

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.600
 he didn't really much like getting them a lot of the time, did he? I read one that he got in 1901

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.720
 and the letter said, "Dear Mr. Mark Twain, I am a little girl six years old. I have read

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.520
 your stories ever since they first came out. I have a cat named Kitty and a dog named Pop.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.480
 I like to guess puzzles. Did you write a story for the Herald competition? I hope you will answer

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:39.120
 my letter. Yours truly Augusta Kortrecht." To which he replied, "Well, no." He didn't reply. He just

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.080
 wrote a comment on it saying, "Labor tempt of a middle-aged liar to pull an autograph."

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:57.040
 He invented one game for kids, which I think sounds pretty cool. He measured out a 817 foot path

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:03.920
 of his driveway and he marked every single foot and that was supposed to be a year and it was

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.360
 the year from 1066 when William the Conqueror arrived in Britain and the idea is you would

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:15.280
 walk along the path and at each point when there was a new king or queen in England or Britain,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.680
 then you would stake in the ground and you would be like, "Oh, this is Edward the first,

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:25.280
 this is Henry the second, blah, blah, blah." It was a way of having fun but also learning

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.200
 your kings and queens because in those days education was very much rote learning. You

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.080
 just had to learn all these things and this was a fun way of doing it.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.640
 Or a very annoyingly slow way of getting to the front door after a long day in the office.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.360
 But he turned it into a board game, didn't he? Or he tried to.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.200
 It sounds really complicated. I didn't fully understand it even after reading it.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.360
 I thought it sounded quite, it sounded a bit like battleship. Basically, it was another

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.920
 sort of history date memorization game and essentially you'd have a chart with a series of

00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:01.200
 dates on it and each player would say a date. You say 1918 and then the other player has to

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.120
 say an event that happened on that date to say the end of the First World War. See,

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.040
 I cleverly chose my date in advance so I'd have something to say for it.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.960
 I mean, you also chose a date that was nearly 10 years after Twain died when no one could possibly

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:18.240
 have guessed what was going to happen. True. But then a player puts a pin in that date if they

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.080
 get it right and if they don't get it right, they don't get a pin and I guess when you've

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.360
 covered up all your dates you've won. Sounds quite fun for a nerd.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.920
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:39.280
 My fact is that before vaccination was invented, the main method of inoculation against smallpox

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.000
 was to powder scabs and blow them up your nose.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.160
 Lovely. Or to get someone else to blow them up your nose.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:52.320
 It's very hard to blow up your own nose. And this was how inoculation worked for a long time.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.560
 It was done in China a thousand years ago. This was the method they knew about this.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:02.720
 And it did work, didn't it? It worked reasonably well. So if you were healthy,

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:10.240
 you would get some smallpox scabs and you would leave them for a little while because fresh

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.320
 scabs were likely to give you the infection properly. So they would be dried, aged smallpox

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:22.560
 scabs and they would be powdered up and then they would be blown up your nose with a special

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.440
 silver blowpipe for the procedure as well. The Chinese doctors had special blowpipes to do this.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.680
 And then apparently the right nostril was used for boys and the left for girls.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:37.200
 And you would maybe get some mild symptoms and some people did actually just then get

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.880
 full blown smallpox. But most people then got it, you know, some mild symptoms and then were

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.600
 resistant to any following exposure. There's a low percentage, wasn't it?

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.840
 So this was a really decent way of doing it before we had the method of vaccination.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.720
 And we didn't know about this, is that right? It took about 700 years to get over.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:03.200
 And it works by the same method as vaccination, right? Which is that it's an attenuated or weakened

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:09.040
 version of the disease in a scab. And your body then makes antibodies that can fight against that

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.880
 and then it can fight against the main thing, is that right? There was another version where

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:18.560
 you had some powdered scab as well or you had some pus from a smallpox pustule and you would

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.440
 make a little scratch on your skin and then you would just pour that pus or, you know,

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.200
 rub that powdered scab into your skin and that worked too. And that's called variolation

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:35.920
 because variola was the Latin for smallpox. In 2011, the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:42.560
 had some things from its collection. And one of them was a letter from the 1870s that had

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:48.160
 a smallpox scab in it. And the idea was that the person who wrote the letter in the 19th

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.920
 century was sending it to his father. It had been taken from the arm of a child and his father was

00:23:53.920 --> 00:24:00.560
 going to make it into dust and inoculate people. But then it never got to the recipient. And so

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.920
 they just found this letter. And of course, immediately, the Census for Disease Control came

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:11.920
 in the hazmat suits and said, holy shit, you don't need to be having this, that the public can see

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:17.680
 this because smallpox has been eradicated, basically, hasn't it? And so, yeah, in the end,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.240
 there was some of the virus on this scab still, but it wasn't deadly enough. I mean,

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:28.640
 it must have attenuated pretty hard by that time. How when was it? It was from 1876 and they found

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:34.560
 it in 2011. Wow. That is really spooky, finding it and not knowing what it is. You just think you

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.280
 found a little button or something. Or maybe it's like a little sticker to put on your face.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.480
 But all these doctors had their own different methods of doing variolation. And there were

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:50.000
 some celebrity doctors in Britain in the 17th, 18th century who worked this out. So have you

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.320
 heard of Johnny Notions? No. Johnny Notions. Sounds like he's got some weird ideas.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:25:00.160
 Well, he was a Scottish doctor and he had a really successful method for variolating,

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:05.440
 because he would collect the pus, first of all. And everyone had their own method of making it

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.800
 a bit less deadly, basically. So he would dry it with peat smoke. So he had a lovely sort of

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:16.560
 smoky flavour for the pus, very nice. And then he would bury it in the ground between sheets of

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.720
 glass, okay, with some campfire. And then he would keep it there for seven or eight years.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.840
 This is like he's making a whiskey, isn't it? Yeah, in genuine years. And then he would

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.720
 insert it and he would then put a cabbage leaf on top as a plaster. And this was apparently a

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.720
 really good way of doing it. And it just gave you the nice amount. I suppose it does take the edge

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.840
 off the urn pus, doesn't it? It's a nice, peachy, cabergy flavour to it.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:48.560
 Apparently, you were more likely to get a job if you could be seen to have smallpox scars,

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.520
 because then the suggestion was, oh, great, you can work with us. You're not going to pass it on.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:59.200
 You've had it already. That was seen as a sort of great, safe workmate. So two of the earliest

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:05.360
 people who worked with inoculation were Robert Koch in Germany and Louis Pasteur in France.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:14.960
 And they fell out with each other because Pasteur once was doing a talk and he used the phrase

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:22.160
 "Rekui Allemande", which means a collection of German writing, but the translator translated

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:30.240
 it as "Augui Allemande", which means German arrogance. And so Koch never forgave him for

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.480
 that because he thought that Pasteur was calling him arrogant. Although I think that before that,

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.960
 they loathe each other. If you read the dialogues that they had, the letters they wrote each other,

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:44.480
 it's just basically spitting with rage, you know, Koch writing letters to Pasteur accusing him

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:50.080
 of stealing all of his ideas and vice versa, saying you're a fraud, you know, really foul language,

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.400
 because there was this huge fight basically when we suddenly discovered the power of

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.440
 the idea of vaccination between a few scientists, wasn't there?

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:06.800
 So that was after Jenna? Yes, it was. So Edward Jenna is the person who kind of we

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:12.880
 give the, we say, created vaccinations today, right? He got it from milkmates.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:18.160
 Did he? Yeah, because there were milkmates near him and he noticed that they got a thing called

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:24.080
 cowpox, which is a disease that cows got, and they would only get one single pustule on their hands,

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.000
 which is where they've been touching the cows because of all the milking. And he theorized,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.800
 maybe this is a milder version of smallpox. So then he did this amazing gamble, Jenna,

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:41.200
 he took some pus from a milkmate and he injected it into a child. Yeah. And six, yeah,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.120
 not his child, by the way, although he did also do it with his own child actually later on, so fair

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:51.360
 play. I think when he knew it worked. And then he, six weeks later, he injected the child with full

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:57.680
 blown smallpox. And he didn't know how it worked. And yeah, and then, but later in life, they became

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.680
 friends. So, yeah, James Phipps, he was the son of Edward Jenna's gardener, which if it hadn't

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.280
 worked, would have made the gardening very, very awkward, I think for a long time. I think he would

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:14.960
 have ruined your rose bush after that. He had smallpox when he was a child, Jenna. And one of the

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.920
 reasons that he kind of went into getting rid of it later is because he had such a bad time of it.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:27.440
 He was varialated. So they gave him some of the pus or some scabs or something. But he was prepared

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:33.040
 for that by being starved, purged and bled and locked in a stable with other infected boys.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:38.640
 With other infected boys? Yeah. So they kind of varialated all these people, gave them like very

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.600
 mild symptoms and then put them all in a stable. Meanwhile, Stanton Avery's outside of a checking

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:53.520
 coop. Don't know you're born, mate. Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show. And that is

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:59.360
 James. Okay, my fact this week is that you can tell if a movie character is a goodie or a baddie

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:06.720
 by the kind of phone they use. That sucks now that I know that and I'm watching movies. I know,

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:12.320
 sorry, this is not just a spoiler of one movie, this is a spoiler of all movies. So this came up

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.200
 in my RSS feed. And thanks to the blog Nitarama, which I follow. And it was an interview with

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:24.080
 Rian Johnson, who is the director of the film Knives Out. And he said that Apple have forbid

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:29.120
 filmmakers from letting villains use their iPhones on the screen. And so if one of your

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:34.080
 characters is using an Apple product, then they must be a good guy. Oh, thank you. So you can't

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.640
 tell who's the good guy in the good, the bad and the ugly, for instance. It's a wonderful life.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.360
 I'm not sure any of them had mobile phones in those. They've been edited in.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:50.720
 But sometimes it's not clear who is a goodie and who's a baddie. If someone is, if someone pushes

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.320
 one person in front of a train to say five people, who will be allowed an iPhone in the

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:59.200
 situation? You're absolutely right. In any decent story, everyone has a mixture of good and bad.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:04.080
 Everyone has one iPhone and one Android. That's a good point. Actually, that saves it for me,

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.880
 because the movie might have been sponsored by Samsung, for example. Yeah, so that's good. Okay,

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:15.120
 great. I'll stop googling which phone sponsored all my movies. But yeah, and there was also an

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:20.640
 article in The Verge that says that Apple says that its products should only be used in the best

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:27.200
 light that reflects favorably on Apple products. And they don't, according to Apple, they don't pay

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:32.720
 to have their phones in movies. But what they do do is give lots of free phones and MacBooks and

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:38.800
 stuff to the people who are making the movies in return for them being nice. But they wouldn't

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:46.720
 show someone looking up on the internet how to kill orphans on a MacBook. On a MacBook. You couldn't

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:51.840
 do that on a MacBook. No. Yeah, were to inject this person to God in the sun. They wouldn't do that.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:58.000
 But this is a thing called product displacement, which is the kind of like product displacement.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 Product displacement is where you replace a real brand with a fictional one, because the original

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.520
 brand are really annoyed about. Oh, okay. So there's a film called Flight, which stars Denzel

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:13.760
 Washington as an alcoholic pilot who somehow he manages to pull off a crazy movie. The plane's

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.480
 about to crash to you to, you know, it's all gone wrong on the plane. And he manages to fly it in

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.720
 upside down and then land it the right way up at the very last moment. I've got to say the first

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:28.080
 five minutes of that movie is one of the best things I've ever seen. It's so tense. It's so amazing.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.720
 Okay. And the rest is terrible, right? You didn't want to say it out loud. I've seen it too. It's

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.400
 shit. Damn, things. The film is bad. God, it tells you not to watch it, especially now the ending

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.960
 has been spoiled anyway. Well, the rest of the film is, I gather, just a lengthy legal process

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.040
 about whether he was right to save the plane. It's a legal drama. Imagine if you got to watch

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:58.000
 that film and you're five minutes late. That would be the worst together. Oh my God. They should

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.440
 make it into a short and release it in short films. Anyway, it's Robert Zemeckis who gave us

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:10.160
 back to the future. He is an alcoholic pilot, Denzel Washington. The character, sorry, not

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.440
 Robert Zemeckis, not Denzel Washington, the character, but he drinks Budweiser and a vodka

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.400
 that Budweiser own either while he's flying the plane or shortly before. I mean, you guys have

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.480
 seen the film, so you'll know. But Budweiser were furious about this and they said, "Can you not show

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.520
 this drunk pilot singing a bud before he flies the plane?" And they refused. They said, "There's

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.640
 nothing you can do." But it's so, that happens. Sometimes movies do have to buckle to these

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.960
 bigger companies. So Slumdog Millionaire, when Danny Boyle made that, he gave an interview where he

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:44.880
 talked about the fact that he had some criminal gangs drinking Coca-Cola at one point, ice cold

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:51.680
 Coca-Cola and, I don't know what to say. Are you personally sponsored by Coca-Cola today?

00:32:51.680 --> 00:33:00.160
 Wow. It was a refreshing ice cold Coca-Cola. So, yeah, available in all shops. But yeah,

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.960
 they're drinking in that and Coca-Cola took a sort of stand against it and so they had to paint

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:10.080
 it out in the post-production of it. Slumdog Millionaire was the most bizarre film. I hadn't

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.800
 realised this, but obviously at the time it was so huge and it won the Oscar, didn't it? And it was

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.720
 massive. I hadn't realised it was made by the same company that makes Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:25.280
 So it was one huge piece of product placement. Wow. Yeah. Isn't that Jasper Carrot who makes that?

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:31.520
 Yes, it is. It is. Well, he wrote Slumdog Millionaire. It might be. It's called Kellador.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.840
 Yes. He's pretty hands off with it, but yeah, he's a direct beneficiary of both those things.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:41.280
 I think it's Kellador, isn't it? It is. It's a company called Kellador. Of course it's like

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.480
 Kellador. I don't think it's deliberately named to be like the Kellador. It might be. It's

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:51.360
 Jasper Carrot. He does love his punks. What's the metaphor behind that? Don't look behind the

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:58.400
 Kellador. It's actually Jasper Carrot. Any international listeners who are wondering who

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.520
 Jasper Carrot is, there's no time. So, Kellador made this, who made Who Wants to Be a Millionaire

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.240
 and then they decided to make Slumdog to sort of advertise Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:14.640
 And the screenwriter for Slumdog Millionaire was one of the co-creators of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.880
 But the only thing that they stipulated was that at the end, and this is a spoiler where he's

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:24.080
 being accused of cheating, the hero is being accused of cheating, the host of Millionaire sort of

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.800
 tortures him backstage. And at that point, they said, we can't have it look like the show is

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.400
 torturing this boy because that's going to make us look bad. So it's just got to be the host.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.840
 So it's like Chris Tarrant's got out on a limb. It wasn't Chris Tarrant in the film.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.000
 Again, any international listeners who were clinging on after Jasper Carrot were now given

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:48.640
 up at Chris Tarrant. So, hang on, wow, torture equipment does the host of Who Wants to Be a

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:52.800
 Millionaire have access to backstage? Like, you couldn't do more than a quick Chinese burn or a

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:58.080
 wedgie, could you? He's got that tension music. Yeah, he's got a super long advert break without

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.560
 telling him. I found out, just looking at product placement stuff, I found out one of the first

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:12.160
 ever examples of product placement on a podcast. Okay. So this was in 2005. There was a show called

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:17.840
 The Dawn and Drew Show. Okay. And it was the newspapers at the time had to explain what a

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:23.200
 podcast was, which is the report I read said a podcast is, or this particular podcast is a

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:27.920
 program filled with strong language that is available only in a digital format and downloaded

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.720
 on iPods and other devices that play MP3 files. Okay. So that's what a podcast is. And this one

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:38.960
 was The Dawn and Drew Show. And it was sponsored, it was product placement did by Durex. Okay. And

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:43.920
 Durex had inserted their product into the show because it was hosted by a husband and wife.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:49.200
 And the show featured the husband and the wife and their dog Hercules tasting flavoured condoms.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:55.520
 That was the first ever product placement podcast. Okay. The firm said they were delighted and they

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.200
 said, this is quotes exactly how we want to position the branch.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.720
 Were they condoms for dogs and humans alike?

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.280
 Like, no, because you'd have to have a dog meat flavoured condom.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.000
 Oh, they don't love strawberry today.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.400
 Oh my God, that's incredible.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.000
 So anyway, I'm just saying we've got further to sink before we hit rock bottom.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.720
 You know, your, this has not been a product placement, but we're recording this podcast on

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.880
 Mac computer. And we're all good guys.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:32.000
 Now, if you were to close that and don't close it because we might lose the recording,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.880
 but you would see that the Apple is upside down as you're looking at it. So maybe if you half

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:42.160
 close it, you see it's kind of upside down as you're looking. Now, the reason that is is for

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:50.000
 product placement reasons. So it was in Legally Blonde, which is a properly great film. She is

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.680
 using an Apple Mac, but the Apple is upside down to what we have it today, because that's the way

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.120
 it used to be. Because it makes much more sense that if you have it closed and you're looking at it,

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:04.000
 the Apple is the right way up. And that's how it used to be. But then there was an employee

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.160
 called Joe Moreno who said to Steve Jobs, look, if we're going to put these in movies, what we need

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.960
 is when it's open and you're looking at it, the Apple is the right way up. So they changed it.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.160
 Or if someone's just like watching you in a cafe, of course you've got to put it the right

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.720
 way out for the people looking at it. Not the one who owns it already.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:23.920
 That's really interesting. So basically the Apple on your Apple Mac is not for you. It's for

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:30.080
 everyone else. Wow. Some advertisers, this is sort of the next step they're doing for advertising

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.520
 and things. So advertisers in soap operas are now selling billboards inside the fictional locations

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:41.440
 in the soap operas. So Coronation Street is a fictional street, but it's a fictional street

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:47.280
 with advertising billboards on it. And jewellery shops and other shops are buying up advertising

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.720
 space in fictional Coronation Street. And there's a new thing also that other advertisers are doing

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:58.960
 where you know you'll be able to digitally alter what viewers see on screen when they're streaming.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:05.040
 So different people see different things. So if you are watching, let's say you drink whiskey

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.680
 and your TV knows that you drink whiskey, there might be billboards for whiskey brands in the

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:17.280
 background. Whereas if you... But what if you're a person who like secretly buys dog meat flavored

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:26.400
 condoms? And you're watching Coronation Street with your parents. That's such a good point.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:33.200
 That's such a good point. The whole family looking at each other suspiciously. It's like an Agatha

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:39.440
 Christie. Yeah, exactly. Wow. Well, they might do it based on the time of day even. So if you're

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.200
 watching late at night, there'll be adverts for... That's what y'all do. Watch Coronation Street

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.880
 late at night. Absolutely. Have another late night set. Yeah, there'll be adverts for I guess late

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:54.320
 night stuff like swearing or cocaine. Well, if you're watching in the morning, there'll just be

00:38:54.320 --> 00:39:01.360
 adverts for cereal and orange juice. Or whiskey. Just one ironic thing about this fact is that

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:08.560
 apples are a sign that someone's a villain. What? In films, apparently people have spotted this.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:13.280
 If you're the baddie, you're always eating an apple. Not always. This is a few cross films.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:19.040
 Yep. So, Mr Bond. The bad guys in Doctor Who do that, don't they? Because an apple a day keeps

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:26.640
 the doctor away. This is true. Please send in more if you've seen them. But Draco Malfoy does it.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.880
 Jeffrey Rush in Poe Rats of the Caribbean. It's kind of crunches down an apple. Colin Farrell

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:36.560
 when he's playing a vampire and something or other. And it's got a name. It's the arrogant apple.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.040
 Sometimes it's really just to show your dominance because it's kind of showing you're so aloof.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.600
 I can eat an apple as well as talking to you. I don't give enough of a crap about what you're

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.800
 saying to stop eating my apple. I wonder if there's like the history of the poisoned apple in fairy

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:56.080
 tales and things. That's been theorized on the internet, James. You should check the internet

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:04.400
 out for more on that. Garden of Eden? Again. And apple was eaten there. It's all on the forums.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.480
 It sounds like we could think of everything on the internet, Anna, so I'm not worried.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:18.160
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.080
 in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over the course of this podcast,

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:28.160
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts. I'm on @Sriberland, James. At James Harkin. Andy.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:34.000
 At Andrew Hunter M. At Jizitski. You can email podcast at qi.com. Yeah, well, you can go to our

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.800
 group account at no such thing or our website, no such thing as a fish.com. Why not check the

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.600
 internet out as well while you're there? And we'll be back again next week with another episode. We'll

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:54.560
 see you then. Goodbye. Anyway, I was sponsored this week of the new Durex range of pedigree chum.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:08.080
 Stop the podcast.
