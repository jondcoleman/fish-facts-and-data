00:00:11,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:19,00:00:23,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:25,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:25,00:00:28,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:28,00:00:32,"and it's the original QI Elf and author of the new children's books,"
00:00:32,00:00:35,"Wonders of the World's Museums, Molly Oldfield,"
00:00:35,00:00:38,and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four
00:00:38,00:00:42,"favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,"
00:00:42,00:00:45,"here we go. Starting with you, Molly."
00:00:45,00:00:51,"My fact is, Blue L's are born backwards tell first so they don't drown during birth."
00:00:51,00:00:52,"Yeah, that's extraordinary."
00:00:52,00:00:55,What I think we can tell is that you are the original QI Elf
00:00:55,00:00:58,because that's typical QI fodder isn't it blue whales?
00:00:58,00:01:00,"Oh, we've got to love a bit of a blue whale."
00:01:00,00:01:01,Yeah.
00:01:01,00:01:02,It's actually really weird.
00:01:02,00:01:04,I googled it to see what they look like.
00:01:04,00:01:06,So obviously the tails coming out first.
00:01:06,00:01:09,"And then I thought, okay, what's it coming out of?"
00:01:09,00:01:11,"I know it sounds ridiculous, but they're mammals, right?"
00:01:11,00:01:14,So am I allowed to see the giant?
00:01:14,00:01:14,Oh yeah.
00:01:14,00:01:16,And I always like do whales have them.
00:01:16,00:01:18,What?
00:01:18,00:01:19,"Obviously they do, right?"
00:01:19,00:01:19,"Yeah, yeah."
00:01:19,00:01:22,So but we spent like so long at QI.
00:01:22,00:01:24,I think I spent about 12 years licking up.
00:01:25,00:01:27,"In fact, James and I were thinking of writing about"
00:01:27,00:01:29,the QI book of genital ignorance.
00:01:29,00:01:30,Do you remember that?
00:01:30,00:01:31,I don't remember that.
00:01:31,00:01:32,That's a great title.
00:01:32,00:01:33,That's a great idea.
00:01:33,00:01:36,I'll be backing off from this project very early.
00:01:36,00:01:43,"But anyway, yeah, so I googled this and there is an expert of wealth giants."
00:01:43,00:01:46,And the scientific American have written an article about her.
00:01:46,00:01:47,She's called Dr. Sarah Messnick.
00:01:47,00:01:49,"And it's really hard to study them, obviously."
00:01:49,00:01:52,So what she does is she looks at Victorian drawings.
00:01:53,00:01:54,She's got a freezer full of them.
00:01:54,00:01:56,She has people if they ever find one.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"I'm sorry, a freezer full of whales for giants."
00:01:58,00:01:59,"Yes, exactly."
00:01:59,00:02:00,"Not drawings, the real things."
00:02:00,00:02:01,And she also...
00:02:01,00:02:03,That must be a big fridge.
00:02:03,00:02:03,"Well, right."
00:02:03,00:02:04,A blue whale's want to stay big.
00:02:04,00:02:06,You can walk inside it.
00:02:06,00:02:09,"And the strange thing, every single way."
00:02:09,00:02:11,But how do you fit that in your freezer?
00:02:11,00:02:12,"I mean, you need a walk in freezer."
00:02:12,00:02:16,"You could make the freezer out of the vagina, couldn't you?"
00:02:16,00:02:20,"Also, the other thing she does is she gets people who are like"
00:02:20,00:02:22,whale experts but love diving to like swim down
00:02:22,00:02:24,and try and like put little cameras on the whale
00:02:24,00:02:26,so that she can see T-scan them.
00:02:26,00:02:31,And she said that it's a total gauntlet in there.
00:02:31,00:02:32,"Are very fat, well done."
00:02:32,00:02:35,"When we open it up, there were so many structures in there"
00:02:35,00:02:37,that we couldn't figure out how a sperm would possibly be able to swim
00:02:37,00:02:38,from one end to the other.
00:02:38,00:02:43,"So basically, whales inside, they've got like flaps, folds,"
00:02:43,00:02:46,"blind alleys and funnels, and a dizzying maze for sperm."
00:02:46,00:02:50,"So the reason for this possibly is, is that because they're in water,"
00:02:50,00:02:53,they don't want water going up there.
00:02:53,00:02:54,"So, you know, that's a way to keep them out."
00:02:54,00:02:57,"Keep the water out, have lots of little sort of blind alleys"
00:02:57,00:02:58,and funnels and mazes.
00:02:58,00:02:59,"Oh, okay, right."
00:02:59,00:03:00,But they don't really know why.
00:03:00,00:03:01,But how about with the birth then?
00:03:01,00:03:02,"Why is it, why, because if they came..."
00:03:02,00:03:03,Why they came up to tell first?
00:03:03,00:03:04,Yeah.
00:03:04,00:03:06,"Well, it's so that as they're being born,"
00:03:06,00:03:07,they can still breathe.
00:03:07,00:03:10,"Because if they came out head first, then they would just drown."
00:03:10,00:03:11,But surely whales breathe there.
00:03:11,00:03:13,"Right, they come up to the surface to breathe."
00:03:13,00:03:16,"Yeah, so they, if they're being born underwater,"
00:03:16,00:03:18,they won't be able to start breathing whichever
00:03:18,00:03:19,and well comes out first.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"So, what happens is, often with whales,"
00:03:22,00:03:24,they'll have a load of mates of the mother.
00:03:24,00:03:25,Midwives?
00:03:25,00:03:27,"Yeah, they're known as midwives, right?"
00:03:27,00:03:29,And they'll kind of take the baby up
00:03:29,00:03:31,so it can have its first breath to make sure
00:03:31,00:03:32,it doesn't just drown there.
00:03:32,00:03:35,"And also, their umbilical cord is like perforated."
00:03:35,00:03:37,"And so, it kind of comes apart really quickly."
00:03:37,00:03:38,Wow.
00:03:38,00:03:38,Cool.
00:03:38,00:03:39,That's amazing.
00:03:39,00:03:42,Have you heard about whale placenta?
00:03:42,00:03:42,No.
00:03:42,00:03:45,"It just floats off, looking like a big plastic bag in the water."
00:03:45,00:03:46,It's very exciting recently.
00:03:46,00:03:47,One floated past a white.
00:03:47,00:03:51,"And everyone, everyone in Hawaii gathered at the water's edge to watch it go."
00:03:51,00:03:52,She's all the animals in the research.
00:03:52,00:03:53,I would imagine that.
00:03:53,00:03:55,"I think it probably becomes food for other animals, yeah."
00:03:55,00:03:55,Yeah.
00:03:55,00:04:00,"Um, yeah, I picked the fact about the Blue Whale"
00:04:00,00:04:02,because it's like what a fact from my book.
00:04:02,00:04:03,And I wrote about the Blue Whale.
00:04:03,00:04:05,He's at the Natural History Museum called Hope.
00:04:05,00:04:08,"And when I went there with a little kid, she said to me,"
00:04:08,00:04:12,"""Do you, can Blue Whales talk to killer whales?"
00:04:12,00:04:13,"What do you think?"""
00:04:13,00:04:13,No.
00:04:13,00:04:15,"Oh, I'd say..."
00:04:15,00:04:16,I'd say different language.
00:04:16,00:04:17,I'd say yes.
00:04:17,00:04:20,I'd say you could sort of shout in Blue Whale
00:04:20,00:04:22,and put on the killer whale accent.
00:04:22,00:04:23,Yeah.
00:04:23,00:04:24,Or you could get the gist.
00:04:24,00:04:26,"You'd be like, ""I think they want to eat me."""
00:04:26,00:04:29,"Doss, squids, poor five all, that kind of thing."
00:04:29,00:04:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:04:30,00:04:31,But a killer whale isn't a whale.
00:04:31,00:04:32,"Yeah, right. It's a dolphin."
00:04:32,00:04:35,"So it makes more, like, clicking, wearing noises."
00:04:35,00:04:39,"And Blue Whale obviously, like, makes deep singing, I don't know, noises."
00:04:39,00:04:41,But I don't know.
00:04:41,00:04:42,Because a killer whale...
00:04:42,00:04:45,"They're called killer whales because they killed whales, right?"
00:04:45,00:04:47,They were originally called whale killers
00:04:47,00:04:48,and then they got flipped around.
00:04:48,00:04:49,"Ah, nice."
00:04:49,00:04:52,"But humans can talk to other animals,"
00:04:52,00:04:54,and other animals can kind of communicate with each other.
00:04:54,00:04:55,"We can talk to dogs, kind of."
00:04:55,00:04:57,We can talk to whoever we want.
00:04:57,00:04:57,Yeah.
00:04:57,00:04:59,Whether they understand us or not.
00:04:59,00:05:03,"So a baby blue whale, for its first year,"
00:05:03,00:05:06,"gains £200 every day, which is about my weight."
00:05:06,00:05:07,Wow.
00:05:07,00:05:10,"So it's like, after day one, it's like,"
00:05:10,00:05:12,"I then go into the whale,"
00:05:12,00:05:13,"and then day two, another one of me,"
00:05:13,00:05:15,"and day three, another one of me, for a whole year,"
00:05:15,00:05:16,until they're absolutely humongous.
00:05:16,00:05:18,"And that's all, is that all krill?"
00:05:18,00:05:21,Or do they get some sort of other food source for the mumps?
00:05:21,00:05:23,"They mumps the milk, the milk and the mumps."
00:05:23,00:05:25,200 litres of milk a day.
00:05:25,00:05:26,Wow.
00:05:26,00:05:28,"That's a very weird mental image, James."
00:05:28,00:05:31,"Kind of just say, a whale made up of 365 years."
00:05:31,00:05:31,Yeah.
00:05:31,00:05:33,All kind of tied together.
00:05:33,00:05:34,Imagine I'm Jonah.
00:05:34,00:05:35,Yeah.
00:05:35,00:05:37,Only baby whales like to eat me.
00:05:37,00:05:39,Yeah.
00:05:39,00:05:41,But they're doing it again and again.
00:05:41,00:05:43,"And I'm cloning myself, obviously, in this metaphor."
00:05:43,00:05:46,How can you use it if it takes to make up one blue whale?
00:05:46,00:05:46,A lot.
00:05:46,00:05:50,"So, for instance, an adult blue whale"
00:05:50,00:05:52,eats about four tons of krill a day.
00:05:52,00:05:53,"Oh, okay."
00:05:53,00:05:58,"And by weight, that's the equivalent of eating 26,000 Greg Stake Bakes"
00:05:58,00:06:00,"a day, which is one every three seconds."
00:06:00,00:06:02,"Oh, what is a steak bake?"
00:06:02,00:06:04,I know.
00:06:04,00:06:05,It's a glorious thing.
00:06:05,00:06:08,"It's like a sausage roll, but it's got a steak in it instead."
00:06:08,00:06:08,Yeah.
00:06:08,00:06:09,It's like a pasty.
00:06:09,00:06:10,"Right, got you."
00:06:10,00:06:11,It's very nice.
00:06:11,00:06:13,"Yeah, but you wouldn't want to eat one every three seconds"
00:06:13,00:06:14,for the rest of your life.
00:06:14,00:06:18,Would you go on with life if you had to do that?
00:06:18,00:06:19,Yeah.
00:06:19,00:06:20,"Yeah, totally."
00:06:20,00:06:23,"So, you don't get full because you've got a much bigger stomach."
00:06:23,00:06:23,Yeah.
00:06:23,00:06:25,"Like, if you're the giant as the size of a fridge,"
00:06:25,00:06:28,"then your stomach's probably the size of, you know,"
00:06:28,00:06:30,maybe a whole warehouse full of fridges.
00:06:30,00:06:30,Yeah.
00:06:30,00:06:33,"So, you're not going to get full all the time with these steak bakes."
00:06:33,00:06:34,And you've got a big mouth.
00:06:34,00:06:35,You can eat more than one in time.
00:06:35,00:06:37,You don't need to do the three-second separation.
00:06:37,00:06:38,I guess so.
00:06:38,00:06:39,"It's, yeah, it's funny."
00:06:39,00:06:42,"So, imagine you, Daniel, are having to eat one every three seconds."
00:06:42,00:06:42,Yes.
00:06:42,00:06:46,"Especially, they feed in this, like, it's called the,"
00:06:46,00:06:48,"the blue-else feed in the lunging position,"
00:06:48,00:06:49,which is actually the position of...
00:06:49,00:06:51,Not the lunging position.
00:06:51,00:06:52,"Which means, isn't it?"
00:06:52,00:06:54,The eternal lunging position.
00:06:54,00:06:56,"And, yeah, that's the, that, you know, they've hung the blue-else"
00:06:56,00:06:58,in from the ceiling.
00:06:58,00:06:59,It's in the feed lunging position.
00:06:59,00:07:01,"So, what they do, they, like, dive down and open their mouths"
00:07:01,00:07:04,and all the krill goes in and then they close their mouths
00:07:04,00:07:07,"and the belly and, like, filters out the water."
00:07:07,00:07:08,"And the krill stays inside, like,"
00:07:08,00:07:09,"little peas, really."
00:07:09,00:07:10,Right.
00:07:10,00:07:12,"I don't know if we've mentioned this on the podcast before,"
00:07:12,00:07:15,"but the blue whale in the Natural History Museum,"
00:07:15,00:07:18,"the one that's made of the massive sort of, like, paper mache."
00:07:18,00:07:20,Do you remember that giant whale that they have?
00:07:20,00:07:22,"A model one, yeah."
00:07:22,00:07:22,"Yeah, the model one."
00:07:22,00:07:24,"So, there's a trap door at the bottom of it"
00:07:24,00:07:27,"and the builders, when they were making"
00:07:27,00:07:29,"all the surrounding rooms and the whale itself,"
00:07:29,00:07:30,used to go in there for breaks.
00:07:30,00:07:32,"And it's a bit of a time capsule now,"
00:07:32,00:07:34,"because inside, there were still old magazines."
00:07:34,00:07:37,"This said to be a mattress because, supposedly,"
00:07:37,00:07:41,"after late-night parties, there were sneaky shag sessions"
00:07:41,00:07:42,going on inside the blue whale.
00:07:42,00:07:45,"We were told, we were told this by curators from there."
00:07:45,00:07:48,Did you have to go in through the freezer-sized vagina?
00:07:48,00:07:51,"But, yeah, inside the blue whale,"
00:07:51,00:07:53,"supposedly, as a time capsule of newspapers"
00:07:53,00:07:54,and there might be a mattress in there and so on.
00:07:54,00:07:56,But the having sex inside a blue whale
00:07:56,00:07:58,definitely happened in Gothenburg
00:07:58,00:07:59,and they also have a trap door.
00:07:59,00:08:01,"And public was allowed to go inside,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,but they stopped it because they found a couple
00:08:03,00:08:04,"in the, doing the..."
00:08:06,00:08:08,"Wow, everything else I've got is very tame compared with this stuff."
00:08:08,00:08:12,They had a cafe in the mouth of this one in Gothenburg
00:08:12,00:08:15,and they used to have religious people would go there
00:08:15,00:08:17,and tell the story of Jonah and the whale
00:08:17,00:08:18,while having their coffee and stuff.
00:08:18,00:08:19,It's not even a whale of a time.
00:08:19,00:08:20,You couldn't get it to...
00:08:20,00:08:25,"You couldn't be swallowed and end up in a stomach of whale, could you?"
00:08:25,00:08:25,Because you'd be...
00:08:25,00:08:28,"Like, because they can only eat krill, right?"
00:08:28,00:08:28,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:28,00:08:30,They've got tiny throats.
00:08:30,00:08:31,"Yeah, the size of the foot..."
00:08:31,00:08:33,"Yeah, the size of a grapefruit we've said on QI, isn't it?"
00:08:33,00:08:36,But you could squeeze through size with grapefruit on it.
00:08:36,00:08:38,"It's not going to be really solid, is it?"
00:08:38,00:08:40,"It's going to be like mussely,"
00:08:40,00:08:42,"but I reckon you could squeeze through, no?"
00:08:42,00:08:43,I'd just...
00:08:43,00:08:44,"Imagine trying to eat a meal, though,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,that was trying to get through...
00:08:46,00:08:47,That was too big.
00:08:47,00:08:49,Imagine a lump of gristle that was trying to get into your stomach.
00:08:49,00:08:50,It was too big.
00:08:50,00:08:50,I think you'd choke.
00:08:50,00:08:54,"Yeah, but it's better to have them helping you swallow it."
00:08:54,00:08:56,"The gristle, if you have food that helps you swallow it,"
00:08:56,00:08:57,if that would make life a lot easier.
00:08:57,00:09:00,If the grang steak bag wants to be eaten...
00:09:00,00:09:02,"Oh, it's slightly down your throat."
00:09:02,00:09:04,"You're like an artist, so I can."
00:09:04,00:09:08,"Come on, there's the other of my buddies, two and a half seconds behind me."
00:09:08,00:09:09,Let's go. Let's go.
00:09:09,00:09:10,"Go, go, go."
00:09:10,00:09:19,"Okay, it's time to move on to fact number two, and that is James."
00:09:19,00:09:23,"Okay, my fact this week is that during the Qing dynasty in China,"
00:09:23,00:09:25,"when the weather got hot in the summer,"
00:09:25,00:09:28,people would swap their pillows for ceramic ones.
00:09:28,00:09:29,Ceramic?
00:09:29,00:09:33,"What an uncomfortable day it must have been like the first day of using a ceramic pillow,"
00:09:33,00:09:34,after having a lovely soft pillow.
00:09:34,00:09:35,Do you think?
00:09:35,00:09:37,"I guess your pillow would be nice and cool, which is good."
00:09:37,00:09:38,Yeah.
00:09:38,00:09:39,Which is the advantage of doing it.
00:09:39,00:09:42,"Well, we're in the hottest day of the year today, aren't we?"
00:09:42,00:09:45,"This is going to go out in a few weeks when it's probably pissing it down again,"
00:09:45,00:09:46,but this is the hottest day of the year.
00:09:46,00:09:48,I'm this morning when you're in bed.
00:09:48,00:09:50,Would you not have killed for a ceramic pillow?
00:09:50,00:09:51,I would have loved a ceramic pillow right now.
00:09:51,00:09:52,Yeah.
00:09:52,00:09:53,"Actually, that would be awful."
00:09:53,00:09:55,Imagine a pillow fight with a ceramic pillow.
00:09:55,00:09:56,Yeah.
00:09:56,00:10:00,What do you want now?
00:10:00,00:10:05,"There was a pillow fight in 2015 between a load of army cadets in America,"
00:10:05,00:10:08,"and they decided, for some reason,"
00:10:08,00:10:13,"instead of having a normal harmless pillow fight that they put helmets in the pillows,"
00:10:13,00:10:16,"and as a result, at least 30 cadets were injured,"
00:10:16,00:10:20,"24 suffered concussions, and there were three broken arms,"
00:10:20,00:10:22,"one broken neck, and many missing teeth."
00:10:22,00:10:23,"One broken neck, currently."
00:10:23,00:10:26,Wow. That is bad. I read about that.
00:10:26,00:10:29,"It's a West Point military academy, and it was this great tradition."
00:10:29,00:10:31,It happened every year since 1897.
00:10:31,00:10:35,"And after 2015, they said, well, maybe no more of this."
00:10:35,00:10:37,Isn't that crazy?
00:10:37,00:10:38,"Yeah, that is."
00:10:38,00:10:40,Pillow fights used to be used a lot for early cinema.
00:10:40,00:10:43,There's a lot of examples of some of the early movies that were made.
00:10:43,00:10:47,"Those black and white ones that are called, like the first example in 1897"
00:10:47,00:10:51,"was just called a pillow fight, and it's just people having a pillow fight."
00:10:51,00:10:55,"And then it was remade. Well, there was a follow-up called new pillow fight."
00:10:55,00:10:57,"Yeah, what happened then?"
00:10:57,00:11:01,"Yeah, it was just more, um, yeah, I guess, you know, the second installment."
00:11:01,00:11:03,They did the helmets inside the pillow.
00:11:03,00:11:08,"No, but what they read is, the reason it was very good for cinema"
00:11:08,00:11:12,"is because you could see the fight starting small, and feathers would come out."
00:11:12,00:11:16,"And as the fight escalated, and they got harder, more feathers would come out,"
00:11:16,00:11:21,so the audience were able to properly see the intensity of a fight as it got heavier and heavier.
00:11:21,00:11:25,It was just great for early cinema to have that as an effect of visual.
00:11:25,00:11:28,"So yeah, a lot of pillow fights in early cinema."
00:11:28,00:11:29,Have you guys heard of a pillow fought?
00:11:29,00:11:31,"That's a phrase, yeah?"
00:11:31,00:11:32,"Yeah, when you build yourself."
00:11:32,00:11:34,"Yeah, when you build a fort out of post, okay."
00:11:34,00:11:38,"There is a park in America, which is called Fort Pillow."
00:11:38,00:11:39,That's its name.
00:11:39,00:11:42,And it's named after a US and Confederacy general.
00:11:42,00:11:44,His name was Gideon Johnson Pillow.
00:11:44,00:11:46,It's got a very comfy man.
00:11:48,00:11:51,"I'm just about to put my head down, sleeping on his fat tummy."
00:11:51,00:11:52,Was it really fat?
00:11:52,00:11:56,"I don't know if he was fat or not, but he was not a nice man."
00:11:56,00:11:57,He wouldn't have wanted a cuddle.
00:11:57,00:11:59,"Yeah, no, he was a bad dude."
00:11:59,00:12:03,"But I don't think it's got anything to do with pillow fights, and it's called Fort Pillow."
00:12:03,00:12:08,"I've been trying to find out the first use of the phrase ""Pillow fought"""
00:12:08,00:12:09,to see if Fort Pillow predates it.
00:12:09,00:12:10,I can't find it.
00:12:10,00:12:14,"Pillow, what a terrible name for his general."
00:12:14,00:12:16,"Hello, General Pillow."
00:12:16,00:12:19,Was he General?
00:12:19,00:12:19,Captain Pillow.
00:12:19,00:12:21,He was a general Pillow.
00:12:21,00:12:22,He was a Brigadier General.
00:12:22,00:12:23,He was very senior in the army.
00:12:23,00:12:26,The record is his name that made him such an angry man.
00:12:26,00:12:34,"So I got this fact from the Christie's website, the auctioneers."
00:12:34,00:12:38,"They had, there was an article about 100 things we learned from Christie's."
00:12:38,00:12:40,I'll give you a few more of those before we go on to the market.
00:12:40,00:12:44,Napoleon was allergic to leather in France.
00:12:44,00:12:49,First edition comic books sell for much less than the original plates that we used to make them.
00:12:49,00:12:51,"That's the fact, isn't it?"
00:12:51,00:12:57,"And Andy Warhol once wrote in his diaries that ""Dabby Davito was so cute we should all marry him."""
00:12:57,00:13:02,"Wow, that is two pop culture names I did not expect to come together."
00:13:02,00:13:04,"Davito, as well, isn't he?"
00:13:04,00:13:05,Davito.
00:13:05,00:13:08,Is that how you just look at people who are slightly everywhere?
00:13:08,00:13:08,"Hello, Ian."
00:13:08,00:13:13,That means like Tommy Utilipan.
00:13:13,00:13:14,"Tommy Utilipan, right?"
00:13:14,00:13:18,"There was someone who, who was it who slept on the stomach of..."
00:13:18,00:13:19,"Um, I know who it was."
00:13:19,00:13:20,Was it Genghis Khan or something?
00:13:20,00:13:22,"No, it was."
00:13:22,00:13:24,I think it was Peter the Great.
00:13:24,00:13:25,That's right.
00:13:25,00:13:29,He had a great use to use a young male secretary's stomach as a pillow.
00:13:29,00:13:33,"He referred his wife, but if he was a way traveling and his wife was an available,"
00:13:33,00:13:34,he had his...
00:13:34,00:13:36,...bring in general pillow at once.
00:13:36,00:13:39,"But you couldn't turn him over, could you?"
00:13:39,00:13:42,"Because if you turn over that person, you've got a bony back."
00:13:42,00:13:45,Yeah. He's got a bum. The bum. He's just having a slid out of it.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"Don't really do that, though, do you?"
00:13:47,00:13:48,"No, it's not ideal."
00:13:48,00:13:51,"No, but you would want the man's tummy."
00:13:51,00:13:56,"Right. It's different, isn't it? There's less going on in the stomach."
00:13:56,00:13:57,Rumbling if it's hungry.
00:13:57,00:14:00,"Yeah, that's true. You don't have to be well fed."
00:14:00,00:14:02,"Sorry, what were we talking about?"
00:14:02,00:14:04,"I mean, pillow's a long time ago."
00:14:04,00:14:09,"Um, yes, so, um, Chinese, um, people, they used to use ceramic pillows."
00:14:09,00:14:11,"Well, actually, James, they still do."
00:14:11,00:14:13,I've got someone staying with me and she's from Singapore.
00:14:13,00:14:17,And she said her aunt still uses ceramic pillows.
00:14:17,00:14:18,Cool. Is that right? Very cool.
00:14:18,00:14:19,Just in the summer off.
00:14:19,00:14:21,"They just stopped talking to her aunt recently, but..."
00:14:21,00:14:24,...following a pillow fight where...
00:14:24,00:14:29,"But because they lived in small, um, living spaces,"
00:14:29,00:14:32,"they would be, um, decorative as well."
00:14:32,00:14:36,"Um, and they would be given as wedding gifts and they'd be kind of a sign of,"
00:14:36,00:14:40,"you know, wishes for many happy years of marriage or offspring or whatever."
00:14:40,00:14:42,"Some of them were, um, shaped."
00:14:42,00:14:46,"So there were lion-shaped ones which would scare off evil spirits, which is useful."
00:14:46,00:14:47,There were some shaped-like frogs.
00:14:47,00:14:50,And there was a fashion for some shaped-like sleeping children.
00:14:50,00:14:51,Hmm. Yeah.
00:14:51,00:14:56,"Yeah, I think they thought that, like, pillows could commune between the spirit world and human world."
00:14:56,00:14:58,"So they'd put, like, children playing on them to, like,"
00:14:58,00:15:01,bring children into the family or specific.
00:15:01,00:15:05,"There's one in the Met in New York that's got a drawing of two boys playing in Piennes,"
00:15:05,00:15:09,"which is a partner to ensure, like, baby boys and airs would come along."
00:15:09,00:15:11,And there's one in the British Museum.
00:15:11,00:15:14,"Um, that is in the shape of a woman lying down with her head on a pillow."
00:15:14,00:15:18,"Um, and yeah, on the concave bit of the woman around her hip where you put your head."
00:15:18,00:15:20,"There's a lovely poem which says,"
00:15:20,00:15:23,"""The wind rustles flowers under a snow white moon."""
00:15:23,00:15:27,"I, I read this and I can't quite believe it, which is that in medieval times,"
00:15:27,00:15:30,"pillows were really for, for people who are a bit weedy."
00:15:30,00:15:31,Yeah.
00:15:31,00:15:34,They were only for the elderly or pregnant women.
00:15:34,00:15:35,"They still are, actually."
00:15:35,00:15:38,"I sleep on a, I sleep on a piece of tube, I fall with nails stuck there."
00:15:38,00:15:40,Take the man out of Bolton.
00:15:40,00:15:46,"I do have a reason why you should throw your pillows away, James,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,and go back to that piece of tube before with nails in it.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"Why is that, Andy?"
00:15:50,00:15:53,"There was a study by the University of Manchester, which took pillows,"
00:15:53,00:15:55,which have been used for various lengths of time.
00:15:55,00:16:01,And they found several thousand spools of fungus per gram of pillow.
00:16:01,00:16:03,They found 47 different species of fungus.
00:16:03,00:16:06,"So that's, that might be what you're sleeping on."
00:16:06,00:16:09,"Yeah, I read that a third of the weight of any pillow,"
00:16:09,00:16:12,"if you've been using it for ages, is dead skin."
00:16:12,00:16:14,"I think that's my, some people think that might be true."
00:16:14,00:16:17,"Some people think that might have been the rumour put about by pillow,"
00:16:17,00:16:19,"might be facturists, by big pillow."
00:16:19,00:16:20,That big guy.
00:16:20,00:16:22,"No, you would think, wouldn't you?"
00:16:22,00:16:23,And it's not just dead skin.
00:16:23,00:16:25,It's also house-might corpses.
00:16:25,00:16:28,"And house-might eggs can run and, I'm living house-mights, I know what it is."
00:16:28,00:16:31,But if it was one third of an entire pillow.
00:16:31,00:16:33,"You would, that's a lot of a pillow."
00:16:33,00:16:35,You would think you could tell if just one end was just your skin.
00:16:35,00:16:38,"Yeah, that's true."
00:16:38,00:16:40,"Mind you, but we sleep with pillowcases, right?"
00:16:40,00:16:42,So it doesn't have all the gross stuff going on there and then you change it.
00:16:42,00:16:43,And then you wash it.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"Wow, I know who washes up pillow."
00:16:45,00:16:46,You put a pillowcase around a turd.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"It's still a turd, isn't it?"
00:16:48,00:16:50,"It's still bad, yeah."
00:16:50,00:16:51,So even that is true.
00:16:51,00:16:56,"Hitler's pillowcase, I'm afraid we've reached the Hitler bit of the podcast."
00:16:56,00:16:59,His pillowcase was not only monogram with his initials.
00:16:59,00:17:01,It had an eagle and the swastika on it.
00:17:01,00:17:04,"Yeah, it was auctioned in 2011."
00:17:04,00:17:07,"And a pillowcase on a sheet was over £2,000."
00:17:07,00:17:08,That's not much.
00:17:08,00:17:10,"It's not, well, come on, the Hitler's pillowcase."
00:17:10,00:17:15,I didn't realise we had a collector in the room.
00:17:15,00:17:17,I didn't lock up for that.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Okay.
00:17:18,00:17:21,Do you want to random swastika facts?
00:17:21,00:17:22,I got two actually.
00:17:22,00:17:26,"One, the oldest bit of human writing ever found it's got a swastika in it."
00:17:26,00:17:31,"And two, the word swastika is Sanskrit and it means kind of lucky, how fortunate."
00:17:33,00:17:34,"Yes, Hindu symbol."
00:17:34,00:17:34,The oldest writing.
00:17:34,00:17:39,So that's the ancient Hindu Indo-European Sanskrit?
00:17:39,00:17:41,"No, it's not, it's pre-Sanskrit."
00:17:41,00:17:44,"Yeah, it's proto-Sanskrit, proto-European."
00:17:44,00:17:47,"You know, if you get to a hotel and you don't like your pillow,"
00:17:47,00:17:48,you can order a pillow menu.
00:17:48,00:17:49,Not in all hotels.
00:17:49,00:17:51,"Not all hotels, but we've just finished a tour."
00:17:51,00:17:55,And I don't think a single one of the hotels that we stated had a pillow menu.
00:17:55,00:17:58,"Yeah, sorry, I should have said so-so in hotels."
00:17:58,00:17:59,Provided pillow menu.
00:18:00,00:18:03,"I've worked in hotels that had pillows, yeah, yeah."
00:18:03,00:18:07,"And they would be like, let's say you had an anti-allergen pillow."
00:18:07,00:18:12,You might have that or hard or soft or general pillows tummy or whatever.
00:18:12,00:18:14,"Or pillow with, I'd like one with an eagle in a swastika right?"
00:18:14,00:18:16,Please do you have one of those?
00:18:16,00:18:26,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact."
00:18:26,00:18:31,My fact this week is that Oscar Wilde ate his books as he read them.
00:18:31,00:18:37,"This was, there was a book that was written by Thomas Wright called ""Bilt of Books,"
00:18:37,00:18:40,"How Reading Defined the Life of Oscar Wilde""."
00:18:40,00:18:42,"In it, he reveals that as Oscar Wilde was reading books,"
00:18:42,00:18:46,he would tear off the top corner of each page once he'd read it and eat it
00:18:46,00:18:48,and then keep moving on.
00:18:48,00:18:49,It was just the habit of his that he did-
00:18:49,00:18:51,"Instead of having like a bookmark, right?"
00:18:51,00:18:52,"I guess so, yes."
00:18:52,00:18:54,So wherever the chomp has been taken out of the corner.
00:18:54,00:18:56,"Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:18:56,00:18:58,Why don't we all do that?
00:18:58,00:19:00,"Well, have you ever eaten paper?"
00:19:00,00:19:00,Yeah.
00:19:00,00:19:01,Do you like it?
00:19:01,00:19:02,I don't mind it.
00:19:02,00:19:04,It's not my favourite.
00:19:04,00:19:05,It's no Greg's steak bake.
00:19:05,00:19:08,I think it's not that nice eating paper.
00:19:08,00:19:09,I think in a small amount it's fine.
00:19:09,00:19:12,I've been reading a lot on Oscar Wilde recently.
00:19:12,00:19:15,That's one of the fun facts that I discovered.
00:19:15,00:19:16,Eat the books as you read them.
00:19:16,00:19:17,"No, I didn't."
00:19:17,00:19:19,It's the internet. He was reading them.
00:19:19,00:19:20,I think you could eat them.
00:19:20,00:19:23,"If you're reading online, you have to take a bite."
00:19:23,00:19:24,"Oh, good."
00:19:24,00:19:25,Very nice.
00:19:25,00:19:27,"So there was an exhibition not too long ago,"
00:19:27,00:19:30,"2016 in Reading Prison, where they showed all of the books"
00:19:30,00:19:33,that Oscar Wilde had while he was in prison.
00:19:33,00:19:33,He did it.
00:19:33,00:19:34,And they did it.
00:19:34,00:19:36,"Yes, it's an empty exhibition."
00:19:36,00:19:39,"But basically, when he was in jail,"
00:19:39,00:19:42,"you weren't really allowed to have access to books,"
00:19:42,00:19:45,but because he was such a prominent figure.
00:19:45,00:19:47,He was the only one who was allowed.
00:19:47,00:19:50,"Basically, they have a special dispensation for him, right?"
00:19:50,00:19:52,"Yeah, he was allowed to keep his light on at night,"
00:19:52,00:19:53,longer than everyone else.
00:19:53,00:19:57,So what I like about it is that Reading Jail was the only reading jail.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Wow.
00:19:58,00:19:59,Very nice.
00:19:59,00:20:00,Yes.
00:20:00,00:20:02,I read that I'm a bit ahead on the details.
00:20:02,00:20:05,"I think he was allowed, it was technically a long letter"
00:20:05,00:20:07,that the governor of the prison allowed him to write.
00:20:07,00:20:09,Because you were allowed to write a letter.
00:20:09,00:20:09,Oh.
00:20:09,00:20:12,But he was writing a huge long...
00:20:12,00:20:14,"Oh, so this is the righting path."
00:20:14,00:20:15,Deeper fundus.
00:20:15,00:20:16,"Deeper fundus, exactly."
00:20:16,00:20:18,"Yeah, so that was when he was in prison being allowed to write."
00:20:18,00:20:19,"Yes, yeah."
00:20:19,00:20:21,"And we see it, interestingly, as a letter,"
00:20:21,00:20:24,because it starts dear Bozy to his lover
00:20:24,00:20:28,and who he ended up going to prison as a result of the relationship with.
00:20:28,00:20:31,And Bozy never read it until after Oscar Wilde had died.
00:20:31,00:20:34,"It was never written to be a private letter to him,"
00:20:34,00:20:35,done in long form.
00:20:35,00:20:36,It was meant to be published.
00:20:36,00:20:40,"And it was written and sent to a publisher, as opposed to Bozy himself."
00:20:40,00:20:43,"So yeah, it was a good cheat that he pulled off."
00:20:43,00:20:47,"Oh, it's a huge sort of philosophic."
00:20:47,00:20:50,"It's his deepest work, I think, that Oscar Wilde did just life."
00:20:50,00:20:54,And why he was in there and what people thought about sex
00:20:54,00:20:56,"and gender and all that sort of stuff, I think."
00:20:56,00:20:58,And he's pretty rude about Bozy in it.
00:20:58,00:21:01,Because Bozy encouraged him to sue for libel
00:21:01,00:21:05,when Bozy's father had been extremely rude about world and public
00:21:05,00:21:07,and said that the cost would be covered and all of this.
00:21:07,00:21:09,"And as it was, the libel truck collapsed."
00:21:09,00:21:13,"Oscar Wilde was sued for what time was gross in decency,"
00:21:13,00:21:14,"being gay, basically."
00:21:14,00:21:16,"And as a result, went to prison."
00:21:16,00:21:19,So he's quite annoyed with Bozy in bits of it.
00:21:19,00:21:22,"You know that he, supposedly his last words were"
00:21:22,00:21:24,"my wallpaper and I fighting a Jewel to the death,"
00:21:24,00:21:26,one or one or either of us has to go.
00:21:26,00:21:29,So I knew I'd to find out what his wallpaper was like.
00:21:29,00:21:30,[LAUGHS]
00:21:30,00:21:33,"Because it must have been pretty horrible, right?"
00:21:33,00:21:34,I think you'd find that.
00:21:34,00:21:35,I didn't.
00:21:35,00:21:38,"But I found out that his wallpaper in his own house,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,"back in London, because he died in Paris in a hotel, right?"
00:21:40,00:21:44,"He, in his own house, he had a drawing room with dragons painted"
00:21:44,00:21:45,all over a blue ceiling.
00:21:45,00:21:48,"And his wallpaper was, had peacock feathers."
00:21:48,00:21:51,It was like peacock feathers all set into the plaster of the walls.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"And then I don't know whether the hotel in Paris,"
00:21:53,00:21:55,"where he died, knows this, because they've"
00:21:55,00:21:58,"re-decorated the Oscar Wilde room, where he died,"
00:21:58,00:22:01,with a fresco of kissing peacocks.
00:22:01,00:22:03,And the other thing that's on show in there is the bill
00:22:03,00:22:06,"from his hotel's day, where he, when he died."
00:22:06,00:22:07,And he never paid it.
00:22:07,00:22:10,"And apparently he said, I am dying above my means."
00:22:10,00:22:11,"Mm, yeah."
00:22:11,00:22:13,"But I don't think that they were his final words,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,where they were their wallpaper thing.
00:22:15,00:22:19,So he had an operation just before he died.
00:22:19,00:22:22,"And while he was recuperating, he said that last words."
00:22:22,00:22:25,"And he said a few other last words as well, saying I can't"
00:22:25,00:22:27,even afford to die and things like that.
00:22:27,00:22:30,"But when he actually died, I don't think he was in any fit"
00:22:30,00:22:32,"states, be making whizzes and so on."
00:22:32,00:22:35,"James, you just read the whole lovely ending."
00:22:35,00:22:37,It was definitely nearly his love.
00:22:37,00:22:38,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:38,00:22:39,So I read a thing.
00:22:39,00:22:41,"Andy and I were talking about the downstairs,"
00:22:41,00:22:44,"because there's a sense that it's been debunked,"
00:22:44,00:22:47,this fact that I'm about to say.
00:22:47,00:22:49,"But I read it in a Christopher Hitchens article,"
00:22:49,00:22:51,where he talks about the hidden--
00:22:51,00:22:54,the hidden sort of innuendos that was all the way
00:22:54,00:22:57,"through the importance of being earnest, the play."
00:22:57,00:23:00,So Christopher Hitchens says that the word earnest used
00:23:00,00:23:03,"to be Victorian slang for, if you were homosexual."
00:23:03,00:23:07,"So the idea was, Oscar Wilde loved the idea on the marquee."
00:23:07,00:23:09,It was effectively saying the importance of being gay
00:23:09,00:23:13,was his big sort of hidden message that was underneath it.
00:23:13,00:23:16,And that seems to have been slightly debunked.
00:23:16,00:23:18,"But it's interesting, because Hitchens brings up"
00:23:18,00:23:20,a bunch of different examples where he
00:23:20,00:23:23,ceded sort of hidden meanings within the play.
00:23:23,00:23:25,"So for example, there's a character,"
00:23:25,00:23:26,a minor character called Bloxham.
00:23:26,00:23:29,Bloxham was famous at the time as an editor
00:23:29,00:23:32,"of a magazine, a gay magazine called The Chameleon."
00:23:32,00:23:34,And he was a very controversial character.
00:23:34,00:23:36,Cessely was one of the characters' names
00:23:36,00:23:38,of one of the high society girls.
00:23:38,00:23:40,"That, according to Hitchens, was vernacular"
00:23:40,00:23:44,for transvestite rent boys back in the day.
00:23:44,00:23:47,And just lots of little bits of hidden hints
00:23:47,00:23:50,towards the two main male characters
00:23:50,00:23:52,having alternative lives that they're trying
00:23:52,00:23:56,to hide was a suggestion that they were both themselves gay.
00:23:56,00:23:59,And if there was a missing handbag in--
00:23:59,00:24:00,A handbag.
00:24:00,00:24:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:02,00:24:04,Very nice.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"Where-- and supposedly sort of meetup places,"
00:24:07,00:24:11,"where guys would go to meetup sort of illegally,"
00:24:11,00:24:15,would be places like lost property places and so on.
00:24:15,00:24:18,"So another thing that you were telling me, Dan,"
00:24:18,00:24:20,is about the mark was of Queen's Brie.
00:24:20,00:24:21,"Yes, yeah."
00:24:21,00:24:23,"Well, my original fact for this was"
00:24:23,00:24:26,that to protest at the opening of the importance
00:24:26,00:24:29,of being earnest about the relationship of Oscar Wilde
00:24:29,00:24:31,"and Bo C, the marquee of Queen's Brie,"
00:24:31,00:24:34,try to interrupt the premiere with a bouquet
00:24:34,00:24:37,of phallic-shaped vegetables.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"Did you, like, riddle on stage or what did he do?"
00:24:39,00:24:40,That was his plan.
00:24:40,00:24:42,He was going to go inside.
00:24:42,00:24:42,And he went with a posse.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"He went with like a crew, kind of like how Conor McGregor"
00:24:45,00:24:46,recently threw stuff at a bus.
00:24:46,00:24:48,That was kind of the marquee of Queen's Brie.
00:24:48,00:24:51,"Conor McGregor didn't throw phallic vegetables, did he?"
00:24:51,00:24:53,"No, they were phallic chairs."
00:24:53,00:24:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:57,00:25:00,"So do you have to, like, carve a phallic vegetable?"
00:25:00,00:25:02,"No, I don't think so."
00:25:02,00:25:06,"Well, this-- so I think he definitely did take along vegetables."
00:25:06,00:25:08,He took along a bus good vegetable to throw at the stage
00:25:08,00:25:09,and throw out wild and protest.
00:25:09,00:25:12,But I think they weren't especially phallic.
00:25:12,00:25:13,I think they were just carrots and turnips because I--
00:25:13,00:25:15,"But then carrots are quite phallic, aren't they?"
00:25:15,00:25:16,All of them really.
00:25:16,00:25:18,Hasn't it?
00:25:18,00:25:19,"Yeah, yeah."
00:25:19,00:25:20,Cucumber.
00:25:20,00:25:21,"Yeah, OK."
00:25:21,00:25:21,Overgene.
00:25:21,00:25:23,What we're saying is that many vegetables
00:25:23,00:25:26,are kind of a little bit phallic in nature.
00:25:26,00:25:26,Yeah.
00:25:26,00:25:30,And so to say that these were phallic vegetables seems plausible.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"Yeah, but what I don't think is true that the marquis of Queen's"
00:25:32,00:25:34,free went around selecting.
00:25:34,00:25:36,I think that'll be a weird thing to protest against homosexuality
00:25:36,00:25:39,by going around looking for penises wherever you could find it.
00:25:39,00:25:42,And we'd say more about the marquis's own state of mind
00:25:42,00:25:44,than about violence.
00:25:44,00:25:46,But that-- so he wasn't allowed in.
00:25:46,00:25:47,He didn't get led into the plate.
00:25:47,00:25:49,"And then he left a card, I think, at least."
00:25:49,00:25:51,"Sorry, can I just say, did they not let him in"
00:25:51,00:25:53,because he was carrying the vegetables?
00:25:53,00:25:55,"Like, did they-- you know when you go to a gig,"
00:25:55,00:25:57,and they have to check your handbag?
00:25:57,00:25:58,"In case you got, like, some--"
00:25:58,00:26:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:01,00:26:03,"But yeah, so was that the reason why,"
00:26:03,00:26:04,"obviously, because they recognized him?"
00:26:04,00:26:07,I think probably he turned up angry with thugs
00:26:07,00:26:08,and holding vegetables.
00:26:08,00:26:09,"And they thought, oh, it's the opening night."
00:26:09,00:26:10,Let's not take the chance.
00:26:10,00:26:10,Yeah.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"And also, he was famous for going to premieres of theater"
00:26:14,00:26:15,shows to protest them.
00:26:15,00:26:16,That was his thing.
00:26:16,00:26:20,So he went to one play that he was protesting
00:26:20,00:26:22,that they were giving atheists a bad name.
00:26:22,00:26:23,It was only Tennyson.
00:26:23,00:26:25,"He was an above atheist, yeah, that's right."
00:26:25,00:26:28,And then he brought vegetable shape like Jesus.
00:26:28,00:26:29,"Yeah, exactly."
00:26:29,00:26:31,"Well, a lot of vegetables actually look like teens think about it."
00:26:31,00:26:32,Yeah.
00:26:32,00:26:32,Which one?
00:26:32,00:26:34,Nugly.
00:26:34,00:26:38,"Drusula Martichoke, hello."
00:26:38,00:26:40,"Yeah, play actually failed."
00:26:40,00:26:43,"In short, being honest, failed as a result of this trial"
00:26:43,00:26:44,happening.
00:26:44,00:26:45,It closed after 83 performances.
00:26:45,00:26:47,It's part of getting crazily good reviews.
00:26:47,00:26:49,But it survived longer than it should have.
00:26:49,00:26:51,What they just did was take his name off the bill.
00:26:51,00:26:54,"So they just erased Oscar Wilde from the production,"
00:26:54,00:26:56,because he was up there on the marquee.
00:26:56,00:26:57,It was an Oscar Wilde play.
00:26:57,00:26:59,"Yeah, and they just say, all right, let's get rid of that"
00:26:59,00:26:59,and let's keep it going.
00:26:59,00:27:03,So it should have come off 30 or 40 performances
00:27:03,00:27:05,"before, then really."
00:27:05,00:27:08,"But when he didn't manage to get into the play,"
00:27:08,00:27:11,"the marquee, I think he went to Wilde's club,"
00:27:11,00:27:14,"and he left a card saying, ""To Oscar Wilde, posing"
00:27:14,00:27:16,"as a Sondermite."""
00:27:16,00:27:18,"He meant to write Sondermite, and he misspelled it."
00:27:18,00:27:20,"But I think to a writer, that has"
00:27:20,00:27:22,got to be more of an insult almost and spelling it right.
00:27:22,00:27:23,That's what makes it annoying.
00:27:23,00:27:26,"And that's what made Bozy say, no,"
00:27:26,00:27:27,you have to sue my father for libel.
00:27:27,00:27:28,And that's when Wilde did sue you.
00:27:28,00:27:30,"Well, one card's spelled wrong."
00:27:30,00:27:30,Yeah.
00:27:30,00:27:32,He shouldn't have done that.
00:27:32,00:27:34,"With the benefit of hindsight, Molly, no, he shouldn't"
00:27:34,00:27:34,have done that.
00:27:34,00:27:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:36,00:27:38,He should have sent it back.
00:27:38,00:27:39,He spelled it wrong.
00:27:39,00:27:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:43,00:27:45,Did you know the Oscar Wilde's on the front cover
00:27:45,00:27:47,of the Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band?
00:27:47,00:27:47,Nope.
00:27:47,00:27:48,Is he?
00:27:48,00:27:49,OK.
00:27:49,00:27:51,He's looking over the shoulder of John Lennon.
00:27:51,00:27:54,The other thing I found out is that is about his tomb.
00:27:54,00:27:58,"So he's buried in Père Lache's cemetery in France, Paris,"
00:27:58,00:28:00,where lots of famous people are.
00:28:00,00:28:03,And his tomb has got a big sphinx flying across it.
00:28:03,00:28:04,Have you seen it?
00:28:04,00:28:04,Yeah.
00:28:04,00:28:08,"And yeah, so it was described as a demonic flying angel,"
00:28:08,00:28:10,"and it had a huge set of genitalia,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,which apparently the keeper of the cemetery said--
00:28:12,00:28:14,"Oh, it's actually a cucumber."
00:28:14,00:28:17,"Or a carrot, a balsnip."
00:28:17,00:28:19,"Yeah, the keeper said that this is totally indecent."
00:28:19,00:28:22,So they just covered it up with a tarpaulin for a little while.
00:28:22,00:28:26,"Anyway, so then, they said, right, we're"
00:28:26,00:28:28,"going to have to sort this out, a tarpaulin's just not going to work."
00:28:28,00:28:31,So they made a bronze butterfly-shaped cod piece
00:28:31,00:28:33,and put that over the top.
00:28:33,00:28:37,"And then Alistair Crowley, apparently, stole it."
00:28:37,00:28:40,"Yeah, he was known as a wickedness man on earth, wasn't he, Crowley?"
00:28:40,00:28:40,Yeah.
00:28:40,00:28:42,He was like-- what was he like?
00:28:42,00:28:48,"He was like a dark magician who, like David Blank."
00:28:48,00:28:52,The newspaper's called him evil because he was--
00:28:52,00:28:56,"he had very poor morals and was kind of corrupting the young,"
00:28:56,00:28:56,"like, say-- Oh, yeah."
00:28:56,00:28:58,Like Jeremy Corbyn.
00:28:58,00:29:01,"OK, so he's a cross between David Blank and Jeremy Corbyn."
00:29:01,00:29:04,I think I understand who the saddest guy is.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"Apparently, when he was on holiday in Egypt with his wife,"
00:29:06,00:29:08,"Bruce, he had a vision of someone dictating"
00:29:08,00:29:11,"like a book of laws to him, and he found it a whole new religion."
00:29:11,00:29:12,Crowley.
00:29:12,00:29:13,"No, Corbyn."
00:29:13,00:29:16,Corbyn.
00:29:16,00:29:19,"There's a bookshop not too far from here, which is called Watkins."
00:29:19,00:29:20,And it's an esoteric bookshop.
00:29:20,00:29:22,"It's a Colton, all that sort of stuff."
00:29:22,00:29:22,It's amazing.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"And they have a story, which is that Alistair Crowley"
00:29:24,00:29:26,used to shop there.
00:29:26,00:29:27,And he came in one time.
00:29:27,00:29:28,"And the owner said, I don't believe"
00:29:28,00:29:29,that you have all these magic tricks.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"And then he said, well, watch this."
00:29:31,00:29:35,"In an instant, he made all of the books disappear in the shop."
00:29:35,00:29:36,"And then a second later, they all came back."
00:29:36,00:29:38,That's because he went in with Oscar Wilde.
00:29:38,00:29:39,He ate the book.
00:29:39,00:29:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:40,00:29:44,"Anyway, so Alistair Crowley, he took the butterfly off--"
00:29:44,00:29:45,"he nicked it, basically."
00:29:45,00:29:47,"And then, when he went to London,"
00:29:47,00:29:49,"he got all dressed up, put the butterfly on his jacket."
00:29:49,00:29:53,And he went to Cafe Royal and hung out with all of his friends.
00:29:53,00:29:56,"And was like, I've got Oscar Wilde's butterfly copies."
00:29:56,00:29:58,And now everyone can see his massive gentleman
00:29:58,00:30:00,"earlier on the swings, right?"
00:30:00,00:30:02,"And then, they're now not there."
00:30:02,00:30:04,And the rumor is that two angry ladies
00:30:04,00:30:06,who were walking in the cemetery just got some rocks
00:30:06,00:30:09,and bashed it off because they didn't like it.
00:30:09,00:30:11,"And yeah, and apparently, the balls are now"
00:30:11,00:30:15,used at paper weights in the pair Laschet's conservation
00:30:15,00:30:16,office.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Is that right?
00:30:17,00:30:19,That's what I'd like to happen to my balls off
00:30:19,00:30:20,the dry die.
00:30:20,00:30:24,And I believe the penis shaft is used as a draft excluder
00:30:24,00:30:26,under the door in the office as well.
00:30:26,00:30:27,"Very good, please."
00:30:27,00:30:31,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:30:31,00:30:37,"OK, it is time for our final factor, the show."
00:30:37,00:30:38,And that is Andy.
00:30:38,00:30:40,My factor is that the New York police
00:30:40,00:30:45,"have a casting director for their lineups, which is--"
00:30:45,00:30:47,now he's not a proper policeman.
00:30:47,00:30:47,Right.
00:30:47,00:30:48,He's not even a rogue policeman.
00:30:48,00:30:50,He's just a guy.
00:30:50,00:30:52,And there was a profile of him in the New York Times
00:30:52,00:30:53,a few years ago.
00:30:53,00:30:54,He's called Robert Weston.
00:30:54,00:30:58,"And whenever the police and the Bronx need to do a line up,"
00:30:58,00:31:01,they say we need five light skinned Hispanic men.
00:31:01,00:31:03,"He'll say, OK, I know just the people are ranked."
00:31:03,00:31:04,They all get $10.
00:31:04,00:31:07,He gets $10 for organizing a thing.
00:31:07,00:31:08,And he's been doing this for years.
00:31:08,00:31:11,And he can find various different categories of people.
00:31:11,00:31:12,That's really cool.
00:31:12,00:31:12,Yeah.
00:31:12,00:31:14,It's a very weird casting job that he does.
00:31:14,00:31:16,But he's been doing it for ages.
00:31:16,00:31:18,"So these days, we have something called Viper."
00:31:18,00:31:22,"In the UK, which is the video identification"
00:31:22,00:31:24,parade electronic recording.
00:31:24,00:31:27,And it's basically a database of loads of different faces.
00:31:27,00:31:28,"And so you go into your database and you say,"
00:31:28,00:31:32,"this person has this colorized, this color of hair and whatever."
00:31:32,00:31:34,And then it just finds people who look like them.
00:31:34,00:31:36,"Basically, instead of getting a ten of her every line up"
00:31:36,00:31:37,"you do, you get paid a ten of ones."
00:31:37,00:31:38,And then your face is in the system.
00:31:38,00:31:39,"Ah, right."
00:31:39,00:31:41,What it means is that they can go to the house
00:31:41,00:31:44,of the person who's been a victim of the crime.
00:31:44,00:31:45,"So if you've been mugged, the police will come"
00:31:45,00:31:46,around to your place.
00:31:46,00:31:49,"And they'll show you on a computer a line up and say,"
00:31:49,00:31:50,can you identify any of these people?
00:31:50,00:31:51,Yes.
00:31:51,00:31:53,"So with the Viper thing, if you're accused,"
00:31:53,00:31:56,then you can ask your lawyer to get the police to Photoshop
00:31:56,00:31:59,any distinctive mark you might have on your face.
00:31:59,00:32:02,"So for instance, I have a scar on my face, don't I, under my eye?"
00:32:02,00:32:03,What's that from?
00:32:03,00:32:04,I'm from when I was--
00:32:04,00:32:05,Hello Viper.
00:32:05,00:32:09,I was in the West Point military when I was young.
00:32:09,00:32:11,"No, I just fell when I was a child."
00:32:11,00:32:13,And it's basically--
00:32:13,00:32:16,I couldn't make it so everyone else has this exact scar
00:32:16,00:32:17,on so that it's not--
00:32:17,00:32:18,"Oh, cool."
00:32:18,00:32:18,Nice.
00:32:18,00:32:19,So you wouldn't have raised it off.
00:32:19,00:32:21,You've just put it on everyone else.
00:32:21,00:32:22,Yeah.
00:32:22,00:32:23,Surely--
00:32:23,00:32:26,"Yeah, because if people are looking for--"
00:32:26,00:32:28,"if they remember a birthmock or a scar on their face,"
00:32:28,00:32:29,they'll fixate on that.
00:32:29,00:32:34,And they might misidentify if they're just looking for that thing.
00:32:34,00:32:36,But surely it's an incentive to criminals
00:32:36,00:32:38,to do all their crimes in a fabulous hat or something.
00:32:38,00:32:40,Because then you can just make everyone in the ID
00:32:40,00:32:41,parade wear a fabulous hat.
00:32:41,00:32:43,That's what I'd do.
00:32:43,00:32:44,I was a criminal.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"Well, like vegetables on it."
00:32:45,00:32:48,Yeah.
00:32:48,00:32:52,"Do you know that in 2015, there was an ID parade of dogs"
00:32:52,00:32:53,in the UK.
00:32:53,00:32:53,What's there?
00:32:53,00:32:54,Yeah.
00:32:54,00:32:55,Because a dog did a crime.
00:32:55,00:32:56,A dog did a crime.
00:32:56,00:32:58,What did you do?
00:32:58,00:33:00,It drew a bit in a girl in Wales.
00:33:00,00:33:02,"And the police ran an ID parade of dogs,"
00:33:02,00:33:05,which were all from the street that the biting had taken place.
00:33:05,00:33:06,Right.
00:33:06,00:33:07,And the girl picked the right one.
00:33:07,00:33:10,But then dogs are very different looking at them.
00:33:10,00:33:12,I don't know if they tried to get five border collies.
00:33:12,00:33:16,You just had a rock viola alone in chihuahas and poodles and stuff.
00:33:16,00:33:20,I think they might have put the other dogs in border collie costumes.
00:33:20,00:33:25,"Two chihuahas, one in the front, one in the back."
00:33:25,00:33:29,"Actually, you could have a lineup where the dogs are the ones"
00:33:29,00:33:33,"who are picking the criminal, because in some states"
00:33:33,00:33:35,"of America, Alaska, Florida, New York, and Texas,"
00:33:35,00:33:40,they have sent lineups where dogs smell a number of people
00:33:40,00:33:42,to pick out the suspect.
00:33:42,00:33:45,And the FBI report from 2004 says it should not be used
00:33:45,00:33:50,"as primary evidence, because it's not exactly amazingly kind"
00:33:50,00:33:51,of accurate.
00:33:51,00:33:53,But some of them just smell like food.
00:33:53,00:33:54,We also get a bark at that one up.
00:33:54,00:33:57,They rub sausages on all the criminals to court.
00:33:57,00:33:59,"If you smell like sausages, normally, you're"
00:33:59,00:34:04,allowed to ask your lawyer to make everyone else smell like sausages.
00:34:04,00:34:07,But the dogs are not the victims of the crime.
00:34:07,00:34:09,It's not which of these men called you a bad dog.
00:34:09,00:34:16,"No, they're just matching the scent with the scent from the crime."
00:34:16,00:34:17,OK.
00:34:17,00:34:19,Do you want to hear one thing about--
00:34:19,00:34:21,so this is about people who look like each other in lineups.
00:34:21,00:34:22,I didn't find one thing about look-alikes.
00:34:22,00:34:24,"Yeah, go on."
00:34:24,00:34:26,It's this guy who's a Daniel Craig look-alike.
00:34:26,00:34:28,And he was writing up his experiences.
00:34:28,00:34:31,And he just sounds like he has a really tricky time.
00:34:31,00:34:32,He was recounting some of his adventures.
00:34:32,00:34:34,He's called Steve Wright.
00:34:34,00:34:36,And he has these awful times.
00:34:36,00:34:38,So he says he was flown out to Santa Fe
00:34:38,00:34:41,by a millionaire rest to reenact the scene where James Bond comes out of the water
00:34:41,00:34:42,in his swimming trunks.
00:34:42,00:34:45,"And he said, I was told to wait a few yards out of the water until my cue came,"
00:34:45,00:34:47,the theme tune from Casino Royal.
00:34:47,00:34:49,"But when it did, it sounded very faint."
00:34:49,00:34:52,"He says, I suddenly realized that somehow I drifted 100 yards out of sea."
00:34:52,00:34:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:55,00:34:59,I had to lunch back with sea water slapping in my face.
00:34:59,00:35:03,"By the time I reached the sound, I was totally out of breath and staggered out of the water."
00:35:03,00:35:04,So you think I was bad?
00:35:04,00:35:07,Then he did another party where he said it's more typical for him to be schmoozing
00:35:07,00:35:11,ladies at a corporate event dressed as James Bond and looking like Daniel Craig.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"He did a function, a black tie ball."
00:35:13,00:35:14,"And he said, unfortunately, it was a black tie ball."
00:35:14,00:35:16,So I didn't stand out easily.
00:35:16,00:35:19,"When I waltzed into the room of 250 people and attempted to charm the female contingent,"
00:35:19,00:35:22,I found myself being treated like a repellent sex person.
00:35:22,00:35:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:24,00:35:26,"I tried taking a woman's arm and saying, so you must be pussy galore."
00:35:26,00:35:28,Would you like me my escort to the night?
00:35:28,00:35:29,Yeah.
00:35:29,00:35:33,But I had failed to introduce myself as James Bond first.
00:35:33,00:35:36,She pulled her arm back very quickly and called her husband over.
00:35:36,00:35:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:37,00:35:41,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:35:41,00:35:43,"OK, that is it."
00:35:43,00:35:44,That is all of our facts.

00:35:59,00:36:01,And Moll mentioned the name of your book again.
00:36:01,00:36:03,"It's called ""Wonders of the World's Museums."""
00:36:03,00:36:07,"Yeah, and it's available now on Amazon and in all book shops."
00:36:07,00:36:08,All book shops.
00:36:08,00:36:11,It's a guide to all the best things in museums around the world for children.
00:36:11,00:36:12,"Yeah, I've got it from my kid."
00:36:12,00:36:13,It's awesome.
00:36:13,00:36:15,So do go out and get that.
