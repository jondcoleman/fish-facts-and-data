00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 *tongue bell*

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.320
 *I don't want to talk to you*

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.160
 *I don't want to talk to you*

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.160
 *I don't want to talk to you*

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.840
 *I don't want to talk to you*

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.760
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.120
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.560
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.720
 and it's the original QI Elf and author of the new children's books,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.920
 Wonders of the World's Museums, Molly Oldfield,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.880
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.400
 favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.360
 here we go. Starting with you, Molly.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.600
 My fact is, Blue L's are born backwards tell first so they don't drown during birth.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.720
 Yeah, that's extraordinary.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.280
 What I think we can tell is that you are the original QI Elf

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.720
 because that's typical QI fodder isn't it blue whales?

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.560
 Oh, we've got to love a bit of a blue whale.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.040
 Yeah.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.080
 It's actually really weird.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.320
 I googled it to see what they look like.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.800
 So obviously the tails coming out first.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.600
 And then I thought, okay, what's it coming out of?

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.520
 I know it sounds ridiculous, but they're mammals, right?

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.320
 So am I allowed to see the giant?

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 Oh yeah.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.720
 And I always like do whales have them.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.000
 What?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.040
 Obviously they do, right?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.560
 So but we spent like so long at QI.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.240
 I think I spent about 12 years licking up.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.600
 In fact, James and I were thinking of writing about

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.760
 the QI book of genital ignorance.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.400
 Do you remember that?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.280
 I don't remember that.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.400
 That's a great title.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.040
 That's a great idea.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.080
 I'll be backing off from this project very early.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.520
 But anyway, yeah, so I googled this and there is an expert of wealth giants.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.160
 And the scientific American have written an article about her.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.920
 She's called Dr. Sarah Messnick.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 And it's really hard to study them, obviously.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.320
 So what she does is she looks at Victorian drawings.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.480
 She's got a freezer full of them.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.000
 She has people if they ever find one.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.400
 I'm sorry, a freezer full of whales for giants.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.280
 Yes, exactly.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.880
 Not drawings, the real things.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.680
 And she also...

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200
 That must be a big fridge.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.760
 Well, right.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.960
 A blue whale's want to stay big.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.000
 You can walk inside it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.760
 And the strange thing, every single way.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.360
 But how do you fit that in your freezer?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.960
 I mean, you need a walk in freezer.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.480
 You could make the freezer out of the vagina, couldn't you?

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.000
 Also, the other thing she does is she gets people who are like

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.720
 whale experts but love diving to like swim down

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.960
 and try and like put little cameras on the whale

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.560
 so that she can see T-scan them.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.280
 And she said that it's a total gauntlet in there.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.720
 Are very fat, well done.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.040
 When we open it up, there were so many structures in there

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.760
 that we couldn't figure out how a sperm would possibly be able to swim

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.960
 from one end to the other.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.200
 So basically, whales inside, they've got like flaps, folds,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.640
 blind alleys and funnels, and a dizzying maze for sperm.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.240
 So the reason for this possibly is, is that because they're in water,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.120
 they don't want water going up there.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.800
 So, you know, that's a way to keep them out.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.520
 Keep the water out, have lots of little sort of blind alleys

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.640
 and funnels and mazes.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.760
 Oh, okay, right.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.720
 But they don't really know why.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.600
 But how about with the birth then?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.960
 Why is it, why, because if they came...

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.840
 Why they came up to tell first?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.640
 Yeah.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.640
 Well, it's so that as they're being born,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.920
 they can still breathe.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.160
 Because if they came out head first, then they would just drown.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.920
 But surely whales breathe there.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.520
 Right, they come up to the surface to breathe.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.240
 Yeah, so they, if they're being born underwater,

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.880
 they won't be able to start breathing whichever

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.920
 and well comes out first.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.320
 So, what happens is, often with whales,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.480
 they'll have a load of mates of the mother.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.280
 Midwives?

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.120
 Yeah, they're known as midwives, right?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.200
 And they'll kind of take the baby up

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.120
 so it can have its first breath to make sure

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.240
 it doesn't just drown there.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.200
 And also, their umbilical cord is like perforated.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.280
 And so, it kind of comes apart really quickly.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.000
 Wow.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.560
 Cool.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.600
 That's amazing.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.160
 Have you heard about whale placenta?

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.640
 No.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.040
 It just floats off, looking like a big plastic bag in the water.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.560
 It's very exciting recently.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.680
 One floated past a white.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.200
 And everyone, everyone in Hawaii gathered at the water's edge to watch it go.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.880
 She's all the animals in the research.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.840
 I would imagine that.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.840
 I think it probably becomes food for other animals, yeah.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.840
 Yeah.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.160
 Um, yeah, I picked the fact about the Blue Whale

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
 because it's like what a fact from my book.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.600
 And I wrote about the Blue Whale.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.680
 He's at the Natural History Museum called Hope.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.640
 And when I went there with a little kid, she said to me,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.000
 "Do you, can Blue Whales talk to killer whales?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.040
 What do you think?"

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.680
 No.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.040
 Oh, I'd say...

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.400
 I'd say different language.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.440
 I'd say yes.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.320
 I'd say you could sort of shout in Blue Whale

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.240
 and put on the killer whale accent.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.040
 Yeah.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.320
 Or you could get the gist.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.800
 You'd be like, "I think they want to eat me."

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.520
 Doss, squids, poor five all, that kind of thing.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.760
 But a killer whale isn't a whale.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.960
 Yeah, right. It's a dolphin.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.840
 So it makes more, like, clicking, wearing noises.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.920
 And Blue Whale obviously, like, makes deep singing, I don't know, noises.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.280
 But I don't know.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.480
 Because a killer whale...

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.680
 They're called killer whales because they killed whales, right?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.440
 They were originally called whale killers

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.880
 and then they got flipped around.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.920
 Ah, nice.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.080
 But humans can talk to other animals,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.640
 and other animals can kind of communicate with each other.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.680
 We can talk to dogs, kind of.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.200
 We can talk to whoever we want.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.680
 Yeah.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.120
 Whether they understand us or not.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.040
 So a baby blue whale, for its first year,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.640
 gains £200 every day, which is about my weight.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.440
 Wow.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.160
 So it's like, after day one, it's like,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.000
 I then go into the whale,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.360
 and then day two, another one of me,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.600
 and day three, another one of me, for a whole year,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.880
 until they're absolutely humongous.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.320
 And that's all, is that all krill?

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.120
 Or do they get some sort of other food source for the mumps?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.120
 They mumps the milk, the milk and the mumps.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.360
 200 litres of milk a day.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.160
 Wow.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.400
 That's a very weird mental image, James.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.360
 Kind of just say, a whale made up of 365 years.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.840
 Yeah.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.440
 All kind of tied together.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.640
 Imagine I'm Jonah.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.920
 Yeah.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.840
 Only baby whales like to eat me.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.920
 Yeah.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.200
 But they're doing it again and again.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.600
 And I'm cloning myself, obviously, in this metaphor.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.080
 How can you use it if it takes to make up one blue whale?

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.880
 A lot.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.000
 So, for instance, an adult blue whale

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.480
 eats about four tons of krill a day.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.120
 Oh, okay.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.240
 And by weight, that's the equivalent of eating 26,000 Greg Stake Bakes

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.240
 a day, which is one every three seconds.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.480
 Oh, what is a steak bake?

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.480
 I know.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.840
 It's a glorious thing.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.160
 It's like a sausage roll, but it's got a steak in it instead.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.640
 Yeah.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.520
 It's like a pasty.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.160
 Right, got you.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.040
 It's very nice.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.600
 Yeah, but you wouldn't want to eat one every three seconds

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.560
 for the rest of your life.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.240
 Would you go on with life if you had to do that?

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.840
 Yeah.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.640
 Yeah, totally.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.280
 So, you don't get full because you've got a much bigger stomach.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.520
 Yeah.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.760
 Like, if you're the giant as the size of a fridge,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.480
 then your stomach's probably the size of, you know,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.080
 maybe a whole warehouse full of fridges.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.720
 Yeah.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.440
 So, you're not going to get full all the time with these steak bakes.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.400
 And you've got a big mouth.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.840
 You can eat more than one in time.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.680
 You don't need to do the three-second separation.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.160
 I guess so.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.360
 It's, yeah, it's funny.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.160
 So, imagine you, Daniel, are having to eat one every three seconds.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.880
 Yes.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.240
 Especially, they feed in this, like, it's called the,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.320
 the blue-else feed in the lunging position,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.760
 which is actually the position of...

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.040
 Not the lunging position.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.160
 Which means, isn't it?

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.000
 The eternal lunging position.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.640
 And, yeah, that's the, that, you know, they've hung the blue-else

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.000
 in from the ceiling.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.040
 It's in the feed lunging position.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.760
 So, what they do, they, like, dive down and open their mouths

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.320
 and all the krill goes in and then they close their mouths

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.200
 and the belly and, like, filters out the water.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.640
 And the krill stays inside, like,

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.680
 little peas, really.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.480
 Right.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.160
 I don't know if we've mentioned this on the podcast before,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.280
 but the blue whale in the Natural History Museum,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.800
 the one that's made of the massive sort of, like, paper mache.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.880
 Do you remember that giant whale that they have?

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.000
 A model one, yeah.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.800
 Yeah, the model one.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.960
 So, there's a trap door at the bottom of it

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.120
 and the builders, when they were making

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.200
 all the surrounding rooms and the whale itself,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.720
 used to go in there for breaks.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.640
 And it's a bit of a time capsule now,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.800
 because inside, there were still old magazines.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.920
 This said to be a mattress because, supposedly,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.040
 after late-night parties, there were sneaky shag sessions

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.400
 going on inside the blue whale.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.200
 We were told, we were told this by curators from there.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.160
 Did you have to go in through the freezer-sized vagina?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.360
 But, yeah, inside the blue whale,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.200
 supposedly, as a time capsule of newspapers

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.800
 and there might be a mattress in there and so on.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.480
 But the having sex inside a blue whale

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.320
 definitely happened in Gothenburg

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.520
 and they also have a trap door.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.040
 And public was allowed to go inside,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.600
 but they stopped it because they found a couple

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.800
 in the, doing the...

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.800
 Wow, everything else I've got is very tame compared with this stuff.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.960
 They had a cafe in the mouth of this one in Gothenburg

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.360
 and they used to have religious people would go there

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.200
 and tell the story of Jonah and the whale

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.720
 while having their coffee and stuff.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.840
 It's not even a whale of a time.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.720
 You couldn't get it to...

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.120
 You couldn't be swallowed and end up in a stomach of whale, could you?

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.680
 Because you'd be...

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.240
 Like, because they can only eat krill, right?

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:28.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.240
 They've got tiny throats.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.600
 Yeah, the size of the foot...

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.840
 Yeah, the size of a grapefruit we've said on QI, isn't it?

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.720
 But you could squeeze through size with grapefruit on it.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.560
 It's not going to be really solid, is it?

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.560
 It's going to be like mussely,

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.960
 but I reckon you could squeeze through, no?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.760
 I'd just...

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.960
 Imagine trying to eat a meal, though,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.320
 that was trying to get through...

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.360
 That was too big.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.600
 Imagine a lump of gristle that was trying to get into your stomach.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.160
 It was too big.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.800
 I think you'd choke.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.000
 Yeah, but it's better to have them helping you swallow it.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.240
 The gristle, if you have food that helps you swallow it,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.760
 if that would make life a lot easier.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.000
 If the grang steak bag wants to be eaten...

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.240
 Oh, it's slightly down your throat.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.800
 You're like an artist, so I can.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.560
 Come on, there's the other of my buddies, two and a half seconds behind me.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.520
 Let's go. Let's go.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.160
 Go, go, go.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:19.600
 Okay, it's time to move on to fact number two, and that is James.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.600
 Okay, my fact this week is that during the Qing dynasty in China,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.520
 when the weather got hot in the summer,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.160
 people would swap their pillows for ceramic ones.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.520
 Ceramic?

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.200
 What an uncomfortable day it must have been like the first day of using a ceramic pillow,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.720
 after having a lovely soft pillow.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.440
 Do you think?

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.920
 I guess your pillow would be nice and cool, which is good.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.320
 Yeah.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.760
 Which is the advantage of doing it.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.240
 Well, we're in the hottest day of the year today, aren't we?

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.040
 This is going to go out in a few weeks when it's probably pissing it down again,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.800
 but this is the hottest day of the year.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.400
 I'm this morning when you're in bed.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.240
 Would you not have killed for a ceramic pillow?

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.760
 I would have loved a ceramic pillow right now.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.560
 Yeah.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.440
 Actually, that would be awful.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.920
 Imagine a pillow fight with a ceramic pillow.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.640
 Yeah.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.080
 What do you want now?

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.680
 There was a pillow fight in 2015 between a load of army cadets in America,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.960
 and they decided, for some reason,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.360
 instead of having a normal harmless pillow fight that they put helmets in the pillows,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.320
 and as a result, at least 30 cadets were injured,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.000
 24 suffered concussions, and there were three broken arms,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.080
 one broken neck, and many missing teeth.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.680
 One broken neck, currently.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.400
 Wow. That is bad. I read about that.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.120
 It's a West Point military academy, and it was this great tradition.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.440
 It happened every year since 1897.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.440
 And after 2015, they said, well, maybe no more of this.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.280
 Isn't that crazy?

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.320
 Yeah, that is.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.480
 Pillow fights used to be used a lot for early cinema.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.520
 There's a lot of examples of some of the early movies that were made.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.760
 Those black and white ones that are called, like the first example in 1897

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.840
 was just called a pillow fight, and it's just people having a pillow fight.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.920
 And then it was remade. Well, there was a follow-up called new pillow fight.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.920
 Yeah, what happened then?

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.920
 Yeah, it was just more, um, yeah, I guess, you know, the second installment.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.520
 They did the helmets inside the pillow.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.640
 No, but what they read is, the reason it was very good for cinema

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.720
 is because you could see the fight starting small, and feathers would come out.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.480
 And as the fight escalated, and they got harder, more feathers would come out,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.040
 so the audience were able to properly see the intensity of a fight as it got heavier and heavier.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.200
 It was just great for early cinema to have that as an effect of visual.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.000
 So yeah, a lot of pillow fights in early cinema.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.760
 Have you guys heard of a pillow fought?

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.680
 That's a phrase, yeah?

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.640
 Yeah, when you build yourself.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.320
 Yeah, when you build a fort out of post, okay.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.000
 There is a park in America, which is called Fort Pillow.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.920
 That's its name.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.400
 And it's named after a US and Confederacy general.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.640
 His name was Gideon Johnson Pillow.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.960
 It's got a very comfy man.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.440
 I'm just about to put my head down, sleeping on his fat tummy.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.240
 Was it really fat?

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.080
 I don't know if he was fat or not, but he was not a nice man.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.680
 He wouldn't have wanted a cuddle.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.600
 Yeah, no, he was a bad dude.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.680
 But I don't think it's got anything to do with pillow fights, and it's called Fort Pillow.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.080
 I've been trying to find out the first use of the phrase "Pillow fought"

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.680
 to see if Fort Pillow predates it.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.480
 I can't find it.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.960
 Pillow, what a terrible name for his general.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.960
 Hello, General Pillow.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.040
 Was he General?

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.680
 Captain Pillow.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.040
 He was a general Pillow.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.320
 He was a Brigadier General.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.680
 He was very senior in the army.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.880
 The record is his name that made him such an angry man.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:34.720
 So I got this fact from the Christie's website, the auctioneers.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.400
 They had, there was an article about 100 things we learned from Christie's.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.880
 I'll give you a few more of those before we go on to the market.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.880
 Napoleon was allergic to leather in France.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.520
 First edition comic books sell for much less than the original plates that we used to make them.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.760
 That's the fact, isn't it?

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:57.200
 And Andy Warhol once wrote in his diaries that "Dabby Davito was so cute we should all marry him."

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.400
 Wow, that is two pop culture names I did not expect to come together.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.880
 Davito, as well, isn't he?

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.680
 Davito.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.240
 Is that how you just look at people who are slightly everywhere?

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.800
 Hello, Ian.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.040
 That means like Tommy Utilipan.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.320
 Tommy Utilipan, right?

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.560
 There was someone who, who was it who slept on the stomach of...

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.760
 Um, I know who it was.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.960
 Was it Genghis Khan or something?

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.320
 No, it was.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.320
 I think it was Peter the Great.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.040
 That's right.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.840
 He had a great use to use a young male secretary's stomach as a pillow.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.440
 He referred his wife, but if he was a way traveling and his wife was an available,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.400
 he had his...

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.240
 ...bring in general pillow at once.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.840
 But you couldn't turn him over, could you?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.640
 Because if you turn over that person, you've got a bony back.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.680
 Yeah. He's got a bum. The bum. He's just having a slid out of it.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.120
 Don't really do that, though, do you?

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.160
 No, it's not ideal.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.280
 No, but you would want the man's tummy.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.480
 Right. It's different, isn't it? There's less going on in the stomach.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.760
 Rumbling if it's hungry.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.800
 Yeah, that's true. You don't have to be well fed.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.320
 Sorry, what were we talking about?

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.000
 I mean, pillow's a long time ago.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.840
 Um, yes, so, um, Chinese, um, people, they used to use ceramic pillows.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.600
 Well, actually, James, they still do.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.920
 I've got someone staying with me and she's from Singapore.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.040
 And she said her aunt still uses ceramic pillows.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.640
 Cool. Is that right? Very cool.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.680
 Just in the summer off.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.120
 They just stopped talking to her aunt recently, but...

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.000
 ...following a pillow fight where...

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.840
 But because they lived in small, um, living spaces,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.000
 they would be, um, decorative as well.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.720
 Um, and they would be given as wedding gifts and they'd be kind of a sign of,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.880
 you know, wishes for many happy years of marriage or offspring or whatever.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.640
 Some of them were, um, shaped.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.000
 So there were lion-shaped ones which would scare off evil spirits, which is useful.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.840
 There were some shaped-like frogs.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.400
 And there was a fashion for some shaped-like sleeping children.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.840
 Hmm. Yeah.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.160
 Yeah, I think they thought that, like, pillows could commune between the spirit world and human world.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.800
 So they'd put, like, children playing on them to, like,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.920
 bring children into the family or specific.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.760
 There's one in the Met in New York that's got a drawing of two boys playing in Piennes,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.520
 which is a partner to ensure, like, baby boys and airs would come along.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.200
 And there's one in the British Museum.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.400
 Um, that is in the shape of a woman lying down with her head on a pillow.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.960
 Um, and yeah, on the concave bit of the woman around her hip where you put your head.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.560
 There's a lovely poem which says,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.920
 "The wind rustles flowers under a snow white moon."

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.360
 I, I read this and I can't quite believe it, which is that in medieval times,

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.240
 pillows were really for, for people who are a bit weedy.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.040
 Yeah.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.000
 They were only for the elderly or pregnant women.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.040
 They still are, actually.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.800
 I sleep on a, I sleep on a piece of tube, I fall with nails stuck there.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.720
 Take the man out of Bolton.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:46.320
 I do have a reason why you should throw your pillows away, James,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.720
 and go back to that piece of tube before with nails in it.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.720
 Why is that, Andy?

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.840
 There was a study by the University of Manchester, which took pillows,

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.360
 which have been used for various lengths of time.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:01.200
 And they found several thousand spools of fungus per gram of pillow.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.840
 They found 47 different species of fungus.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.000
 So that's, that might be what you're sleeping on.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.440
 Yeah, I read that a third of the weight of any pillow,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.000
 if you've been using it for ages, is dead skin.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.720
 I think that's my, some people think that might be true.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.680
 Some people think that might have been the rumour put about by pillow,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.360
 might be facturists, by big pillow.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.720
 That big guy.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.160
 No, you would think, wouldn't you?

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.440
 And it's not just dead skin.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.360
 It's also house-might corpses.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.800
 And house-might eggs can run and, I'm living house-mights, I know what it is.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.760
 But if it was one third of an entire pillow.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.280
 You would, that's a lot of a pillow.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.920
 You would think you could tell if just one end was just your skin.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.400
 Mind you, but we sleep with pillowcases, right?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.320
 So it doesn't have all the gross stuff going on there and then you change it.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.440
 And then you wash it.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.440
 Wow, I know who washes up pillow.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.800
 You put a pillowcase around a turd.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.640
 It's still a turd, isn't it?

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.000
 It's still bad, yeah.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.680
 So even that is true.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.160
 Hitler's pillowcase, I'm afraid we've reached the Hitler bit of the podcast.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.200
 His pillowcase was not only monogram with his initials.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.440
 It had an eagle and the swastika on it.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.640
 Yeah, it was auctioned in 2011.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.520
 And a pillowcase on a sheet was over £2,000.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.160
 That's not much.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.880
 It's not, well, come on, the Hitler's pillowcase.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.360
 I didn't realise we had a collector in the room.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.520
 I didn't lock up for that.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.480
 Okay.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.520
 Do you want to random swastika facts?

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.400
 I got two actually.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.880
 One, the oldest bit of human writing ever found it's got a swastika in it.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.920
 And two, the word swastika is Sanskrit and it means kind of lucky, how fortunate.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.000
 Yes, Hindu symbol.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.880
 The oldest writing.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.280
 So that's the ancient Hindu Indo-European Sanskrit?

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.360
 No, it's not, it's pre-Sanskrit.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.160
 Yeah, it's proto-Sanskrit, proto-European.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.200
 You know, if you get to a hotel and you don't like your pillow,

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.800
 you can order a pillow menu.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.600
 Not in all hotels.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.920
 Not all hotels, but we've just finished a tour.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.520
 And I don't think a single one of the hotels that we stated had a pillow menu.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.320
 Yeah, sorry, I should have said so-so in hotels.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.440
 Provided pillow menu.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.440
 I've worked in hotels that had pillows, yeah, yeah.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.840
 And they would be like, let's say you had an anti-allergen pillow.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.560
 You might have that or hard or soft or general pillows tummy or whatever.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.960
 Or pillow with, I'd like one with an eagle in a swastika right?

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.160
 Please do you have one of those?

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:26.160
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.120
 My fact this week is that Oscar Wilde ate his books as he read them.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:37.840
 This was, there was a book that was written by Thomas Wright called "Bilt of Books,

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.000
 How Reading Defined the Life of Oscar Wilde".

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.880
 In it, he reveals that as Oscar Wilde was reading books,

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.960
 he would tear off the top corner of each page once he'd read it and eat it

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.000
 and then keep moving on.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.520
 It was just the habit of his that he did-

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.280
 Instead of having like a bookmark, right?

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.000
 I guess so, yes.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.640
 So wherever the chomp has been taken out of the corner.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.800
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.480
 Why don't we all do that?

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.160
 Well, have you ever eaten paper?

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:00.800
 Yeah.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.600
 Do you like it?

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.560
 I don't mind it.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.000
 It's not my favourite.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.200
 It's no Greg's steak bake.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.240
 I think it's not that nice eating paper.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.440
 I think in a small amount it's fine.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.640
 I've been reading a lot on Oscar Wilde recently.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.040
 That's one of the fun facts that I discovered.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.560
 Eat the books as you read them.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.520
 No, I didn't.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.120
 It's the internet. He was reading them.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.880
 I think you could eat them.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.280
 If you're reading online, you have to take a bite.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.400
 Oh, good.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.440
 Very nice.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.920
 So there was an exhibition not too long ago,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.720
 2016 in Reading Prison, where they showed all of the books

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.120
 that Oscar Wilde had while he was in prison.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.520
 He did it.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.320
 And they did it.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.720
 Yes, it's an empty exhibition.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.760
 But basically, when he was in jail,

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.800
 you weren't really allowed to have access to books,

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.200
 but because he was such a prominent figure.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.280
 He was the only one who was allowed.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.080
 Basically, they have a special dispensation for him, right?

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.320
 Yeah, he was allowed to keep his light on at night,

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.360
 longer than everyone else.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.280
 So what I like about it is that Reading Jail was the only reading jail.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.400
 Wow.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.040
 Very nice.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.000
 Yes.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.240
 I read that I'm a bit ahead on the details.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.040
 I think he was allowed, it was technically a long letter

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.200
 that the governor of the prison allowed him to write.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.040
 Because you were allowed to write a letter.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.520
 Oh.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.880
 But he was writing a huge long...

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.160
 Oh, so this is the righting path.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.040
 Deeper fundus.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.240
 Deeper fundus, exactly.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.960
 Yeah, so that was when he was in prison being allowed to write.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.760
 Yes, yeah.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.600
 And we see it, interestingly, as a letter,

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.560
 because it starts dear Bozy to his lover

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.000
 and who he ended up going to prison as a result of the relationship with.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.200
 And Bozy never read it until after Oscar Wilde had died.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.160
 It was never written to be a private letter to him,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.280
 done in long form.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.560
 It was meant to be published.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.320
 And it was written and sent to a publisher, as opposed to Bozy himself.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.360
 So yeah, it was a good cheat that he pulled off.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.120
 Oh, it's a huge sort of philosophic.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.640
 It's his deepest work, I think, that Oscar Wilde did just life.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.560
 And why he was in there and what people thought about sex

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.160
 and gender and all that sort of stuff, I think.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.880
 And he's pretty rude about Bozy in it.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.840
 Because Bozy encouraged him to sue for libel

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.440
 when Bozy's father had been extremely rude about world and public

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.600
 and said that the cost would be covered and all of this.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.840
 And as it was, the libel truck collapsed.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.120
 Oscar Wilde was sued for what time was gross in decency,

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.400
 being gay, basically.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.800
 And as a result, went to prison.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.440
 So he's quite annoyed with Bozy in bits of it.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.320
 You know that he, supposedly his last words were

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.400
 my wallpaper and I fighting a Jewel to the death,

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.800
 one or one or either of us has to go.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.040
 So I knew I'd to find out what his wallpaper was like.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.240
 [LAUGHS]

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.040
 Because it must have been pretty horrible, right?

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.400
 I think you'd find that.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.680
 I didn't.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.320
 But I found out that his wallpaper in his own house,

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.720
 back in London, because he died in Paris in a hotel, right?

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.800
 He, in his own house, he had a drawing room with dragons painted

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.760
 all over a blue ceiling.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.400
 And his wallpaper was, had peacock feathers.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.680
 It was like peacock feathers all set into the plaster of the walls.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.920
 And then I don't know whether the hotel in Paris,

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.600
 where he died, knows this, because they've

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.480
 re-decorated the Oscar Wilde room, where he died,

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.360
 with a fresco of kissing peacocks.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.200
 And the other thing that's on show in there is the bill

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.080
 from his hotel's day, where he, when he died.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.360
 And he never paid it.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.080
 And apparently he said, I am dying above my means.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.520
 Mm, yeah.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.920
 But I don't think that they were his final words,

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.920
 where they were their wallpaper thing.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.200
 So he had an operation just before he died.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.560
 And while he was recuperating, he said that last words.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.760
 And he said a few other last words as well, saying I can't

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.360
 even afford to die and things like that.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.160
 But when he actually died, I don't think he was in any fit

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.240
 states, be making whizzes and so on.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.600
 James, you just read the whole lovely ending.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.440
 It was definitely nearly his love.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.440
 So I read a thing.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.360
 Andy and I were talking about the downstairs,

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.480
 because there's a sense that it's been debunked,

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.040
 this fact that I'm about to say.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.040
 But I read it in a Christopher Hitchens article,

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.760
 where he talks about the hidden--

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.960
 the hidden sort of innuendos that was all the way

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.200
 through the importance of being earnest, the play.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.080
 So Christopher Hitchens says that the word earnest used

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.440
 to be Victorian slang for, if you were homosexual.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.120
 So the idea was, Oscar Wilde loved the idea on the marquee.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.440
 It was effectively saying the importance of being gay

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.280
 was his big sort of hidden message that was underneath it.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.320
 And that seems to have been slightly debunked.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.800
 But it's interesting, because Hitchens brings up

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.320
 a bunch of different examples where he

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.120
 ceded sort of hidden meanings within the play.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.280
 So for example, there's a character,

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.880
 a minor character called Bloxham.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.360
 Bloxham was famous at the time as an editor

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.880
 of a magazine, a gay magazine called The Chameleon.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.960
 And he was a very controversial character.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.800
 Cessely was one of the characters' names

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.240
 of one of the high society girls.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.960
 That, according to Hitchens, was vernacular

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.240
 for transvestite rent boys back in the day.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.840
 And just lots of little bits of hidden hints

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.720
 towards the two main male characters

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.640
 having alternative lives that they're trying

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.720
 to hide was a suggestion that they were both themselves gay.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.440
 And if there was a missing handbag in--

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.400
 A handbag.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.400
 Very nice.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.600
 Where-- and supposedly sort of meetup places,

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.520
 where guys would go to meetup sort of illegally,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.520
 would be places like lost property places and so on.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.000
 So another thing that you were telling me, Dan,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.280
 is about the mark was of Queen's Brie.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.280
 Yes, yeah.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.360
 Well, my original fact for this was

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.640
 that to protest at the opening of the importance

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.040
 of being earnest about the relationship of Oscar Wilde

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.920
 and Bo C, the marquee of Queen's Brie,

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.560
 try to interrupt the premiere with a bouquet

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.800
 of phallic-shaped vegetables.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.640
 Did you, like, riddle on stage or what did he do?

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.640
 That was his plan.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.040
 He was going to go inside.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:42.880
 And he went with a posse.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.520
 He went with like a crew, kind of like how Conor McGregor

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.920
 recently threw stuff at a bus.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.720
 That was kind of the marquee of Queen's Brie.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.200
 Conor McGregor didn't throw phallic vegetables, did he?

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.640
 No, they were phallic chairs.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.720
 So do you have to, like, carve a phallic vegetable?

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.200
 No, I don't think so.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.080
 Well, this-- so I think he definitely did take along vegetables.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.360
 He took along a bus good vegetable to throw at the stage

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.560
 and throw out wild and protest.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.000
 But I think they weren't especially phallic.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.920
 I think they were just carrots and turnips because I--

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.960
 But then carrots are quite phallic, aren't they?

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.960
 All of them really.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.160
 Hasn't it?

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.320
 Cucumber.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.160
 Yeah, OK.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.680
 Overgene.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.760
 What we're saying is that many vegetables

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.320
 are kind of a little bit phallic in nature.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:26.840
 Yeah.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.560
 And so to say that these were phallic vegetables seems plausible.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.920
 Yeah, but what I don't think is true that the marquis of Queen's

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.600
 free went around selecting.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.960
 I think that'll be a weird thing to protest against homosexuality

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.960
 by going around looking for penises wherever you could find it.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.320
 And we'd say more about the marquis's own state of mind

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.320
 than about violence.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.160
 But that-- so he wasn't allowed in.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.320
 He didn't get led into the plate.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.920
 And then he left a card, I think, at least.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.920
 Sorry, can I just say, did they not let him in

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.520
 because he was carrying the vegetables?

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.840
 Like, did they-- you know when you go to a gig,

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.400
 and they have to check your handbag?

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.560
 In case you got, like, some--

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.240
 But yeah, so was that the reason why,

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.920
 obviously, because they recognized him?

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.200
 I think probably he turned up angry with thugs

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.080
 and holding vegetables.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.240
 And they thought, oh, it's the opening night.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.120
 Let's not take the chance.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:10.640
 Yeah.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.000
 And also, he was famous for going to premieres of theater

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.440
 shows to protest them.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.400
 That was his thing.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.440
 So he went to one play that he was protesting

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.160
 that they were giving atheists a bad name.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.080
 It was only Tennyson.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.600
 He was an above atheist, yeah, that's right.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.120
 And then he brought vegetable shape like Jesus.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.280
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.520
 Well, a lot of vegetables actually look like teens think about it.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.200
 Yeah.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:32.680
 Which one?

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.600
 Nugly.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.680
 Drusula Martichoke, hello.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.440
 Yeah, play actually failed.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.120
 In short, being honest, failed as a result of this trial

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.000
 happening.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.560
 It closed after 83 performances.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.960
 It's part of getting crazily good reviews.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.560
 But it survived longer than it should have.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.560
 What they just did was take his name off the bill.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.920
 So they just erased Oscar Wilde from the production,

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.280
 because he was up there on the marquee.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.480
 It was an Oscar Wilde play.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.040
 Yeah, and they just say, all right, let's get rid of that

00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.960
 and let's keep it going.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:03.320
 So it should have come off 30 or 40 performances

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.720
 before, then really.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.760
 But when he didn't manage to get into the play,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.320
 the marquee, I think he went to Wilde's club,

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.760
 and he left a card saying, "To Oscar Wilde, posing

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.240
 as a Sondermite."

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.560
 He meant to write Sondermite, and he misspelled it.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.160
 But I think to a writer, that has

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.560
 got to be more of an insult almost and spelling it right.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.960
 That's what makes it annoying.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.200
 And that's what made Bozy say, no,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.720
 you have to sue my father for libel.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.920
 And that's when Wilde did sue you.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.040
 Well, one card's spelled wrong.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:30.560
 Yeah.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.080
 He shouldn't have done that.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.120
 With the benefit of hindsight, Molly, no, he shouldn't

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:34.960
 have done that.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.120
 He should have sent it back.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.560
 He spelled it wrong.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.080
 Did you know the Oscar Wilde's on the front cover

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.360
 of the Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band?

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:47.880
 Nope.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.400
 Is he?

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.080
 OK.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.960
 He's looking over the shoulder of John Lennon.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.080
 The other thing I found out is that is about his tomb.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.680
 So he's buried in Père Lache's cemetery in France, Paris,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.000
 where lots of famous people are.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.200
 And his tomb has got a big sphinx flying across it.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.080
 Have you seen it?

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.880
 Yeah.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.240
 And yeah, so it was described as a demonic flying angel,

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.720
 and it had a huge set of genitalia,

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.440
 which apparently the keeper of the cemetery said--

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.480
 Oh, it's actually a cucumber.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.200
 Or a carrot, a balsnip.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.840
 Yeah, the keeper said that this is totally indecent.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.840
 So they just covered it up with a tarpaulin for a little while.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.040
 Anyway, so then, they said, right, we're

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.400
 going to have to sort this out, a tarpaulin's just not going to work.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.800
 So they made a bronze butterfly-shaped cod piece

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.840
 and put that over the top.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.280
 And then Alistair Crowley, apparently, stole it.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.160
 Yeah, he was known as a wickedness man on earth, wasn't he, Crowley?

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:40.680
 Yeah.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.400
 He was like-- what was he like?

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:48.480
 He was like a dark magician who, like David Blank.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.480
 The newspaper's called him evil because he was--

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.000
 he had very poor morals and was kind of corrupting the young,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.920
 like, say-- Oh, yeah.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.440
 Like Jeremy Corbyn.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.200
 OK, so he's a cross between David Blank and Jeremy Corbyn.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.000
 I think I understand who the saddest guy is.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.600
 Apparently, when he was on holiday in Egypt with his wife,

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.880
 Bruce, he had a vision of someone dictating

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.680
 like a book of laws to him, and he found it a whole new religion.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.280
 Crowley.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.120
 No, Corbyn.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.120
 Corbyn.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.000
 There's a bookshop not too far from here, which is called Watkins.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.920
 And it's an esoteric bookshop.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.320
 It's a Colton, all that sort of stuff.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:22.960
 It's amazing.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.800
 And they have a story, which is that Alistair Crowley

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.040
 used to shop there.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.040
 And he came in one time.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.680
 And the owner said, I don't believe

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.960
 that you have all these magic tricks.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.920
 And then he said, well, watch this.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.200
 In an instant, he made all of the books disappear in the shop.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.840
 And then a second later, they all came back.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.160
 That's because he went in with Oscar Wilde.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.320
 He ate the book.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.840
 Anyway, so Alistair Crowley, he took the butterfly off--

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.800
 he nicked it, basically.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.040
 And then, when he went to London,

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.920
 he got all dressed up, put the butterfly on his jacket.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.200
 And he went to Cafe Royal and hung out with all of his friends.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.280
 And was like, I've got Oscar Wilde's butterfly copies.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.200
 And now everyone can see his massive gentleman

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.200
 earlier on the swings, right?

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.440
 And then, they're now not there.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.760
 And the rumor is that two angry ladies

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.600
 who were walking in the cemetery just got some rocks

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.240
 and bashed it off because they didn't like it.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.280
 And yeah, and apparently, the balls are now

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.280
 used at paper weights in the pair Laschet's conservation

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.280
 office.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.840
 Is that right?

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.560
 That's what I'd like to happen to my balls off

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.640
 the dry die.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.240
 And I believe the penis shaft is used as a draft excluder

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.600
 under the door in the office as well.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.960
 Very good, please.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.240
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:37.040
 OK, it is time for our final factor, the show.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.840
 And that is Andy.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.440
 My factor is that the New York police

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.120
 have a casting director for their lineups, which is--

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.280
 now he's not a proper policeman.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:47.780
 Right.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.920
 He's not even a rogue policeman.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.760
 He's just a guy.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.520
 And there was a profile of him in the New York Times

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.040
 a few years ago.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.440
 He's called Robert Weston.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.080
 And whenever the police and the Bronx need to do a line up,

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.520
 they say we need five light skinned Hispanic men.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.840
 He'll say, OK, I know just the people are ranked.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.880
 They all get $10.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.120
 He gets $10 for organizing a thing.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.560
 And he's been doing this for years.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.520
 And he can find various different categories of people.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.200
 That's really cool.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:12.880
 Yeah.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.920
 It's a very weird casting job that he does.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.520
 But he's been doing it for ages.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.600
 So these days, we have something called Viper.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.120
 In the UK, which is the video identification

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.160
 parade electronic recording.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.040
 And it's basically a database of loads of different faces.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.920
 And so you go into your database and you say,

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.120
 this person has this colorized, this color of hair and whatever.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.360
 And then it just finds people who look like them.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.200
 Basically, instead of getting a ten of her every line up

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.400
 you do, you get paid a ten of ones.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.920
 And then your face is in the system.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.440
 Ah, right.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.960
 What it means is that they can go to the house

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.120
 of the person who's been a victim of the crime.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.880
 So if you've been mugged, the police will come

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.760
 around to your place.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.600
 And they'll show you on a computer a line up and say,

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600
 can you identify any of these people?

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.160
 Yes.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.680
 So with the Viper thing, if you're accused,

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.520
 then you can ask your lawyer to get the police to Photoshop

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.400
 any distinctive mark you might have on your face.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.240
 So for instance, I have a scar on my face, don't I, under my eye?

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.240
 What's that from?

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.360
 I'm from when I was--

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.280
 Hello Viper.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.800
 I was in the West Point military when I was young.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.600
 No, I just fell when I was a child.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.720
 And it's basically--

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.120
 I couldn't make it so everyone else has this exact scar

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.200
 on so that it's not--

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.240
 Oh, cool.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:18.760
 Nice.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.960
 So you wouldn't have raised it off.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.080
 You've just put it on everyone else.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.080
 Yeah.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.480
 Surely--

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.720
 Yeah, because if people are looking for--

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.280
 if they remember a birthmock or a scar on their face,

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.440
 they'll fixate on that.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.280
 And they might misidentify if they're just looking for that thing.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.160
 But surely it's an incentive to criminals

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.920
 to do all their crimes in a fabulous hat or something.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.680
 Because then you can just make everyone in the ID

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.960
 parade wear a fabulous hat.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.440
 That's what I'd do.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.240
 I was a criminal.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.320
 Well, like vegetables on it.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.120
 Yeah.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.520
 Do you know that in 2015, there was an ID parade of dogs

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.280
 in the UK.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:53.800
 What's there?

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.320
 Yeah.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.600
 Because a dog did a crime.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.920
 A dog did a crime.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.080
 What did you do?

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.480
 It drew a bit in a girl in Wales.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.160
 And the police ran an ID parade of dogs,

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.800
 which were all from the street that the biting had taken place.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.320
 Right.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.320
 And the girl picked the right one.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.160
 But then dogs are very different looking at them.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.560
 I don't know if they tried to get five border collies.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.520
 You just had a rock viola alone in chihuahas and poodles and stuff.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.640
 I think they might have put the other dogs in border collie costumes.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:25.440
 Two chihuahas, one in the front, one in the back.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:29.840
 Actually, you could have a lineup where the dogs are the ones

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.320
 who are picking the criminal, because in some states

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.520
 of America, Alaska, Florida, New York, and Texas,

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.320
 they have sent lineups where dogs smell a number of people

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.080
 to pick out the suspect.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.120
 And the FBI report from 2004 says it should not be used

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:50.120
 as primary evidence, because it's not exactly amazingly kind

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.120
 of accurate.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.320
 But some of them just smell like food.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.800
 We also get a bark at that one up.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.560
 They rub sausages on all the criminals to court.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.800
 If you smell like sausages, normally, you're

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.560
 allowed to ask your lawyer to make everyone else smell like sausages.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.560
 But the dogs are not the victims of the crime.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.880
 It's not which of these men called you a bad dog.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:16.560
 No, they're just matching the scent with the scent from the crime.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.560
 OK.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.320
 Do you want to hear one thing about--

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.400
 so this is about people who look like each other in lineups.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.960
 I didn't find one thing about look-alikes.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.000
 Yeah, go on.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.160
 It's this guy who's a Daniel Craig look-alike.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.360
 And he was writing up his experiences.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.200
 And he just sounds like he has a really tricky time.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.880
 He was recounting some of his adventures.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.400
 He's called Steve Wright.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.360
 And he has these awful times.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.160
 So he says he was flown out to Santa Fe

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.240
 by a millionaire rest to reenact the scene where James Bond comes out of the water

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.520
 in his swimming trunks.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.880
 And he said, I was told to wait a few yards out of the water until my cue came,

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.520
 the theme tune from Casino Royal.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.160
 But when it did, it sounded very faint.

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.800
 He says, I suddenly realized that somehow I drifted 100 yards out of sea.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.240
 I had to lunch back with sea water slapping in my face.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.520
 By the time I reached the sound, I was totally out of breath and staggered out of the water.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.480
 So you think I was bad?

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.880
 Then he did another party where he said it's more typical for him to be schmoozing

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.240
 ladies at a corporate event dressed as James Bond and looking like Daniel Craig.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.280
 He did a function, a black tie ball.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.760
 And he said, unfortunately, it was a black tie ball.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.160
 So I didn't stand out easily.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.800
 When I waltzed into the room of 250 people and attempted to charm the female contingent,

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.240
 I found myself being treated like a repellent sex person.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.960
 I tried taking a woman's arm and saying, so you must be pussy galore.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.480
 Would you like me my escort to the night?

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.280
 Yeah.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.360
 But I had failed to introduce myself as James Bond first.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.200
 She pulled her arm back very quickly and called her husband over.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.960
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.200
 OK, that is it.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.440
 That is all of our facts.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.680
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.840

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.800
 the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

 @MollielField.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:35:59.480
 Yep.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.640
 And Moll mentioned the name of your book again.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.520
 It's called "Wonders of the World's Museums."

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.160
 Yeah, and it's available now on Amazon and in all book shops.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.000
 All book shops.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.480
 It's a guide to all the best things in museums around the world for children.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.520
 Yeah, I've got it from my kid.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.200
 It's awesome.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.080
 So do go out and get that.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.440
 You can also go to our website.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.880
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.600
 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.120
 We have links to our tour dates.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.120
 And we have links to our book and other goodies.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.200
 So go there and check it out.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.200
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:27.800
 See you then.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.800
