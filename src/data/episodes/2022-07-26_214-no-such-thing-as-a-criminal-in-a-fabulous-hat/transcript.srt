00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 *tongue bell*

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,320
 *I don't want to talk to you*

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,160
 *I don't want to talk to you*

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,160
 *I don't want to talk to you*

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,840
 *I don't want to talk to you*

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,760
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,120
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,560
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,720
 and it's the original QI Elf and author of the new children's books,

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,920
 Wonders of the World's Museums, Molly Oldfield,

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,880
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,400
 favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,360
 here we go. Starting with you, Molly.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,600
 My fact is, Blue L's are born backwards tell first so they don't drown during birth.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,720
 Yeah, that's extraordinary.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,280
 What I think we can tell is that you are the original QI Elf

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,720
 because that's typical QI fodder isn't it blue whales?

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,560
 Oh, we've got to love a bit of a blue whale.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,040
 Yeah.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,080
 It's actually really weird.

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,320
 I googled it to see what they look like.

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,800
 So obviously the tails coming out first.

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,600
 And then I thought, okay, what's it coming out of?

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,520
 I know it sounds ridiculous, but they're mammals, right?

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,320
 So am I allowed to see the giant?

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,880
 Oh yeah.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,720
 And I always like do whales have them.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,000
 What?

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,040
 Obviously they do, right?

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,760
 Yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,560
 So but we spent like so long at QI.

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
 I think I spent about 12 years licking up.

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,600
 In fact, James and I were thinking of writing about

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,760
 the QI book of genital ignorance.

36
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,400
 Do you remember that?

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,280
 I don't remember that.

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,400
 That's a great title.

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,040
 That's a great idea.

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,080
 I'll be backing off from this project very early.

41
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:43,520
 But anyway, yeah, so I googled this and there is an expert of wealth giants.

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,160
 And the scientific American have written an article about her.

43
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,920
 She's called Dr. Sarah Messnick.

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
 And it's really hard to study them, obviously.

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320
 So what she does is she looks at Victorian drawings.

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,480
 She's got a freezer full of them.

47
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,000
 She has people if they ever find one.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,400
 I'm sorry, a freezer full of whales for giants.

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,280
 Yes, exactly.

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,880
 Not drawings, the real things.

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,680
 And she also...

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
 That must be a big fridge.

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,760
 Well, right.

54
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,960
 A blue whale's want to stay big.

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,000
 You can walk inside it.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,760
 And the strange thing, every single way.

57
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,360
 But how do you fit that in your freezer?

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,960
 I mean, you need a walk in freezer.

59
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,480
 You could make the freezer out of the vagina, couldn't you?

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,000
 Also, the other thing she does is she gets people who are like

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,720
 whale experts but love diving to like swim down

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,960
 and try and like put little cameras on the whale

63
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,560
 so that she can see T-scan them.

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,280
 And she said that it's a total gauntlet in there.

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
 Are very fat, well done.

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,040
 When we open it up, there were so many structures in there

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,760
 that we couldn't figure out how a sperm would possibly be able to swim

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,960
 from one end to the other.

69
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,200
 So basically, whales inside, they've got like flaps, folds,

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,640
 blind alleys and funnels, and a dizzying maze for sperm.

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,240
 So the reason for this possibly is, is that because they're in water,

72
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,120
 they don't want water going up there.

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
 So, you know, that's a way to keep them out.

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,520
 Keep the water out, have lots of little sort of blind alleys

75
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,640
 and funnels and mazes.

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,760
 Oh, okay, right.

77
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,720
 But they don't really know why.

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,600
 But how about with the birth then?

79
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,960
 Why is it, why, because if they came...

80
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,840
 Why they came up to tell first?

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,640
 Yeah.

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
 Well, it's so that as they're being born,

83
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
 they can still breathe.

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,160
 Because if they came out head first, then they would just drown.

85
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,920
 But surely whales breathe there.

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,520
 Right, they come up to the surface to breathe.

87
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,240
 Yeah, so they, if they're being born underwater,

88
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,880
 they won't be able to start breathing whichever

89
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,920
 and well comes out first.

90
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,320
 So, what happens is, often with whales,

91
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,480
 they'll have a load of mates of the mother.

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,280
 Midwives?

93
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,120
 Yeah, they're known as midwives, right?

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,200
 And they'll kind of take the baby up

95
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,120
 so it can have its first breath to make sure

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
 it doesn't just drown there.

97
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,200
 And also, their umbilical cord is like perforated.

98
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,280
 And so, it kind of comes apart really quickly.

99
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,000
 Wow.

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,560
 Cool.

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,600
 That's amazing.

102
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,160
 Have you heard about whale placenta?

103
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,640
 No.

104
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,040
 It just floats off, looking like a big plastic bag in the water.

105
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,560
 It's very exciting recently.

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,680
 One floated past a white.

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,200
 And everyone, everyone in Hawaii gathered at the water's edge to watch it go.

108
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,880
 She's all the animals in the research.

109
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,840
 I would imagine that.

110
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
 I think it probably becomes food for other animals, yeah.

111
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:55,840
 Yeah.

112
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,160
 Um, yeah, I picked the fact about the Blue Whale

113
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
 because it's like what a fact from my book.

114
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,600
 And I wrote about the Blue Whale.

115
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,680
 He's at the Natural History Museum called Hope.

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,640
 And when I went there with a little kid, she said to me,

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,000
 "Do you, can Blue Whales talk to killer whales?

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,040
 What do you think?"

119
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,680
 No.

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,040
 Oh, I'd say...

121
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,400
 I'd say different language.

122
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,440
 I'd say yes.

123
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,320
 I'd say you could sort of shout in Blue Whale

124
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,240
 and put on the killer whale accent.

125
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,040
 Yeah.

126
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,320
 Or you could get the gist.

127
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,800
 You'd be like, "I think they want to eat me."

128
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,520
 Doss, squids, poor five all, that kind of thing.

129
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,320
 Yeah, yeah.

130
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,760
 But a killer whale isn't a whale.

131
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,960
 Yeah, right. It's a dolphin.

132
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,840
 So it makes more, like, clicking, wearing noises.

133
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,920
 And Blue Whale obviously, like, makes deep singing, I don't know, noises.

134
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,280
 But I don't know.

135
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,480
 Because a killer whale...

136
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,680
 They're called killer whales because they killed whales, right?

137
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,440
 They were originally called whale killers

138
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,880
 and then they got flipped around.

139
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,920
 Ah, nice.

140
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,080
 But humans can talk to other animals,

141
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,640
 and other animals can kind of communicate with each other.

142
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,680
 We can talk to dogs, kind of.

143
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,200
 We can talk to whoever we want.

144
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,680
 Yeah.

145
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,120
 Whether they understand us or not.

146
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,040
 So a baby blue whale, for its first year,

147
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,640
 gains £200 every day, which is about my weight.

148
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,440
 Wow.

149
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,160
 So it's like, after day one, it's like,

150
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,000
 I then go into the whale,

151
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,360
 and then day two, another one of me,

152
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
 and day three, another one of me, for a whole year,

153
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,880
 until they're absolutely humongous.

154
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,320
 And that's all, is that all krill?

155
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,120
 Or do they get some sort of other food source for the mumps?

156
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
 They mumps the milk, the milk and the mumps.

157
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,360
 200 litres of milk a day.

158
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
 Wow.

159
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
 That's a very weird mental image, James.

160
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,360
 Kind of just say, a whale made up of 365 years.

161
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,840
 Yeah.

162
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
 All kind of tied together.

163
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,640
 Imagine I'm Jonah.

164
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,920
 Yeah.

165
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,840
 Only baby whales like to eat me.

166
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,920
 Yeah.

167
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,200
 But they're doing it again and again.

168
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,600
 And I'm cloning myself, obviously, in this metaphor.

169
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,080
 How can you use it if it takes to make up one blue whale?

170
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,880
 A lot.

171
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,000
 So, for instance, an adult blue whale

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,480
 eats about four tons of krill a day.

173
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,120
 Oh, okay.

174
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,240
 And by weight, that's the equivalent of eating 26,000 Greg Stake Bakes

175
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
 a day, which is one every three seconds.

176
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,480
 Oh, what is a steak bake?

177
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
 I know.

178
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,840
 It's a glorious thing.

179
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,160
 It's like a sausage roll, but it's got a steak in it instead.

180
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,640
 Yeah.

181
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,520
 It's like a pasty.

182
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,160
 Right, got you.

183
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
 It's very nice.

184
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,600
 Yeah, but you wouldn't want to eat one every three seconds

185
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,560
 for the rest of your life.

186
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,240
 Would you go on with life if you had to do that?

187
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,840
 Yeah.

188
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,640
 Yeah, totally.

189
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,280
 So, you don't get full because you've got a much bigger stomach.

190
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,520
 Yeah.

191
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,760
 Like, if you're the giant as the size of a fridge,

192
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,480
 then your stomach's probably the size of, you know,

193
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,080
 maybe a whole warehouse full of fridges.

194
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,720
 Yeah.

195
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,440
 So, you're not going to get full all the time with these steak bakes.

196
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,400
 And you've got a big mouth.

197
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
 You can eat more than one in time.

198
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,680
 You don't need to do the three-second separation.

199
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,160
 I guess so.

200
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
 It's, yeah, it's funny.

201
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,160
 So, imagine you, Daniel, are having to eat one every three seconds.

202
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,880
 Yes.

203
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,240
 Especially, they feed in this, like, it's called the,

204
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,320
 the blue-else feed in the lunging position,

205
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,760
 which is actually the position of...

206
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,040
 Not the lunging position.

207
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,160
 Which means, isn't it?

208
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,000
 The eternal lunging position.

209
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,640
 And, yeah, that's the, that, you know, they've hung the blue-else

210
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,000
 in from the ceiling.

211
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,040
 It's in the feed lunging position.

212
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,760
 So, what they do, they, like, dive down and open their mouths

213
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,320
 and all the krill goes in and then they close their mouths

214
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,200
 and the belly and, like, filters out the water.

215
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,640
 And the krill stays inside, like,

216
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,680
 little peas, really.

217
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,480
 Right.

218
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,160
 I don't know if we've mentioned this on the podcast before,

219
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,280
 but the blue whale in the Natural History Museum,

220
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,800
 the one that's made of the massive sort of, like, paper mache.

221
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,880
 Do you remember that giant whale that they have?

222
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,000
 A model one, yeah.

223
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,800
 Yeah, the model one.

224
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,960
 So, there's a trap door at the bottom of it

225
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
 and the builders, when they were making

226
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,200
 all the surrounding rooms and the whale itself,

227
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,720
 used to go in there for breaks.

228
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,640
 And it's a bit of a time capsule now,

229
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,800
 because inside, there were still old magazines.

230
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,920
 This said to be a mattress because, supposedly,

231
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,040
 after late-night parties, there were sneaky shag sessions

232
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,400
 going on inside the blue whale.

233
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,200
 We were told, we were told this by curators from there.

234
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,160
 Did you have to go in through the freezer-sized vagina?

235
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,360
 But, yeah, inside the blue whale,

236
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,200
 supposedly, as a time capsule of newspapers

237
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,800
 and there might be a mattress in there and so on.

238
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,480
 But the having sex inside a blue whale

239
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,320
 definitely happened in Gothenburg

240
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,520
 and they also have a trap door.

241
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,040
 And public was allowed to go inside,

242
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,600
 but they stopped it because they found a couple

243
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,800
 in the, doing the...

244
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,800
 Wow, everything else I've got is very tame compared with this stuff.

245
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,960
 They had a cafe in the mouth of this one in Gothenburg

246
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,360
 and they used to have religious people would go there

247
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,200
 and tell the story of Jonah and the whale

248
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,720
 while having their coffee and stuff.

249
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
 It's not even a whale of a time.

250
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
 You couldn't get it to...

251
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,120
 You couldn't be swallowed and end up in a stomach of whale, could you?

252
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,680
 Because you'd be...

253
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,240
 Like, because they can only eat krill, right?

254
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,720
 Yeah, yeah.

255
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,240
 They've got tiny throats.

256
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,600
 Yeah, the size of the foot...

257
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,840
 Yeah, the size of a grapefruit we've said on QI, isn't it?

258
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,720
 But you could squeeze through size with grapefruit on it.

259
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,560
 It's not going to be really solid, is it?

260
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
 It's going to be like mussely,

261
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,960
 but I reckon you could squeeze through, no?

262
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,760
 I'd just...

263
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,960
 Imagine trying to eat a meal, though,

264
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,320
 that was trying to get through...

265
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,360
 That was too big.

266
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,600
 Imagine a lump of gristle that was trying to get into your stomach.

267
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,160
 It was too big.

268
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,800
 I think you'd choke.

269
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
 Yeah, but it's better to have them helping you swallow it.

270
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
 The gristle, if you have food that helps you swallow it,

271
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,760
 if that would make life a lot easier.

272
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,000
 If the grang steak bag wants to be eaten...

273
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,240
 Oh, it's slightly down your throat.

274
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
 You're like an artist, so I can.

275
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,560
 Come on, there's the other of my buddies, two and a half seconds behind me.

276
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,520
 Let's go. Let's go.

277
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,160
 Go, go, go.

278
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:19,600
 Okay, it's time to move on to fact number two, and that is James.

279
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
 Okay, my fact this week is that during the Qing dynasty in China,

280
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,520
 when the weather got hot in the summer,

281
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,160
 people would swap their pillows for ceramic ones.

282
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,520
 Ceramic?

283
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,200
 What an uncomfortable day it must have been like the first day of using a ceramic pillow,

284
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,720
 after having a lovely soft pillow.

285
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,440
 Do you think?

286
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,920
 I guess your pillow would be nice and cool, which is good.

287
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,320
 Yeah.

288
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,760
 Which is the advantage of doing it.

289
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
 Well, we're in the hottest day of the year today, aren't we?

290
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,040
 This is going to go out in a few weeks when it's probably pissing it down again,

291
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,800
 but this is the hottest day of the year.

292
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,400
 I'm this morning when you're in bed.

293
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,240
 Would you not have killed for a ceramic pillow?

294
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,760
 I would have loved a ceramic pillow right now.

295
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,560
 Yeah.

296
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,440
 Actually, that would be awful.

297
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
 Imagine a pillow fight with a ceramic pillow.

298
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,640
 Yeah.

299
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,080
 What do you want now?

300
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,680
 There was a pillow fight in 2015 between a load of army cadets in America,

301
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,960
 and they decided, for some reason,

302
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,360
 instead of having a normal harmless pillow fight that they put helmets in the pillows,

303
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,320
 and as a result, at least 30 cadets were injured,

304
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,000
 24 suffered concussions, and there were three broken arms,

305
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,080
 one broken neck, and many missing teeth.

306
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,680
 One broken neck, currently.

307
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,400
 Wow. That is bad. I read about that.

308
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,120
 It's a West Point military academy, and it was this great tradition.

309
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,440
 It happened every year since 1897.

310
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,440
 And after 2015, they said, well, maybe no more of this.

311
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,280
 Isn't that crazy?

312
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,320
 Yeah, that is.

313
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
 Pillow fights used to be used a lot for early cinema.

314
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,520
 There's a lot of examples of some of the early movies that were made.

315
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,760
 Those black and white ones that are called, like the first example in 1897

316
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,840
 was just called a pillow fight, and it's just people having a pillow fight.

317
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,920
 And then it was remade. Well, there was a follow-up called new pillow fight.

318
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
 Yeah, what happened then?

319
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,920
 Yeah, it was just more, um, yeah, I guess, you know, the second installment.

320
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,520
 They did the helmets inside the pillow.

321
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,640
 No, but what they read is, the reason it was very good for cinema

322
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,720
 is because you could see the fight starting small, and feathers would come out.

323
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,480
 And as the fight escalated, and they got harder, more feathers would come out,

324
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,040
 so the audience were able to properly see the intensity of a fight as it got heavier and heavier.

325
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,200
 It was just great for early cinema to have that as an effect of visual.

326
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,000
 So yeah, a lot of pillow fights in early cinema.

327
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,760
 Have you guys heard of a pillow fought?

328
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,680
 That's a phrase, yeah?

329
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,640
 Yeah, when you build yourself.

330
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,320
 Yeah, when you build a fort out of post, okay.

331
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,000
 There is a park in America, which is called Fort Pillow.

332
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,920
 That's its name.

333
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,400
 And it's named after a US and Confederacy general.

334
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,640
 His name was Gideon Johnson Pillow.

335
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,960
 It's got a very comfy man.

336
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
 I'm just about to put my head down, sleeping on his fat tummy.

337
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,240
 Was it really fat?

338
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,080
 I don't know if he was fat or not, but he was not a nice man.

339
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,680
 He wouldn't have wanted a cuddle.

340
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,600
 Yeah, no, he was a bad dude.

341
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,680
 But I don't think it's got anything to do with pillow fights, and it's called Fort Pillow.

342
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,080
 I've been trying to find out the first use of the phrase "Pillow fought"

343
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,680
 to see if Fort Pillow predates it.

344
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,480
 I can't find it.

345
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,960
 Pillow, what a terrible name for his general.

346
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
 Hello, General Pillow.

347
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,040
 Was he General?

348
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,680
 Captain Pillow.

349
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,040
 He was a general Pillow.

350
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
 He was a Brigadier General.

351
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,680
 He was very senior in the army.

352
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,880
 The record is his name that made him such an angry man.

353
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,720
 So I got this fact from the Christie's website, the auctioneers.

354
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,400
 They had, there was an article about 100 things we learned from Christie's.

355
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,880
 I'll give you a few more of those before we go on to the market.

356
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,880
 Napoleon was allergic to leather in France.

357
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,520
 First edition comic books sell for much less than the original plates that we used to make them.

358
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,760
 That's the fact, isn't it?

359
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,200
 And Andy Warhol once wrote in his diaries that "Dabby Davito was so cute we should all marry him."

360
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,400
 Wow, that is two pop culture names I did not expect to come together.

361
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,880
 Davito, as well, isn't he?

362
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,680
 Davito.

363
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,240
 Is that how you just look at people who are slightly everywhere?

364
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,800
 Hello, Ian.

365
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,040
 That means like Tommy Utilipan.

366
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,320
 Tommy Utilipan, right?

367
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,560
 There was someone who, who was it who slept on the stomach of...

368
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,760
 Um, I know who it was.

369
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,960
 Was it Genghis Khan or something?

370
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,320
 No, it was.

371
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
 I think it was Peter the Great.

372
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,040
 That's right.

373
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,840
 He had a great use to use a young male secretary's stomach as a pillow.

374
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,440
 He referred his wife, but if he was a way traveling and his wife was an available,

375
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,400
 he had his...

376
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,240
 ...bring in general pillow at once.

377
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,840
 But you couldn't turn him over, could you?

378
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,640
 Because if you turn over that person, you've got a bony back.

379
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,680
 Yeah. He's got a bum. The bum. He's just having a slid out of it.

380
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,120
 Don't really do that, though, do you?

381
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,160
 No, it's not ideal.

382
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,280
 No, but you would want the man's tummy.

383
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,480
 Right. It's different, isn't it? There's less going on in the stomach.

384
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,760
 Rumbling if it's hungry.

385
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,800
 Yeah, that's true. You don't have to be well fed.

386
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,320
 Sorry, what were we talking about?

387
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,000
 I mean, pillow's a long time ago.

388
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,840
 Um, yes, so, um, Chinese, um, people, they used to use ceramic pillows.

389
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,600
 Well, actually, James, they still do.

390
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,920
 I've got someone staying with me and she's from Singapore.

391
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,040
 And she said her aunt still uses ceramic pillows.

392
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,640
 Cool. Is that right? Very cool.

393
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,680
 Just in the summer off.

394
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
 They just stopped talking to her aunt recently, but...

395
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,000
 ...following a pillow fight where...

396
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,840
 But because they lived in small, um, living spaces,

397
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,000
 they would be, um, decorative as well.

398
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,720
 Um, and they would be given as wedding gifts and they'd be kind of a sign of,

399
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,880
 you know, wishes for many happy years of marriage or offspring or whatever.

400
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,640
 Some of them were, um, shaped.

401
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,000
 So there were lion-shaped ones which would scare off evil spirits, which is useful.

402
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,840
 There were some shaped-like frogs.

403
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,400
 And there was a fashion for some shaped-like sleeping children.

404
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,840
 Hmm. Yeah.

405
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,160
 Yeah, I think they thought that, like, pillows could commune between the spirit world and human world.

406
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,800
 So they'd put, like, children playing on them to, like,

407
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
 bring children into the family or specific.

408
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
 There's one in the Met in New York that's got a drawing of two boys playing in Piennes,

409
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,520
 which is a partner to ensure, like, baby boys and airs would come along.

410
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,200
 And there's one in the British Museum.

411
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,400
 Um, that is in the shape of a woman lying down with her head on a pillow.

412
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,960
 Um, and yeah, on the concave bit of the woman around her hip where you put your head.

413
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,560
 There's a lovely poem which says,

414
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,920
 "The wind rustles flowers under a snow white moon."

415
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,360
 I, I read this and I can't quite believe it, which is that in medieval times,

416
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,240
 pillows were really for, for people who are a bit weedy.

417
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,040
 Yeah.

418
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,000
 They were only for the elderly or pregnant women.

419
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,040
 They still are, actually.

420
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,800
 I sleep on a, I sleep on a piece of tube, I fall with nails stuck there.

421
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,720
 Take the man out of Bolton.

422
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,320
 I do have a reason why you should throw your pillows away, James,

423
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,720
 and go back to that piece of tube before with nails in it.

424
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
 Why is that, Andy?

425
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,840
 There was a study by the University of Manchester, which took pillows,

426
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,360
 which have been used for various lengths of time.

427
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,200
 And they found several thousand spools of fungus per gram of pillow.

428
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,840
 They found 47 different species of fungus.

429
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,000
 So that's, that might be what you're sleeping on.

430
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,440
 Yeah, I read that a third of the weight of any pillow,

431
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,000
 if you've been using it for ages, is dead skin.

432
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
 I think that's my, some people think that might be true.

433
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,680
 Some people think that might have been the rumour put about by pillow,

434
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
 might be facturists, by big pillow.

435
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
 That big guy.

436
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,160
 No, you would think, wouldn't you?

437
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,440
 And it's not just dead skin.

438
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
 It's also house-might corpses.

439
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,800
 And house-might eggs can run and, I'm living house-mights, I know what it is.

440
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,760
 But if it was one third of an entire pillow.

441
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,280
 You would, that's a lot of a pillow.

442
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,920
 You would think you could tell if just one end was just your skin.

443
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
 Yeah, that's true.

444
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,400
 Mind you, but we sleep with pillowcases, right?

445
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,320
 So it doesn't have all the gross stuff going on there and then you change it.

446
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,440
 And then you wash it.

447
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
 Wow, I know who washes up pillow.

448
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,800
 You put a pillowcase around a turd.

449
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,640
 It's still a turd, isn't it?

450
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,000
 It's still bad, yeah.

451
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,680
 So even that is true.

452
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,160
 Hitler's pillowcase, I'm afraid we've reached the Hitler bit of the podcast.

453
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,200
 His pillowcase was not only monogram with his initials.

454
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,440
 It had an eagle and the swastika on it.

455
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,640
 Yeah, it was auctioned in 2011.

456
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,520
 And a pillowcase on a sheet was over £2,000.

457
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,160
 That's not much.

458
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,880
 It's not, well, come on, the Hitler's pillowcase.

459
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,360
 I didn't realise we had a collector in the room.

460
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,520
 I didn't lock up for that.

461
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,480
 Okay.

462
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,520
 Do you want to random swastika facts?

463
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,400
 I got two actually.

464
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,880
 One, the oldest bit of human writing ever found it's got a swastika in it.

465
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,920
 And two, the word swastika is Sanskrit and it means kind of lucky, how fortunate.

466
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,000
 Yes, Hindu symbol.

467
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,880
 The oldest writing.

468
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,280
 So that's the ancient Hindu Indo-European Sanskrit?

469
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,360
 No, it's not, it's pre-Sanskrit.

470
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,160
 Yeah, it's proto-Sanskrit, proto-European.

471
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,200
 You know, if you get to a hotel and you don't like your pillow,

472
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,800
 you can order a pillow menu.

473
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,600
 Not in all hotels.

474
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,920
 Not all hotels, but we've just finished a tour.

475
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,520
 And I don't think a single one of the hotels that we stated had a pillow menu.

476
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,320
 Yeah, sorry, I should have said so-so in hotels.

477
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,440
 Provided pillow menu.

478
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,440
 I've worked in hotels that had pillows, yeah, yeah.

479
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,840
 And they would be like, let's say you had an anti-allergen pillow.

480
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,560
 You might have that or hard or soft or general pillows tummy or whatever.

481
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,960
 Or pillow with, I'd like one with an eagle in a swastika right?

482
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,160
 Please do you have one of those?

483
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:26,160
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

484
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,120
 My fact this week is that Oscar Wilde ate his books as he read them.

485
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,840
 This was, there was a book that was written by Thomas Wright called "Bilt of Books,

486
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,000
 How Reading Defined the Life of Oscar Wilde".

487
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,880
 In it, he reveals that as Oscar Wilde was reading books,

488
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,960
 he would tear off the top corner of each page once he'd read it and eat it

489
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,000
 and then keep moving on.

490
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
 It was just the habit of his that he did-

491
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,280
 Instead of having like a bookmark, right?

492
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,000
 I guess so, yes.

493
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,640
 So wherever the chomp has been taken out of the corner.

494
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,800
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

495
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,480
 Why don't we all do that?

496
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,160
 Well, have you ever eaten paper?

497
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,800
 Yeah.

498
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,600
 Do you like it?

499
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,560
 I don't mind it.

500
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,000
 It's not my favourite.

501
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
 It's no Greg's steak bake.

502
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,240
 I think it's not that nice eating paper.

503
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,440
 I think in a small amount it's fine.

504
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,640
 I've been reading a lot on Oscar Wilde recently.

505
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,040
 That's one of the fun facts that I discovered.

506
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,560
 Eat the books as you read them.

507
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,520
 No, I didn't.

508
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,120
 It's the internet. He was reading them.

509
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,880
 I think you could eat them.

510
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,280
 If you're reading online, you have to take a bite.

511
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,400
 Oh, good.

512
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,440
 Very nice.

513
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,920
 So there was an exhibition not too long ago,

514
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,720
 2016 in Reading Prison, where they showed all of the books

515
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
 that Oscar Wilde had while he was in prison.

516
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,520
 He did it.

517
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,320
 And they did it.

518
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,720
 Yes, it's an empty exhibition.

519
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,760
 But basically, when he was in jail,

520
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,800
 you weren't really allowed to have access to books,

521
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,200
 but because he was such a prominent figure.

522
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,280
 He was the only one who was allowed.

523
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,080
 Basically, they have a special dispensation for him, right?

524
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,320
 Yeah, he was allowed to keep his light on at night,

525
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,360
 longer than everyone else.

526
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,280
 So what I like about it is that Reading Jail was the only reading jail.

527
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,400
 Wow.

528
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,040
 Very nice.

529
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,000
 Yes.

530
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
 I read that I'm a bit ahead on the details.

531
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,040
 I think he was allowed, it was technically a long letter

532
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,200
 that the governor of the prison allowed him to write.

533
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,040
 Because you were allowed to write a letter.

534
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,520
 Oh.

535
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,880
 But he was writing a huge long...

536
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,160
 Oh, so this is the righting path.

537
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,040
 Deeper fundus.

538
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,240
 Deeper fundus, exactly.

539
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,960
 Yeah, so that was when he was in prison being allowed to write.

540
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,760
 Yes, yeah.

541
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,600
 And we see it, interestingly, as a letter,

542
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,560
 because it starts dear Bozy to his lover

543
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,000
 and who he ended up going to prison as a result of the relationship with.

544
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
 And Bozy never read it until after Oscar Wilde had died.

545
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,160
 It was never written to be a private letter to him,

546
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,280
 done in long form.

547
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,560
 It was meant to be published.

548
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,320
 And it was written and sent to a publisher, as opposed to Bozy himself.

549
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,360
 So yeah, it was a good cheat that he pulled off.

550
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,120
 Oh, it's a huge sort of philosophic.

551
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,640
 It's his deepest work, I think, that Oscar Wilde did just life.

552
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,560
 And why he was in there and what people thought about sex

553
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,160
 and gender and all that sort of stuff, I think.

554
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,880
 And he's pretty rude about Bozy in it.

555
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,840
 Because Bozy encouraged him to sue for libel

556
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,440
 when Bozy's father had been extremely rude about world and public

557
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,600
 and said that the cost would be covered and all of this.

558
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,840
 And as it was, the libel truck collapsed.

559
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,120
 Oscar Wilde was sued for what time was gross in decency,

560
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,400
 being gay, basically.

561
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,800
 And as a result, went to prison.

562
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,440
 So he's quite annoyed with Bozy in bits of it.

563
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,320
 You know that he, supposedly his last words were

564
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,400
 my wallpaper and I fighting a Jewel to the death,

565
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,800
 one or one or either of us has to go.

566
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,040
 So I knew I'd to find out what his wallpaper was like.

567
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,240
 [LAUGHS]

568
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,040
 Because it must have been pretty horrible, right?

569
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,400
 I think you'd find that.

570
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,680
 I didn't.

571
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,320
 But I found out that his wallpaper in his own house,

572
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,720
 back in London, because he died in Paris in a hotel, right?

573
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,800
 He, in his own house, he had a drawing room with dragons painted

574
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,760
 all over a blue ceiling.

575
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,400
 And his wallpaper was, had peacock feathers.

576
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,680
 It was like peacock feathers all set into the plaster of the walls.

577
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,920
 And then I don't know whether the hotel in Paris,

578
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,600
 where he died, knows this, because they've

579
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,480
 re-decorated the Oscar Wilde room, where he died,

580
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,360
 with a fresco of kissing peacocks.

581
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,200
 And the other thing that's on show in there is the bill

582
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,080
 from his hotel's day, where he, when he died.

583
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
 And he never paid it.

584
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,080
 And apparently he said, I am dying above my means.

585
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,520
 Mm, yeah.

586
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,920
 But I don't think that they were his final words,

587
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
 where they were their wallpaper thing.

588
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,200
 So he had an operation just before he died.

589
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,560
 And while he was recuperating, he said that last words.

590
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,760
 And he said a few other last words as well, saying I can't

591
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,360
 even afford to die and things like that.

592
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,160
 But when he actually died, I don't think he was in any fit

593
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,240
 states, be making whizzes and so on.

594
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,600
 James, you just read the whole lovely ending.

595
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
 It was definitely nearly his love.

596
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,560
 Yeah, yeah.

597
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,440
 So I read a thing.

598
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,360
 Andy and I were talking about the downstairs,

599
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,480
 because there's a sense that it's been debunked,

600
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,040
 this fact that I'm about to say.

601
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
 But I read it in a Christopher Hitchens article,

602
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,760
 where he talks about the hidden--

603
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,960
 the hidden sort of innuendos that was all the way

604
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,200
 through the importance of being earnest, the play.

605
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,080
 So Christopher Hitchens says that the word earnest used

606
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,440
 to be Victorian slang for, if you were homosexual.

607
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,120
 So the idea was, Oscar Wilde loved the idea on the marquee.

608
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,440
 It was effectively saying the importance of being gay

609
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,280
 was his big sort of hidden message that was underneath it.

610
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,320
 And that seems to have been slightly debunked.

611
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,800
 But it's interesting, because Hitchens brings up

612
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,320
 a bunch of different examples where he

613
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,120
 ceded sort of hidden meanings within the play.

614
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,280
 So for example, there's a character,

615
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,880
 a minor character called Bloxham.

616
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,360
 Bloxham was famous at the time as an editor

617
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,880
 of a magazine, a gay magazine called The Chameleon.

618
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,960
 And he was a very controversial character.

619
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,800
 Cessely was one of the characters' names

620
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,240
 of one of the high society girls.

621
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,960
 That, according to Hitchens, was vernacular

622
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,240
 for transvestite rent boys back in the day.

623
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,840
 And just lots of little bits of hidden hints

624
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,720
 towards the two main male characters

625
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,640
 having alternative lives that they're trying

626
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,720
 to hide was a suggestion that they were both themselves gay.

627
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,440
 And if there was a missing handbag in--

628
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,400
 A handbag.

629
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,880
 [LAUGHTER]

630
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,400
 Very nice.

631
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,600
 Where-- and supposedly sort of meetup places,

632
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,520
 where guys would go to meetup sort of illegally,

633
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,520
 would be places like lost property places and so on.

634
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,000
 So another thing that you were telling me, Dan,

635
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,280
 is about the mark was of Queen's Brie.

636
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
 Yes, yeah.

637
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,360
 Well, my original fact for this was

638
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,640
 that to protest at the opening of the importance

639
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,040
 of being earnest about the relationship of Oscar Wilde

640
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,920
 and Bo C, the marquee of Queen's Brie,

641
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,560
 try to interrupt the premiere with a bouquet

642
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,800
 of phallic-shaped vegetables.

643
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,640
 Did you, like, riddle on stage or what did he do?

644
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
 That was his plan.

645
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,040
 He was going to go inside.

646
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,880
 And he went with a posse.

647
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,520
 He went with like a crew, kind of like how Conor McGregor

648
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,920
 recently threw stuff at a bus.

649
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,720
 That was kind of the marquee of Queen's Brie.

650
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,200
 Conor McGregor didn't throw phallic vegetables, did he?

651
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,640
 No, they were phallic chairs.

652
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,640
 [LAUGHTER]

653
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,720
 So do you have to, like, carve a phallic vegetable?

654
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,200
 No, I don't think so.

655
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,080
 Well, this-- so I think he definitely did take along vegetables.

656
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,360
 He took along a bus good vegetable to throw at the stage

657
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,560
 and throw out wild and protest.

658
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,000
 But I think they weren't especially phallic.

659
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,920
 I think they were just carrots and turnips because I--

660
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,960
 But then carrots are quite phallic, aren't they?

661
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
 All of them really.

662
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,160
 Hasn't it?

663
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,320
 Yeah, yeah.

664
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
 Cucumber.

665
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,160
 Yeah, OK.

666
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,680
 Overgene.

667
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,760
 What we're saying is that many vegetables

668
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,320
 are kind of a little bit phallic in nature.

669
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,840
 Yeah.

670
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,560
 And so to say that these were phallic vegetables seems plausible.

671
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,920
 Yeah, but what I don't think is true that the marquis of Queen's

672
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,600
 free went around selecting.

673
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,960
 I think that'll be a weird thing to protest against homosexuality

674
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,960
 by going around looking for penises wherever you could find it.

675
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,320
 And we'd say more about the marquis's own state of mind

676
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
 than about violence.

677
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,160
 But that-- so he wasn't allowed in.

678
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,320
 He didn't get led into the plate.

679
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,920
 And then he left a card, I think, at least.

680
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,920
 Sorry, can I just say, did they not let him in

681
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,520
 because he was carrying the vegetables?

682
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,840
 Like, did they-- you know when you go to a gig,

683
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,400
 and they have to check your handbag?

684
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,560
 In case you got, like, some--

685
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,800
 [LAUGHTER]

686
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,240
 But yeah, so was that the reason why,

687
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,920
 obviously, because they recognized him?

688
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,200
 I think probably he turned up angry with thugs

689
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,080
 and holding vegetables.

690
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,240
 And they thought, oh, it's the opening night.

691
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,120
 Let's not take the chance.

692
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,640
 Yeah.

693
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,000
 And also, he was famous for going to premieres of theater

694
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
 shows to protest them.

695
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,400
 That was his thing.

696
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,440
 So he went to one play that he was protesting

697
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,160
 that they were giving atheists a bad name.

698
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,080
 It was only Tennyson.

699
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,600
 He was an above atheist, yeah, that's right.

700
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,120
 And then he brought vegetable shape like Jesus.

701
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,280
 Yeah, exactly.

702
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,520
 Well, a lot of vegetables actually look like teens think about it.

703
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,200
 Yeah.

704
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,680
 Which one?

705
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,600
 Nugly.

706
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,680
 Drusula Martichoke, hello.

707
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,440
 Yeah, play actually failed.

708
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,120
 In short, being honest, failed as a result of this trial

709
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,000
 happening.

710
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,560
 It closed after 83 performances.

711
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,960
 It's part of getting crazily good reviews.

712
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,560
 But it survived longer than it should have.

713
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,560
 What they just did was take his name off the bill.

714
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,920
 So they just erased Oscar Wilde from the production,

715
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,280
 because he was up there on the marquee.

716
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,480
 It was an Oscar Wilde play.

717
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,040
 Yeah, and they just say, all right, let's get rid of that

718
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,960
 and let's keep it going.

719
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,320
 So it should have come off 30 or 40 performances

720
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,720
 before, then really.

721
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,760
 But when he didn't manage to get into the play,

722
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,320
 the marquee, I think he went to Wilde's club,

723
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,760
 and he left a card saying, "To Oscar Wilde, posing

724
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,240
 as a Sondermite."

725
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,560
 He meant to write Sondermite, and he misspelled it.

726
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,160
 But I think to a writer, that has

727
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,560
 got to be more of an insult almost and spelling it right.

728
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,960
 That's what makes it annoying.

729
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,200
 And that's what made Bozy say, no,

730
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,720
 you have to sue my father for libel.

731
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,920
 And that's when Wilde did sue you.

732
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,040
 Well, one card's spelled wrong.

733
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,560
 Yeah.

734
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,080
 He shouldn't have done that.

735
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,120
 With the benefit of hindsight, Molly, no, he shouldn't

736
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,960
 have done that.

737
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,880
 [LAUGHTER]

738
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,120
 He should have sent it back.

739
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,560
 He spelled it wrong.

740
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,000
 [LAUGHTER]

741
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,080
 Did you know the Oscar Wilde's on the front cover

742
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,360
 of the Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band?

743
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,880
 Nope.

744
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,400
 Is he?

745
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,080
 OK.

746
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,960
 He's looking over the shoulder of John Lennon.

747
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,080
 The other thing I found out is that is about his tomb.

748
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,680
 So he's buried in Père Lache's cemetery in France, Paris,

749
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,000
 where lots of famous people are.

750
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,200
 And his tomb has got a big sphinx flying across it.

751
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,080
 Have you seen it?

752
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,880
 Yeah.

753
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,240
 And yeah, so it was described as a demonic flying angel,

754
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,720
 and it had a huge set of genitalia,

755
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,440
 which apparently the keeper of the cemetery said--

756
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,480
 Oh, it's actually a cucumber.

757
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,200
 Or a carrot, a balsnip.

758
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,840
 Yeah, the keeper said that this is totally indecent.

759
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,840
 So they just covered it up with a tarpaulin for a little while.

760
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,040
 Anyway, so then, they said, right, we're

761
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,400
 going to have to sort this out, a tarpaulin's just not going to work.

762
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,800
 So they made a bronze butterfly-shaped cod piece

763
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,840
 and put that over the top.

764
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,280
 And then Alistair Crowley, apparently, stole it.

765
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,160
 Yeah, he was known as a wickedness man on earth, wasn't he, Crowley?

766
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,680
 Yeah.

767
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,400
 He was like-- what was he like?

768
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,480
 He was like a dark magician who, like David Blank.

769
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,480
 The newspaper's called him evil because he was--

770
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,000
 he had very poor morals and was kind of corrupting the young,

771
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,920
 like, say-- Oh, yeah.

772
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,440
 Like Jeremy Corbyn.

773
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,200
 OK, so he's a cross between David Blank and Jeremy Corbyn.

774
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
 I think I understand who the saddest guy is.

775
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,600
 Apparently, when he was on holiday in Egypt with his wife,

776
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,880
 Bruce, he had a vision of someone dictating

777
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,680
 like a book of laws to him, and he found it a whole new religion.

778
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,280
 Crowley.

779
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,120
 No, Corbyn.

780
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,120
 Corbyn.

781
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,000
 There's a bookshop not too far from here, which is called Watkins.

782
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,920
 And it's an esoteric bookshop.

783
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,320
 It's a Colton, all that sort of stuff.

784
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,960
 It's amazing.

785
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,800
 And they have a story, which is that Alistair Crowley

786
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,040
 used to shop there.

787
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
 And he came in one time.

788
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,680
 And the owner said, I don't believe

789
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,960
 that you have all these magic tricks.

790
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,920
 And then he said, well, watch this.

791
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,200
 In an instant, he made all of the books disappear in the shop.

792
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,840
 And then a second later, they all came back.

793
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,160
 That's because he went in with Oscar Wilde.

794
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,320
 He ate the book.

795
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,960
 [LAUGHTER]

796
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,840
 Anyway, so Alistair Crowley, he took the butterfly off--

797
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,800
 he nicked it, basically.

798
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,040
 And then, when he went to London,

799
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,920
 he got all dressed up, put the butterfly on his jacket.

800
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,200
 And he went to Cafe Royal and hung out with all of his friends.

801
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,280
 And was like, I've got Oscar Wilde's butterfly copies.

802
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,200
 And now everyone can see his massive gentleman

803
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
 earlier on the swings, right?

804
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,440
 And then, they're now not there.

805
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,760
 And the rumor is that two angry ladies

806
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,600
 who were walking in the cemetery just got some rocks

807
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,240
 and bashed it off because they didn't like it.

808
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,280
 And yeah, and apparently, the balls are now

809
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,280
 used at paper weights in the pair Laschet's conservation

810
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
 office.

811
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,840
 Is that right?

812
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,560
 That's what I'd like to happen to my balls off

813
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,640
 the dry die.

814
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,240
 And I believe the penis shaft is used as a draft excluder

815
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,600
 under the door in the office as well.

816
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,960
 Very good, please.

817
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,240
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

818
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,040
 OK, it is time for our final factor, the show.

819
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,840
 And that is Andy.

820
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,440
 My factor is that the New York police

821
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,120
 have a casting director for their lineups, which is--

822
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,280
 now he's not a proper policeman.

823
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,780
 Right.

824
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,920
 He's not even a rogue policeman.

825
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,760
 He's just a guy.

826
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,520
 And there was a profile of him in the New York Times

827
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,040
 a few years ago.

828
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,440
 He's called Robert Weston.

829
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,080
 And whenever the police and the Bronx need to do a line up,

830
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,520
 they say we need five light skinned Hispanic men.

831
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,840
 He'll say, OK, I know just the people are ranked.

832
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,880
 They all get $10.

833
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,120
 He gets $10 for organizing a thing.

834
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,560
 And he's been doing this for years.

835
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,520
 And he can find various different categories of people.

836
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,200
 That's really cool.

837
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,880
 Yeah.

838
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,920
 It's a very weird casting job that he does.

839
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,520
 But he's been doing it for ages.

840
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,600
 So these days, we have something called Viper.

841
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,120
 In the UK, which is the video identification

842
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,160
 parade electronic recording.

843
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,040
 And it's basically a database of loads of different faces.

844
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,920
 And so you go into your database and you say,

845
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,120
 this person has this colorized, this color of hair and whatever.

846
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,360
 And then it just finds people who look like them.

847
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,200
 Basically, instead of getting a ten of her every line up

848
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,400
 you do, you get paid a ten of ones.

849
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,920
 And then your face is in the system.

850
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,440
 Ah, right.

851
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,960
 What it means is that they can go to the house

852
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,120
 of the person who's been a victim of the crime.

853
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,880
 So if you've been mugged, the police will come

854
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,760
 around to your place.

855
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,600
 And they'll show you on a computer a line up and say,

856
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
 can you identify any of these people?

857
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,160
 Yes.

858
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,680
 So with the Viper thing, if you're accused,

859
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,520
 then you can ask your lawyer to get the police to Photoshop

860
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,400
 any distinctive mark you might have on your face.

861
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,240
 So for instance, I have a scar on my face, don't I, under my eye?

862
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,240
 What's that from?

863
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,360
 I'm from when I was--

864
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,280
 Hello Viper.

865
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,800
 I was in the West Point military when I was young.

866
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,600
 No, I just fell when I was a child.

867
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,720
 And it's basically--

868
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,120
 I couldn't make it so everyone else has this exact scar

869
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,200
 on so that it's not--

870
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,240
 Oh, cool.

871
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,760
 Nice.

872
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,960
 So you wouldn't have raised it off.

873
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,080
 You've just put it on everyone else.

874
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
 Yeah.

875
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,480
 Surely--

876
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,720
 Yeah, because if people are looking for--

877
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,280
 if they remember a birthmock or a scar on their face,

878
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,440
 they'll fixate on that.

879
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,280
 And they might misidentify if they're just looking for that thing.

880
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,160
 But surely it's an incentive to criminals

881
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,920
 to do all their crimes in a fabulous hat or something.

882
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,680
 Because then you can just make everyone in the ID

883
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,960
 parade wear a fabulous hat.

884
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,440
 That's what I'd do.

885
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
 I was a criminal.

886
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,320
 Well, like vegetables on it.

887
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,120
 Yeah.

888
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,520
 Do you know that in 2015, there was an ID parade of dogs

889
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,280
 in the UK.

890
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,800
 What's there?

891
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,320
 Yeah.

892
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,600
 Because a dog did a crime.

893
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,920
 A dog did a crime.

894
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,080
 What did you do?

895
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,480
 It drew a bit in a girl in Wales.

896
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,160
 And the police ran an ID parade of dogs,

897
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,800
 which were all from the street that the biting had taken place.

898
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,320
 Right.

899
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
 And the girl picked the right one.

900
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,160
 But then dogs are very different looking at them.

901
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,560
 I don't know if they tried to get five border collies.

902
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,520
 You just had a rock viola alone in chihuahas and poodles and stuff.

903
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,640
 I think they might have put the other dogs in border collie costumes.

904
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,440
 Two chihuahas, one in the front, one in the back.

905
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,840
 Actually, you could have a lineup where the dogs are the ones

906
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,320
 who are picking the criminal, because in some states

907
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,520
 of America, Alaska, Florida, New York, and Texas,

908
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,320
 they have sent lineups where dogs smell a number of people

909
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
 to pick out the suspect.

910
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,120
 And the FBI report from 2004 says it should not be used

911
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,120
 as primary evidence, because it's not exactly amazingly kind

912
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,120
 of accurate.

913
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,320
 But some of them just smell like food.

914
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,800
 We also get a bark at that one up.

915
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,560
 They rub sausages on all the criminals to court.

916
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,800
 If you smell like sausages, normally, you're

917
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,560
 allowed to ask your lawyer to make everyone else smell like sausages.

918
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,560
 But the dogs are not the victims of the crime.

919
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,880
 It's not which of these men called you a bad dog.

920
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:16,560
 No, they're just matching the scent with the scent from the crime.

921
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
 OK.

922
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,320
 Do you want to hear one thing about--

923
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,400
 so this is about people who look like each other in lineups.

924
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,960
 I didn't find one thing about look-alikes.

925
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,000
 Yeah, go on.

926
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,160
 It's this guy who's a Daniel Craig look-alike.

927
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,360
 And he was writing up his experiences.

928
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,200
 And he just sounds like he has a really tricky time.

929
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,880
 He was recounting some of his adventures.

930
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,400
 He's called Steve Wright.

931
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,360
 And he has these awful times.

932
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,160
 So he says he was flown out to Santa Fe

933
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,240
 by a millionaire rest to reenact the scene where James Bond comes out of the water

934
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,520
 in his swimming trunks.

935
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,880
 And he said, I was told to wait a few yards out of the water until my cue came,

936
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,520
 the theme tune from Casino Royal.

937
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,160
 But when it did, it sounded very faint.

938
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,800
 He says, I suddenly realized that somehow I drifted 100 yards out of sea.

939
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,800
 [LAUGHTER]

940
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,240
 I had to lunch back with sea water slapping in my face.

941
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,520
 By the time I reached the sound, I was totally out of breath and staggered out of the water.

942
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,480
 So you think I was bad?

943
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,880
 Then he did another party where he said it's more typical for him to be schmoozing

944
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,240
 ladies at a corporate event dressed as James Bond and looking like Daniel Craig.

945
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,280
 He did a function, a black tie ball.

946
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,760
 And he said, unfortunately, it was a black tie ball.

947
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,160
 So I didn't stand out easily.

948
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,800
 When I waltzed into the room of 250 people and attempted to charm the female contingent,

949
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,240
 I found myself being treated like a repellent sex person.

950
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,000
 [LAUGHTER]

951
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,960
 I tried taking a woman's arm and saying, so you must be pussy galore.

952
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,480
 Would you like me my escort to the night?

953
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,280
 Yeah.

954
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,360
 But I had failed to introduce myself as James Bond first.

955
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,200
 She pulled her arm back very quickly and called her husband over.

956
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
 [LAUGHTER]

957
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,960
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

958
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,200
 OK, that is it.

959
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,440
 That is all of our facts.

960
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,680
 Thank you so much for listening.

961
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,840
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over

962
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,800
 the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

963
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
 I am on @Streiberland.

964

 James.

965
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,720
 @JamesHarkin.

966
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,200

968
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,080
 And Moll.

969
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,160
 @MollielField.

970
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,480
 Yep.

971
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,640
 And Moll mentioned the name of your book again.

972
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,520
 It's called "Wonders of the World's Museums."

973
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,160
 Yeah, and it's available now on Amazon and in all book shops.

974
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,000
 All book shops.

975
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,480
 It's a guide to all the best things in museums around the world for children.

976
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,520
 Yeah, I've got it from my kid.

977
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,200
 It's awesome.

978
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,080
 So do go out and get that.

979
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,440
 You can also go to our website.

980
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,880
 No such thing as a fish.com.

981
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,600
 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

982
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,120
 We have links to our tour dates.

983
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,120
 And we have links to our book and other goodies.

984
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,200
 So go there and check it out.

985
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

986
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,800
 See you then.

987
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
 Goodbye.
