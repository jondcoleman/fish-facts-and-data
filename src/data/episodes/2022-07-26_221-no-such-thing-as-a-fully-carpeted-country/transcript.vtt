00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.900
 Oh hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.700
 this week coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.800
 James Harkin and special guest Alan Davies and once again we've gathered around the microphone

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.160
 with our four favorite facts this time about the World Cup and in no particular order here

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 we go.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.060
 Starting with you, Alan.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.520
 Austria qualified for the 1938 World Cup, but then had to withdraw because it stopped

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.040
 existing as a country.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.520
 It's a good excuse.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
 That's a good excuse.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.920
 It was the 30s, there was a lot of that kind of philosophy and made an existential crisis

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 in the camp.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.600
 They're not sure they exist and on that basis they were drawn.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.520
 Also they have been annexed by Germany.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.760
 It's not a big deal guys, but we won't be there.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.960
 Yeah, so that's Germany claimed Austria, right?

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.200
 Yeah, but they had to qualify.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.840
 You had to qualify in that year, in '38, while a lot of teams entered.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 So they've gone to a lot of trouble only to be annexed in the preamble to the tournament.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.600
 And they were very good, weren't they, in that they were then sort of the German team and

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.320
 the Austrian team then came together.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.640
 So they still eventually played a lot of the players.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.560
 Some of the players went a bit more fan-traff about it.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 Did they?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.560
 I just would not have it.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 Oh really?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 Yeah.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.960
 And actually the players who played didn't get on with the Germans and they all fell out

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.760
 and they ended up losing quite early, didn't they?

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.760
 Did they?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.760
 Yes, yeah.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.760
 Did it happen to the trophy during the Second World War?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.760
 No.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.840
 It probably melted down, I presume.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840
 It was under someone's bed.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 Was it?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.000
 Yeah, it was under shoebox under an Italian official's bed.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.800
 Yeah, because I think it did Italy win, it's in 1937 when it happened elsewhere, it didn't

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 happen in France.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 Yeah.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.680
 So France took it after Austria, it stopped being a thing.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.680
 Yeah.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.600
 And then I think Italy won and so an Italian official just looked after it.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.000
 Well, Italy won in '34 and this suspicion was that Mussolini chose all the referees for

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 their matches.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.140
 Yeah, in '34 Austria came forth behind Germany, so as presumably they hoped the combined

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.120
 might of Austria and Germany, at Uruguay who had stayed at tournament 9 to 30 and won it,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.400
 then Sultan didn't come because none of the European teams went to Uruguay, only four of

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.400
 them turned up.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.840
 It's such a strife, it's so immature, but you didn't come to my party, I'm not going

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840
 to Uruguay.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.880
 And when they did come back they won it again.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.840
 Do you know what happened when Austria did rip out in 1938, so obviously that left

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.960
 a gap and the runners up were Latvia who should have replaced Austria then in the tournament.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.800
 And the people were just like no, we'll just do without, it's fine, and they just gave Sweden

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.960
 a buy through the rounds instead of letting Latvia play at all.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960
 They just decided.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960
 Right.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960
 Not good enough.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.320
 I'm beginning to think that these FIFA guys are not completely fair and honest, I'm sorry

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.320
 for that.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.560
 Did they not offer for England to take part?

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560
 Oh, maybe they did.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560
 Yes.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.560
 England refused.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.080
 In the rounds at the home international tournament between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.000
 Ireland was of a higher standard and a more significant event.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.520
 Not even making that up.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.760
 We have our own international tournament.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.880
 This wouldn't even go.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.160
 It takes place entirely within our nation, on our little island, where everything's better.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.320
 This Austrian team, they were so good, they were kind of beating everyone at the time,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.520
 not England, they came up to England and lost, but they were beating everyone else by

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.760
 quite a lot.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.080
 And they had a new system that no one else used, and it was a 235 system.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.600
 So two defenders, three in midfield and five strikers, which is long being claimed to have

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.880
 been invented by Herbert Chapman at Arsenal.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.880
 Is that right?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.720
 And England didn't go into the World Cup, Arsenal played Italy at Highbury.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.880
 I say Arsenal, it was England, but they had seven Arsenal players in.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.680
 One in the game.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.320
 One in the game, three, two.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.920
 Would you say that the current England team is basically Tottenham?

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.920
 Yeah, so we're doomed.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.400
 Well, in the game, three, two, it became known as the Battle of Highbury.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400
 Oh, really?

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.040
 And it was decided by Arsenal supporters at the time that, therefore, you're officially

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.360
 the World Champions, having beaten Italy on air.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.360
 Oh, of course.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.360
 And that was with a 5-3-2.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.640
 Yeah, it was a revolutionary system.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.640
 There's only team ever played.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.640
 All up front.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.640
 Lantern, one, 10-0-0-0.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.640
 Yeah.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.040
 It's worth a try, right?

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.760
 So 1938 FIFA World Cup, the draw was selected by Jules Rimmett, who is the founder of the World

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.760
 Cup.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.760
 Jules Rimmett.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760
 Oh, Jules Rimmett.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.760
 It's actually an interesting fact.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.760
 It's Rimmett.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.760
 You Rimmett.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.760
 (LAUGHTER)

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.360
 Rimmett got his grandson to do the draw from a ball.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.280
 It was his grandson on top of a table, picked them out, and that's how the 19-30.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.160
 Now the draw nowadays can be seen from space, and more technology is used in it than was

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.040
 used on the Apollo moon landing.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.040
 Oh, come on.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.640
 It's just two things you say about almost every single fact we ever have, and it's bigger than

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.640
 a blue one.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.360
 It does sound like a QI script, just can't out your mouth.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.360
 This is the exact same thing.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.240
 They did reveal the logo, though, for this World Cup up in the International Space Station.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.920
 So it was the Russian cosmonauts who, uh, so, yeah.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.200
 And this year's matchball has been to space, so it just came back down in fact.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.960
 It was made in Pakistan, sent up to the ISS.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.480
 So no one kicked it up, did they?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.480
 Oh, sorry.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.840
 They kicked it while it was up.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.840
 Right.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.720
 They hoof it into the rocket, as the rocket was just leaving it.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720
 That would be different.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.720
 They did, yeah.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.720
 Only Beckham could do this.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.000
 Can I check something with you?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.360
 So you've said the matchball.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.320
 Now, that, to me, gives the impression there's only one ball for the whole World Cup.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.560
 And I know that can't be true, obviously.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.560
 Yeah.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.920
 I think this is the main, the, um, what was you call it?

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.920
 The signature ball.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.320
 Yeah, the one they'll probably use in the first game in the final, I guess.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.880
 But they'll use, they'll have lots of balls in every game.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.880
 It's a good call though.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.160
 They'd probably be like, we really need to wrap up these penalties with England and Brazil.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.320
 The Italian German match is happening.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.360
 I've got a fact about the 1930 World Cup, which is, um, the original and the best.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360
 The original.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.360
 Yeah.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.360
 And you're a guy and say that, don't they?

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.520
 So it was in you're a guy and, um, it was not a very advanced World Cup.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.040
 So for example, there was a match between Brazil and Bolivia where everyone was wearing

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.040
 white.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.360
 And it was very confusing when they just cricketers they got on their own pitch.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.480
 But there was, there was one way of telling, which is that half the Bolivians were wearing

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.480
 berets as well.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.080
 If you, if you kicked it to a guy wearing a beret, there was one in two chances he was on

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.080
 your team.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.080
 That's really good.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.520
 No, if you kicked it to a guy wearing a beret, there was a hundred percent chance he was

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.520
 on your team if you were Bolivian.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.520
 Yeah.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.520
 It's just that it was, uh, one in three chance, I guess, if you kicked it to a guy with

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.520
 that wearing.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.440
 Yeah, so I knew this went on.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.320
 I'm telling you what, a privilege is to be in the inner sanctuary.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.320
 We do actually say things like that to be done.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.320
 No, you're right.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.320
 You're going to get home.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.320
 They do it.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.840
 They actually pulled him up on it.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.640
 We were talking about, um, so England and the World Cup and British teams in the World

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.880
 Cup have a good history.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.440
 So Scotland, um, basically got in, but didn't quite in 1950.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.880
 So 1950, it was so weird.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.200
 FIFA really wanted British teams to be playing in the World Cup because they were still being

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.120
 really snooty with this whole Britain's better thing.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.080
 And so they said that if they played their home championship, the winner and the runner-up

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.760
 could play in the World Cup would both qualify.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.040
 And Scotland said that's insulting.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.040
 If we win, we'll play in it.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.320
 If we roll it up, we refuse.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.400
 And so they played their games and they both smashed Wales and Northern Ireland.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.400
 And then England beat Scotland and Scotland ran back to FIFA and said, "Please, we didn't

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400
 mean it.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.400
 That's interesting, aren't we?"

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400
 And FIFA didn't.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400
 They were like, "I'm really sorry.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.720
 You gave us your word."

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.200
 You said it was only if you won it.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200
 You won.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200
 Wow.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.200
 And that was the end of Scotland and the World Cup.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.720
 Have they never won it since then?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.720
 They've never won it.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.720
 They've won it.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.560
 You can't win it if you don't qualify, is he?

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.560
 Right, got it.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.560
 They used to qualify.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.560
 I mean, in my school days, it was always Scotland in and not England in the seventies.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560
 Thank you.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.560
 You used to be on a level pegging, actually, didn't they?

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.560
 Yeah.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.600
 England had a policy of refusing to pick their best players on the grounds that they had

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600
 long hair.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.600
 And I'm not even making them so much.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.360
 So that people like Stan Bowles and Rodney Marsh, who had long hair and Frank Worthington, who

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.720
 were all the most skillful players in the first division, because they didn't have a

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.320
 shortback in sides and play cards.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.320
 Oh, my God.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.040
 They would pick people who looked like they were in the army because most of the managers

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.040
 had been.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.040
 Wow.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.560
 They also would not pick maverick managers who were clever and inventive, like Garret

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.560
 Southgate.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.560
 Yeah.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.640
 He said the tradition of the English manager looks good in the blaze up.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.640
 And he's good.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.640
 And he's never seen.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.640
 He's a good man.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.640
 And he looks so confused.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.640
 The references we made.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.640
 I don't know what's going on.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.640
 It feels like that.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.640
 Good news, though, Andy.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.640
 You've got quite short hair.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.640
 Oh, great.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.640
 Well, I imagine I'll make it in, right?

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.640
 Yeah.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.640
 Yeah.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.640
 In the seventies, everything changed in the fashion front.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.480
 So people started growing their hair long.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480
 And England failed to qualify.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.480
 In 1974 and 1978.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.520
 And I'm convinced it's because all the best players had long hair and the older men were

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520
 offended.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.520
 And then, in the world covered in 1978, the leading scorer had really a load of hair.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.520
 And beer.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.520
 And I think he had his ear pierced.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.520
 And his name was Mario.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.680
 And he gave the lie.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.880
 And his partner in crime, his ferrocenter forward, had a headband.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.000
 I mean, that absolutely gave the lie a short back in size, being essential for winning football

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 matches.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Yeah.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 That's our excuse.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 That's our excuse in the seventies.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 One of the eighties and nineties.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 One of the eighties and nineties.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 One of the eighties and nineties.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 We got loads of people in the locker.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 We even have people with mullets.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 And we got to the semi-final.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 That's true.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 And in fact, it was one of the mullets.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.280
 Chris Waddle, who blasted his penalty over the bar.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.280
 But we forgive him.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.600
 I'm just thinking about the current squad.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.560
 There's not much long hair there, is there?

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.560
 So...

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.560
 No, times have changed.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.560
 Yeah.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.560
 Not matters now are tattoos.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.040
 How many arms leaves have you got?

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.040
 And how many piercings?

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040
 Do they want more or less?

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040
 Yeah, more.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040
 The more...

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.920
 I mean, Lionel Messi, who's the best player that's ever played football, has had one of his

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.280
 legs from the knee down entirely blacked out.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.280
 Wow.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280
 Yeah.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.280
 So they can't see it on the field.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280
 Yeah.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.280
 It's on sale.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.280
 In night matches.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.280
 And that is a floating boot going around with it.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.600
 See if he's not good enough as it is.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.560
 This boot is now detached from his body.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.160
 Doesn't Messi have really dodgy legs or something?

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.320
 Like, he had polio or something as a child.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.320
 Really?

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.320
 He was...

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.320
 Oh.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.320
 And he took tons of drugs.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.320
 He had to have lots and lots of...

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.320
 Yeah, hormones for growth.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.320
 Yeah.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.320
 Growth hormones.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.320
 And some people think that's a little bit naughty.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.840
 Well, I'm not sure about that.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.880
 When he came from Argentina when he was about 11 or 12, as this kind of mccurial prodigy,

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.480
 and he went to Barcelona and they said he's brilliant, but he's too small.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.320
 And then one of the coaches saw him and said, "He really is brilliant.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.320
 What can we do about him?"

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.320
 And they did that.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.320
 They had him on growth hormones.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.320
 Tell you he was about 13.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.320
 But he's still only five for seven.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.320
 Yeah, that's not working that well.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.320
 He's not like Michael Jordan.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.320
 He's not like Michael Jordan.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.320
 You actually think he's that small because half his legs are blacked out?

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320
 Yeah.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.320
 You can't see his legs.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:25.320
 Please say so far.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.080
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chisinski.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.080
 My fact is that this year, Argentina's Football Association gave its players a World Cup

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.200
 manual with a chapter on how to pick up Russian women.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.840
 So it was a booklet that was given out to journalists and to players and to coaches in Argentina.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.000
 And it was like a course about how to adapt to Russian culture.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.920
 And there was an entire chapter that was titled, "How to Stand a Chance with a Russian Girl."

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.200
 And it included advice like, "Make sure you're clean, smell good and dress well."

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.280
 Because apparently, Argentinian men love filthy, smelling women.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.280
 Can I just say as someone married to a Russian?

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.480
 I'm not sure they're bothered about cleverness and dressing well, but we haven't seen it

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.480
 before yet.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.480
 Well, are they bothered about this, James?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.160
 The booklet also said, "Russian girls hate boring men.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.480
 Never ask tight questions.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.480
 Be original."

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.440
 I wonder if my wife actually is Russian.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.520
 It also said that they don't like to be seen as objects, which is singular to Russian women.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.520
 But apparently, it's true of them.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.840
 But yeah, this was in the booklet.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.520
 And then apparently, Argentina got word of it from some of the journalists and went

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.760
 to rip all the pages out of this booklet and said, "Oh God, that wasn't meant to be in

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.760
 there.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.760
 Sorry.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.760
 It was a mistake.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.760
 Mistakely included."

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.760
 And it's no longer there.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.000
 I found a bit of, so there's a problem that Moscow's parliament has been telling people

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.800
 to be smart for the World Cup.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800
 OK.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.800
 And this is travelers, I think.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.040
 I think it's fans arriving, and there are on the spot fines in Moscow if you don't adhere

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.040
 to these rules.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.960
 And it's 500 rubles, which is the maximum, which is about 6 quid, so you can actually...

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.960
 That's great.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.280
 No jeans, no trainers.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.280
 Yeah.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.280
 It's like a nightclub.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.280
 It's like a big nightclub.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.280
 The name's knocked down.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280
 You're not coming in.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.280
 That definitely is one.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.280
 They've had that down for years.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.280
 Even the name's knocked down.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.280
 You're not getting out.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.280
 Yeah.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:17.680
 But it's, with visas this time, obviously, when you go into a country like Russia, you need

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.360
 a visa, but fans won't need a visa.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.560
 They have a fan visa, which is automatically given to them if they can show they have a ticket.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.560
 That's quite cool.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.560
 That's quite cool.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.760
 To prove interest or knowledge in football.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.760
 Just need a ticket.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.760
 Yeah, just need a ticket.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.760
 But under you wouldn't enjoy it.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.760
 There's no point in lying.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.760
 I don't have a ticket either.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.760
 That's fine.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.440
 The amount of information you have to give on the official ticket website to get a ticket.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440
 Oh, really?

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440
 Yeah.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.440
 Mark Zuckerberg would absolutely.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.720
 And you've actually got to give your parents details.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.720
 What are the awesome stuff?

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.720
 Oh, everyone.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.720
 Is it like your passport information?

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.720
 Yeah, probably every country you've been to.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.720
 Like everything.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.720
 To vote for on love island.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.720
 You have to.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.920
 Andy, we've suddenly hit an interest point for you here on the podcast.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.920
 We're not here to discuss that.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.720
 People aren't tense about this one, right?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.720
 Didn't the head of-

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.720
 So about this love island?

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.720
 I know I am.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.720
 Yeah.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.720
 Kendall was robbed.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.880
 I saw Kendall this morning in the flash.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880
 Did she?

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.400
 At the this morning's studios.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.560
 She is very, very small.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.720
 And one of her legs is completely invisible.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.520
 Never been seen in the same room.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.920
 Isn't there no messy?

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.920
 Fascinating.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.160
 If you go out, just put on the door of the tunnel.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.880
 The greatest conspiracy theory I heard in this show.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.880
 Kendall Messi.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:40.960
 No, the head of football policing in the UK has warned the Brits, basically, not to

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.960
 be to Agro.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.960
 Haven't they in Russia?

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.200
 So they said don't wave St. George's flags around.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.200
 Don't drink.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.200
 Don't drink.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.200
 Don't drink.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.960
 There's a security expert, a man who calls himself a security expert.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.640
 He's a director of the University of Buckingham Center for Security Intelligence.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.040
 He's called Anthony Gleese, but he did an interview with the Express.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.120
 So I want to have a reliable he is, but he warned.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.480
 Well, after he's been through the prism of the Express, then it ain't going to happen.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.680
 When did he say the world's going to end?

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.720
 And where is Princess Dunham?

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:22.920
 He seriously said that English footballers need to look out for Russian women who are actually

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.680
 spies disguised as women trying to seduce them, because he said if there's one way to

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.880
 scupper England's chances even more, it'll be through honey traps by leading the players

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.880
 on with gorgeous Russian girls.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.000
 I've heard the English team are going for a 10-0-0 formation this World Cup.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 What?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 I don't know how you jeopardise it.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.120
 And then you give them an STD or something that...

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.960
 Oh, cripples them for them.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.960
 Yeah.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.320
 Well, apparently Paraguayan prostitutes tried to seduce Venezuela and players in the qualifiers

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.720
 of this World Cup.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.720
 And?

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.720
 Yeah.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.720
 What?

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.840
 Well, it was weird, because actually neither team could qualify at that point.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:03.760
 But apparently, a load of prostitutes made it into their hotel lobby and they claimed they

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.240
 were trying to seduce them.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.920
 But to sort of detire them out before the big match?

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.920
 I suppose that might happen.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.640
 Because it sounds like they were just prostitutes doing their job and these were just men who

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.640
 wanted to show prostitutes.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.640
 Yeah.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.640
 It does sound like that.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.520
 This is in a way trip that all the Paraguayan squab were available for.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.400
 Who wants to go to Venezuela for the dead rubber?

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.400
 Me!

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.400
 Me!

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.400
 The dead rubber.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.440
 Is that a prostitution phrase, or is it a...

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.320
 It may also be, but in its context...

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.400
 So it gets thrown out the window and it acts.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.400
 Yeah.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.760
 But isn't it true, that?

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.160
 But actually, people think that you shouldn't have sex before football matches, right?

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.160
 Well, I've heard...

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.160
 No, footballers.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.160
 Footballers don't think that.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.160
 No.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
 Sometimes, there's people who charge them and think they charge them out.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.160
 Yeah, I've heard it doesn't really affect your performance, actually.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.160
 Yeah.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.160
 I don't think so.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.440
 Yeah, there's a football health coach called Nick Littlehaels, who's Christiana Ronaldo

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.440
 Sleep Coach, as well as a bunch of other people sleep coach.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.200
 Sorry, Christiana Ronaldo Sleep Coach.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200
 Yeah.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200
 Right.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.200
 Got a sleep!

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:10.680
 Actually, it was not a tactic that worked, in fact.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.760
 But he says it's crap that athletes shouldn't have sex before big games, but he just says

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.360
 they do need to sleep so low.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.120
 So what he says is, I guess, they should have sex, but then their partners need to get

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.960
 up and go and sleep in a separate room, like in kind of Tudor times.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.960
 Ah!

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.960
 That's the idea.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:30.920
 And he introduced Sleeping Pods, so Christiana Ronaldo at his Real Madrid moment, isn't he?

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.920
 Yeah.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.200
 Real Madrid has Sleeping Pods, and every player has their own Sleeping Pods.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.960
 I imagine them all in orbit, somehow.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.960
 Yeah.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.960
 Yeah, they're only...

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.680
 Just been brought in back into the atmosphere for the match.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.680
 Yes, each match.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.680
 And then launched back into orbit.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.680
 Yeah.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.680
 That big dry ice.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.680
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.680
 Over there.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680
 Let me get woken up.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680
 Yeah.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680
 Where am I?

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.680
 What do you think?

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.680
 You woken up too early.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.680
 Let's wake up, Jennifer Lauren.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.680
 She's not here.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.680
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.680
 Well, that Paraguay in prostitutes will do.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.680
 (LAUGHTER)

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.680
 Where the Paraguay in prostitute pots?

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.680
 (LAUGHTER)

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:11.680
 (MUSIC)

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.520
 OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.520
 My fact this week is that scientists have invented anti-diving shin pads.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.520
 Oh!

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:27.520
 Do these scents psychologically that you're about to dive, and they hold your body up.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.520
 (LAUGHTER)

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.520
 On the pitch.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.520
 (LAUGHTER)

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.520
 In mid-air.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.520
 Yeah.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.520
 And they're broke us saying, "I'm fine.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.520
 It didn't touch me."

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.520
 Well, what it is.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520
 (LAUGHTER)

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.520
 I mean, they're completely useless.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.520
 Like, they're just stupid.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.520
 But they do exist.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.520
 There's a sensor in your boot.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.520
 There's a sensor in the shin pad.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.520
 And when they touch each other, the referee has an alarm, which will go off,

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.520
 so he knows that there's been contact.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.520
 Unfortunately, the problem is that you can file someone by pushing them in the back,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.520
 or whatever, so it doesn't let it completely pointless.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.520
 So they need to invent anti-diving body suits.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.520
 Yeah, it's like the same technology as you have in a fencing, I guess,

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.520
 when you know that someone's been hitting fencing.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.520
 There's a new version which makes your shin pads light up when you get kicked.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.520
 Kids would love light up shin pads.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.520
 Yeah.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.520
 It's just for the to light up.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.520
 Kick me.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.520
 (LAUGHTER)

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.520
 You kick yourself on the shin pad.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.520
 Penalty.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.520
 They almost brought this in for the Kanifa World Cup, which is just happened,

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.520
 which is the World Cup for countries that aren't really countries,

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.520
 which is sponsored by Paddy Power, and Paddy Power wanted to bring in some weird ass rules,

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.520
 you know, that were different than normal rules.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.520
 Right.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.520
 And they brought in one thing, which was a green card,

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.520
 which means if you get sent off for abusing the referee.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.520
 You can work in America.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.520
 (LAUGHTER)

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.520
 It's very tempting.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.520
 Even now.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.520
 There's a lot of state of the United States.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.520
 North Koreans offending.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.520
 (LAUGHTER)

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.520
 There's a lot of Mexicans.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.520
 What happens if you get so much fun?

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.520
 For the green cards, you get sent off, but they're allowed to bring on a substitute.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.520
 So they don't punish the team, they punish the player.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.520
 So they did that in this, in this World Cup.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.520
 And you actually went, didn't you, to the Kanifa?

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.520
 To the final and to one of the other games, yeah.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.520
 It's fun.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.520
 Who did you play?

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.520
 I saw Northern Cyprus against Abkazia in the first game,

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.520
 and then Northern Cyprus against...

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.520
 Who was a Kapitalia?

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.520
 I don't believe Abkazia lost Northern Cyprus.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.520
 I know.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.520
 Because I was supporting Abkazia, actually.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.520
 Where's Abkazia?

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.520
 It's a breakaway area of Georgia.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.520
 Do you know who's won?

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.520
 Does it finish at the same time as the World Cup?

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.520
 No, it finished.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.520
 I went to the final last weekend, then it was won by Kapitalia,

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.520
 which is a part of Ukraine where Hungarians live.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.520
 Oh, okay.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.520
 Oh, it's not a carpet warehouse.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.520
 Because it really sounds like one.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.520
 Yeah.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.520
 Run by Italians.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.520
 I'd like to see their television ads.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.520
 It's not the ones where the owner does it himself.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.520
 It's a Kapitalia.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.520
 Kapitalia.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.520
 Soon we will be our own country.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.520
 Fully Kapitalia.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.520
 The only Kapitalia nation on earth.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.520
 The other wall.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.520
 And the other wall.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.520
 I'd be world-to-world Kapitalia.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.520
 World-to-world Kapitalia.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.520
 World-to-world Kapitalia.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.520
 So on weird football rules, I was looking into.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.520
 Do you know the referee can send himself off?

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.520
 Do you know that?

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.520
 No, he needs a wee.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.520
 No.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.520
 He can send a card.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.520
 He doesn't card him.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.520
 Say yellow card.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.520
 That card happened, can it?

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.520
 It can happen.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.520
 It has happened.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.520
 Not in big football games.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:36.520
 But for instance, in 2005, Peterborough North End was playing Royal Mail AYL.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.520
 This was a lower leagues match.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.520
 And the referee Andy Wayne got really angry.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.520
 So someone disagreed with his decision.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.520
 A player disagreed with his decision.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.520
 And he flung away his whistle.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.520
 And he untucked his shirt.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.520
 And he ran up and labeled the player.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.520
 And then immediately he saw the error of his ways.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.520
 And he gave himself a red card and sent himself off.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.520
 And there was no one to replace him.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.520
 And then he waited to the car park for him.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.520
 Wow.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.520
 But they can also send off Linesman, which I didn't know.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.520
 So this has some type of...

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.520
 They've got so much power.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.520
 Yeah.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.520
 They've got more power than they should have.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.520
 So last year, there was Dundee beat Kalmanuk.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.520
 So this was an actual match with teams that...

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.520
 Well, it's in Scotland.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.520
 It's in Scotland.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.520
 But it's still real football.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.520
 As many of your listeners.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.520
 Oh my god.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.520
 So naive.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.520
 When I do a Scotland, of course, they're the best shows I have.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.520
 Are they?

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.520
 Better than Wales, Alan.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.520
 Don't do that.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.520
 What am I filled?

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.520
 So in Scotland, whom we love.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.520
 All of you.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.520
 In this match, the revs sent off the assistant referee

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.520
 and gave him a red card, because he was vomiting.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.520
 By the side of the pitch.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.520
 That's not a vomiting, send him off.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.520
 That is a bit harsh.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.520
 Yeah, I think it seems unfair.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.520
 You can't be sent off for vomiting.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.520
 Who was it who vomiting before a penalty and the...

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.520
 Well, because you're down.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.520
 Yeah.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520
 That was in the Euro.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520
 That was in England.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.520
 It depends on whether it's deliberate and malicious vomiting.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.520
 If you do it in the face of the goalkeeper, just before a penalty.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.520
 Yeah.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520
 He just did it on the pitch.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.520
 He put his hands on his knee.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520
 I was at that match.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520
 He put his hands on his knees.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.520
 We thought, "What's he doing?"

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.520
 Wow.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.520
 And then he suddenly looked up, ran up, smashed it in the net.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.520
 And on the television replay, you can see when he had his hands on his knees.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.520
 He was vomiting on the pitch.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.520
 I grabbed in because he once did a poo on the pitch.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.520
 Oh.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.520
 Yeah.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.520
 What was the video of this?

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.520
 There were so many cameras in the ground.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.520
 There must be a poo camera.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.520
 There was so many cameras in the ground.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.520
 There must be a poo camera.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.520
 There's video of him kind of dragging his bum on the grass.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.520
 Like a dirt.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.520
 Like a dirt.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520
 Like a staphage of ulterior.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.520
 And then people tweet him all the time, just saying.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.520
 Just remind the good...

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.520
 You poo to the pitch.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.520
 Yeah.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.520
 But he never got a yellow card in his whole career.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.520
 He probably scored the card as well.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.520
 Yeah.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.520
 No, he never did.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.520
 Can I each guy enter up with just a tiny bit of personal news?

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.520
 We're recording this on Anna's computer.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.520
 And there's a alarm that's come up that is to tell her she needs to get

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.520
 lural and olive oil in 25 minutes.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.520
 Well, the thing is, Anna always shits herself in the middle of a podcast.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.520
 Lural and olive oil.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520
 Lural and olive oil.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.520
 That's what every paragraph possibly takes for the world cup.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.520
 Wow.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.520
 I'm not extra virgin.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.520
 No.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.520
 So the penalty was invented by an Irish guy called William McCrum.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.520
 And no one liked him at first because they thought how on earth would anyone be so

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.520
 low as to deliberately commit a foul.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.520
 This was in a long time ago.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.520
 Yeah.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.520
 And they called it the Irishman's motion.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.520
 But they...

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.520
 Gary Linnaker.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.520
 I don't know.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.520
 Honour of that.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.520
 Performed an Irishman's motion.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.520
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.520
 And that is Andy.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:59.520
 My fact is that in April, police in Lima seized over 20,000 counterfeit

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:05.520
 Penini football sticker albums with a street value of $350,000.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.520
 Wow.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520
 That's amazing.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520
 Yeah.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.520
 And this keeps happening. It happens all the time because they're really...

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.520
 They're on the every four years.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.520
 Yes, true.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.520
 But the police in Italy have seized another 20,000 stickers.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.520
 And they said this could be the tip of the iceberg.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.520
 Every World Cup happens because they're quite, you know, valuable things.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.520
 I mean, the full ones are really valuable.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.520
 Yeah.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.520
 The empty ones, I guess, are valuable, too, because you can...

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.520
 Well, I went on eBay just to see what the highest...

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.520
 You're putting Penini sticker.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.520
 And there are empty albums from previous World Cups.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.520
 The highest value is sort of 5,000 pounds.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.520
 Sometimes for an empty book.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.520
 Well, the empty ones, if you can sell an eBay and empty book with all the stickers in it,

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.520
 then that's the best you can get.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.520
 Because then people get it and they get the enjoyment of putting the stickers in.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.520
 I understand that.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.520
 Yeah.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.520
 Yeah, that's worth thousands of dollars, by me.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.520
 To people like me.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.520
 And you do it, don't you?

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.520
 You've, in previous World Cups, called out on Twitter to say can we swap Penini stickers?

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.520
 Well, let's put this on the podcast.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.520
 Oh, okay.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.520
 No, no, I do, yeah, I do do stickers.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.520
 You live in North London, don't you, in Finnsbury Park?

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.520
 And you love people to approach you with football stickers.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.520
 Did you always do Penini?

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.520
 Because they won.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.520
 We did a different one when we were kids.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.520
 Merlin, yeah.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.520
 I did Merlin when they did the Bino stickers.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.520
 But then Dini came back in, didn't it?

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.520
 Penini recently has become huge.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.520
 Yeah.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.520
 Well, huge.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.520
 In my household.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.520
 You were dressed just to be clear.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.520
 Do you not do stickers?

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.520
 No.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.520
 Oh, no, my little boy now is keen.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.520
 In fact, he found some at the bottom of a well-known breakfast cereal recently.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.520
 And I thought this is going to cost me about a grand.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.520
 Yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.520
 It will cost you 773 pounds 60 to fill a book.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.520
 Yep.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.520
 Is that, is that, if that's if you get every single sticker first time?

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.520
 That's if you keep buying.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.520
 It's a mathematics professor has worked out that if you just keep buying

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.520
 and you don't do any swaps with anyone on average to have to complete the album.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.520
 But apparently, if you do have friends, it can be cheaper.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.520
 It can be cheaper.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.520
 And also, you can buy stickers direct from Penini.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.520
 Yeah, you're last 50 you can buy.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.520
 Yeah, but they failed then, haven't you?

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.520
 Have you?

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:24.520
 If you've just calling them out, so please, can I have Marcus Rashford?

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.520
 I've bought 5,000.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.520
 Well, that's what happened.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.520
 Music Magpie decided to test it out.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.520
 And they bought 5,000 stickers worth 800 pounds.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.520
 They only found 681 out of the 682 stickers.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.520
 So they were one shot.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.520
 They didn't have Raja Nangolin.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.520
 And he isn't even going, yeah, he's maybe going to the World Cup.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.520
 Is he not?

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.520
 No, really.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.520
 Yeah, he's I think, I think he didn't get picked.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.520
 But yeah.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.520
 Yeah.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.520
 Remember that in 1990, David Rowcastle of Arsenal had a coin made.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.520
 And he played, he played, he started in every qualify match England played.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.520
 He had a coin made in the S.O. World Cup coin collection.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.520
 And then when they picked the squad, they didn't pick him.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.520
 Oh, my God.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.520
 No, that's about so, so, so hurtful.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.520
 But I mean, I've got a coin.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.520
 Never mind playing every qualify.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.520
 You were thinking he had his own coin made on vanity.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.520
 He didn't have his own made.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.520
 He didn't mean to coin in the S.O. World Cup.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.520
 There was a really cool idea.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.520
 And James, I reckon you would like this.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.520
 There was a news agent in the 2016 Euro.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.520
 So Penini did for the Euro 2016.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.520
 They did a shop where basically people could meet up just to swap the Penini stickers.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.520
 I guess I'm not interested in me to go with people to do so.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:42.520
 This fact is about Lima.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.520
 Peru.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.520
 So they qualified about footballs.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.520
 Sorry, they were in the fact.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.520
 Yeah.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.520
 So they qualified, right?

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.520
 Yes.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.520
 Peru qualified.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:58.520
 But in Lima, where the match was against New Zealand, it's where they had a 2NL victory that got them in.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.520
 There was an app which is designed to warn people of an impending natural disaster.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.520
 So earthquakes, mainly.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:11.520
 And that app went off when Lima was celebrating because there was so much activity going on.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.520
 Oh, really?

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.520
 That an earthquake warning went out to everyone with that app.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.520
 How cool is that?

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.520
 There was so much geological activity.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.520
 Yeah, there was so many people just jumping around.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.520
 Which happens a lot in football stadiums, doesn't it, in America?

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.520
 In America, in football stadiums.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.520
 Yeah, so an American football stadium can register a very tiny earthquake to anything that's sensitive towards it.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.520
 And in Lima, they have that.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.520
 And there was once a madness festival in Finnsbury Park that set off a earthquake thing as well.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.520
 Really?

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.520
 Yeah.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.520
 You live in Finnsbury Park.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.520
 I can't see the sun here.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.520
 I was bizarrely looking into sponsorship that appears on jerseys.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:51.520
 So my favourite one is Athletico Madrid, who the sponsorship for their team in 2003 was a deal with Columbia Pictures.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:56.520
 So the sponsorship kept changing according to what movie they were pushing at that time.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:03.520
 So movies that appeared on their jerseys included white chicks, Spanglish, and Anaconda's the hunt for the Blood Orchid.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:12.520
 Okay, that's it.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.520
 That is all of our facts.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.520
 Thank you so much for listening.
