00:00:00,00:00:19,"Oh hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:23,this week coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:28,00:00:32,James Harkin and special guest Alan Davies and once again we've gathered around the microphone
00:00:32,00:00:37,with our four favorite facts this time about the World Cup and in no particular order here
00:00:37,00:00:38,we go.
00:00:38,00:00:40,"Starting with you, Alan."
00:00:40,00:00:44,"Austria qualified for the 1938 World Cup, but then had to withdraw because it stopped"
00:00:44,00:00:46,existing as a country.
00:00:46,00:00:47,It's a good excuse.
00:00:47,00:00:50,That's a good excuse.
00:00:50,00:00:55,"It was the 30s, there was a lot of that kind of philosophy and made an existential crisis"
00:00:55,00:00:58,in the camp.
00:00:58,00:01:01,They're not sure they exist and on that basis they were drawn.
00:01:01,00:01:05,Also they have been annexed by Germany.
00:01:05,00:01:10,"It's not a big deal guys, but we won't be there."
00:01:10,00:01:12,"Yeah, so that's Germany claimed Austria, right?"
00:01:12,00:01:14,"Yeah, but they had to qualify."
00:01:14,00:01:17,"You had to qualify in that year, in '38, while a lot of teams entered."
00:01:17,00:01:23,So they've gone to a lot of trouble only to be annexed in the preamble to the tournament.
00:01:23,00:01:28,"And they were very good, weren't they, in that they were then sort of the German team and"
00:01:28,00:01:30,the Austrian team then came together.
00:01:30,00:01:32,So they still eventually played a lot of the players.
00:01:32,00:01:36,Some of the players went a bit more fan-traff about it.
00:01:36,00:01:37,Did they?
00:01:37,00:01:38,I just would not have it.
00:01:38,00:01:39,Oh really?
00:01:39,00:01:40,Yeah.
00:01:40,00:01:43,And actually the players who played didn't get on with the Germans and they all fell out
00:01:43,00:01:46,"and they ended up losing quite early, didn't they?"
00:01:46,00:01:47,Did they?
00:01:47,00:01:48,"Yes, yeah."
00:01:48,00:01:50,Did it happen to the trophy during the Second World War?
00:01:50,00:01:51,No.
00:01:51,00:01:53,"It probably melted down, I presume."
00:01:53,00:01:54,It was under someone's bed.
00:01:54,00:01:55,Was it?
00:01:55,00:01:59,"Yeah, it was under shoebox under an Italian official's bed."
00:01:59,00:02:02,"Yeah, because I think it did Italy win, it's in 1937 when it happened elsewhere, it didn't"
00:02:02,00:02:03,happen in France.
00:02:03,00:02:04,Yeah.
00:02:04,00:02:06,"So France took it after Austria, it stopped being a thing."
00:02:06,00:02:07,Yeah.
00:02:07,00:02:11,And then I think Italy won and so an Italian official just looked after it.
00:02:11,00:02:17,"Well, Italy won in '34 and this suspicion was that Mussolini chose all the referees for"
00:02:17,00:02:18,their matches.
00:02:18,00:02:25,"Yeah, in '34 Austria came forth behind Germany, so as presumably they hoped the combined"
00:02:25,00:02:30,"might of Austria and Germany, at Uruguay who had stayed at tournament 9 to 30 and won it,"
00:02:30,00:02:35,"then Sultan didn't come because none of the European teams went to Uruguay, only four of"
00:02:35,00:02:36,them turned up.
00:02:36,00:02:40,"It's such a strife, it's so immature, but you didn't come to my party, I'm not going"
00:02:40,00:02:41,to Uruguay.
00:02:41,00:02:43,And when they did come back they won it again.
00:02:43,00:02:47,"Do you know what happened when Austria did rip out in 1938, so obviously that left"
00:02:47,00:02:53,a gap and the runners up were Latvia who should have replaced Austria then in the tournament.
00:02:53,00:02:57,"And the people were just like no, we'll just do without, it's fine, and they just gave Sweden"
00:02:57,00:03:00,a buy through the rounds instead of letting Latvia play at all.
00:03:00,00:03:01,They just decided.
00:03:01,00:03:02,Right.
00:03:02,00:03:03,Not good enough.
00:03:03,00:03:08,"I'm beginning to think that these FIFA guys are not completely fair and honest, I'm sorry"
00:03:08,00:03:09,for that.
00:03:09,00:03:12,Did they not offer for England to take part?
00:03:12,00:03:13,"Oh, maybe they did."
00:03:13,00:03:14,Yes.
00:03:14,00:03:15,England refused.
00:03:15,00:03:19,"In the rounds at the home international tournament between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern"
00:03:19,00:03:25,Ireland was of a higher standard and a more significant event.
00:03:25,00:03:26,Not even making that up.
00:03:26,00:03:28,We have our own international tournament.
00:03:28,00:03:30,This wouldn't even go.
00:03:30,00:03:37,"It takes place entirely within our nation, on our little island, where everything's better."
00:03:37,00:03:40,"This Austrian team, they were so good, they were kind of beating everyone at the time,"
00:03:40,00:03:43,"not England, they came up to England and lost, but they were beating everyone else by"
00:03:43,00:03:44,quite a lot.
00:03:44,00:03:50,"And they had a new system that no one else used, and it was a 235 system."
00:03:50,00:03:54,"So two defenders, three in midfield and five strikers, which is long being claimed to have"
00:03:54,00:03:56,been invented by Herbert Chapman at Arsenal.
00:03:56,00:03:57,Is that right?
00:03:57,00:04:02,"And England didn't go into the World Cup, Arsenal played Italy at Highbury."
00:04:02,00:04:06,"I say Arsenal, it was England, but they had seven Arsenal players in."
00:04:06,00:04:08,One in the game.
00:04:08,00:04:10,"One in the game, three, two."
00:04:10,00:04:12,Would you say that the current England team is basically Tottenham?
00:04:12,00:04:14,"Yeah, so we're doomed."
00:04:14,00:04:18,"Well, in the game, three, two, it became known as the Battle of Highbury."
00:04:18,00:04:19,"Oh, really?"
00:04:19,00:04:23,"And it was decided by Arsenal supporters at the time that, therefore, you're officially"
00:04:23,00:04:26,"the World Champions, having beaten Italy on air."
00:04:26,00:04:27,"Oh, of course."
00:04:27,00:04:29,And that was with a 5-3-2.
00:04:29,00:04:31,"Yeah, it was a revolutionary system."
00:04:31,00:04:33,There's only team ever played.
00:04:33,00:04:34,All up front.
00:04:34,00:04:36,"Lantern, one, 10-0-0-0."
00:04:36,00:04:37,Yeah.
00:04:37,00:04:41,"It's worth a try, right?"
00:04:41,00:04:48,"So 1938 FIFA World Cup, the draw was selected by Jules Rimmett, who is the founder of the World"
00:04:48,00:04:49,Cup.
00:04:49,00:04:50,Jules Rimmett.
00:04:50,00:04:51,"Oh, Jules Rimmett."
00:04:51,00:04:52,It's actually an interesting fact.
00:04:52,00:04:53,It's Rimmett.
00:04:53,00:04:54,You Rimmett.
00:04:54,00:04:55,(LAUGHTER)
00:04:55,00:05:01,Rimmett got his grandson to do the draw from a ball.
00:05:01,00:05:05,"It was his grandson on top of a table, picked them out, and that's how the 19-30."
00:05:05,00:05:09,"Now the draw nowadays can be seen from space, and more technology is used in it than was"
00:05:09,00:05:11,used on the Apollo moon landing.
00:05:11,00:05:12,"Oh, come on."
00:05:12,00:05:17,"It's just two things you say about almost every single fact we ever have, and it's bigger than"
00:05:17,00:05:18,a blue one.
00:05:18,00:05:21,"It does sound like a QI script, just can't out your mouth."
00:05:21,00:05:22,This is the exact same thing.
00:05:22,00:05:26,"They did reveal the logo, though, for this World Cup up in the International Space Station."
00:05:26,00:05:29,"So it was the Russian cosmonauts who, uh, so, yeah."
00:05:29,00:05:34,"And this year's matchball has been to space, so it just came back down in fact."
00:05:34,00:05:36,"It was made in Pakistan, sent up to the ISS."
00:05:36,00:05:38,"So no one kicked it up, did they?"
00:05:38,00:05:39,"Oh, sorry."
00:05:39,00:05:41,They kicked it while it was up.
00:05:41,00:05:42,Right.
00:05:42,00:05:45,"They hoof it into the rocket, as the rocket was just leaving it."
00:05:45,00:05:46,That would be different.
00:05:46,00:05:47,"They did, yeah."
00:05:47,00:05:48,Only Beckham could do this.
00:05:48,00:05:50,Can I check something with you?
00:05:50,00:05:51,So you've said the matchball.
00:05:51,00:05:55,"Now, that, to me, gives the impression there's only one ball for the whole World Cup."
00:05:55,00:05:57,"And I know that can't be true, obviously."
00:05:57,00:05:58,Yeah.
00:05:58,00:06:01,"I think this is the main, the, um, what was you call it?"
00:06:01,00:06:02,The signature ball.
00:06:02,00:06:05,"Yeah, the one they'll probably use in the first game in the final, I guess."
00:06:05,00:06:07,"But they'll use, they'll have lots of balls in every game."
00:06:07,00:06:08,It's a good call though.
00:06:08,00:06:13,"They'd probably be like, we really need to wrap up these penalties with England and Brazil."
00:06:13,00:06:16,The Italian German match is happening.
00:06:16,00:06:21,"I've got a fact about the 1930 World Cup, which is, um, the original and the best."
00:06:21,00:06:22,The original.
00:06:22,00:06:23,Yeah.
00:06:23,00:06:24,"And you're a guy and say that, don't they?"
00:06:24,00:06:29,"So it was in you're a guy and, um, it was not a very advanced World Cup."
00:06:29,00:06:33,"So for example, there was a match between Brazil and Bolivia where everyone was wearing"
00:06:33,00:06:34,white.
00:06:34,00:06:38,And it was very confusing when they just cricketers they got on their own pitch.
00:06:38,00:06:41,"But there was, there was one way of telling, which is that half the Bolivians were wearing"
00:06:41,00:06:42,berets as well.
00:06:42,00:06:47,"If you, if you kicked it to a guy wearing a beret, there was one in two chances he was on"
00:06:47,00:06:48,your team.
00:06:48,00:06:50,That's really good.
00:06:50,00:06:53,"No, if you kicked it to a guy wearing a beret, there was a hundred percent chance he was"
00:06:53,00:06:54,on your team if you were Bolivian.
00:06:54,00:06:55,Yeah.
00:06:55,00:06:59,"It's just that it was, uh, one in three chance, I guess, if you kicked it to a guy with"
00:06:59,00:07:00,that wearing.
00:07:00,00:07:04,"Yeah, so I knew this went on."
00:07:04,00:07:08,"I'm telling you what, a privilege is to be in the inner sanctuary."
00:07:08,00:07:13,We do actually say things like that to be done.
00:07:13,00:07:14,"No, you're right."
00:07:14,00:07:15,You're going to get home.
00:07:15,00:07:16,They do it.
00:07:16,00:07:19,They actually pulled him up on it.
00:07:19,00:07:23,"We were talking about, um, so England and the World Cup and British teams in the World"
00:07:23,00:07:24,Cup have a good history.
00:07:24,00:07:30,"So Scotland, um, basically got in, but didn't quite in 1950."
00:07:30,00:07:31,"So 1950, it was so weird."
00:07:31,00:07:35,FIFA really wanted British teams to be playing in the World Cup because they were still being
00:07:35,00:07:38,really snooty with this whole Britain's better thing.
00:07:38,00:07:43,"And so they said that if they played their home championship, the winner and the runner-up"
00:07:43,00:07:45,could play in the World Cup would both qualify.
00:07:45,00:07:48,And Scotland said that's insulting.
00:07:48,00:07:49,"If we win, we'll play in it."
00:07:49,00:07:51,"If we roll it up, we refuse."
00:07:51,00:07:55,And so they played their games and they both smashed Wales and Northern Ireland.
00:07:55,00:07:59,"And then England beat Scotland and Scotland ran back to FIFA and said, ""Please, we didn't"
00:07:59,00:08:00,mean it.
00:08:00,00:08:02,"That's interesting, aren't we?"""
00:08:02,00:08:03,And FIFA didn't.
00:08:03,00:08:04,"They were like, ""I'm really sorry."
00:08:04,00:08:05,"You gave us your word."""
00:08:05,00:08:07,You said it was only if you won it.
00:08:07,00:08:08,You won.
00:08:08,00:08:09,Wow.
00:08:09,00:08:10,And that was the end of Scotland and the World Cup.
00:08:10,00:08:12,Have they never won it since then?
00:08:12,00:08:13,They've never won it.
00:08:13,00:08:14,They've won it.
00:08:14,00:08:16,"You can't win it if you don't qualify, is he?"
00:08:16,00:08:17,"Right, got it."
00:08:17,00:08:18,They used to qualify.
00:08:18,00:08:22,"I mean, in my school days, it was always Scotland in and not England in the seventies."
00:08:22,00:08:23,Thank you.
00:08:23,00:08:25,"You used to be on a level pegging, actually, didn't they?"
00:08:25,00:08:26,Yeah.
00:08:26,00:08:28,England had a policy of refusing to pick their best players on the grounds that they had
00:08:28,00:08:29,long hair.
00:08:29,00:08:31,And I'm not even making them so much.
00:08:31,00:08:37,"So that people like Stan Bowles and Rodney Marsh, who had long hair and Frank Worthington, who"
00:08:37,00:08:40,"were all the most skillful players in the first division, because they didn't have a"
00:08:40,00:08:42,shortback in sides and play cards.
00:08:42,00:08:43,"Oh, my God."
00:08:43,00:08:47,They would pick people who looked like they were in the army because most of the managers
00:08:47,00:08:48,had been.
00:08:48,00:08:49,Wow.
00:08:49,00:08:52,"They also would not pick maverick managers who were clever and inventive, like Garret"
00:08:52,00:08:53,Southgate.
00:08:53,00:08:54,Yeah.
00:08:54,00:08:57,He said the tradition of the English manager looks good in the blaze up.
00:08:57,00:08:58,And he's good.
00:08:58,00:08:59,And he's never seen.
00:08:59,00:09:00,He's a good man.
00:09:00,00:09:01,And he looks so confused.
00:09:01,00:09:02,The references we made.
00:09:02,00:09:03,I don't know what's going on.
00:09:03,00:09:04,It feels like that.
00:09:04,00:09:05,"Good news, though, Andy."
00:09:05,00:09:06,You've got quite short hair.
00:09:06,00:09:07,"Oh, great."
00:09:07,00:09:08,"Well, I imagine I'll make it in, right?"
00:09:08,00:09:09,Yeah.
00:09:09,00:09:10,Yeah.
00:09:10,00:09:12,"In the seventies, everything changed in the fashion front."
00:09:12,00:09:14,So people started growing their hair long.
00:09:14,00:09:15,And England failed to qualify.
00:09:15,00:09:17,In 1974 and 1978.
00:09:17,00:09:21,And I'm convinced it's because all the best players had long hair and the older men were
00:09:21,00:09:22,offended.
00:09:22,00:09:26,"And then, in the world covered in 1978, the leading scorer had really a load of hair."
00:09:26,00:09:27,And beer.
00:09:27,00:09:29,And I think he had his ear pierced.
00:09:29,00:09:33,And his name was Mario.
00:09:33,00:09:35,And he gave the lie.
00:09:35,00:09:38,"And his partner in crime, his ferrocenter forward, had a headband."
00:09:38,00:09:42,"I mean, that absolutely gave the lie a short back in size, being essential for winning football"
00:09:42,00:09:43,matches.
00:09:43,00:09:44,Yeah.
00:09:44,00:09:45,That's our excuse.
00:09:45,00:09:46,That's our excuse in the seventies.
00:09:46,00:09:47,One of the eighties and nineties.
00:09:47,00:09:48,One of the eighties and nineties.
00:09:48,00:09:49,One of the eighties and nineties.
00:09:49,00:09:50,We got loads of people in the locker.
00:09:50,00:09:51,We even have people with mullets.
00:09:51,00:09:52,And we got to the semi-final.
00:09:52,00:09:53,That's true.
00:09:53,00:09:55,"And in fact, it was one of the mullets."
00:09:55,00:09:57,"Chris Waddle, who blasted his penalty over the bar."
00:09:57,00:09:58,But we forgive him.
00:09:58,00:09:59,I'm just thinking about the current squad.
00:09:59,00:10:01,"There's not much long hair there, is there?"
00:10:01,00:10:02,So...
00:10:02,00:10:03,"No, times have changed."
00:10:03,00:10:04,Yeah.
00:10:04,00:10:05,Not matters now are tattoos.
00:10:05,00:10:07,How many arms leaves have you got?
00:10:07,00:10:08,And how many piercings?
00:10:08,00:10:09,Do they want more or less?
00:10:09,00:10:10,"Yeah, more."
00:10:10,00:10:11,The more...
00:10:11,00:10:14,"I mean, Lionel Messi, who's the best player that's ever played football, has had one of his"
00:10:14,00:10:17,legs from the knee down entirely blacked out.
00:10:17,00:10:18,Wow.
00:10:18,00:10:19,Yeah.
00:10:19,00:10:20,So they can't see it on the field.
00:10:20,00:10:21,Yeah.
00:10:21,00:10:22,It's on sale.
00:10:22,00:10:23,In night matches.
00:10:23,00:10:26,And that is a floating boot going around with it.
00:10:26,00:10:29,See if he's not good enough as it is.
00:10:29,00:10:32,This boot is now detached from his body.
00:10:32,00:10:35,Doesn't Messi have really dodgy legs or something?
00:10:35,00:10:37,"Like, he had polio or something as a child."
00:10:37,00:10:38,Really?
00:10:38,00:10:39,He was...
00:10:39,00:10:40,Oh.
00:10:40,00:10:41,And he took tons of drugs.
00:10:41,00:10:42,He had to have lots and lots of...
00:10:42,00:10:44,"Yeah, hormones for growth."
00:10:44,00:10:45,Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:46,Growth hormones.
00:10:46,00:10:48,And some people think that's a little bit naughty.
00:10:48,00:10:49,"Well, I'm not sure about that."
00:10:49,00:10:54,"When he came from Argentina when he was about 11 or 12, as this kind of mccurial prodigy,"
00:10:54,00:10:59,"and he went to Barcelona and they said he's brilliant, but he's too small."
00:10:59,00:11:02,"And then one of the coaches saw him and said, ""He really is brilliant."
00:11:02,00:11:03,"What can we do about him?"""
00:11:03,00:11:04,And they did that.
00:11:04,00:11:05,They had him on growth hormones.
00:11:05,00:11:06,Tell you he was about 13.
00:11:06,00:11:08,But he's still only five for seven.
00:11:08,00:11:09,"Yeah, that's not working that well."
00:11:09,00:11:10,He's not like Michael Jordan.
00:11:10,00:11:11,He's not like Michael Jordan.
00:11:11,00:11:15,You actually think he's that small because half his legs are blacked out?
00:11:15,00:11:16,Yeah.
00:11:16,00:11:17,You can't see his legs.
00:11:17,00:11:25,Please say so far.
00:11:25,00:11:29,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chisinski."
00:11:29,00:11:33,"My fact is that this year, Argentina's Football Association gave its players a World Cup"
00:11:33,00:11:37,manual with a chapter on how to pick up Russian women.
00:11:37,00:11:42,So it was a booklet that was given out to journalists and to players and to coaches in Argentina.
00:11:42,00:11:45,And it was like a course about how to adapt to Russian culture.
00:11:45,00:11:49,"And there was an entire chapter that was titled, ""How to Stand a Chance with a Russian Girl."""
00:11:49,00:11:55,"And it included advice like, ""Make sure you're clean, smell good and dress well."""
00:11:55,00:11:59,"Because apparently, Argentinian men love filthy, smelling women."
00:11:59,00:12:01,Can I just say as someone married to a Russian?
00:12:01,00:12:05,"I'm not sure they're bothered about cleverness and dressing well, but we haven't seen it"
00:12:05,00:12:06,before yet.
00:12:06,00:12:08,"Well, are they bothered about this, James?"
00:12:08,00:12:12,"The booklet also said, ""Russian girls hate boring men."
00:12:12,00:12:13,Never ask tight questions.
00:12:13,00:12:14,"Be original."""
00:12:14,00:12:18,I wonder if my wife actually is Russian.
00:12:18,00:12:22,"It also said that they don't like to be seen as objects, which is singular to Russian women."
00:12:22,00:12:24,"But apparently, it's true of them."
00:12:24,00:12:26,"But yeah, this was in the booklet."
00:12:26,00:12:30,"And then apparently, Argentina got word of it from some of the journalists and went"
00:12:30,00:12:33,"to rip all the pages out of this booklet and said, ""Oh God, that wasn't meant to be in"
00:12:33,00:12:34,there.
00:12:34,00:12:35,Sorry.
00:12:35,00:12:36,It was a mistake.
00:12:36,00:12:37,"Mistakely included."""
00:12:37,00:12:38,And it's no longer there.
00:12:38,00:12:42,"I found a bit of, so there's a problem that Moscow's parliament has been telling people"
00:12:42,00:12:43,to be smart for the World Cup.
00:12:43,00:12:44,OK.
00:12:44,00:12:45,"And this is travelers, I think."
00:12:45,00:12:50,"I think it's fans arriving, and there are on the spot fines in Moscow if you don't adhere"
00:12:50,00:12:51,to these rules.
00:12:51,00:12:55,"And it's 500 rubles, which is the maximum, which is about 6 quid, so you can actually..."
00:12:55,00:12:56,That's great.
00:12:56,00:12:58,"No jeans, no trainers."
00:12:58,00:12:59,Yeah.
00:12:59,00:13:00,It's like a nightclub.
00:13:00,00:13:01,It's like a big nightclub.
00:13:01,00:13:02,The name's knocked down.
00:13:02,00:13:03,You're not coming in.
00:13:03,00:13:04,That definitely is one.
00:13:04,00:13:05,They've had that down for years.
00:13:05,00:13:06,Even the name's knocked down.
00:13:06,00:13:07,You're not getting out.
00:13:07,00:13:08,Yeah.
00:13:08,00:13:17,"But it's, with visas this time, obviously, when you go into a country like Russia, you need"
00:13:17,00:13:19,"a visa, but fans won't need a visa."
00:13:19,00:13:23,"They have a fan visa, which is automatically given to them if they can show they have a ticket."
00:13:23,00:13:24,That's quite cool.
00:13:24,00:13:25,That's quite cool.
00:13:25,00:13:27,To prove interest or knowledge in football.
00:13:27,00:13:28,Just need a ticket.
00:13:28,00:13:29,"Yeah, just need a ticket."
00:13:29,00:13:30,But under you wouldn't enjoy it.
00:13:30,00:13:31,There's no point in lying.
00:13:31,00:13:32,I don't have a ticket either.
00:13:32,00:13:33,That's fine.
00:13:33,00:13:37,The amount of information you have to give on the official ticket website to get a ticket.
00:13:37,00:13:38,"Oh, really?"
00:13:38,00:13:39,Yeah.
00:13:39,00:13:43,Mark Zuckerberg would absolutely.
00:13:43,00:13:45,And you've actually got to give your parents details.
00:13:45,00:13:47,What are the awesome stuff?
00:13:47,00:13:48,"Oh, everyone."
00:13:48,00:13:49,Is it like your passport information?
00:13:49,00:13:51,"Yeah, probably every country you've been to."
00:13:51,00:13:52,Like everything.
00:13:52,00:13:53,To vote for on love island.
00:13:53,00:13:54,You have to.
00:13:54,00:13:58,"Andy, we've suddenly hit an interest point for you here on the podcast."
00:13:58,00:14:01,We're not here to discuss that.
00:14:01,00:14:03,"People aren't tense about this one, right?"
00:14:03,00:14:04,Didn't the head of-
00:14:04,00:14:05,So about this love island?
00:14:05,00:14:06,I know I am.
00:14:06,00:14:07,Yeah.
00:14:07,00:14:08,Kendall was robbed.
00:14:08,00:14:10,I saw Kendall this morning in the flash.
00:14:10,00:14:11,Did she?
00:14:11,00:14:14,At the this morning's studios.
00:14:14,00:14:16,"She is very, very small."
00:14:16,00:14:21,And one of her legs is completely invisible.
00:14:21,00:14:23,Never been seen in the same room.
00:14:23,00:14:24,Isn't there no messy?
00:14:24,00:14:25,Fascinating.
00:14:25,00:14:30,"If you go out, just put on the door of the tunnel."
00:14:30,00:14:32,The greatest conspiracy theory I heard in this show.
00:14:32,00:14:33,Kendall Messi.
00:14:33,00:14:40,"No, the head of football policing in the UK has warned the Brits, basically, not to"
00:14:40,00:14:41,be to Agro.
00:14:41,00:14:42,Haven't they in Russia?
00:14:42,00:14:46,So they said don't wave St. George's flags around.
00:14:46,00:14:47,Don't drink.
00:14:47,00:14:48,Don't drink.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Don't drink.
00:14:49,00:14:54,"There's a security expert, a man who calls himself a security expert."
00:14:54,00:14:58,He's a director of the University of Buckingham Center for Security Intelligence.
00:14:58,00:15:02,"He's called Anthony Gleese, but he did an interview with the Express."
00:15:02,00:15:05,"So I want to have a reliable he is, but he warned."
00:15:05,00:15:09,"Well, after he's been through the prism of the Express, then it ain't going to happen."
00:15:09,00:15:12,When did he say the world's going to end?
00:15:12,00:15:16,And where is Princess Dunham?
00:15:16,00:15:22,He seriously said that English footballers need to look out for Russian women who are actually
00:15:22,00:15:26,"spies disguised as women trying to seduce them, because he said if there's one way to"
00:15:26,00:15:30,"scupper England's chances even more, it'll be through honey traps by leading the players"
00:15:30,00:15:32,on with gorgeous Russian girls.
00:15:32,00:15:38,I've heard the English team are going for a 10-0-0 formation this World Cup.
00:15:38,00:15:39,What?
00:15:39,00:15:40,I don't know how you jeopardise it.
00:15:40,00:15:42,And then you give them an STD or something that...
00:15:42,00:15:43,"Oh, cripples them for them."
00:15:43,00:15:44,Yeah.
00:15:44,00:15:49,"Well, apparently Paraguayan prostitutes tried to seduce Venezuela and players in the qualifiers"
00:15:49,00:15:50,of this World Cup.
00:15:50,00:15:51,And?
00:15:51,00:15:52,Yeah.
00:15:52,00:15:53,What?
00:15:53,00:15:56,"Well, it was weird, because actually neither team could qualify at that point."
00:15:56,00:16:03,"But apparently, a load of prostitutes made it into their hotel lobby and they claimed they"
00:16:03,00:16:05,were trying to seduce them.
00:16:05,00:16:07,But to sort of detire them out before the big match?
00:16:07,00:16:08,I suppose that might happen.
00:16:08,00:16:12,Because it sounds like they were just prostitutes doing their job and these were just men who
00:16:12,00:16:13,wanted to show prostitutes.
00:16:13,00:16:14,Yeah.
00:16:14,00:16:15,It does sound like that.
00:16:15,00:16:19,This is in a way trip that all the Paraguayan squab were available for.
00:16:19,00:16:21,Who wants to go to Venezuela for the dead rubber?
00:16:21,00:16:22,Me!
00:16:22,00:16:23,Me!
00:16:23,00:16:24,The dead rubber.
00:16:24,00:16:27,"Is that a prostitution phrase, or is it a..."
00:16:27,00:16:29,"It may also be, but in its context..."
00:16:29,00:16:33,So it gets thrown out the window and it acts.
00:16:33,00:16:34,Yeah.
00:16:34,00:16:37,"But isn't it true, that?"
00:16:37,00:16:41,"But actually, people think that you shouldn't have sex before football matches, right?"
00:16:41,00:16:42,"Well, I've heard..."
00:16:42,00:16:43,"No, footballers."
00:16:43,00:16:44,Footballers don't think that.
00:16:44,00:16:45,No.
00:16:45,00:16:47,"Sometimes, there's people who charge them and think they charge them out."
00:16:47,00:16:48,"Yeah, I've heard it doesn't really affect your performance, actually."
00:16:48,00:16:49,Yeah.
00:16:49,00:16:50,I don't think so.
00:16:50,00:16:55,"Yeah, there's a football health coach called Nick Littlehaels, who's Christiana Ronaldo"
00:16:55,00:16:57,"Sleep Coach, as well as a bunch of other people sleep coach."
00:16:57,00:16:59,"Sorry, Christiana Ronaldo Sleep Coach."
00:16:59,00:17:00,Yeah.
00:17:00,00:17:01,Right.
00:17:01,00:17:02,Got a sleep!
00:17:02,00:17:03,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:03,00:17:10,"Actually, it was not a tactic that worked, in fact."
00:17:10,00:17:14,"But he says it's crap that athletes shouldn't have sex before big games, but he just says"
00:17:14,00:17:16,they do need to sleep so low.
00:17:16,00:17:19,"So what he says is, I guess, they should have sex, but then their partners need to get"
00:17:19,00:17:21,"up and go and sleep in a separate room, like in kind of Tudor times."
00:17:21,00:17:22,Ah!
00:17:22,00:17:23,That's the idea.
00:17:23,00:17:30,"And he introduced Sleeping Pods, so Christiana Ronaldo at his Real Madrid moment, isn't he?"
00:17:30,00:17:31,Yeah.
00:17:31,00:17:35,"Real Madrid has Sleeping Pods, and every player has their own Sleeping Pods."
00:17:35,00:17:36,"I imagine them all in orbit, somehow."
00:17:36,00:17:37,Yeah.
00:17:37,00:17:38,"Yeah, they're only..."
00:17:38,00:17:40,Just been brought in back into the atmosphere for the match.
00:17:40,00:17:41,"Yes, each match."
00:17:41,00:17:42,And then launched back into orbit.
00:17:42,00:17:43,Yeah.
00:17:43,00:17:44,That big dry ice.
00:17:44,00:17:45,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:45,00:17:46,Over there.
00:17:46,00:17:47,Let me get woken up.
00:17:47,00:17:48,Yeah.
00:17:48,00:17:49,Where am I?
00:17:49,00:17:50,What do you think?
00:17:50,00:17:52,You woken up too early.
00:17:52,00:17:54,"Let's wake up, Jennifer Lauren."
00:17:54,00:17:55,She's not here.
00:17:55,00:17:56,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:56,00:17:59,"Well, that Paraguay in prostitutes will do."
00:17:59,00:18:00,(LAUGHTER)
00:18:00,00:18:03,Where the Paraguay in prostitute pots?
00:18:03,00:18:05,(LAUGHTER)
00:18:05,00:18:11,(MUSIC)
00:18:11,00:18:14,"OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:18:14,00:18:19,My fact this week is that scientists have invented anti-diving shin pads.
00:18:19,00:18:20,Oh!
00:18:20,00:18:27,"Do these scents psychologically that you're about to dive, and they hold your body up."
00:18:27,00:18:28,(LAUGHTER)
00:18:28,00:18:29,On the pitch.
00:18:29,00:18:30,(LAUGHTER)
00:18:30,00:18:31,In mid-air.
00:18:31,00:18:32,Yeah.
00:18:32,00:18:33,"And they're broke us saying, ""I'm fine."
00:18:33,00:18:34,"It didn't touch me."""
00:18:34,00:18:35,"Well, what it is."
00:18:35,00:18:36,(LAUGHTER)
00:18:36,00:18:38,"I mean, they're completely useless."
00:18:38,00:18:39,"Like, they're just stupid."
00:18:39,00:18:40,But they do exist.
00:18:40,00:18:41,There's a sensor in your boot.
00:18:41,00:18:43,There's a sensor in the shin pad.
00:18:43,00:18:47,"And when they touch each other, the referee has an alarm, which will go off,"
00:18:47,00:18:49,so he knows that there's been contact.
00:18:49,00:18:53,"Unfortunately, the problem is that you can file someone by pushing them in the back,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,"or whatever, so it doesn't let it completely pointless."
00:18:55,00:18:57,So they need to invent anti-diving body suits.
00:18:57,00:19:01,"Yeah, it's like the same technology as you have in a fencing, I guess,"
00:19:01,00:19:04,when you know that someone's been hitting fencing.
00:19:04,00:19:08,There's a new version which makes your shin pads light up when you get kicked.
00:19:08,00:19:10,Kids would love light up shin pads.
00:19:10,00:19:11,Yeah.
00:19:11,00:19:13,It's just for the to light up.
00:19:13,00:19:14,Kick me.
00:19:14,00:19:15,(LAUGHTER)
00:19:15,00:19:17,You kick yourself on the shin pad.
00:19:17,00:19:18,Penalty.
00:19:18,00:19:21,"They almost brought this in for the Kanifa World Cup, which is just happened,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,"which is the World Cup for countries that aren't really countries,"
00:19:23,00:19:27,"which is sponsored by Paddy Power, and Paddy Power wanted to bring in some weird ass rules,"
00:19:27,00:19:29,"you know, that were different than normal rules."
00:19:29,00:19:30,Right.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"And they brought in one thing, which was a green card,"
00:19:32,00:19:36,which means if you get sent off for abusing the referee.
00:19:36,00:19:37,You can work in America.
00:19:37,00:19:38,(LAUGHTER)
00:19:38,00:19:41,It's very tempting.
00:19:41,00:19:42,Even now.
00:19:42,00:19:44,There's a lot of state of the United States.
00:19:44,00:19:46,North Koreans offending.
00:19:46,00:19:47,(LAUGHTER)
00:19:47,00:19:49,There's a lot of Mexicans.
00:19:49,00:19:51,What happens if you get so much fun?
00:19:51,00:19:55,"For the green cards, you get sent off, but they're allowed to bring on a substitute."
00:19:55,00:19:57,"So they don't punish the team, they punish the player."
00:19:57,00:19:59,"So they did that in this, in this World Cup."
00:19:59,00:20:02,"And you actually went, didn't you, to the Kanifa?"
00:20:02,00:20:05,"To the final and to one of the other games, yeah."
00:20:05,00:20:06,It's fun.
00:20:06,00:20:07,Who did you play?
00:20:07,00:20:11,"I saw Northern Cyprus against Abkazia in the first game,"
00:20:11,00:20:13,and then Northern Cyprus against...
00:20:13,00:20:16,Who was a Kapitalia?
00:20:16,00:20:19,I don't believe Abkazia lost Northern Cyprus.
00:20:19,00:20:20,I know.
00:20:20,00:20:22,"Because I was supporting Abkazia, actually."
00:20:22,00:20:23,Where's Abkazia?
00:20:23,00:20:26,It's a breakaway area of Georgia.
00:20:26,00:20:27,Do you know who's won?
00:20:27,00:20:28,Does it finish at the same time as the World Cup?
00:20:28,00:20:29,"No, it finished."
00:20:29,00:20:32,"I went to the final last weekend, then it was won by Kapitalia,"
00:20:32,00:20:35,which is a part of Ukraine where Hungarians live.
00:20:35,00:20:36,"Oh, okay."
00:20:36,00:20:38,"Oh, it's not a carpet warehouse."
00:20:38,00:20:41,Because it really sounds like one.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Yeah.
00:20:42,00:20:43,Run by Italians.
00:20:43,00:20:45,I'd like to see their television ads.
00:20:45,00:20:48,It's not the ones where the owner does it himself.
00:20:48,00:20:52,It's a Kapitalia.
00:20:52,00:20:53,Kapitalia.
00:20:53,00:20:57,Soon we will be our own country.
00:20:57,00:21:00,Fully Kapitalia.
00:21:00,00:21:04,The only Kapitalia nation on earth.
00:21:04,00:21:05,The other wall.
00:21:05,00:21:06,And the other wall.
00:21:06,00:21:07,I'd be world-to-world Kapitalia.
00:21:07,00:21:08,World-to-world Kapitalia.
00:21:08,00:21:09,World-to-world Kapitalia.
00:21:09,00:21:14,"So on weird football rules, I was looking into."
00:21:14,00:21:17,Do you know the referee can send himself off?
00:21:17,00:21:18,Do you know that?
00:21:18,00:21:19,"No, he needs a wee."
00:21:19,00:21:20,No.
00:21:20,00:21:21,He can send a card.
00:21:21,00:21:22,He doesn't card him.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Say yellow card.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"That card happened, can it?"
00:21:25,00:21:26,It can happen.
00:21:26,00:21:27,It has happened.
00:21:27,00:21:29,Not in big football games.
00:21:29,00:21:36,"But for instance, in 2005, Peterborough North End was playing Royal Mail AYL."
00:21:36,00:21:40,This was a lower leagues match.
00:21:40,00:21:43,And the referee Andy Wayne got really angry.
00:21:43,00:21:45,So someone disagreed with his decision.
00:21:45,00:21:46,A player disagreed with his decision.
00:21:46,00:21:47,And he flung away his whistle.
00:21:47,00:21:48,And he untucked his shirt.
00:21:48,00:21:51,And he ran up and labeled the player.
00:21:51,00:21:54,And then immediately he saw the error of his ways.
00:21:54,00:21:56,And he gave himself a red card and sent himself off.
00:21:56,00:21:58,And there was no one to replace him.
00:21:58,00:22:01,And then he waited to the car park for him.
00:22:01,00:22:04,Wow.
00:22:04,00:22:07,"But they can also send off Linesman, which I didn't know."
00:22:07,00:22:09,So this has some type of...
00:22:09,00:22:10,They've got so much power.
00:22:10,00:22:11,Yeah.
00:22:11,00:22:13,They've got more power than they should have.
00:22:13,00:22:17,"So last year, there was Dundee beat Kalmanuk."
00:22:17,00:22:19,So this was an actual match with teams that...
00:22:19,00:22:20,"Well, it's in Scotland."
00:22:20,00:22:21,It's in Scotland.
00:22:21,00:22:22,But it's still real football.
00:22:22,00:22:24,As many of your listeners.
00:22:24,00:22:26,Oh my god.
00:22:26,00:22:28,So naive.
00:22:28,00:22:32,"When I do a Scotland, of course, they're the best shows I have."
00:22:32,00:22:34,Are they?
00:22:34,00:22:36,"Better than Wales, Alan."
00:22:36,00:22:37,Don't do that.
00:22:37,00:22:40,What am I filled?
00:22:40,00:22:44,"So in Scotland, whom we love."
00:22:44,00:22:45,All of you.
00:22:45,00:22:49,"In this match, the revs sent off the assistant referee"
00:22:49,00:22:52,"and gave him a red card, because he was vomiting."
00:22:52,00:22:54,By the side of the pitch.
00:22:54,00:22:56,"That's not a vomiting, send him off."
00:22:56,00:22:57,That is a bit harsh.
00:22:57,00:22:58,"Yeah, I think it seems unfair."
00:22:58,00:23:00,You can't be sent off for vomiting.
00:23:00,00:23:02,Who was it who vomiting before a penalty and the...
00:23:02,00:23:03,"Well, because you're down."
00:23:03,00:23:04,Yeah.
00:23:04,00:23:05,That was in the Euro.
00:23:05,00:23:06,That was in England.
00:23:06,00:23:08,It depends on whether it's deliberate and malicious vomiting.
00:23:08,00:23:11,"If you do it in the face of the goalkeeper, just before a penalty."
00:23:11,00:23:12,Yeah.
00:23:12,00:23:13,He just did it on the pitch.
00:23:13,00:23:14,He put his hands on his knee.
00:23:14,00:23:15,I was at that match.
00:23:15,00:23:16,He put his hands on his knees.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"We thought, ""What's he doing?"""
00:23:17,00:23:18,Wow.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"And then he suddenly looked up, ran up, smashed it in the net."
00:23:20,00:23:23,"And on the television replay, you can see when he had his hands on his knees."
00:23:23,00:23:24,He was vomiting on the pitch.
00:23:24,00:23:26,I grabbed in because he once did a poo on the pitch.
00:23:26,00:23:27,Oh.
00:23:27,00:23:28,Yeah.
00:23:28,00:23:29,What was the video of this?
00:23:29,00:23:30,There were so many cameras in the ground.
00:23:30,00:23:31,There must be a poo camera.
00:23:31,00:23:32,There was so many cameras in the ground.
00:23:32,00:23:33,There must be a poo camera.
00:23:33,00:23:36,There's video of him kind of dragging his bum on the grass.
00:23:36,00:23:37,Like a dirt.
00:23:37,00:23:38,Like a dirt.
00:23:38,00:23:39,Like a staphage of ulterior.
00:23:39,00:23:42,"And then people tweet him all the time, just saying."
00:23:42,00:23:43,Just remind the good...
00:23:43,00:23:44,You poo to the pitch.
00:23:44,00:23:45,Yeah.
00:23:45,00:23:48,But he never got a yellow card in his whole career.
00:23:48,00:23:49,He probably scored the card as well.
00:23:49,00:23:50,Yeah.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"No, he never did."
00:23:51,00:23:54,Can I each guy enter up with just a tiny bit of personal news?
00:23:54,00:23:56,We're recording this on Anna's computer.
00:23:56,00:24:00,And there's a alarm that's come up that is to tell her she needs to get
00:24:00,00:24:03,lural and olive oil in 25 minutes.
00:24:03,00:24:07,"Well, the thing is, Anna always shits herself in the middle of a podcast."
00:24:07,00:24:08,Lural and olive oil.
00:24:08,00:24:09,Lural and olive oil.
00:24:09,00:24:14,That's what every paragraph possibly takes for the world cup.
00:24:14,00:24:15,Wow.
00:24:15,00:24:17,I'm not extra virgin.
00:24:17,00:24:20,No.
00:24:20,00:24:24,So the penalty was invented by an Irish guy called William McCrum.
00:24:24,00:24:28,And no one liked him at first because they thought how on earth would anyone be so
00:24:28,00:24:30,low as to deliberately commit a foul.
00:24:30,00:24:32,This was in a long time ago.
00:24:32,00:24:33,Yeah.
00:24:33,00:24:35,And they called it the Irishman's motion.
00:24:35,00:24:37,But they...
00:24:37,00:24:39,Gary Linnaker.
00:24:39,00:24:40,I don't know.
00:24:40,00:24:41,Honour of that.
00:24:41,00:24:43,Performed an Irishman's motion.
00:24:49,00:24:52,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:24:52,00:24:54,And that is Andy.
00:24:54,00:24:59,"My fact is that in April, police in Lima seized over 20,000 counterfeit"
00:24:59,00:25:05,"Penini football sticker albums with a street value of $350,000."
00:25:05,00:25:06,Wow.
00:25:06,00:25:07,That's amazing.
00:25:07,00:25:08,Yeah.
00:25:08,00:25:10,And this keeps happening. It happens all the time because they're really...
00:25:10,00:25:12,They're on the every four years.
00:25:12,00:25:13,"Yes, true."
00:25:13,00:25:16,"But the police in Italy have seized another 20,000 stickers."
00:25:16,00:25:18,And they said this could be the tip of the iceberg.
00:25:18,00:25:22,"Every World Cup happens because they're quite, you know, valuable things."
00:25:22,00:25:24,"I mean, the full ones are really valuable."
00:25:24,00:25:25,Yeah.
00:25:25,00:25:28,"The empty ones, I guess, are valuable, too, because you can..."
00:25:28,00:25:32,"Well, I went on eBay just to see what the highest..."
00:25:32,00:25:34,You're putting Penini sticker.
00:25:34,00:25:37,And there are empty albums from previous World Cups.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"The highest value is sort of 5,000 pounds."
00:25:39,00:25:41,Sometimes for an empty book.
00:25:41,00:25:46,"Well, the empty ones, if you can sell an eBay and empty book with all the stickers in it,"
00:25:46,00:25:47,then that's the best you can get.
00:25:47,00:25:51,Because then people get it and they get the enjoyment of putting the stickers in.
00:25:51,00:25:53,I understand that.
00:25:53,00:25:54,Yeah.
00:25:54,00:25:56,"Yeah, that's worth thousands of dollars, by me."
00:25:56,00:25:58,To people like me.
00:25:58,00:26:00,"And you do it, don't you?"
00:26:00,00:26:03,"You've, in previous World Cups, called out on Twitter to say can we swap Penini stickers?"
00:26:03,00:26:05,"Well, let's put this on the podcast."
00:26:05,00:26:06,"Oh, okay."
00:26:06,00:26:08,"No, no, I do, yeah, I do do stickers."
00:26:08,00:26:10,"You live in North London, don't you, in Finnsbury Park?"
00:26:10,00:26:13,And you love people to approach you with football stickers.
00:26:13,00:26:17,Did you always do Penini?
00:26:17,00:26:19,Because they won.
00:26:19,00:26:21,We did a different one when we were kids.
00:26:21,00:26:22,"Merlin, yeah."
00:26:22,00:26:24,I did Merlin when they did the Bino stickers.
00:26:24,00:26:25,"Yeah, exactly."
00:26:25,00:26:28,"But then Dini came back in, didn't it?"
00:26:28,00:26:30,Penini recently has become huge.
00:26:30,00:26:31,Yeah.
00:26:31,00:26:32,"Well, huge."
00:26:32,00:26:33,In my household.
00:26:33,00:26:36,You were dressed just to be clear.
00:26:36,00:26:38,Do you not do stickers?
00:26:38,00:26:39,No.
00:26:39,00:26:42,"Oh, no, my little boy now is keen."
00:26:42,00:26:46,"In fact, he found some at the bottom of a well-known breakfast cereal recently."
00:26:46,00:26:47,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:47,00:26:49,And I thought this is going to cost me about a grand.
00:26:49,00:26:50,"Yeah, that's pretty much it."
00:26:50,00:26:53,It will cost you 773 pounds 60 to fill a book.
00:26:53,00:26:54,Yep.
00:26:54,00:26:57,"Is that, is that, if that's if you get every single sticker first time?"
00:26:57,00:26:58,That's if you keep buying.
00:26:58,00:27:02,It's a mathematics professor has worked out that if you just keep buying
00:27:02,00:27:07,and you don't do any swaps with anyone on average to have to complete the album.
00:27:07,00:27:10,"But apparently, if you do have friends, it can be cheaper."
00:27:10,00:27:11,It can be cheaper.
00:27:11,00:27:13,"And also, you can buy stickers direct from Penini."
00:27:13,00:27:15,"Yeah, you're last 50 you can buy."
00:27:15,00:27:17,"Yeah, but they failed then, haven't you?"
00:27:17,00:27:18,Have you?
00:27:18,00:27:24,"If you've just calling them out, so please, can I have Marcus Rashford?"
00:27:24,00:27:27,"I've bought 5,000."
00:27:27,00:27:28,"Well, that's what happened."
00:27:28,00:27:30,Music Magpie decided to test it out.
00:27:30,00:27:34,"And they bought 5,000 stickers worth 800 pounds."
00:27:34,00:27:38,They only found 681 out of the 682 stickers.
00:27:38,00:27:39,So they were one shot.
00:27:39,00:27:42,They didn't have Raja Nangolin.
00:27:42,00:27:44,"And he isn't even going, yeah, he's maybe going to the World Cup."
00:27:44,00:27:45,Is he not?
00:27:45,00:27:46,"No, really."
00:27:46,00:27:48,"Yeah, he's I think, I think he didn't get picked."
00:27:48,00:27:49,But yeah.
00:27:49,00:27:50,Yeah.
00:27:50,00:27:54,"Remember that in 1990, David Rowcastle of Arsenal had a coin made."
00:27:54,00:27:59,"And he played, he played, he started in every qualify match England played."
00:27:59,00:28:02,He had a coin made in the S.O. World Cup coin collection.
00:28:02,00:28:04,"And then when they picked the squad, they didn't pick him."
00:28:04,00:28:05,"Oh, my God."
00:28:05,00:28:08,"No, that's about so, so, so hurtful."
00:28:08,00:28:10,"But I mean, I've got a coin."
00:28:10,00:28:12,Never mind playing every qualify.
00:28:12,00:28:15,You were thinking he had his own coin made on vanity.
00:28:15,00:28:17,He didn't have his own made.
00:28:17,00:28:20,He didn't mean to coin in the S.O. World Cup.
00:28:20,00:28:22,There was a really cool idea.
00:28:22,00:28:23,"And James, I reckon you would like this."
00:28:23,00:28:27,There was a news agent in the 2016 Euro.
00:28:27,00:28:30,So Penini did for the Euro 2016.
00:28:30,00:28:34,They did a shop where basically people could meet up just to swap the Penini stickers.
00:28:34,00:28:37,I guess I'm not interested in me to go with people to do so.
00:28:37,00:28:42,This fact is about Lima.
00:28:42,00:28:43,Peru.
00:28:43,00:28:45,So they qualified about footballs.
00:28:45,00:28:48,"Sorry, they were in the fact."
00:28:48,00:28:49,Yeah.
00:28:49,00:28:50,"So they qualified, right?"
00:28:50,00:28:51,Yes.
00:28:51,00:28:52,Peru qualified.
00:28:52,00:28:58,"But in Lima, where the match was against New Zealand, it's where they had a 2NL victory that got them in."
00:28:58,00:29:02,There was an app which is designed to warn people of an impending natural disaster.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"So earthquakes, mainly."
00:29:04,00:29:11,And that app went off when Lima was celebrating because there was so much activity going on.
00:29:11,00:29:12,"Oh, really?"
00:29:12,00:29:15,That an earthquake warning went out to everyone with that app.
00:29:15,00:29:16,How cool is that?
00:29:16,00:29:18,There was so much geological activity.
00:29:18,00:29:20,"Yeah, there was so many people just jumping around."
00:29:20,00:29:23,"Which happens a lot in football stadiums, doesn't it, in America?"
00:29:23,00:29:24,"In America, in football stadiums."
00:29:24,00:29:29,"Yeah, so an American football stadium can register a very tiny earthquake to anything that's sensitive towards it."
00:29:29,00:29:30,"And in Lima, they have that."
00:29:30,00:29:35,And there was once a madness festival in Finnsbury Park that set off a earthquake thing as well.
00:29:35,00:29:36,Really?
00:29:36,00:29:37,Yeah.

00:29:40,00:29:44,I was bizarrely looking into sponsorship that appears on jerseys.
00:29:44,00:29:51,"So my favourite one is Athletico Madrid, who the sponsorship for their team in 2003 was a deal with Columbia Pictures."
00:29:51,00:29:56,So the sponsorship kept changing according to what movie they were pushing at that time.
00:29:56,00:30:03,"So movies that appeared on their jerseys included white chicks, Spanglish, and Anaconda's the hunt for the Blood Orchid."
00:30:03,00:30:12,"Okay, that's it."
