00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,900
 Oh hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

2
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,700
 this week coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

3
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,800
 James Harkin and special guest Alan Davies and once again we've gathered around the microphone

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,160
 with our four favorite facts this time about the World Cup and in no particular order here

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,160
 we go.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,060
 Starting with you, Alan.

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,520
 Austria qualified for the 1938 World Cup, but then had to withdraw because it stopped

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,040
 existing as a country.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,520
 It's a good excuse.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,520
 That's a good excuse.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,920
 It was the 30s, there was a lot of that kind of philosophy and made an existential crisis

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,920
 in the camp.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,600
 They're not sure they exist and on that basis they were drawn.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,520
 Also they have been annexed by Germany.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,760
 It's not a big deal guys, but we won't be there.

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,960
 Yeah, so that's Germany claimed Austria, right?

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,200
 Yeah, but they had to qualify.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,840
 You had to qualify in that year, in '38, while a lot of teams entered.

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,840
 So they've gone to a lot of trouble only to be annexed in the preamble to the tournament.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,600
 And they were very good, weren't they, in that they were then sort of the German team and

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,320
 the Austrian team then came together.

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,640
 So they still eventually played a lot of the players.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
 Some of the players went a bit more fan-traff about it.

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
 Did they?

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
 I just would not have it.

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
 Oh really?

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
 Yeah.

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,960
 And actually the players who played didn't get on with the Germans and they all fell out

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,760
 and they ended up losing quite early, didn't they?

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
 Did they?

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
 Yes, yeah.

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,760
 Did it happen to the trophy during the Second World War?

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
 No.

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,840
 It probably melted down, I presume.

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
 It was under someone's bed.

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
 Was it?

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,000
 Yeah, it was under shoebox under an Italian official's bed.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,800
 Yeah, because I think it did Italy win, it's in 1937 when it happened elsewhere, it didn't

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
 happen in France.

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
 Yeah.

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,680
 So France took it after Austria, it stopped being a thing.

43
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
 Yeah.

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,600
 And then I think Italy won and so an Italian official just looked after it.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,000
 Well, Italy won in '34 and this suspicion was that Mussolini chose all the referees for

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 their matches.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,140
 Yeah, in '34 Austria came forth behind Germany, so as presumably they hoped the combined

48
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,120
 might of Austria and Germany, at Uruguay who had stayed at tournament 9 to 30 and won it,

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,400
 then Sultan didn't come because none of the European teams went to Uruguay, only four of

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
 them turned up.

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,840
 It's such a strife, it's so immature, but you didn't come to my party, I'm not going

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
 to Uruguay.

53
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,880
 And when they did come back they won it again.

54
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,840
 Do you know what happened when Austria did rip out in 1938, so obviously that left

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,960
 a gap and the runners up were Latvia who should have replaced Austria then in the tournament.

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,800
 And the people were just like no, we'll just do without, it's fine, and they just gave Sweden

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,960
 a buy through the rounds instead of letting Latvia play at all.

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
 They just decided.

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
 Right.

60
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
 Not good enough.

61
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,320
 I'm beginning to think that these FIFA guys are not completely fair and honest, I'm sorry

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
 for that.

63
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,560
 Did they not offer for England to take part?

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
 Oh, maybe they did.

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
 Yes.

66
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
 England refused.

67
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,080
 In the rounds at the home international tournament between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,000
 Ireland was of a higher standard and a more significant event.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,520
 Not even making that up.

70
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,760
 We have our own international tournament.

71
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,880
 This wouldn't even go.

72
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,160
 It takes place entirely within our nation, on our little island, where everything's better.

73
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,320
 This Austrian team, they were so good, they were kind of beating everyone at the time,

74
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,520
 not England, they came up to England and lost, but they were beating everyone else by

75
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,760
 quite a lot.

76
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,080
 And they had a new system that no one else used, and it was a 235 system.

77
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,600
 So two defenders, three in midfield and five strikers, which is long being claimed to have

78
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,880
 been invented by Herbert Chapman at Arsenal.

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
 Is that right?

80
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,720
 And England didn't go into the World Cup, Arsenal played Italy at Highbury.

81
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,880
 I say Arsenal, it was England, but they had seven Arsenal players in.

82
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,680
 One in the game.

83
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,320
 One in the game, three, two.

84
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,920
 Would you say that the current England team is basically Tottenham?

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
 Yeah, so we're doomed.

86
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,400
 Well, in the game, three, two, it became known as the Battle of Highbury.

87
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
 Oh, really?

88
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,040
 And it was decided by Arsenal supporters at the time that, therefore, you're officially

89
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,360
 the World Champions, having beaten Italy on air.

90
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
 Oh, of course.

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
 And that was with a 5-3-2.

92
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,640
 Yeah, it was a revolutionary system.

93
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,640
 There's only team ever played.

94
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
 All up front.

95
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
 Lantern, one, 10-0-0-0.

96
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
 Yeah.

97
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,040
 It's worth a try, right?

98
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,760
 So 1938 FIFA World Cup, the draw was selected by Jules Rimmett, who is the founder of the World

99
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
 Cup.

100
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
 Jules Rimmett.

101
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
 Oh, Jules Rimmett.

102
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
 It's actually an interesting fact.

103
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
 It's Rimmett.

104
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
 You Rimmett.

105
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
 (LAUGHTER)

106
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,360
 Rimmett got his grandson to do the draw from a ball.

107
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,280
 It was his grandson on top of a table, picked them out, and that's how the 19-30.

108
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,160
 Now the draw nowadays can be seen from space, and more technology is used in it than was

109
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,040
 used on the Apollo moon landing.

110
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
 Oh, come on.

111
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,640
 It's just two things you say about almost every single fact we ever have, and it's bigger than

112
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
 a blue one.

113
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,360
 It does sound like a QI script, just can't out your mouth.

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
 This is the exact same thing.

115
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,240
 They did reveal the logo, though, for this World Cup up in the International Space Station.

116
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,920
 So it was the Russian cosmonauts who, uh, so, yeah.

117
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,200
 And this year's matchball has been to space, so it just came back down in fact.

118
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,960
 It was made in Pakistan, sent up to the ISS.

119
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,480
 So no one kicked it up, did they?

120
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
 Oh, sorry.

121
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,840
 They kicked it while it was up.

122
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
 Right.

123
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,720
 They hoof it into the rocket, as the rocket was just leaving it.

124
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
 That would be different.

125
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
 They did, yeah.

126
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
 Only Beckham could do this.

127
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
 Can I check something with you?

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,360
 So you've said the matchball.

129
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,320
 Now, that, to me, gives the impression there's only one ball for the whole World Cup.

130
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,560
 And I know that can't be true, obviously.

131
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
 Yeah.

132
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,920
 I think this is the main, the, um, what was you call it?

133
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
 The signature ball.

134
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,320
 Yeah, the one they'll probably use in the first game in the final, I guess.

135
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,880
 But they'll use, they'll have lots of balls in every game.

136
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
 It's a good call though.

137
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,160
 They'd probably be like, we really need to wrap up these penalties with England and Brazil.

138
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,320
 The Italian German match is happening.

139
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,360
 I've got a fact about the 1930 World Cup, which is, um, the original and the best.

140
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
 The original.

141
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
 Yeah.

142
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
 And you're a guy and say that, don't they?

143
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,520
 So it was in you're a guy and, um, it was not a very advanced World Cup.

144
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,040
 So for example, there was a match between Brazil and Bolivia where everyone was wearing

145
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
 white.

146
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,360
 And it was very confusing when they just cricketers they got on their own pitch.

147
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,480
 But there was, there was one way of telling, which is that half the Bolivians were wearing

148
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
 berets as well.

149
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,080
 If you, if you kicked it to a guy wearing a beret, there was one in two chances he was on

150
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
 your team.

151
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
 That's really good.

152
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,520
 No, if you kicked it to a guy wearing a beret, there was a hundred percent chance he was

153
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
 on your team if you were Bolivian.

154
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
 Yeah.

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,520
 It's just that it was, uh, one in three chance, I guess, if you kicked it to a guy with

156
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
 that wearing.

157
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,440
 Yeah, so I knew this went on.

158
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,320
 I'm telling you what, a privilege is to be in the inner sanctuary.

159
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,320
 We do actually say things like that to be done.

160
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
 No, you're right.

161
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
 You're going to get home.

162
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
 They do it.

163
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,840
 They actually pulled him up on it.

164
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,640
 We were talking about, um, so England and the World Cup and British teams in the World

165
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,880
 Cup have a good history.

166
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,440
 So Scotland, um, basically got in, but didn't quite in 1950.

167
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,880
 So 1950, it was so weird.

168
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,200
 FIFA really wanted British teams to be playing in the World Cup because they were still being

169
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,120
 really snooty with this whole Britain's better thing.

170
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,080
 And so they said that if they played their home championship, the winner and the runner-up

171
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,760
 could play in the World Cup would both qualify.

172
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,040
 And Scotland said that's insulting.

173
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
 If we win, we'll play in it.

174
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,320
 If we roll it up, we refuse.

175
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,400
 And so they played their games and they both smashed Wales and Northern Ireland.

176
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,400
 And then England beat Scotland and Scotland ran back to FIFA and said, "Please, we didn't

177
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
 mean it.

178
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
 That's interesting, aren't we?"

179
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
 And FIFA didn't.

180
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
 They were like, "I'm really sorry.

181
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,720
 You gave us your word."

182
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,200
 You said it was only if you won it.

183
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
 You won.

184
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
 Wow.

185
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
 And that was the end of Scotland and the World Cup.

186
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,720
 Have they never won it since then?

187
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
 They've never won it.

188
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
 They've won it.

189
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,560
 You can't win it if you don't qualify, is he?

190
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
 Right, got it.

191
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
 They used to qualify.

192
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
 I mean, in my school days, it was always Scotland in and not England in the seventies.

193
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
 Thank you.

194
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,560
 You used to be on a level pegging, actually, didn't they?

195
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
 Yeah.

196
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,600
 England had a policy of refusing to pick their best players on the grounds that they had

197
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
 long hair.

198
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
 And I'm not even making them so much.

199
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,360
 So that people like Stan Bowles and Rodney Marsh, who had long hair and Frank Worthington, who

200
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,720
 were all the most skillful players in the first division, because they didn't have a

201
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,320
 shortback in sides and play cards.

202
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
 Oh, my God.

203
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,040
 They would pick people who looked like they were in the army because most of the managers

204
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
 had been.

205
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
 Wow.

206
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,560
 They also would not pick maverick managers who were clever and inventive, like Garret

207
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
 Southgate.

208
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
 Yeah.

209
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,640
 He said the tradition of the English manager looks good in the blaze up.

210
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
 And he's good.

211
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
 And he's never seen.

212
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
 He's a good man.

213
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
 And he looks so confused.

214
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
 The references we made.

215
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
 I don't know what's going on.

216
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
 It feels like that.

217
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
 Good news, though, Andy.

218
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
 You've got quite short hair.

219
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
 Oh, great.

220
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
 Well, I imagine I'll make it in, right?

221
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
 Yeah.

222
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
 Yeah.

223
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
 In the seventies, everything changed in the fashion front.

224
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,480
 So people started growing their hair long.

225
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
 And England failed to qualify.

226
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
 In 1974 and 1978.

227
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,520
 And I'm convinced it's because all the best players had long hair and the older men were

228
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
 offended.

229
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,520
 And then, in the world covered in 1978, the leading scorer had really a load of hair.

230
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
 And beer.

231
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
 And I think he had his ear pierced.

232
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,520
 And his name was Mario.

233
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,680
 And he gave the lie.

234
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,880
 And his partner in crime, his ferrocenter forward, had a headband.

235
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,000
 I mean, that absolutely gave the lie a short back in size, being essential for winning football

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 matches.

237
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Yeah.

238
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 That's our excuse.

239
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 That's our excuse in the seventies.

240
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 One of the eighties and nineties.

241
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 One of the eighties and nineties.

242
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 One of the eighties and nineties.

243
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 We got loads of people in the locker.

244
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 We even have people with mullets.

245
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And we got to the semi-final.

246
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 That's true.

247
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And in fact, it was one of the mullets.

248
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,280
 Chris Waddle, who blasted his penalty over the bar.

249
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
 But we forgive him.

250
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,600
 I'm just thinking about the current squad.

251
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,560
 There's not much long hair there, is there?

252
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
 So...

253
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
 No, times have changed.

254
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
 Yeah.

255
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
 Not matters now are tattoos.

256
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,040
 How many arms leaves have you got?

257
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
 And how many piercings?

258
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
 Do they want more or less?

259
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
 Yeah, more.

260
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
 The more...

261
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,920
 I mean, Lionel Messi, who's the best player that's ever played football, has had one of his

262
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,280
 legs from the knee down entirely blacked out.

263
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
 Wow.

264
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
 Yeah.

265
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
 So they can't see it on the field.

266
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
 Yeah.

267
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
 It's on sale.

268
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
 In night matches.

269
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,280
 And that is a floating boot going around with it.

270
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,600
 See if he's not good enough as it is.

271
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,560
 This boot is now detached from his body.

272
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,160
 Doesn't Messi have really dodgy legs or something?

273
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,320
 Like, he had polio or something as a child.

274
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
 Really?

275
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
 He was...

276
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 Oh.

277
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
 And he took tons of drugs.

278
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
 He had to have lots and lots of...

279
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
 Yeah, hormones for growth.

280
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
 Yeah.

281
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
 Growth hormones.

282
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
 And some people think that's a little bit naughty.

283
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,840
 Well, I'm not sure about that.

284
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,880
 When he came from Argentina when he was about 11 or 12, as this kind of mccurial prodigy,

285
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,480
 and he went to Barcelona and they said he's brilliant, but he's too small.

286
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,320
 And then one of the coaches saw him and said, "He really is brilliant.

287
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
 What can we do about him?"

288
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
 And they did that.

289
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
 They had him on growth hormones.

290
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
 Tell you he was about 13.

291
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
 But he's still only five for seven.

292
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
 Yeah, that's not working that well.

293
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
 He's not like Michael Jordan.

294
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
 He's not like Michael Jordan.

295
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,320
 You actually think he's that small because half his legs are blacked out?

296
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
 Yeah.

297
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
 You can't see his legs.

298
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:25,320
 Please say so far.

299
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,080
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chisinski.

300
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,080
 My fact is that this year, Argentina's Football Association gave its players a World Cup

301
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,200
 manual with a chapter on how to pick up Russian women.

302
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,840
 So it was a booklet that was given out to journalists and to players and to coaches in Argentina.

303
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,000
 And it was like a course about how to adapt to Russian culture.

304
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,920
 And there was an entire chapter that was titled, "How to Stand a Chance with a Russian Girl."

305
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,200
 And it included advice like, "Make sure you're clean, smell good and dress well."

306
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,280
 Because apparently, Argentinian men love filthy, smelling women.

307
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
 Can I just say as someone married to a Russian?

308
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,480
 I'm not sure they're bothered about cleverness and dressing well, but we haven't seen it

309
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
 before yet.

310
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
 Well, are they bothered about this, James?

311
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,160
 The booklet also said, "Russian girls hate boring men.

312
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,480
 Never ask tight questions.

313
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
 Be original."

314
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,440
 I wonder if my wife actually is Russian.

315
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,520
 It also said that they don't like to be seen as objects, which is singular to Russian women.

316
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
 But apparently, it's true of them.

317
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,840
 But yeah, this was in the booklet.

318
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,520
 And then apparently, Argentina got word of it from some of the journalists and went

319
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,760
 to rip all the pages out of this booklet and said, "Oh God, that wasn't meant to be in

320
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
 there.

321
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
 Sorry.

322
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
 It was a mistake.

323
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
 Mistakely included."

324
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
 And it's no longer there.

325
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,000
 I found a bit of, so there's a problem that Moscow's parliament has been telling people

326
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,800
 to be smart for the World Cup.

327
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
 OK.

328
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
 And this is travelers, I think.

329
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,040
 I think it's fans arriving, and there are on the spot fines in Moscow if you don't adhere

330
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
 to these rules.

331
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,960
 And it's 500 rubles, which is the maximum, which is about 6 quid, so you can actually...

332
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
 That's great.

333
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,280
 No jeans, no trainers.

334
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
 Yeah.

335
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
 It's like a nightclub.

336
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
 It's like a big nightclub.

337
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
 The name's knocked down.

338
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
 You're not coming in.

339
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
 That definitely is one.

340
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
 They've had that down for years.

341
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
 Even the name's knocked down.

342
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
 You're not getting out.

343
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
 Yeah.

344
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:17,680
 But it's, with visas this time, obviously, when you go into a country like Russia, you need

345
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,360
 a visa, but fans won't need a visa.

346
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,560
 They have a fan visa, which is automatically given to them if they can show they have a ticket.

347
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
 That's quite cool.

348
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
 That's quite cool.

349
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,760
 To prove interest or knowledge in football.

350
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
 Just need a ticket.

351
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
 Yeah, just need a ticket.

352
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
 But under you wouldn't enjoy it.

353
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
 There's no point in lying.

354
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
 I don't have a ticket either.

355
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
 That's fine.

356
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,440
 The amount of information you have to give on the official ticket website to get a ticket.

357
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
 Oh, really?

358
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
 Yeah.

359
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
 Mark Zuckerberg would absolutely.

360
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,720
 And you've actually got to give your parents details.

361
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
 What are the awesome stuff?

362
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
 Oh, everyone.

363
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
 Is it like your passport information?

364
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
 Yeah, probably every country you've been to.

365
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
 Like everything.

366
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,720
 To vote for on love island.

367
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
 You have to.

368
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,920
 Andy, we've suddenly hit an interest point for you here on the podcast.

369
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,920
 We're not here to discuss that.

370
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,720
 People aren't tense about this one, right?

371
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
 Didn't the head of-

372
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
 So about this love island?

373
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
 I know I am.

374
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
 Yeah.

375
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
 Kendall was robbed.

376
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,880
 I saw Kendall this morning in the flash.

377
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
 Did she?

378
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,400
 At the this morning's studios.

379
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,560
 She is very, very small.

380
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,720
 And one of her legs is completely invisible.

381
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,520
 Never been seen in the same room.

382
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,920
 Isn't there no messy?

383
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
 Fascinating.

384
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,160
 If you go out, just put on the door of the tunnel.

385
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,880
 The greatest conspiracy theory I heard in this show.

386
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
 Kendall Messi.

387
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,960
 No, the head of football policing in the UK has warned the Brits, basically, not to

388
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
 be to Agro.

389
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
 Haven't they in Russia?

390
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,200
 So they said don't wave St. George's flags around.

391
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
 Don't drink.

392
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
 Don't drink.

393
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
 Don't drink.

394
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,960
 There's a security expert, a man who calls himself a security expert.

395
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,640
 He's a director of the University of Buckingham Center for Security Intelligence.

396
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,040
 He's called Anthony Gleese, but he did an interview with the Express.

397
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,120
 So I want to have a reliable he is, but he warned.

398
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,480
 Well, after he's been through the prism of the Express, then it ain't going to happen.

399
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,680
 When did he say the world's going to end?

400
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,720
 And where is Princess Dunham?

401
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,920
 He seriously said that English footballers need to look out for Russian women who are actually

402
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,680
 spies disguised as women trying to seduce them, because he said if there's one way to

403
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,880
 scupper England's chances even more, it'll be through honey traps by leading the players

404
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
 on with gorgeous Russian girls.

405
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,000
 I've heard the English team are going for a 10-0-0 formation this World Cup.

406
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 What?

407
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I don't know how you jeopardise it.

408
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,120
 And then you give them an STD or something that...

409
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,960
 Oh, cripples them for them.

410
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
 Yeah.

411
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,320
 Well, apparently Paraguayan prostitutes tried to seduce Venezuela and players in the qualifiers

412
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,720
 of this World Cup.

413
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
 And?

414
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
 Yeah.

415
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
 What?

416
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,840
 Well, it was weird, because actually neither team could qualify at that point.

417
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,760
 But apparently, a load of prostitutes made it into their hotel lobby and they claimed they

418
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,240
 were trying to seduce them.

419
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,920
 But to sort of detire them out before the big match?

420
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
 I suppose that might happen.

421
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,640
 Because it sounds like they were just prostitutes doing their job and these were just men who

422
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
 wanted to show prostitutes.

423
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
 Yeah.

424
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
 It does sound like that.

425
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,520
 This is in a way trip that all the Paraguayan squab were available for.

426
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,400
 Who wants to go to Venezuela for the dead rubber?

427
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
 Me!

428
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
 Me!

429
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
 The dead rubber.

430
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,440
 Is that a prostitution phrase, or is it a...

431
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,320
 It may also be, but in its context...

432
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,400
 So it gets thrown out the window and it acts.

433
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
 Yeah.

434
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,760
 But isn't it true, that?

435
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,160
 But actually, people think that you shouldn't have sex before football matches, right?

436
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
 Well, I've heard...

437
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
 No, footballers.

438
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
 Footballers don't think that.

439
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
 No.

440
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
 Sometimes, there's people who charge them and think they charge them out.

441
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
 Yeah, I've heard it doesn't really affect your performance, actually.

442
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
 Yeah.

443
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
 I don't think so.

444
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,440
 Yeah, there's a football health coach called Nick Littlehaels, who's Christiana Ronaldo

445
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
 Sleep Coach, as well as a bunch of other people sleep coach.

446
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,200
 Sorry, Christiana Ronaldo Sleep Coach.

447
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
 Yeah.

448
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
 Right.

449
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
 Got a sleep!

450
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
 (LAUGHTER)

451
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:10,680
 Actually, it was not a tactic that worked, in fact.

452
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,760
 But he says it's crap that athletes shouldn't have sex before big games, but he just says

453
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,360
 they do need to sleep so low.

454
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,120
 So what he says is, I guess, they should have sex, but then their partners need to get

455
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,960
 up and go and sleep in a separate room, like in kind of Tudor times.

456
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
 Ah!

457
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
 That's the idea.

458
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:30,920
 And he introduced Sleeping Pods, so Christiana Ronaldo at his Real Madrid moment, isn't he?

459
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
 Yeah.

460
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,200
 Real Madrid has Sleeping Pods, and every player has their own Sleeping Pods.

461
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,960
 I imagine them all in orbit, somehow.

462
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
 Yeah.

463
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
 Yeah, they're only...

464
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,680
 Just been brought in back into the atmosphere for the match.

465
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
 Yes, each match.

466
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
 And then launched back into orbit.

467
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
 Yeah.

468
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
 That big dry ice.

469
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
 (LAUGHTER)

470
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
 Over there.

471
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
 Let me get woken up.

472
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
 Yeah.

473
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
 Where am I?

474
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
 What do you think?

475
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
 You woken up too early.

476
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
 Let's wake up, Jennifer Lauren.

477
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
 She's not here.

478
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
 (LAUGHTER)

479
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,680
 Well, that Paraguay in prostitutes will do.

480
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
 (LAUGHTER)

481
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,680
 Where the Paraguay in prostitute pots?

482
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
 (LAUGHTER)

483
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:11,680
 (MUSIC)

484
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,520
 OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is James.

485
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,520
 My fact this week is that scientists have invented anti-diving shin pads.

486
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
 Oh!

487
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:27,520
 Do these scents psychologically that you're about to dive, and they hold your body up.

488
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
 (LAUGHTER)

489
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
 On the pitch.

490
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
 (LAUGHTER)

491
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
 In mid-air.

492
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
 Yeah.

493
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
 And they're broke us saying, "I'm fine.

494
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
 It didn't touch me."

495
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
 Well, what it is.

496
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
 (LAUGHTER)

497
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
 I mean, they're completely useless.

498
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
 Like, they're just stupid.

499
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
 But they do exist.

500
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
 There's a sensor in your boot.

501
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
 There's a sensor in the shin pad.

502
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,520
 And when they touch each other, the referee has an alarm, which will go off,

503
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
 so he knows that there's been contact.

504
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,520
 Unfortunately, the problem is that you can file someone by pushing them in the back,

505
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
 or whatever, so it doesn't let it completely pointless.

506
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
 So they need to invent anti-diving body suits.

507
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,520
 Yeah, it's like the same technology as you have in a fencing, I guess,

508
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,520
 when you know that someone's been hitting fencing.

509
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,520
 There's a new version which makes your shin pads light up when you get kicked.

510
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
 Kids would love light up shin pads.

511
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
 Yeah.

512
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
 It's just for the to light up.

513
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
 Kick me.

514
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
 (LAUGHTER)

515
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
 You kick yourself on the shin pad.

516
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
 Penalty.

517
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,520
 They almost brought this in for the Kanifa World Cup, which is just happened,

518
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
 which is the World Cup for countries that aren't really countries,

519
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,520
 which is sponsored by Paddy Power, and Paddy Power wanted to bring in some weird ass rules,

520
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
 you know, that were different than normal rules.

521
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
 Right.

522
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
 And they brought in one thing, which was a green card,

523
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,520
 which means if you get sent off for abusing the referee.

524
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
 You can work in America.

525
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
 (LAUGHTER)

526
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,520
 It's very tempting.

527
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
 Even now.

528
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
 There's a lot of state of the United States.

529
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
 North Koreans offending.

530
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
 (LAUGHTER)

531
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
 There's a lot of Mexicans.

532
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
 What happens if you get so much fun?

533
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,520
 For the green cards, you get sent off, but they're allowed to bring on a substitute.

534
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
 So they don't punish the team, they punish the player.

535
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
 So they did that in this, in this World Cup.

536
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,520
 And you actually went, didn't you, to the Kanifa?

537
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,520
 To the final and to one of the other games, yeah.

538
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
 It's fun.

539
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
 Who did you play?

540
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,520
 I saw Northern Cyprus against Abkazia in the first game,

541
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
 and then Northern Cyprus against...

542
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,520
 Who was a Kapitalia?

543
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,520
 I don't believe Abkazia lost Northern Cyprus.

544
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
 I know.

545
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
 Because I was supporting Abkazia, actually.

546
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
 Where's Abkazia?

547
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
 It's a breakaway area of Georgia.

548
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
 Do you know who's won?

549
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
 Does it finish at the same time as the World Cup?

550
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
 No, it finished.

551
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,520
 I went to the final last weekend, then it was won by Kapitalia,

552
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,520
 which is a part of Ukraine where Hungarians live.

553
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
 Oh, okay.

554
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
 Oh, it's not a carpet warehouse.

555
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,520
 Because it really sounds like one.

556
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
 Yeah.

557
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
 Run by Italians.

558
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
 I'd like to see their television ads.

559
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,520
 It's not the ones where the owner does it himself.

560
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,520
 It's a Kapitalia.

561
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
 Kapitalia.

562
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,520
 Soon we will be our own country.

563
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,520
 Fully Kapitalia.

564
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,520
 The only Kapitalia nation on earth.

565
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
 The other wall.

566
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
 And the other wall.

567
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
 I'd be world-to-world Kapitalia.

568
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
 World-to-world Kapitalia.

569
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
 World-to-world Kapitalia.

570
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,520
 So on weird football rules, I was looking into.

571
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,520
 Do you know the referee can send himself off?

572
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
 Do you know that?

573
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
 No, he needs a wee.

574
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
 No.

575
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
 He can send a card.

576
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
 He doesn't card him.

577
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
 Say yellow card.

578
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
 That card happened, can it?

579
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
 It can happen.

580
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
 It has happened.

581
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
 Not in big football games.

582
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:36,520
 But for instance, in 2005, Peterborough North End was playing Royal Mail AYL.

583
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,520
 This was a lower leagues match.

584
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,520
 And the referee Andy Wayne got really angry.

585
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
 So someone disagreed with his decision.

586
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
 A player disagreed with his decision.

587
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
 And he flung away his whistle.

588
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
 And he untucked his shirt.

589
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,520
 And he ran up and labeled the player.

590
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,520
 And then immediately he saw the error of his ways.

591
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
 And he gave himself a red card and sent himself off.

592
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
 And there was no one to replace him.

593
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,520
 And then he waited to the car park for him.

594
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,520
 Wow.

595
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,520
 But they can also send off Linesman, which I didn't know.

596
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
 So this has some type of...

597
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
 They've got so much power.

598
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
 Yeah.

599
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
 They've got more power than they should have.

600
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,520
 So last year, there was Dundee beat Kalmanuk.

601
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
 So this was an actual match with teams that...

602
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
 Well, it's in Scotland.

603
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
 It's in Scotland.

604
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
 But it's still real football.

605
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
 As many of your listeners.

606
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
 Oh my god.

607
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,520
 So naive.

608
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,520
 When I do a Scotland, of course, they're the best shows I have.

609
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
 Are they?

610
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,520
 Better than Wales, Alan.

611
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
 Don't do that.

612
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,520
 What am I filled?

613
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,520
 So in Scotland, whom we love.

614
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
 All of you.

615
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,520
 In this match, the revs sent off the assistant referee

616
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,520
 and gave him a red card, because he was vomiting.

617
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
 By the side of the pitch.

618
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
 That's not a vomiting, send him off.

619
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
 That is a bit harsh.

620
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
 Yeah, I think it seems unfair.

621
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
 You can't be sent off for vomiting.

622
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
 Who was it who vomiting before a penalty and the...

623
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
 Well, because you're down.

624
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
 Yeah.

625
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
 That was in the Euro.

626
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
 That was in England.

627
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
 It depends on whether it's deliberate and malicious vomiting.

628
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,520
 If you do it in the face of the goalkeeper, just before a penalty.

629
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
 Yeah.

630
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
 He just did it on the pitch.

631
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
 He put his hands on his knee.

632
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
 I was at that match.

633
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
 He put his hands on his knees.

634
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
 We thought, "What's he doing?"

635
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
 Wow.

636
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
 And then he suddenly looked up, ran up, smashed it in the net.

637
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,520
 And on the television replay, you can see when he had his hands on his knees.

638
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
 He was vomiting on the pitch.

639
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
 I grabbed in because he once did a poo on the pitch.

640
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
 Oh.

641
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
 Yeah.

642
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
 What was the video of this?

643
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
 There were so many cameras in the ground.

644
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
 There must be a poo camera.

645
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
 There was so many cameras in the ground.

646
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
 There must be a poo camera.

647
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,520
 There's video of him kind of dragging his bum on the grass.

648
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
 Like a dirt.

649
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
 Like a dirt.

650
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
 Like a staphage of ulterior.

651
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,520
 And then people tweet him all the time, just saying.

652
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
 Just remind the good...

653
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
 You poo to the pitch.

654
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
 Yeah.

655
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,520
 But he never got a yellow card in his whole career.

656
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
 He probably scored the card as well.

657
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
 Yeah.

658
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
 No, he never did.

659
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,520
 Can I each guy enter up with just a tiny bit of personal news?

660
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,520
 We're recording this on Anna's computer.

661
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,520
 And there's a alarm that's come up that is to tell her she needs to get

662
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,520
 lural and olive oil in 25 minutes.

663
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,520
 Well, the thing is, Anna always shits herself in the middle of a podcast.

664
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
 Lural and olive oil.

665
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
 Lural and olive oil.

666
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,520
 That's what every paragraph possibly takes for the world cup.

667
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
 Wow.

668
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
 I'm not extra virgin.

669
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,520
 No.

670
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,520
 So the penalty was invented by an Irish guy called William McCrum.

671
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,520
 And no one liked him at first because they thought how on earth would anyone be so

672
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
 low as to deliberately commit a foul.

673
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
 This was in a long time ago.

674
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
 Yeah.

675
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
 And they called it the Irishman's motion.

676
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
 But they...

677
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
 Gary Linnaker.

678
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
 I don't know.

679
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
 Honour of that.

680
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
 Performed an Irishman's motion.

681
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,520
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

682
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
 And that is Andy.

683
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,520
 My fact is that in April, police in Lima seized over 20,000 counterfeit

684
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,520
 Penini football sticker albums with a street value of $350,000.

685
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
 Wow.

686
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
 That's amazing.

687
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
 Yeah.

688
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
 And this keeps happening. It happens all the time because they're really...

689
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
 They're on the every four years.

690
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
 Yes, true.

691
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,520
 But the police in Italy have seized another 20,000 stickers.

692
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
 And they said this could be the tip of the iceberg.

693
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,520
 Every World Cup happens because they're quite, you know, valuable things.

694
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
 I mean, the full ones are really valuable.

695
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
 Yeah.

696
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,520
 The empty ones, I guess, are valuable, too, because you can...

697
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,520
 Well, I went on eBay just to see what the highest...

698
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
 You're putting Penini sticker.

699
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,520
 And there are empty albums from previous World Cups.

700
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
 The highest value is sort of 5,000 pounds.

701
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
 Sometimes for an empty book.

702
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,520
 Well, the empty ones, if you can sell an eBay and empty book with all the stickers in it,

703
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
 then that's the best you can get.

704
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,520
 Because then people get it and they get the enjoyment of putting the stickers in.

705
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
 I understand that.

706
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
 Yeah.

707
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,520
 Yeah, that's worth thousands of dollars, by me.

708
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,520
 To people like me.

709
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
 And you do it, don't you?

710
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,520
 You've, in previous World Cups, called out on Twitter to say can we swap Penini stickers?

711
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,520
 Well, let's put this on the podcast.

712
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
 Oh, okay.

713
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,520
 No, no, I do, yeah, I do do stickers.

714
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
 You live in North London, don't you, in Finnsbury Park?

715
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,520
 And you love people to approach you with football stickers.

716
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,520
 Did you always do Penini?

717
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
 Because they won.

718
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
 We did a different one when we were kids.

719
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
 Merlin, yeah.

720
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,520
 I did Merlin when they did the Bino stickers.

721
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
 Yeah, exactly.

722
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,520
 But then Dini came back in, didn't it?

723
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
 Penini recently has become huge.

724
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
 Yeah.

725
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,520
 Well, huge.

726
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
 In my household.

727
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,520
 You were dressed just to be clear.

728
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
 Do you not do stickers?

729
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
 No.

730
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,520
 Oh, no, my little boy now is keen.

731
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,520
 In fact, he found some at the bottom of a well-known breakfast cereal recently.

732
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
 Oh, yeah.

733
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
 And I thought this is going to cost me about a grand.

734
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
 Yeah, that's pretty much it.

735
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,520
 It will cost you 773 pounds 60 to fill a book.

736
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
 Yep.

737
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,520
 Is that, is that, if that's if you get every single sticker first time?

738
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,520
 That's if you keep buying.

739
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,520
 It's a mathematics professor has worked out that if you just keep buying

740
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,520
 and you don't do any swaps with anyone on average to have to complete the album.

741
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,520
 But apparently, if you do have friends, it can be cheaper.

742
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
 It can be cheaper.

743
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
 And also, you can buy stickers direct from Penini.

744
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
 Yeah, you're last 50 you can buy.

745
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
 Yeah, but they failed then, haven't you?

746
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
 Have you?

747
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,520
 If you've just calling them out, so please, can I have Marcus Rashford?

748
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,520
 I've bought 5,000.

749
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
 Well, that's what happened.

750
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
 Music Magpie decided to test it out.

751
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,520
 And they bought 5,000 stickers worth 800 pounds.

752
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,520
 They only found 681 out of the 682 stickers.

753
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
 So they were one shot.

754
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,520
 They didn't have Raja Nangolin.

755
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
 And he isn't even going, yeah, he's maybe going to the World Cup.

756
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
 Is he not?

757
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
 No, really.

758
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
 Yeah, he's I think, I think he didn't get picked.

759
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
 But yeah.

760
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
 Yeah.

761
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,520
 Remember that in 1990, David Rowcastle of Arsenal had a coin made.

762
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,520
 And he played, he played, he started in every qualify match England played.

763
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,520
 He had a coin made in the S.O. World Cup coin collection.

764
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
 And then when they picked the squad, they didn't pick him.

765
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
 Oh, my God.

766
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,520
 No, that's about so, so, so hurtful.

767
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
 But I mean, I've got a coin.

768
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,520
 Never mind playing every qualify.

769
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,520
 You were thinking he had his own coin made on vanity.

770
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
 He didn't have his own made.

771
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,520
 He didn't mean to coin in the S.O. World Cup.

772
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
 There was a really cool idea.

773
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
 And James, I reckon you would like this.

774
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,520
 There was a news agent in the 2016 Euro.

775
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,520
 So Penini did for the Euro 2016.

776
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,520
 They did a shop where basically people could meet up just to swap the Penini stickers.

777
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,520
 I guess I'm not interested in me to go with people to do so.

778
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,520
 This fact is about Lima.

779
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
 Peru.

780
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
 So they qualified about footballs.

781
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,520
 Sorry, they were in the fact.

782
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
 Yeah.

783
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
 So they qualified, right?

784
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
 Yes.

785
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,520
 Peru qualified.

786
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:58,520
 But in Lima, where the match was against New Zealand, it's where they had a 2NL victory that got them in.

787
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,520
 There was an app which is designed to warn people of an impending natural disaster.

788
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
 So earthquakes, mainly.

789
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:11,520
 And that app went off when Lima was celebrating because there was so much activity going on.

790
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
 Oh, really?

791
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,520
 That an earthquake warning went out to everyone with that app.

792
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
 How cool is that?

793
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,520
 There was so much geological activity.

794
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,520
 Yeah, there was so many people just jumping around.

795
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,520
 Which happens a lot in football stadiums, doesn't it, in America?

796
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
 In America, in football stadiums.

797
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,520
 Yeah, so an American football stadium can register a very tiny earthquake to anything that's sensitive towards it.

798
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
 And in Lima, they have that.

799
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,520
 And there was once a madness festival in Finnsbury Park that set off a earthquake thing as well.

800
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
 Really?

801
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
 Yeah.

802
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,520
 You live in Finnsbury Park.

803
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
 I can't see the sun here.

804
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,520
 I was bizarrely looking into sponsorship that appears on jerseys.

805
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:51,520
 So my favourite one is Athletico Madrid, who the sponsorship for their team in 2003 was a deal with Columbia Pictures.

806
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,520
 So the sponsorship kept changing according to what movie they were pushing at that time.

807
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:03,520
 So movies that appeared on their jerseys included white chicks, Spanglish, and Anaconda's the hunt for the Blood Orchid.

808
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:12,520
 Okay, that's it.

809
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
 That is all of our facts.

810
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
