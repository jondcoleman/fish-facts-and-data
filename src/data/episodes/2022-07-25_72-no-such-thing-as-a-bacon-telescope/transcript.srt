00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,500
 [sad piano music]

00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,740
 [sad piano music]

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,480
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,280
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,440
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,900
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,180
 and in no particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,640
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,480
 My fact is that the first item to be sent via New York's pneumatic tube postal system

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,040
 was an artificial peach, and the second was a live black cat.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,500
 Yeah, so an artificial peach, that's the interesting thing.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,460
 It was a huge oversized one as well.

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,760
 It's quite a leap, really, because you would think you'd go from artificial peach to real peach

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,100
 to artificial cats or real cats, but they just missed out on stuff.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,440
 Yeah, they got overconfident, but the cat did survive, bizarrely.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,920
 This story comes from the reminiscences of a postal worker called Howard Wallace Connolly.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,200
 He self-published an autobiography in 1931, and he worked for the postal service where New York was

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,400
 building its pneumatic postal delivery system, which is a system of pneumatic tubes underneath New York.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,800
 And so he recounted the big launch of this pneumatic tube, which was an exciting event.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,900
 So there's a guy demonstrating the pneumatic tube, going, "Look how great this is.

23
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,660
 This is coming from the other side of town, and there's this opening of the pneumatic tube,

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,120
 and something shoots out from it.

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
 He opens it up.

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,100
 It's an artificial peach, and then a second thing shoots out of it.

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,440
 He opens it up, and a cat jumped out and looked really scared and tried to get away, and then they grabbed it."

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,760
 I read though that they had a basket waiting for the cat, so someone knew this was pre-planned.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,880
 It wasn't like a cat.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,800
 The cat had a lectin of its own accord.

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,760
 Cats get into places that they shouldn't get into.

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,860
 I read Justice Morning, "The famous scene in the godfather, Marlon Brando stroking a cat that comes up onto the table."

33
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,060
 That was a stray cat that just jumped on and Brando improvised with it.

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,660
 Yeah, it's one of the most famous scenes in cinematic history.

35
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,160
 What about that one in James Bond, where he stroking a cat?

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,660
 The villain was meant to be the cat, and then Blowfeld just walked on and the cat started improvising with it.

37
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,760
 It was a stray villain, yeah.

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,760
 Also, 101 Dalmatians was just called 1 Dalmatians, and 100 Strays just walked in.

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,960
 By the way, though, London, 40 years before New York had this cinematic tubing, London had pneumatic tubing.

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,960
 Do you know what the first thing they sent on their trip was?

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:36,160
 Was it a novelty foam strawberry, followed by a live bear?

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,760
 No, it was the Duke of Buckingham.

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,760
 Was he just a stray Duke of Buckingham who just wondered it?

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760
 The pneumatic tube sounds amazing. They sound unbelievable.

45
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,760
 Basically, the way they work just to quickly explain, although I'm sure people mostly know,

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,760
 is that it's a big pipe, and you have to put a cylindrical tube in it,

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,760
 and whatever you want to send inside the cylindrical tube, and the cylindrical tube is propelled down the big pipe

48
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,760
 by the force of compressed air or by a vacuum, so that it's sucked into the vacuum.

49
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,760
 And people thought this was how they were going to deliver posts, so there was a time in the late 19th century in New York,

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,760
 where I think a third of all posts was delivered by a pneumatic tube.

51
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,760
 It kind of still feels like the future, doesn't it?

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
 It's so futuristic.

53
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,760
 I think, well, it is. Sounds like it is going to be a part of the future now,

54
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,760
 because Elon Musk, the billionaire of PayPal, and who's been doing SpaceX,

55
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,760
 and so on, he's now building a pneumatic ride to get people from San Francisco to L.A.

56
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,760
 It's going to take half an hour. I think he suggested it. Is he actually building it?

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,760
 So this was from an article two years ago, so actually, yes, I don't know fully if he's stuck with it.

58
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,760
 His idea is that it'll take 35 minutes to go from San Francisco to L.A., right?

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,760
 But the current design, so there's no bathrooms in there, so you just kind of strap yourself in, and if you want to go, it's tough.

60
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,760
 And let's face it, I've read that you'd travel at 800 miles an hour, so you would be wetting yourself, wouldn't it?

61
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,760
 That's true. Have you heard of William Murdoch? He was the guy who invented this in the UK, and he is unbelievably cool.

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,760
 So he invented pneumatic tubes. He invented gas lighting, basically.

63
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,760
 When he was 23 years old, he walked 300 miles to Birmingham to ask for a job with James Wat,

64
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,760
 the steam engine pioneer. He got the job partly because he had an interview with what's business partner, Matthew Boulton.

65
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,760
 The reason he got the job was because Boulton was fascinated by Murdoch's wooden hat.

66
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:35,760
 He had a hat, he'd made himself out of wood, and he wore it 300 miles as he walked to Birmingham, and then he said, can I have a job?

67
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,760
 Because it's a talking point in an interview, clearly. He also invented a steam gun, which fired lead bullets, and he invented a steam cannon.

68
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,760
 And this is on his Wikipedia. It just says a steam cannon, which he attempted to use in 1803 to knock down a wall in Soho.

69
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
 That's all it says.

70
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,760
 It seems to me, and I don't want to put this guy down, but he's just adding steam to lots of other inventions.

71
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,760
 You're a luttite. I think this guy's amazing. I want to add steam to everything.

72
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,760
 There are some modern-day applications of pneumatic tubes, which are also quite fun.

73
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:14,760
 They're really common in hospitals. That's one of the few places I think where they're still used regularly for quickly transporting medications up and down floors and around hospitals, so that's quite interesting.

74
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:30,760
 Also a salmon cannon, so that's quite handy. pneumatic tubes are used to propel salmon in America now over waterfalls, because sometimes there's a problem with salmon, because we built a lot of dams, and so they can no longer get up the river to lay their eggs at the top of the river.

75
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
 So we shoot salmon.

76
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
 Yeah, through the air.

77
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,760
 Do you know how bears kind of sit by the river, and they wait for a salmon to jump out and then kind of rub it?

78
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,760
 They must be going, what the fuck was that?

79
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,760
 But if you work out where it's going to land at the other end, you just sit there with your mouth open waiting for the salmon to land at it.

80
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:57,760
 There is a restaurant in New Zealand called C1, which has food delivery pipes, and they fire out burgers to tables in pipes.

81
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,760
 I went to in Abu Dhabi. There's a restaurant, which is a roller coaster restaurant, and you sit, and your food gets rollercoastered to you.

82
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,760
 So the food gets to do a really fun roller coaster, right?

83
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,760
 No, it's a time because it's attached to Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which has the fastest roller coaster in the world.

84
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
 So it's just a little...

85
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
 Does only food get to enjoy that as well?

86
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,760
 The only vegetables allowed?

87
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:28,760
 That restaurant in New Zealand, the owner said that the tubes would be locked until it delivered the actual canister to the table.

88
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:35,760
 And he said, and I quote, "A canister with that is me. It could take someone's hand off. We certainly don't want to be known for that."

89
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:44,760
 There is also a restaurant in Bangkok called Katron, and they send their food by catapult to the table.

90
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:54,760
 So the chickens are cooked in the kitchen, loaded into a catapult, fired across the restaurant, and caught on a spike by a waiter riding a unicycle.

91
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
 No, no.

92
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,760
 The health and safety required to have a man on a unicycle holding a spike, riding around a restaurant with chickens being fired at him.

93
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
 What if he doesn't catch it?

94
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
 He always does.

95
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
 He always does.

96
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,760
 James is the PR man for this company.

97
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,760
 Someone got decapitated by a chicken and we don't want to be known for that.

98
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,760
 I looked into Kat's dislike, just off the back of it being a black cat.

99
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
 It was the first red something crazy this morning.

100
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,760
 Kat's lactose intolerant.

101
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
 No.

102
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
 Yeah.

103
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
 I had no idea.

104
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
 But they drink milk.

105
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
 No, we give them milk and they drink it.

106
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,760
 They don't know not to drink it, but they technically, majority of your lactose intolerant.

107
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
 But they do keep lapping it up.

108
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
 Yeah.

109
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,760
 But they're quite stupid then, because most animals or something makes them sick.

110
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
 They avoid it.

111
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
 Yeah, weird, hey.

112
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
 It's like finding out dogs are allergic to dog foods.

113
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
 Yeah, I know.

114
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
 Kat's can be allergic to humans as well.

115
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
 Can they?

116
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,760
 Yeah, in the same way that humans can like cat fur can make you sneeze and make you make your eyes water.

117
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
 Kat's can get allergic to their owners.

118
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,760
 Oh my god, I have definitely been feeding our cats the wrong things then.

119
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
 Chopped up human.

120
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
 With a side of milk.

121
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
 No, I really feel terrible.

122
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
 Yeah.

123
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,760
 I read as well that, so whiskers obviously very important to cats.

124
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,760
 I didn't realise they had whiskers on other bits of their body that were just are important.

125
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
 They have whiskers on the back of their legs.

126
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
 Really?

127
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
 Yeah, so they use it for if their site is bad at night.

128
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,760
 That's the, so for there, for hunting prey that might be below them.

129
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,760
 They have it on the back of their legs.

130
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
 Wow.

131
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
 That's really cool.

132
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,760
 I'm pussington post, which is like it's a cat news.

133
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
 Yeah.

134
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
 Cat news website.

135
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,760
 I thought pussington post was a magazine that was banned in the 90s, but okay.

136
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,760
 I've just clicked on the pussington post and the headlines are unbelievably good.

137
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,760
 Kat interrupts cross stitching.

138
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,760
 Irish police take care of exceptionally cute kitten found by roadside.

139
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
 Marmalade's epic birthday party.

140
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
 This is amazing.

141
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
 There was an inventor called Joseph Sturtsle in 1908.

142
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,760
 And he proposed a system of large enumatic jubes to transport free.

143
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,760
 I know Andy's still laughing at the pussington post, but I think we're just going to ride on past that.

144
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,760
 Cat man from Japan walks nine cats in Australia.

145
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,760
 Sorry.

146
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
 Sorry, go on.

147
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,760
 We've got to stop letting Andy have a laptop during the contest.

148
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
 It's becoming a child here.

149
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
 This is why I feed my cat's milk.

150
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,760
 So they stop ruining the podcast.

151
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,760
 Yeah, so this guy decided that people could be transported in enumatic jubes in Chicago.

152
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
 So there's a 9008 here, right to these enumatic jubes.

153
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,760
 And then to prove it to people that you could shoot people underground.

154
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,760
 He said, I will demonstrate for you.

155
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,760
 And here's my young son, Robert, to do that.

156
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,760
 And he laid his little son down and there's a really good picture of it.

157
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:58,760
 If you look up Chicago daily news, pneumatic carrier, there is a terrified looking ten-year-old boy lying down in a cylinder about to be shot.

158
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
 Extremely fast through a tube.

159
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
 And it was okay.

160
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
 Not sure, actually, to get into it.

161
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:13,760
 Okay, time for fact number two, and that is James.

162
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,760
 Okay, my fact this week is that scientists have made algae that taste like bacon.

163
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
 I did that.

164
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
 Yep.

165
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,760
 Have they made it for fish to make their lives a bit more enjoyable?

166
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,760
 That would be so nice.

167
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
 Yeah, why did they make it?

168
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,760
 They've made it because it's a possible new kind of superfood.

169
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,760
 It's kind of algae called dulce.

170
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
 It's a bit like seaweed.

171
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,760
 And it tastes like bacon, but it's high in protein.

172
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,760
 And it has twice the nutritional value of kale.

173
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,760
 So it means that if you're a vegetarian or maybe we'll all be vegetarians in the future,

174
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,760
 we'll be able to eat this stuff and still have the delicious, delicious taste of bacon.

175
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,760
 It's for the texture of algae.

176
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
 What is the texture of algae?

177
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
 Slimey, I reckon.

178
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
 Yeah.

179
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 Slimey, squishy.

180
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,760
 Well seaweed is a kind of algae.

181
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,760
 And that tastes good sometimes.

182
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
 Yeah.

183
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
 I mean, it tastes like crunchy salt.

184
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
 Yeah.

185
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
 It's delicious.

186
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
 Oh, yeah, it's delicious.

187
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
 Yeah, it's delicious.

188
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
 Yeah, it's delicious.

189
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
 Bacon flavored seaweed.

190
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
 Yeah.

191
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
 Yeah, that's really nice.

192
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,760
 Yeah, but I just like this kind of idea of like food science and creating weird flavors.

193
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
 Yeah.

194
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
 And I think probably it's the future, isn't it?

195
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
 Definitely.

196
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,760
 I mean, we definitely are going to need to spend a lot of attention on turning vegetables

197
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,760
 into things that taste like meat in the next couple of years, I think.

198
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,760
 Because I think we will be vegetarian quite soon.

199
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
 Fortunately, I won't be alive then.

200
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,760
 You look kind of cholesterol over there.

201
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
 I was looking at what algae actually is.

202
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
 Yeah, what is it?

203
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
 Well, there's no generally accepted definition of algae.

204
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,760
 Because it comes from lots of different filers and they're just biologically.

205
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
 It's loads of different things, I think.

206
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
 But I had no idea how cool it is.

207
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,760
 So 70 or 80% of the oxygen in the atmosphere comes from marine plants.

208
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
 And those are almost all algae.

209
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
 Wow.

210
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
 So people think that a lot of the oxygen, constant plants are photosynthesizing.

211
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
 But it's actually blue-green algae.

212
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
 Yeah.

213
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
 Yeah, it's amazing.

214
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
 I didn't even make algae into oil.

215
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
 They found a way of doing that.

216
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
 Yeah, a new kind of technology.

217
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
 And they think that might be the future of biofuels.

218
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,760
 Yeah, I think they found that it's twice as efficient as, you know, biofuels that they make on land.

219
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
 I think it's about twice as efficient as that.

220
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
 Or you can use half as much as they might have.

221
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,760
 And also you're not using up the land, which you can then use for making delicious bacon.

222
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,760
 Another cool thing that you can do with algae is they've recently discovered that

223
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,760
 absorbs light in a really unusual way.

224
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,760
 And blind people can have their site restored by introducing an algae gene into them.

225
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,760
 Basically, you introduce to these people a gene that encodes this light-sensitive protein,

226
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,760
 which is one that our only algae has.

227
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,760
 And then you introduce that gene into the retinal cells of a blind person and their site can be restored.

228
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
 It's amazing.

229
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
 Yeah, it's cool.

230
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,760
 And with an animal whose eyes are the best to transplant into a human face.

231
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
 Cats?

232
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
 That'd be awesome.

233
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
 Yeah.

234
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
 Or like goats which have rectangular pupils.

235
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
 Well, that would be really fun.

236
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
 Yeah.

237
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
 It's sharks.

238
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
 Because they have a surprisingly similar eyes to ours.

239
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
 No way.

240
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
 Yeah.

241
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
 Yeah, it does.

242
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
 Isn't that incredible?

243
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
 People are going round with shark's eyes in their face.

244
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,760
 I would like to have shark nose transplant so I could smell blood from 500 miles.

245
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
 And you would look so great as well.

246
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,760
 Here's another thing that they're using algae for.

247
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,760
 They've worked out that algae might be perfect for making batteries.

248
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,760
 So I just can't see how you would squish algae into the back of a TV remote.

249
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,760
 No, there's probably more science behind it than just taking the seaweed.

250
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
 Yeah.

251
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,760
 I just say that you can't just shove algae in someone's face to stop them from being blind.

252
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,760
 There is a sea slug that eats algae and then it can steal the genes from the algae.

253
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,760
 And it can then photosynthesize and it can run on solar power rather than eating stuff.

254
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
 Is clever.

255
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,760
 So if we ate that sea slug would we be able to photosynthesize?

256
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
 You shoved it in your face.

257
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,760
 No, is there any way that we could steal that technology from the sea slug

258
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
 so that we could photosynthesize?

259
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,760
 You couldn't do it just by eating the sea slug but theoretically I suppose you could kind of splice some genes.

260
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,760
 Do you want to have you always wanted to be able to photosynthesize Andy?

261
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,760
 I imagine everyone photosynthesized so that we were all producing oxygen instead of producing carbon dioxide.

262
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
 We only need half of us, wouldn't you?

263
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,760
 I could photosynthesize and my wife could just respire in the normal way and then we'd have a net no gain or no loss.

264
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
 Yeah.

265
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
 Wow.

266
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,760
 I was looking into food science to actually talk about that as well.

267
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
 Yes, please.

268
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,760
 Food science wise, one thing I really liked is dog food is tested on humans.

269
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
 Really?

270
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
 Yeah.

271
00:14:51,760 --> 00:15:00,760
 So you can have this as a job, anyone who makes dog food, that is a job and I found that salary ranges between 34,000 American and 117,000 American per year.

272
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,760
 It's not just the money though, it's the shiny, shiny coats that you get.

273
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,760
 What you'll be doing is not only testing it, you're developing it as well.

274
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
 So here's the thing that they say.

275
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
 My salt, my salt is like that kind of thing.

276
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
 Their thing is that they say dogs will eat anything.

277
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,760
 What dogs will like though is what humans will quite like.

278
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,760
 When humans eat dog food, dog, hmm, would I feed that to myself?

279
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
 No, so I won't feed it to the dog.

280
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
 So that's kind of the mentality.

281
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,760
 That's a very strange bit of reasoning to assume that humans and dogs are the same sense of taste.

282
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,760
 Their point is you can reliably ask a dog to go, no, that's no use because dogs will just eat it.

283
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,760
 Yeah, so who cares what their food tastes like?

284
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
 They don't.

285
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,760
 All those habits where they say 9 out of 10 dogs prefer pedigree Trump.

286
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,760
 They should actually say 9 out of 10 humans prefer pedigree Trump.

287
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,760
 Do they have them on all fours on the floor in the lab?

288
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,760
 They don't wear name tags, they got dog collar in the lab though.

289
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
 Why don't you check the Wafington Post?

290
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,760
 See what they say?

291
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
 I bet that's what I'm saying.

292
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
 That must be real, check it out.

293
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,760
 I have a serious quibble with this fact.

294
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,760
 Yeah.

295
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,760
 Dog food is not manufactured to be something that humans want to eat.

296
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,760
 Otherwise, we just give them human food.

297
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
 Have you ever tasted dog food?

298
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,760
 I have smelt it and I do think you can tell a lot from a smell.

299
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
 Yeah, absolutely.

300
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,760
 But people ate dog food during the Second World War and food,

301
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
 human food was in very short supply.

302
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
 Right.

303
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
 Yeah.

304
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,760
 So, you're using that as evidence that humans do enjoy it?

305
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,760
 Well, no, maybe it's evidence that these guys actually know of an imminent war that's coming

306
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,760
 and that we're going to have to be returning to dog food.

307
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:38,760
 Okay, time for fact number three and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

308
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,760
 My fact is that telescopes have a new telescope smell that can break them.

309
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,760
 So, you know, a new car smell.

310
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
 Yeah.

311
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
 Or you have a lovely smell of a new car.

312
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
 You get the same with a telescope in space.

313
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
 You would smell things in space.

314
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
 Yeah.

315
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
 There's not many molecules.

316
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,760
 Not many molecules, but I imagine that they give off the molecules.

317
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,760
 If I was in space with my massive shark nose.

318
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
 Yes, exactly.

319
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

320
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,760
 So, this is something called outgassing, which is where if you've built something using particular chemicals,

321
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,760
 they give off volatile chemicals. They're called VOCs, volatile organic compounds.

322
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,760
 Unfortunately, telescopes are so sensitive these days that if they give off the chemicals,

323
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
 it can literally break them.

324
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,760
 Or the VOCs get stuck on the optical surfaces of the telescope and that ruins what you're seeing through it.

325
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
 So, yeah.

326
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,760
 What you're saying they're called VOCs.

327
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
 What's that smell for?

328
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
 Volatile organic compounds.

329
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
 Oh, right. Bacon has them as well.

330
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
 Really?

331
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,760
 There's 150 volatile organic compounds that contribute to bacon's meaty aroma.

332
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,760
 And these compounds are given off by bacon, but they're not really given off by ham or gammon or whatever.

333
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
 And that's kind of why bacon is so much tastier.

334
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
 Not sure why, but yeah.

335
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,760
 There's also a way you don't get many space telescopes made of bacon.

336
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
 Yet.

337
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,760
 So, about smell, okay.

338
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
 You can smell danger.

339
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
 Okay.

340
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,760
 Everyone has this ability or must people do?

341
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,760
 Volunteers who couldn't tell the difference between two similar smells.

342
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
 So, it's like bacon and bacon e-smell.

343
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
 Bacon.

344
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
 Bacon and bacon.

345
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
 Bacon and bacon.

346
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,760
 Then if they were given an electric shock from one of them and then not the other one,

347
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,760
 then later they could distinguish the two different smells because they remembered the electric shock that they had.

348
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
 That is really cool.

349
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
 Right.

350
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,760
 But wait, what does that have to do with smelling danger?

351
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
 I thought you meant if I'm walking on the street and there was a mug going on behind the alley.

352
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
 But I couldn't see it.

353
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
 I could smell danger.

354
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
 Yeah, it's not quite that.

355
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
 So, it's not quite...

356
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
 Ah, what a shame.

357
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,760
 Whereas, if you had been approached by two people who smelled very, very similar and one of them had mugged you,

358
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,760
 later on, you'd be able to tell which of the muggers there was.

359
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,760
 Actually, don't they say that when they do lineups with police, you know, when they do a police lineup

360
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,760
 and they do someone who is at the scene at the crime, something new that they've started trying out is to get them to close their eyes

361
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,760
 and go purely by the smell because smells actually a really big thing.

362
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
 Wow.

363
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,760
 I was going to ask if there have been any police lineups which only used smell and completely dispensed with the visual element of it.

364
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,760
 If you were blind and you were mugged, maybe that would be a thing.

365
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,760
 Maybe.

366
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,760
 They smelled of oak, you know, something like that.

367
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,760
 Are you being mugged by a tree?

368
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
 Yeah.

369
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
 That would be a great lineup.

370
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
 Or...

371
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
 With men one tree.

372
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
 Yeah.

373
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
 I know who it was immediately.

374
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
 No, I don't need to do the smell test.

375
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
 Honestly.

376
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,760
 The smell of oak, like a wine, as well.

377
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,760
 The man who mugged me, I'd say, was five foot nine with notes of citrus.

378
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,760
 He was fruity, full-bodied.

379
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
 Come on.

380
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
 No, after you.

381
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,760
 I was going to say that the only scent to win an EU trademark is the smell of freshly cut grass.

382
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
 And that was registered by a Dutch perfume company.

383
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,760
 And it uses it to give tennis balls their aroma.

384
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,760
 When we did this fact, I was like, I'm desperate to know what that amazing smell is.

385
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,760
 When you click open a new tube of tennis balls and it smells so delicious.

386
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
 It's the best part of a game of tennis.

387
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
 And I couldn't turn.

388
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
 How video tennis.

389
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:10,760
 Anyway, the company that sprays these balls with the smell of freshly cut grass has trademarked that smell with the EU.

390
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
 Oh, that's very cool.

391
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
 Yeah.

392
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
 Smells in space.

393
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
 Yeah.

394
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
 We talk about, because of this...

395
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
 The telescope.

396
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,760
 There's an artist called Carrie Patterson, who wants to send messages to aliens but includes smells in them as well.

397
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:31,760
 So the idea is, you know, we would send like these messages with pictures of humans or which planet we're from and stuff like those.

398
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
 She thinks that we should send smells as well.

399
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,760
 In case the aliens are particularly good with smells like a dog or a shark or whatever.

400
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,760
 She wants to send smells of animal blood and feces.

401
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,760
 God, that's a good welcomingness.

402
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
 It's a visit anytime.

403
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,760
 I see you've moved into the neighbourhood.

404
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:57,760
 But even if we send nice smells, how do we know that their excrement doesn't smell like freshly open tennis balls?

405
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,760
 And therefore, it's gonna be a huge insult.

406
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
 Yeah.

407
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,760
 Also benzene to show our global dependence on the car.

408
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,760
 And the blood and feces is to show that we have like carbon based life forms.

409
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,760
 This explains why that got left on my doorstep the other day.

410
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,760
 So we're trying to explain to me that we're carbon based life forms.

411
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,760
 Oh, that's great.

412
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
 Telescopes?

413
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
 Yeah.

414
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
 Yeah.

415
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,760
 There is a telescope called the ice cube telescope.

416
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,760
 I don't know if you guys know about this, which is buried a mile under the ice in Antarctica.

417
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
 And yeah, that's cool, right?

418
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
 It's one that's looking for gravity waves.

419
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
 It's looking for neutrinos.

420
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
 Oh, neutrinos.

421
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
 It actually has.

422
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,760
 So I think the only place that we had detected neutrinos was from the sun until a couple of years ago.

423
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,760
 And then they used this telescope to find detect 28 neutrinos under the ice in Antarctica.

424
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
 28.

425
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,760
 They built a telescope and buried it a mile deep for 28 neutrinos.

426
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
 That's right.

427
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
 Yeah.

428
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
 What are the neutrinos?

429
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,760
 They're totally neutral particles that were with theoretical for ages.

430
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
 Yeah.

431
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,760
 And they fight out from the sun and there's billions of them passing through your body every second.

432
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
 Wow.

433
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
 Yeah.

434
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
 And also they don't really react with anything.

435
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
 Yes.

436
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
 Wow.

437
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
 Wow.

438
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,760
 I would say how they fix the new telescope smell breaking it problem.

439
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
 Oh, yeah.

440
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
 Yeah.

441
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,760
 They use a spray paint made of this chemical called zero light, which I'd never heard of before.

442
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
 Yeah.

443
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,760
 It doesn't absorb the chemicals that could have not fit adsorbs, then which means it reacts chemically and binds to them.

444
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
 So, yeah.

445
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,760
 They clean telescopes, or they clean telescopes mirrors using snow spray, don't they?

446
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,760
 Firing a spray of very fine snow particles out there.

447
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
 Oh, right.

448
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
 So not that stuff that you spray in your window to make it look festive.

449
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,760
 No, not the 70s, but the Christmas tree that would ruin the telescope.

450
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,760
 And this is a ghastly mix up and that has been another $500 million.

451
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:52,760
 Because the intern in the office heard a QI factoid on the podcast.

452
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,760
 I'll just do these guys a favor and polish this.

453
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,760
 No, they spray a special snow, which is made of carbon dioxide at the mirror.

454
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
 And then it freezes and creates little snowflakes.

455
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,760
 And then when the snowflakes slide down it, it takes any little tiny particles of dust and dirt with it.

456
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
 That is amazing.

457
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
 That's very cool.

458
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
 It is very cool.

459
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:16,760
 You know, the gene shoemaker, the very famous, he spotted a lot of comets.

460
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,760
 I think famously the one that impacted on Jupiter.

461
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,760
 Also, there was one called shoemaker Levy, which went past the Earth a few years ago.

462
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
 Yes, exactly.

463
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,760
 Yeah.

464
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,760
 So, he worked a lot with his wife, Carolyn Shoemaker, to find all of these comets out in space.

465
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,760
 Do you know how they found all these comets using what?

466
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
 Telescope?

467
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
 No.

468
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
 Microscope.

469
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
 Really?

470
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,760
 So they would take all the images from the telescope, but they were so grainy and so small that they would use a microscope.

471
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,760
 And using the microscope, that's how they would eventually spot all of the comets.

472
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
 Wow, that's very cool.

473
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
 Yeah.

474
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,760
 Mirrors are obviously a really vital part of telescopes now.

475
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,760
 And I read that.

476
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:05,760
 If you put a mirror half a light year away from Earth and then you looked at it through a telescope,

477
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
 you can see a year into the Earth's past.

478
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
 How cool is that?

479
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
 We should plant a mirror half a light year away.

480
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,760
 The great thing about that is whenever I look in the mirror in the morning, I always look so old.

481
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
 There you go.

482
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
 So you would look a year younger?

483
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
 Yeah.

484
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
 Yeah.

485
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
 Maybe put it even further away, James, for you.

486
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,760
 I would say maybe a few light years away.

487
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,760
 Okay, time for our final fact to the show.

488
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
 And that's my fact.

489
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:37,760
 My fact this week is that there is a museum in North Korea that has a scaled down replica of the world's largest table.

490
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,760
 From what I'm told, it's been scaled down to the size of a normal table.

491
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,760
 So this fact actually got sent into us via our email, podcasterQI.com.

492
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,760
 And it was sent to us by guy called Ian Kimball.

493
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,760
 And he said in episode 50, we'd start talking about my favorite table, which was going to be a side podcast,

494
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
 and it's his favorite table.

495
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
 And he was in North Korea.

496
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,760
 And he went to a thing called the National Friendship Exhibition.

497
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,760
 And that's basically an exhibition where they show all the presents that have been given to North Korea by countries around the world,

498
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,760
 to show to the North Koreans how love they are by the rest of the world.

499
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
 And he wrote a blog about it.

500
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,760
 And in this blog, he included amongst the other things in his list, the table.

501
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,760
 And it's one of these things where I've been googling it, and I can't actually find verification that the table exists.

502
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,760
 So I'm taking his word for it here, which is a bit dangerous, but I don't know.

503
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,760
 I think first hand research sounds about right?

504
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
 Yeah, exactly.

505
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,760
 I've tried to find out what the largest table in the world is.

506
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
 And there are a few different records.

507
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
 Okay.

508
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,760
 So there's the longest table in the world, which was broken this month.

509
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,760
 It was broken in July 2015.

510
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,760
 Sorry, the table was broken.

511
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
 No, sorry.

512
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
 The record.

513
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
 The record was broken.

514
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
 Right.

515
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,760
 And it was 1,500 meters long.

516
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,760
 It was an iftar table, which is the meal for when Muslims break Ramadan, they're fast.

517
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
 It was a very, very, very, very long table.

518
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
 Excuse me.

519
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
 Can you pass the salt?

520
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,760
 And there's also the largest desk in the world, which is in a New York marketing firm's office,

521
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
 and which can seat 125 employees.

522
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
 Wow.

523
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,760
 Yeah, and it goes through the entire office, and it ramps up.

524
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,760
 And it's sort of made from a single piece of resin that was poured into the cast, or however.

525
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
 Wow.

526
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,760
 You know, there's a bit here where a certain department says, but then it banks up to the floor above

527
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
 and then swoops around.

528
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
 It's very, very cool.

529
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
 That's so cool.

530
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
 Yeah, it's really cool.

531
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,760
 So there's, you can get an app now, which is a tourist guide to North Korea.

532
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
 So it's a North Korea travel app.

533
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
 It's not condoned by North Korea.

534
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
 It's built in Britain.

535
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,760
 And it contains genuinely quite useful advice about traveling there.

536
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,760
 So they, for instance, talk about the Rajin Zoo, saying, best known as World War Zoo,

537
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,760
 where the attractions are three ducks, a turkey, some elusive foxes, and a drawing of a monkey.

538
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
 They're both actually drawing of a monkey.

539
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
 Yeah.

540
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,760
 That's a great, great zoo.

541
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
 It saves on feed, doesn't it?

542
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
 It definitely does.

543
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
 It's got a drawing of a monkey.

544
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,760
 You just need to give it a, you know, a drawing of a banana.

545
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:13,760
 Just on this North Korea app, it just has some other good travel advice you can get.

546
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,760
 It suggests that you bribe your guide by bringing him really good quality alcohol.

547
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,760
 And then he'll be more likely to give you a better tour.

548
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,760
 But it does say don't ask your guide any difficult questions, because guides will be blamed for tourists who cause trouble.

549
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,760
 So if you've been guide around North Korea, yeah, don't start a fire or anything.

550
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
 Oh, wow.

551
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,760
 And it acknowledges it says most of the guides will be aware of the inaccuracies of their government's line on things.

552
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,760
 But try not to embarrass them by challenging them.

553
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
 Oh, that's fair.

554
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
 It's just polite, isn't it?

555
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
 Yeah.

556
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
 And smile.

557
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,760
 It describes the people's army circus as a circus that you can visit.

558
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
 They've got a drawing of a clown.

559
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:57,760
 It says this circus very rarely features any animals, but does almost always feature an anti-American clown show.

560
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
 It's the American clown show.

561
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
 What?

562
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
 Is that your bag?

563
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
 Yeah.

564
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
 Well, I mean, I would be interested to see what that involves.

565
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
 Yeah.

566
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
 Something about weird museums.

567
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
 Yeah.

568
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:18,760
 I was saying in Kansas, you can find a place called the world's largest collection of the world's smallest versions of the world's largest things, which is a traveling museum.

569
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
 Wow.

570
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:28,760
 What happens is they find out about a world's largest thing and then they document it usually by going to visit it and then they make a tiny version of it.

571
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
 Damn it.

572
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,760
 I thought you were going to say then they make the machine from honey, I shrunk the kids and fire it at the thing and take it away with them.

573
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
 Those are great films.

574
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
 They were fantastic.

575
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
 Rick Moranis.

576
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
 Yes.

577
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:47,760
 So to make these smaller versions, they say that they have to find materials that are most appropriate, but that they can find.

578
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:55,760
 So the world's smallest version of the world's largest ball of rubber bands is made of miniature rubber bands.

579
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:04,760
 And weirdly, the world's smallest version of the world's largest otter is made from a dashinged figurine cut into, filled in with modeling clay.

580
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
 Wow.

581
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,760
 Sounds great.

582
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
 Very great.

583
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
 Yeah.

584
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:19,760
 Another museum and I've mentioned this previously on the podcast that in Georgia that there was a museum dedicated to Elvis in which one of this place was maybe Elvis's toenail.

585
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:33,760
 This lady found it in a carpet when she was at Graceland in the jungle room and she got to the ground because she wanted to feel where Elvis would have walked and she came across this toenail and thought it must be his, but she can't verify it.

586
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:43,760
 But she put it into her own Elvis museum that she's opened, which is called the louder milk boarding house museum contains 30,000 Elvis Presley artifacts.

587
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
 Possibly 29,900.

588
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
 Yeah.

589
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,760
 I mean, how many of you others were maybe this belonged to Elvis.

590
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,760
 It appeared slightly near him on one occasion.

591
00:29:52,760 --> 00:30:05,760
 When she has a vial of sweat, she has a wart and actually a lot of people she says come to her and say, could you donate the wart to science so that they could clone Elvis and she says, it wouldn't be right.

592
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,760
 He wouldn't be, he wouldn't be happy, which is rich coming from someone who's collecting body parts.

593
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,760
 I believe actually Elvis himself is in that museum while a drawing of him.

594
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:25,760
 Potato potato. But if you cloned him from a wart, wouldn't he just be an enormous wart?

595
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:33,760
 Yeah, I don't think that's quite how cloning works when they cloned Dolly the sheep, which came from a bit of a mammary gland.

596
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
 It wasn't just an enormous sheep-bubble gland.

597
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
 Yeah, exactly.

598
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
 Big, woolly breast.

599
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:45,760
 She also has Elvis hair button, which has the hair of Elvis in it donated to her by Elvis's barber.

600
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,760
 Next to it, she also has a cease and desist letter from selling Elvis Presley hair buttons.

601
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,760
 She's sort of manufacturing and selling them and legal action was threatened against her.

602
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,760
 What did she put sort of one hair in each button or something?

603
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
 Yeah, exactly.

604
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
 Oh, come on.

605
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
 Yeah.

606
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,760
 Old Boatstar Cafe in Cornwall has the Museum of Celebrity Leftovers.

607
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,760
 And their exhibits include an actress called Mia Vasikovska, who I've never heard of.

608
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,760
 A courgette from her soup is on display there.

609
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:22,760
 And there is a piece of Prince Charles's bread pudding, which he chose to leave unfinished one time.

610
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,760
 And a few other exhibits.

611
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
 Wow.

612
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
 Oh, God.

613
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,760
 I think I'd really like these little museums.

614
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,760
 I think they also have an interesting, unneeded purpose, but yeah, I'm happy they exist.

615
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
 I'm not sure they're all museums.

616
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:45,760
 Well, one day, because like, you know, for example, they have bits of hair from, in the Smithsonian, I think it is, from 14 presidents.

617
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
 And, you know, at the time, that was--

618
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,760
 Are they bits of hair or are they just hair that was found in a carpet vagueness or were they giving speech once?

619
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
 They're actually all belong to Elvis.

620
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:02,760
 So, yeah, well, it's interesting. What is a museum? What isn't? Because a museum is just a collection of interesting artefacts, or culturally significant artefacts, or historical artefacts.

621
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,760
 So, yeah, these are definitely museums.

622
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,760
 There's a museum in-- it's either in Tasmania, yeah, it's in Tasmania.

623
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:16,760
 And I can't remember what it's called, but it's a museum that's made up entirely of stolen tiny little bits from other famous bits of museum exhibits.

624
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
 So it's really--

625
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,760
 I'd like to purchase museum.

626
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:25,760
 [Laughter]

627
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:34,760
