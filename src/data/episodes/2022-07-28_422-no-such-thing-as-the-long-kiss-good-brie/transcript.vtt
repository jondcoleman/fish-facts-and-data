00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello and welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing As A Fish!

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.880
 It is Good Friday and what does that mean?

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:15.920
 Well, it means you probably have a day off work and it means we're gonna have a little day off as well because we have got for you this week.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.040
 The second half of our live show compilation.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.880
 This is loads of bits from all of our live shows,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.480
 bits that were too good to go in the original edit, frankly. Too funny, too stupid,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.160
 too silly, too getting the facts wrong, too much audience interaction.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.920
 We begin with an extremely keen audience and end with, let's say, a less keen audience.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.080
 You've got that to look forward to in between loads and loads of facts, loads and loads of fun.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.760
 I really hope you enjoy this and we'll be back with a normal episode of No Such Thing As A Fish next week!

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.280
 For now though, on with the podcast!

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.040
 *Buzzing*

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:15.720
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish!

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.840
 A weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Dublin!

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:38.320
 *Cheering*

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:50.760
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and Jane Tarkin.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:59.000
 And once again, we have gathered around that microphone with our four favourite facts from the last seven days!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.720
 And in that particular order, here we go!

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.720
 Starting with fact number one...

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.120
 Okay, calm the fuck down, everyone. It's 7pm.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.880
 Starting with fact number one and that is Andy.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.040
 My fact is...

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.120
 You had all that time to prepare!

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.120
 One, two, no, it's still gone. Wow, all right, well...

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.400
 Time for fact number two and that...

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.200
 Remember, my friend, I think I told you guys once, claimed that he was at a festival and he claimed one night after being missing the whole night, came back.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.680
 He said, "I had an amazing sleep last night. I found a pillow that I used. It was a soft rock."

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.880
 And everyone's like, "What?" He was like, "I swear to God, I slept on a soft rock. It was the softest rock ever."

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.640
 No one believed him and he talked about it for all morning and he eventually said, "I'm sick of taking crap for this. I'm going to show you the soft rock."

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.360
 So he took everyone to the field that he fell asleep in and he went, "There, there's the soft rock."

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:23.720
 And what they discovered was, it was a hardened cow-pat that was shell-like and it just slightly dented to the shape of his head when he laid on it.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.120
 And he was like, "Oh, it's soft."

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.040
 It's like the shroud of Turin of this guy's face.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.520
 I thought it was going to be a convoluted joke where he led you to the field and the eagles were playing as he went to sleep, but no.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.400
 That will put you to sleep.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.600
 Tell everyone what happened to you the other day when you opened up your door and you were wearing a no-search thing as a fish t-shirt.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:53.920
 Oh, I was wearing a fish hoodie and I opened the door and it was a go from Amazon and he said, "No such thing as a fish. I like that."

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.520
 And I said, "Oh, do you listen?" And he said, "No, I know."

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.000
 "What?" He just said, "I keep fish." I thought, "That's good."

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.360
 Oh, yeah. And he said, "What is it?" I said, "It's nothing. Shall I go away?"

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.840
 If you kind of make pot plants and pot plants in pots, you can die.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.880
 There was someone who died quite recently in the last 10 years of a brain-eating amoeba that they caught from a pot plant.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.320
 But don't let the name worry you. It's actually not a true amoeba.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.880
 It's a shape-shifting amoebo-flagellate excavate.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.000
 There's a woman who has made a website. I've actually only written down her first name, which is Avril.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.280
 So, find her. Oh, no, she's called Avril Shepard, sorry.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.160
 And she's made a website of every single weird festival in Britain and she has gone to as many as she possibly can.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.960
 She's been doing for 10, 11 years and she's gone and personally reviewed them.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.600
 And so you can click on any day of the year and get every single weirdo festival.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.000
 So, I was in February. I got to late February and I was reading about the rhubarb festival in Wakefield,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.720
 where you can get a tour of the forcing sheds, which is where they force rhubarb,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.440
 which I was thinking is a really aggressive term for what is just quite an innocuous thing to do.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.400
 And so I was reading about the rhubarb festival. I thought I wouldn't go to that.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.640
 And then in March, there's the slate weight moon raking festival.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.560
 And this is related to this legend in this place where basically the locals tried to fish the moon out of the lake.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.880
 But they didn't really, they just did it to trick the locals, Google it, to trick the police.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.640
 Anyway, this moon raking festival is a huge deal, very exciting.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.120
 And Avril was like, it's brilliant. It's so fun. There's a big parade through the streets.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.080
 There's a moon arriving by barge. I did go in 2013, although no one turned up that year,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.280
 because all the moon rakers are defected to the rhubarb festival at Wakefield.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.880
 Oh!

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.280
 Can't be that fucking good, Avril.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.280
 He had been an absolute millionaire because of all these artichokes he was selling.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.560
 Three or four years later, he was gone. Completely penniless.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.080
 And that was just like one week's work by LaGadia.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080
 Wow, yeah.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.600
 Arti broke.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.840
 Sorry?

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.280
 He was Arti broke, I believe, was the submission from the, very nice, very nice indeed.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.120
 Definitely worth it, that. Well done. Good choice.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.280
 I think this guy knows our level. Come on.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.440
 That was good news.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.640
 But apparently in their breaks, this lady, this MI5 employee said,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.240
 "The Girl Guide retires to her attractive little sitting room

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.640
 "where she converses on high topics with her friends."

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.600
 She said that they would, they took their jobs very seriously, as you can imagine.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.720
 And she said, "Their function is to snub you

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.280
 "when you seek to penetrate beyond the sacred portals of their office."

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.520
 I think snubbing is core for under those circumstances.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.120
 Craig, can you say that again? The portals of their office?

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.280
 If you seek to penetrate through the portals of their office,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.200
 and if you're hearing anything other than a metaphor there,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.760
 then that is your problem and not the Girl Guides.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.520
 No, it sounds like Stargate.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.560
 I have read a little about the Texas Mosquito Festival.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.760
 Just because they've got a mascot, you know, someone in a huge mosquito costume,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.920
 the name of the mascot is Willie Manchu.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920
 What?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.560
 Willie Manchu.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.560
 That's funny.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560
 Is it?

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.560
 Yeah.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.560
 Well, Manchu, I get.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.200
 Willie Manchu, yes, he will.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.200
 What?

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.200
 Is the mosquito pantomime.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.200
 Wait, what?

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.200
 What?

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.200
 What is a Yoda?

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.200
 What kind of sense of structure is that?

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.360
 I just found another level on that joke.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.240
 Honestly, I was just thinking the word "Willy" is quite funny.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.240
 Yeah.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.840
 I think we've talked before about how you attract bees to sort of make them sit on you,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.840
 and you do it by hanging the queen bee next to your face, basically.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.840
 Oh, that's what it is.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.840
 In a little bee cage.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.200
 Yeah, and so they have a festival to see you can wear the most bees.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200
 It's pretty impressive.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.200
 That's seriously impressive, because getting a queen bee is quite hard, because there's

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.080
 a lot of bees to work out which one she is, right, to begin with.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.080
 I think it's quite obvious which one the queen is.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.080
 Is it?

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.080
 She's got a massive crown.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.080
 Yeah.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.080
 No.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.080
 No.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.080
 No.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.080
 No.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080
 No.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.080
 No.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.080
 No.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.080
 No.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.080
 No.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.080
 No.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.080
 No.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.080
 So what?

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.080
 What?

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.080
 Not everything.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.080
 No.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.080
 No.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.080
 No.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.080
 No.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.200
 No, it just makes it into the final edit.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.200
 That goes into the legally contentious outtakes file.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.120
 Although it's got such a big laugh, it may just have to stay.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.800
 I think it's got to stay, yeah.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.800
 Anyway.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.800
 Wow.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.600
 But be wearing, be wearing.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600
 Be wearing.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.600
 I like to say.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.440
 Can we just take a second just to let everyone recover?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.120
 Move on from libelous claims that definitely will never make it to air.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.240
 Yes, they have spies in the competitions which is incredibly exciting.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.240
 Sometimes.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.480
 It's happened vanishingly rarely.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:05.880
 But in 1988 there was a woman called Michelle Anderson who infiltrated Miss California.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.880
 This was so cool.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.880
 That's disgusting.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.880
 Sorry.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.000
 Was that the talent round?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.440
 She secretly entered Miss California.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.440
 I got it.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.440
 Yeah.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.440
 Yeah.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.440
 No.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.440
 She had been trying to get into a few different beauty pageants so that she could basically

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.040
 make a feminist statement and she'd done badly.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.040
 She'd failed a few times.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.800
 She never thought she was especially good looking or anything like this.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.360
 But she realized that what they were looking for in effect.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.640
 And so she did months of dieting, training, tanning, feigning the beliefs, you know, really

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.780
 giving the impression that she was a fully paid up member of this thing.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:47.080
 And then at Miss California she was in the absolute final and seconds before the winner

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.400
 was announced she got a silk banner out from her cleavage and unfurled it to say pageants

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.400
 hurt all women and started waving it around as them was wrestling off stage.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.880
 But she'd been through months and months and months of kind of deep cover training to get

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.880
 to this point.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.680
 That's like Miss Congeniality, isn't it?

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.600
 It is like Miss Congeniality, which is a fucking good film.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.600
 It is.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.120
 It's an amazing film.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.120
 Yeah.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120
 So good.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.120
 Sandra Bullock.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.120
 And there's definitely no sequel.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120
 Rubbish.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.120
 Have you guys heard of Yuichiro Mura?

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.120
 No, he's not.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.640
 So he is a sportsman.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.640
 He's Japanese.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.800
 He was the oldest person in the world to climb Mount Everest.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.800
 He climbed at age 70.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.400
 Then five years after that he did it again at the age of 75.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.360
 He started again at the age of 80.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360
 I remember this guy.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.680
 He keeps breaking his own record, doesn't he, like 80, 85 and 90.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.680
 Yeah.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.360
 And that always reminds me of, you know, when you do video games and you race your own ghost

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.600
 from the previous time that you set a record.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.960
 And I, you know, do you guys know?

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960
 Which one's that?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.960
 Which game's that?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.960
 I feel like I do know.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.960
 I can't do racing.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.960
 You do that.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.960
 So you set a record.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.960
 You race your own ghost.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.960
 Okay.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.960
 I think it's one player mode, Anna.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.960
 I think it's three.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.360
 Sometimes my friends didn't want to come around.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.760
 I like to play that.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.360
 It's like, you know, when you're playing video games, you only play one video game and it's

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.360
 Diddy Kong Racing.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360
 Yeah.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.600
 And video games have moved on quite a bit since then.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.880
 Is there no more racing your own ghost?

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.880
 I'm a feared one.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.880
 Look, this guy, he's 150.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.880
 He knows what I'm talking about.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.880
 He remembers Diddy Kong.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.000
 And I just like to think that you are, I've raced and you're overtaking your own ghost.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And then it overtakes you.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Wouldn't that be cool?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Yeah.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Yeah.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 I think that's not what happens at it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.480
 Remember, I did that with a fish gig.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.800
 We had to email everyone coming to the gig saying, "Sorry, the time has changed for

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800
 the gig."

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800
 What?

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.040
 And for some reason, you idiots let me do it.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.040
 And I...

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.040
 You cc'd.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.040
 I cc'd everyone at the gig.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.040
 Yeah.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.360
 And it was just after there was this whole movement about, you know, people's privacy

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.360
 and stuff.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.320
 It was literally like the fucking next day after that happened.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.320
 It wasn't a movement.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.320
 It was a law.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.840
 Oh, it was horrific.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.560
 I thought, yeah, I thought I was going to jail.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.560
 It was scary.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.800
 Well, stroving was a huge deal, wasn't it?

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.880
 Because basically lots of animals farmed in Wales, not that many animals farmed or not

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:06.880
 as many in the centre of England, where there was lots more wealthy people, sadly, in medieval

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.040
 and pre-industrial times, who wanted to buy all the meat from Wales.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.680
 So the huge stroving industry, and the thing I love the most is that there's between Anglesey

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.120
 and Wales, there's the Menai Strait, which is sort of, well, it's a straight, and at

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.120
 its...

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.840
 At its thinnest, it's a straight, great.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.000
 Yeah, but confusingly, it's a bit wiggly, so...

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Yes.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Yeah.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Yeah, it's not a straight straight.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.360
 I never said that.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.920
 It's about 200 metres wide, and it's narrowest, and at that point drovers would not only drive,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.360
 they would swim, castle, and so, and pigs.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.320
 And so they'd jump in the water with the castle and the pigs, and they'd all swim them over.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.760
 Now, I don't know how you heard, you know, 800 pigs, while you're also trying to swim

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.760
 across 200 metres of quite fast-flowing water, but they did it until 1826.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.920
 They did it, and they did it in their pyjamas, and they got a brick from the bottom of the

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.920
 pool.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920
 It's very impressive.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.920
 Wow.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.920
 Yeah.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.840
 That was, yeah, swimming proficiency was tougher in those days, wasn't it?

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.360
 What do you reckon is the most unread emails anyone's got or had?

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.840
 Oh, you see their pictures on, you know, the 100,000, you know.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.840
 No more than that.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.840
 There's millions.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:28.840
 Four billion, 294,967,257 unread emails, a guy called Joey Mananzala from America.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840
 It's Boris Johnson.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.800
 They're all from Sue Gray, saying, "Where are you?

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.800
 Need talk now."

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:40.960
 But apparently, if you don't reply, if you like, leave a lot of emails unread in your

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.720
 email thing, it means that you might be well-adjusted, and the reason being that the emails are from

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.160
 someone else wanting you to do something.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.720
 So if you're doing the things that are important to you, instead of the things that are important

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.240
 to other people, it might be that you've got the balance right.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.240
 Oh.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.480
 It's not getting the balance right.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.480
 Always doing things that are important to you, rather than things that are important

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.480
 to other people.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:08.920
 You know, in that election, the elected church, other than 51, do you know that the Labour

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:15.120
 government in that election got a more votes, more people's votes, than in any winning or

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.480
 losing party in any election before or until 1992?

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.160
 So the Labour government -- sorry, Labour got more of the popular vote than the Tories,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.280
 which does sometimes happen, as we know.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.280
 But the Tories won.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.280
 But isn't that extraordinary?

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.600
 They got more votes than anyone had ever got before, and lost it.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.600
 Yeah.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.600
 It's a kick in the face.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.600
 You might as well have got none.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:43.160
 The first parody I found of Conan Doyle was an article in the newspaper by someone called

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.520
 Donan Coyle in 1888.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.680
 This was in a newspaper in Portsmouth.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.400
 And what happened was, this was really early in Conan Doyle's time, he had written an article

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.080
 called On the Geographical Distribution of British Intellect.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.760
 And he came up with this theory that people who lived in the south were really good at

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.800
 poetry, music and art.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.520
 And people who lived in the north were really good at theology, science and engineering.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.520
 Okay.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.560
 Makes sense, because in the north you're closer to God.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.560
 You suck up.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.680
 It's just higher up, isn't it?

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.760
 But when you read the article of Conan Doyle's original, he's really throwing us north and

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.920
 there's a bit of a bone.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.240
 He's basically saying how great the south is.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.160
 And so this person who was Donan Coyle wrote about Hampshire.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.640
 And he said, because Hampshire's so far south, he said, "The soot in Hampshire is smuttier

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.160
 than any other soot.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.600
 The grass of Hampshire is greener than jealousy itself.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.440
 The cats of Hampshire are paragons of cats.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:53.400
 They catch more mice, breed more kittens, per more softly than any other cats in creation.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.480
 The fleas of Hampshire are the finest fleas of the species.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:02.840
 They are more bloodthirsty, have greater powers of suction, skip more nimbly and are caught

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.880
 less easily than any other fleas in Britain."

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.640
 I still don't want to visit Hampshire based on this.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.880
 I don't know if I want the smuttiest soot.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.440
 Is that soot that watches porn?

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:22.440
 Yeah, I was reading about this amazing woman called Mieko Nagaoka, who has just retired

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.040
 actually from a swimming career, which has been a 25-year-long swimming career.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.040
 And she broke 18 world records, and she started swimming in her early 80s.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.120
 So she's a hundred and five hundred and sixty-nine.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.320
 She must have won beaten world records of her age group.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.000
 No, just fastest in the world, 18, 19.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 Swimming.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Yeah.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 Right.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Yeah, I think of her age group.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 And she's pretty cocky about it.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 She published a book aged a hundred, the title of which was The Catchy, I'm a Hundred Years

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Old and the World's Best Active Swimmer.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Wow.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 Wow.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.500
 So impressive stuff.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.200
 But yeah, she has retired now because at a hundred, five hundred and six, you've got

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.920
 to spend some time with your family.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.120
 There was a famous guy called Chris Robinson.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.600
 He was kind of a little bit famous.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.880
 He was in a soap opera in America called General Hospital.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:19.480
 He played Dr. Rick Weber and he invested around $100,000 in beanie babies, which is basically

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.440
 all of his kids' college money.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:27.000
 And he went completely, he lost every penny, but on the plus side, he does now have 20,000

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 beanie babies.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Yeah.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.520
 What a huge comfort that must be, given his children don't speak to him anymore.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.360
 So, presumably, you can't even give the grandchildren the beanie babies.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.640
 He used to take his kids to McDonald's in order to get the beanie babies.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.980
 And one of their friends, one of their buddies, had to go to hospital because they were feeling

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.880
 so sick of the amount of McDonald's that Chris Robinson.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.960
 And the kids speculate that he wasn't sick.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.560
 He just was so sick of actually eating the McDonald's.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.800
 He would rather be in hospital than he would be at another McDonald's.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.800
 Wow.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800
 Righty.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.640
 You don't have to eat all the Happy Meals.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.360
 This is a bit like at Christmas, we hide coins in the Christmas pudding and it's to incentivise

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.280
 you to eat it and you have to eat all the pudding before you get the coin.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.480
 But was he doing a similar thing?

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.740
 You don't, did McDonald's say you have to eat the Happy Meals?

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:19.280
 We've hidden the beanie baby in the heart of the burger.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.400
 Kidley Wink was also a word for a child.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400
 Kidley Wink.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400
 Yeah, Kidley Wink.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.320
 No, but supposedly, Kidley Wink wasn't just like an acute name.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.960
 It was someone who had, there was someone who suggested a Kidley Wink, the Kidley Wink

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.080
 bars that open and his name was Kidley Wink.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.080
 Come on, Dan.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.080
 First name Kidley, second name Wink.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.080
 Yeah, that's the story.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.960
 Hang on, sorry, what was a Kidley Wink, a bar?

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.000
 Yeah, they were places you would go for alcohol, so an alcohol shop.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.640
 And they were opened by someone who was called Kidley Wink.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.640
 Kidley Wink, yeah.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.640
 Don't believe it.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.040
 Like, Sainsbury's is named after someone called Sainsbury.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.120
 Yeah, it's not crazy, there might be someone called Mr Kidley Wink.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.920
 And also Meatloaf, who's passed away, turns out it's Meat Loaf.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.440
 It's Mr Loaf, that's his second name.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.920
 Yeah, but he didn't invent the Meatloaf, that's the thing.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.920
 But the Meatloaf is obviously one word, right, and I always thought Meatloaf was one word.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.920
 It's not.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.920
 It's Meatloaf, Mr M Loaf.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920
 I didn't know.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.920
 Yeah.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.920
 Hang on, so his parents call him Meat.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.920
 No, it's not his real name.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.920
 Oh.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.920
 But he decided with the pseudonymity.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.920
 It's his real surname.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920
 He was born Pete Loaf.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:32.800
 Just quickly on the drink porter, you know, the drink, a porter, a bit of an old fashioned

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.880
 one, but it does come from being a drink for porters.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.960
 And it was because London porters were a huge deal until the end of the 19th century when

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.760
 everything completely changed, and they used to get so many of their calories from beer.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.280
 So it was estimated that in the 18th century, a manual worker would get about 2,000 calories

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.920
 a day that they needed in their working life from beer, and all pubs would have benches

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.400
 outside with tables next to them for the porters to dump their stuff on, and they would have

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400
 an initiation ritual.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.720
 There's a thing in the ship tavern, which people might know, it's near Lincoln's Inn

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.600
 Fields in London, near Hoban, and that was where the porters' union would always hang

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.600
 out and they'd go to pick up their pay and everything, and the initiation ritual when

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.520
 someone became a porter was that you'd have the badge of office dropped into a mug of

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.400
 strong ale, and you had to extract it with your teeth without spilling any.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.400
 Cool.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400
 Yeah.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.280
 Well, you had to get it out of a thing of ale without spilling any.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.960
 Well, I think you would drink the drink, and then at the bottom, you kind of get it

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960
 with your mouth, right?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:35.440
 I was thinking you had to, like, bob for it in a plain glass, but not get any beer out

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.440
 of the glass.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.360
 I think they just didn't make glasses like that, no one's face is that shape.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:46.040
 I live for the day that you're on Taskmaster Avenue.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.360
 Drink this glass of beer.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:21:03.800
 So, um, Carp, did you hear that in 2012, so no, it's too stupid, scientists at the University

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.880
 of Manchester made a magic carpet, which is very exciting.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.880
 Yeah.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.000
 Not a classic magic carpet, they made one which...

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.880
 That's the name of a Pokemon, Dino.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.880
 Is it?

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.880
 Magic carpet, yeah.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.880
 Is it?

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.880
 Does it have a magic carpet?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.320
 No, it's like a pathetic little fish that flops around.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.320
 Can it fly?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.240
 No, it can barely swim.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.240
 Why is it called magic carpet?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.240
 Like magic carpet?

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.040
 Because it's like a carp, but it's magic.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.040
 I understand.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.040
 Every day is a school day.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.040
 Yeah.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.320
 This is reminding me of my school days a lot, but I also knew jack shit about Pokemon.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.080
 Um, we've got to move on in a second, or in next fact.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.960
 I've got one other thing that's banned in New York, it's, you know, this is about baby

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.560
 hashtags. So in 1974, nunchucks were banned in New York.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.560
 Sounds reasonable.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.480
 Well, maybe, but it's the home of the Ninja Turtles, and you'd think that would have

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480
 some play.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.480
 Not in 1974, it wasn't.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.480
 Yeah.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.480
 A good point, but...

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.480
 And also, they're always...

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.160
 The police are always after the Ninja Turtles, so...

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.160
 Are they?

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.160
 Are they?

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.160
 Yeah.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.160
 I didn't think...

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.160
 I'm not...

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.000
 Vigilantes, they're, you know, they're doing it without permission of the police for...

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 I just didn't think...

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 Let's keep going.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.360
 But basically, this ban lasted for more than 40 years, and it was struck down in 2018.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.000
 So nunchucks are now allowed in New York, great news, if you're planning to go...

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Yay!

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.120
 Um, but they were struck down thanks to one guy, one nunchuck nut called James Maloney,

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:36.480
 who loved his nunchucks, and had been arrested in 1981 for doing a public demonstration.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.040
 And he went to court saying he wanted them, and the judge said, "Okay, I think you're fine."

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.520
 And James Maloney's argument was basically, "These are so crap that they're not a proper

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.000
 threat to life and limb."

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.880
 He said, "If you're going to commit a crime, your weapon of choice would not be these two

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.880
 sticks."

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.880
 And the judge agreed and lifted the ban.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.880
 Wow.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.160
 It's a heartening story of citizen power to get nunchucks.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.160
 Yeah, right.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.160
 That's cool.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.760
 I'd be so suspicious if someone's born that grudge for 40 years.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.400
 I'd be thinking, "I bet there's got to be something dangerous about these things."

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.400
 Yeah.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.400
 I have nunchucks.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.400
 Um, I made some myself, because I...

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.400
 You made some?

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.400
 Yeah.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.160
 I mean, in Hong Kong, I did karate as a kid, and I learned nunchucks, and I always thought

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.720
 they're a really cool thing.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.280
 And so, you know how sometimes people keep a thing by the bed, just in case...

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.280
 Glass of water.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.280
 ...a robber?

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280
 Yeah.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.280
 No, like, you know...

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.280
 A book.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.280
 A bedside lamp.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.280
 To protect yourself and your family.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.280
 So I keep nunchucks by the side of my bed.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.280
 Okay.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.280
 Yeah.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.280
 And when I was...

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.280
 Okay.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.640
 When I was dating my now wife, there was a night where she thought someone broke into

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.000
 the house, and then we heard the door go.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.240
 And I leapt up out of bed, and I grabbed the nunchucks, and I stood on the bed with the

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.520
 nunchucks looking at the door.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.520
 It stood on the bed.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:52.400
 And Finella was so confused by that, that we forgot about the possible robber, and just

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:57.840
 had a chat about, "Why are you holding nunchucks on the bed?"

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.160
 And it was because I was saving our lives.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.160
 That's the answer.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.160
 Um...

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.160
 Wow.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.160
 If the robber heard at the door, went, "I'm not getting involved in this."

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.160
 That's good stuff.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.160
 I'm out, guys.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.160
 It's cool.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.160
 Um...

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.560
 Oh, just another silly Japanese saying that, um, my friend told me, so my friend's actually

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.960
 making a documentary in Japan in, like, Rice Paddy Fields, in the middle of nowhere.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.920
 And she was...and she's Japanese, but she came across as saying that she'd never heard

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.480
 of when she was talking to a guy who was helping his neighbor plow his field.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.960
 And so she said, "Why are you doing that?

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.960
 He's your neighbor."

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.200
 And he said, "It's very important.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.200
 It's my duty.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.200
 You must never forget your duty or your fundoshi."

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.080
 And your fundoshi is, like, um, it's, like, the pants that Sumo Rest is wearing.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.440
 It's, like, an old-fashioned kind of pants, like, a loincloth thing.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.440
 That's cool.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.080
 And so she said, "Well, that's a weird saying."

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.560
 Well, it's like, "Yeah, yeah, it's an old saying."

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.480
 You know, and he's this really somber, and she's filming, he's this very serious, very

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.040
 dry, doesn't really say anything, old guy.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.680
 And he just said, "Yeah, if you don't have your fundoshi, everyone can see you're willy."

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:06.120
 And that's a great saying.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.920
 Your duty is just the same.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.560
 I read this cool story.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.120
 A guy called Steve Robertson, he bought a house in 2018, and the tenant was still living

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.360
 on the property.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:25.120
 So the tenant then moved out in 2019, and Steve tried to claim $5,166 off of the old

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:31.120
 tenant because he said that in the time between him buying and the tenant leaving, the tenant

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.040
 had moved a 10-ton rock onto the property.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.120
 And he was like, "I didn't buy this rock, I don't know why it's here."

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.520
 And she said, "Well, I didn't put this rock there.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.520
 This was always there.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.160
 You just didn't see the massive 10-ton rock."

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.960
 And he said, "I think I would have seen a 10-ton rock."

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.840
 And so she produced photos from 2016 saying, "Here's the 10-ton rock."

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.800
 And he said, "I'm pretty sure you hired a crane."

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.080
 So he denied the evidence.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:00.040
 He claimed that she hired a crane that, once having sold the house, then imported a 10-ton

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.080
 rock onto the property for no good reason whatsoever, other than to maybe just, I don't

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.080
 know, play a prank on him.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.640
 How did she prove that a photo of the rock on the premises was from 2016?

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.080
 Well, I guess she was reading a copy of a 2016 newspaper with a recognizable event.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.080
 Like, I don't know.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.520
 Well, I guess on our list to win the premiership or whatever with the rock in the background.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.640
 No, because there's time stamping on a lot of digital photos.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.640
 Yep, that's a better idea.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.640
 Good point.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.640
 Good point.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.640
 God.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.000
 Wait, whose side are we on?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 I don't know who's right.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.160
 I think she's right, because she's got evidence there was a massive 10-ton rock on the property

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.160
 that he bought.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.360
 No, but why would he have not seen the rock?

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.040
 Okay, I don't know why you're on his side.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.560
 2016 was the year of Brexit and Trump, and I picked, as an event that happened in it,

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.200
 Leicester winning the premiership.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.920
 I don't even like football.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.880
 I actually think the only thing I'll remember is this rock star.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.880
 Did you read about this story?

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:58.600
 In 2018, there was a court where the jury had to read all 218 pages of a book called

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.080
 "Behind the Artichokes."

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.080
 Okay.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.840
 And this apparently, so the judge in this case said, they thought it was the first time

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.240
 since Lady Chastley's lover that the jury had been asked to read an entire book to decide

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.240
 on a case.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.960
 The case in this instance was basically this massive round between three sisters, and this

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:22.360
 woman, Gillian Leedon, had written this book behind the artichokes, laying into her other

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.360
 two sisters, accusing them of stealing from their mother and abusing their mother, which

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:31.120
 it seems like they weren't, and she sent this book to the vicar and to the local counsellors

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.920
 and, you know, to every man and his dog, and yet to decide who was in the wrong, then the

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:41.120
 entire jury had to sit down and read "Behind the Artichokes," self-published book.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:47.720
 And apparently it contains details of one of the sisters' bowel movements, so it calls

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.240
 the other sister a hippopotamus.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.240
 Thank you.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:55.520
 And I don't know where it stands in the Lady Chastley's lover, so hierarchy, but maybe

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.520
 it's worth a read.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.400
 Does it sound quite as sexy, does it?

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:04.080
 You've definitely not, you've buried the lead if it's as sexy as Lady Chastley's mother.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.240
 I think it depends what you're into, you know?

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.480
 I've got ten copies.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.000
 A Nobel Prize went to these guys called Paul Lauterbauer and Peter Mansfield in 2003 for

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.920
 developing MRI technology, basically, but there's a guy called Raymond Damadian who

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:27.040
 says that he invented it, and he should have got the Nobel, and it causes huge ruckus.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.560
 I mean, often there's a lot of people involved in scientific discoveries, various bits of

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.560
 the process.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.560
 The Nobel Committee decided, Peter and Paul, maybe because it's biblical, they should get

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.680
 it because they contributed the most.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.800
 And Raymond, immediately after the Nobel Prize was awarded, took out a series of full-page

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:48.120
 ads in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the LA Times that cost him hundreds

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:53.320
 of thousands of dollars, all saying things like, "Shameful wrong that must be righted."

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.080
 You know, a person who invented MRI robbed of their Nobel Prize.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.560
 They did what they did, fully knowing the evil of what they were doing.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.560
 Wow.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.600
 The main reason he didn't get it is there are different innovations that happened.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.920
 And it's the MRI scanner that was given the Nobel Prize.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:13.720
 He was part of the MR scanning, I believe that's right, and so, yeah, but he's very

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.720
 pissed off.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.720
 What's the MRI?

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.520
 The eye is for imaging, so he just did a scan, but he didn't tell anyone what he saw.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.520
 But you haven't...

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.960
 There is an even more advanced version, the MRI eye scanner, but that's only for sailors

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.920
 and pirates at the moment, so that's...

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.960
 Jesus Christ.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.400
 It's time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.880
 My fact this week is that when leaving the Norwegian military, soldiers must now hand

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.800
 over their used underpants and socks for the next recruit to wear.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.120
 Well, it used to be that you would give every other bit of clothing back.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.120
 Oh, but you got to keep the pants.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.520
 Yeah, you kept your pants and socks, but then, yeah, but then, you know, it's been a hard

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.360
 time in the pandemic, and they haven't been able to get their hands on extra underwear,

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.360
 so...

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.360
 More like a pants to make.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360
 That's what I'm hearing.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.360
 Oh, come on, Andy.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.360
 I don't know why I keep doing this.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.640
 I'm trying to make the edit hard for you.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.640
 Sorry.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.760
 Woodpeckers are just storing more and more of these acorns.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.320
 They will use sometimes not just trees, but there's a lot of wooden lampposts around there,

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.320
 and they'll find...

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.920
 And they won't notice it necessarily to begin with.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.560
 People who work, they'll just find the lampposts is acting a bit weird, and they will be storing

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.760
 it all the way through their people's houses if they have wood...

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.760
 The lampposts...

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.760
 Sorry, what is a weird-acting lamppost?

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.680
 Darling, I think the lampposts look to me pretty funny today.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:35.600
 I'm starting saying some freaky shit.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.200
 Yeah, good point.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:45.640
 Yeah, so then the other thing I was going to say was the houses as well, like a lot of

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.120
 people's houses, they're garages and so on, and there's a professor who was asked about

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.520
 it saying, "What can we do?

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.560
 Surely there's like some kind of like, you know, bear piss that we can put around here.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.880
 Do you know how you buy on...

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.600
 We bought some on Amazon the other day, it was really weird.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.160
 Was it foxes around our area?

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.320
 And someone went, "You should get some tiger piss and bear piss, and you can buy that."

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.320
 Did you buy it?

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.720
 Well, we've bought some, but it hasn't arrived yet, but yeah.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.560
 They're still milking the tiger, aren't they?

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:17.800
 But so, like, you'd think there would be stuff that you could use, but Walter Koenig, who's

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.320
 a senior scientist at Cornell Lab of Ornithology, was asked about it, and his advice was, "You've

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.760
 got a simple three-point plan.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:30.320
 Move out of your house, bulldoze it, and rebuild it in stucco."

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.320
 Which...

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.320
 What's stucco?

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.320
 I should have read up where that word is.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.320
 A building material that's not wood.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.320
 Great.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.320
 Yes.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.320
 Yeah.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.320
 It's got a plastering.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.320
 It checks out.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.160
 If you don't want to flatten your home, I have read that you can tie helium balloons around

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.680
 the area that's being salted.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.680
 Oh, well.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.680
 And lift the house away.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.680
 Yeah, like up.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.680
 Yeah.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.480
 I think it puts them off the colours.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.480
 It ruins the aesthetic of a house.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.960
 It looks like you're constantly got a tacky children's birthday party going on.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.880
 Or a cool adult birthday party.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.880
 Sure.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.880
 Do you want to hear the most underpants anyone's ever had on?

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.880
 Most pairs of underpants.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.880
 Yeah.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.880
 Okay.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.880
 Have a guess.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.160
 Okay, well, the other day we were talking, and we found out the maximum number of socks

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.840
 that anyone's wore on one foot.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.840
 Yes.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.840
 Can you remember where that was done?

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:17.240
 It was 152, but then I think someone broke the record by putting on 180.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.240
 So...

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.240
 So 180 socks.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.800
 I reckon it would be similar for pants.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.800
 Okay.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.800
 180 pairs of pants.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.800
 Yeah.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.800
 I'll tell you.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.800
 Wouldn't...

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.800
 Hang on.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.800
 I'm going to say...

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.800
 I'm going to say 280.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.800
 Hannah?

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.080
 Oh, I'm going to say 98.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.080
 Thank you.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.080
 Anyone?

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.080
 160.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.080
 No one cares.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.080
 OK.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:42.200
 I'll put us all out of our misery.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.200
 302.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200
 Wow.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.200
 Which I think is very good.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.200
 And it was a guy called Gary Craig.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:52.160
 He broke his own record in 2011 when he donned 211 pairs of pants, 200 pairs of pants.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.320
 Imagine the pressure at the heart of that.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.280
 Like a black hole.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.280
 Yeah.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.680
 You think you could spontaneously combust at that point in size?

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.680
 You think so.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.920
 He'll then audition for Britain's Got Talent.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.000
 I'm afraid I don't know how far he got in the process.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 He lost the record, and that's when he got mad, and he decided to get even, and he re-broke

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.760
 his own record, or rather the broken record in 2012.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.920
 And he said, "Putting on all those pants is harder than it looks, because you're carrying

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.840
 an incredible weight, but the crowd really spurred me on and kept me going."

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.140
 And he said, "My wife Jacqueline helps me out with this one by getting all the pants

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.120
 ready and helping me get them on, but she doesn't like the limelight as much as I do."

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.120
 Wow.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:38.120
 You know, in a previous episode, we spoke about the Festival of Britain, and the Festival

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:44.360
 of Britain is actually the origin of all of these Miss World, Miss USA, Miss America,

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.440
 and all those things that happened.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.120
 And it was this guy who was called Eric Morley, and he was trying to work out how to add something

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.560
 to the Festival of Britain, which was this thing that took place in 1951.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.840
 It was this big event in London.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.960
 But wait, that was after all of this context, right?

00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.960
 Yeah.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.480
 So this was the first Miss World, so they'd already had Miss America and stuff, but this

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.480
 was the first Miss World.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.480
 Yes.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.480
 Sorry, sorry.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.480
 I got that wrong.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.480
 This was the first Miss World.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.800
 And actually, it was only accidentally the first Miss World, because it was a bikini competition,

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.560
 but foreigners were part of it, and they were like, "Oh, I guess this is a global event."

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.400
 Like, it was just meant to be a local event, basically.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.400
 It wasn't advertising itself as that.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.120
 But thank God, because the Brazilians are hotter than we are, so.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:29.700
 Well, it was won by someone from Sweden, Kirsten Kiki Hackensson.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.700
 And yeah.

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.200
 The Swedes are also hotter than we are, so.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.080
 But Eric Morley, they crowned the person as the only Miss World or Miss America or anyone

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.600
 who was crowned in a bikini, because it was part of a bikini.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.200
 She was condemned by the Pope for having done it.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:48.640
 It was a very bad thing to be representing your country in a bikini.

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:52.880
 But Eric Morley then went on to invent come dancing for TV.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.760
 So when you watch Strictly Come Dancing or Dancing with the Stars, that's Eric Morley.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.240
 So he meant it come dancing before it was strict.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.120
 He put it on TV.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.840
 Casually come dancing.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.400
 Casually, yeah.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.680
 Loose come dancing.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.680
 Wow.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.680
 Really?

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.800
 It's wonderful of Britain as far as women are concerned and objectifying and stuff like

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:19.560
 that, because they had a cinema there, the Telecinema, and they only hired red-headed

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.200
 usherettes, because they had green uniform and they thought it would look good with

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.280
 the uniform to have red hair.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.280
 Fair.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.480
 Just seems unnecessary, doesn't it?

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.920
 I mean, it was all black and white.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.920
 What was the point of?

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.920
 What?

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.720
 Everything in the world was black and white in 1951, wasn't it?

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.640
 Guys, sorry to cut us off, but we're going to have to end the show in a second.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.320
 I just want to talk about the fact that Andy thinks that the whole world was black and

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.320
 white in the 1950s.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.320
 Yeah.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.480
 I've seen the footage.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.280
 There was an emblem of the festival.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:57.240
 It was a red, white, and blue image of Britannia's head over the top of a compass, and this emblem

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.880
 was everywhere at the time.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:04.320
 It was on spoons, it was on cartoons, it was on flower beds, it was on pub signs, it was

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.320
 everywhere.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.520
 But one place it was as well was quite amazing.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:15.480
 It was 604 gold stones that had been removed from a patient, and they coloured them and

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.320
 put them in the shape of the emblem, and then they displayed it at the festival.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.320
 One patient.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.760
 One patient, six persons.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.760
 604.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.760
 They're quite small.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.760
 Right.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.200
 But like, someone in the audience has gone, yes, to the news that they're quite small.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.400
 The voice of experience over there.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.400
 I mean, wow.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.400
 Yeah.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.400
 That's...

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.400
 What a patriotic man.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400
 What a cool thing to do.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.400
 Yeah.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:43.080
 He must have been walking around, and they were just rattling around inside of him,

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.080
 aren't they?

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.080
 Do you think he was holding them in for the festival?

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.080
 He'd had them for decades.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:52.360
 Mr Smith, we're only on 590 gold stones, I'm afraid we need you some more.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.360
 Please drink this...

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.360
 ...goal.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:59.680
 Completely clear on the activism.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.000
 And that, you know, sometimes, you know, like Oasis, they broke up because I think Liam threw

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 a banana or something at Noll, it was a piece of fruit.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.560
 But, you know, sometimes it comes down to a very tiny moment.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.240
 And in Gilbert and Sullivan's case, it was a carpet.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:18.000
 So they were doing a show, and part of the preliminary costs that came in that they were

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.960
 charged for, and this was a show called The Gondoliers, was charged for a carpet for the

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.240
 front of the house of the actual theatre.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:32.080
 And I think it was Sullivan who freaked out about it, no, sorry, it was Gilbert who freaked

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.720
 out about it, saying, "They've charged us for this carpet."

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.720
 And Sullivan didn't care.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.720
 And then there was a bit of a silence, and Gilbert wrote back going, "I can't believe

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.240
 you don't care about this whole carpet thing."

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.280
 And then that led to them no longer being...

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.480
 It feels like there might have been underlying issues.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.520
 Well, underlying issues more like...

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:55.080
 That fucking hell, that was a sarcastic show, wasn't it?

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.240
 That was a tired audience.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.920
 I won't do it again, all right.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:05.040
 Well, hey, just while we're on Detectives and Mysteries with Cheese Theft, I discovered,

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.400
 and I found this when I was trying to look for great detective books, that there's a

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.560
 whole series of cheese shop mysteries that have been read, and they're modern day books

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:18.520
 written by someone called Avery Ames, and basically the premises, someone opens up a

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:23.960
 cheese shop, and a lot of murders happen, and the cheese shop owner, I believe, is the

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:29.520
 person who's solving them, and every single title of the book has a pun in its name.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.880
 So let me see who can get there first on the following title.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.640
 So I'll give you the name of, let's say, the actual quote, the phrase, and you've got

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.560
 to convert it into cheese.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.560
 So to be or not to be.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.560
 To bring on to be.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.560
 To bring on to be.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.560
 Yep.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.560
 Give us a harder one.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.560
 Okay, that was an easy one.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.560
 Okay, slightly hard one.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.560
 Lost and Found.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.560
 This is a hard one.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.800
 Mix up the word found a bit, and you can get there.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.800
 Lost and Founded.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.800
 Absolutely correct.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.800
 Come on, nice.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.800
 Yes.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.800
 For better or worse.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.800
 For better or worse?

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.800
 For better or worse?

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.800
 For better or worse?

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800
 For better or worse, absolutely.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.960
 I would suggest a rewrite with, for better or worse.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.960
 Sorry, James.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.960
 You've got to think like this also.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.960
 Two more.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.960
 As good as dead.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.960
 As good as dead.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.960
 Yes, absolutely.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:14.960
 And last one.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.960
 Let's see if the audience can get it.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:16.960
 The long kiss, goodbye.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:17.960
 The long cheese, goodbye.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.960
 The long kiss, goodbye.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.960
 The long kiss, goodbye.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.960
 Ah, fuck off.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.960
 Alright, mate.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.960
 We're nearly done.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.960
 (LAUGHTER)

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:46.440
 I'm sorry, I chumbled a gun, I know that was your turn, I know we've been doing all

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.440
 the talking.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.440
 It's a joke, the long quiche, goodbye.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.440
 I don't even get it right.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:56.440
 I've got to fuck off for my life, I don't even get it right.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.440
 (LAUGHTER)

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.440
 Wow.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:04.440
 Well, it's what you get when you come to Newcastle.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.400
