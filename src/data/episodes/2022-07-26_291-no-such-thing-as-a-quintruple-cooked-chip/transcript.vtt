 *Bell*

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 I don't want to get hurt or what, I guess?

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.400
 *Bell*

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:22.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.800
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.000
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.200
 Starting with you, Chizinski.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 My fact this week is that one of the women about to take part in the first all-female spacewalk has spent the last eight years hand-rearing a flock of geese.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200
 Wow.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.200
 And not in preparation for this.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.200
 So that isn't part of the preparation.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:05.400
 It sounds like she's going to take the geese with her... Yeah, she's flying up on the flock of geese, which would almost work because they're geese, which are famous because they can fly higher than any other bird, so they're the bar-headed geese.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.400
 But not in space.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
 I think space would be pushing it even for them.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.600
 Yeah, so this is Jessica Mir, and she's due to do a spacewalk on October 21st, and she's going to do it with Christina Koch.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.600
 And it's going to be the first all-female spacewalk, and she hasn't always been an astronaut.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 She's a physiologist, and the reason she's going up into space is to look at how space affects people's bodies.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 And in the past, she's only ever really looked at this in animals.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 And so one of the things she looked at is the bar-headed goose, because it flies so high.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 And so she wanted to know how it can survive, for instance, in oxygen, which is a third as much as oxygen here at ground level.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 And so, yeah, she realised that the only way you can look at that and look at how their physiology responds to proper sort of Everest height level conditions.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 By putting them in a wind tunnel, and blasting them with wind, and reducing their oxygen levels, and putting masks on them and stuff.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 And all of that really freaks geese out.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 And so you can't really do that to a bunch of geese that you've just picked up.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.600
 And so she realised, in order to study this, you'd have to rear geese from the egg, so that they trusted her.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 And so she did.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 And the pictures are amazing, aren't they?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 I've seen the picture.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 There was an article by Ed Young, right?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 Is that what you read this as well?

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.600
 And they have a picture of her with all of her little geese around her, and she just looks like mother goose kind of thing.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.600
 I think they followed her around and everything, right?

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.600
 Yeah, it looks pretty fun, because they imprinted on her.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.600
 I think we've probably said before that there are a lot of birds, which if you're the first thing they see,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.600
 and if you nurture them as a youth, then they think you're their mother.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600
 Yeah.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.600
 And so they love her as you train them to fly by scootering along on her motorbike, scooter thing, and they all flew next to her.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.600
 But, well, I'm sure you read this in the piece too, it's when they got separated, like a car came in the other direction,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 they'd freak out and fly off, and then they would just land somewhere, and they would search for anyone who looked like the lady they thought was their mother.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.600
 So one of them just started following people in and out of a supermarket, just on the ground.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 How similar do you think you'd have to look to this lady?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 I think if you had brown hair, I think that would do it.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.600
 And one of them landed in a hockey field and started chasing players around the field, so that's all it's my brilliant.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.600
 And yeah, they had to wear a backpack and goggles, didn't they?

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.600
 No, was it a mask?

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.600
 It was a little mask.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.600
 Yeah, tiny mask.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600
 Yeah, it doesn't look as comical as you might be imagining.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.600
 I sort of imagined Biggles or something, but it's tiny little goggles.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:28.600
 And yeah, and they would blow nitrogen into their face so they could see what it would be like with low oxygen conditions that they would otherwise be flying at.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600
 And even then they didn't all cooperate.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.600
 So they're quite stubborn and fair enough, someone shoves you in a wind tunnel and takes away your air.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.600
 Seven of them cooperated, seven out of 12.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.600
 So she did these experiments in the wind tunnel.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 Yeah.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.600
 And what did she find?

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.600
 She basically found out that they are really well adapted to these strange conditions.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.600
 So first of all, they've got better hemoglobin than the rest of us.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.600
 So their hemoglobin is just better at taking in oxygen.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.600
 They've got much more densely packed blood vessels.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.600
 They've got bigger lungs and they take deep breaths.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.600
 So if you see a goose flying as sort of panting, it's likely to be a barheaded goose.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.600
 Wow.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.600
 So how did NASA find her and then decide to train her as an astronaut?

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 Well, I read that she was an aquanauts before she was an astronaut.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.600
 Wow.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.600
 She worked for NASA in the extreme environment missions operations for, which is known as Nemo.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.600
 And they went to the Antarctic and they studied the Emperor penguins and elephant seals to see how they deal with cold weather and deep diving and things like that.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.600
 But she didn't, she didn't have to raise any elephant seals from the egg.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 I would love to see the penguins from the people around them around the Milky Way.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.600
 That would be great.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600
 Yeah.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600
 She did dive with them a lot.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.600
 So maybe she was a sort of mother figure.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.600
 So we used adjusting chains that maybe it was a bit of a typo on NASA's part.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.600
 They meant to type astronaut, they typed aquanauts, she felt too rude to say no and that was it.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600
 I think you're absolutely right.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.600
 So Spacewalks, the man who did the first ever Spacewalk, Alexei Leonov, he died very recently.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.600
 He died within the last fortnight or so.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.600
 And he had a terrible time when he went into space.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.600
 And specifically when he walked in space.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.600
 So he just had to put a camera on the air log and record it with the camera on his chest and then not die.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.600
 And that was all he had to do.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.600
 You make it sound like it's not difficult.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.600
 No, no, no, no, it's very difficult.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.600
 But he even left that out the pool.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.600
 But his body temperature went up and up because obviously you're in a space suit.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.600
 And I think that sort of reflected the heat inwards rather than letting it radiate outwards.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.600
 And it was so inflated, his space suit, that he couldn't even reach the camera on his chest.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.600
 You know, he was just this sort of Michelin man floating around in space.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.600
 And he was so big that he couldn't get back in the air log.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.600
 And his hand slipped out of his gloves and his feet slipped out of his boots.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.600
 So he was just inside this very big space suit.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.600
 I know.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.600
 It must be like Mr. Blobby.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.600
 It was like Mr. Blobby in space basically.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.600
 And so he had to deflate himself, didn't he?

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.600
 Yeah.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.600
 He had to allow some of the pressure out.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.600
 But as a result of that, he got the bends like you would if you were coming back from scuba diving.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600
 So that complicated things even more.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.600
 Yeah, he said it was incredibly difficult to squeeze in, wasn't it?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.600
 And you had to go sort of head first, which you weren't supposed to.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.600
 And because the deflated, the losing the pressure meant that you...

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.600
 I'm not sure it was exactly the bends, but it's like it involves sucking the oxygen out of his suit.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.600
 So he was basically risking suffocating himself for the sake of trying to get back in.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.600
 Otherwise, he would have died, of course.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600
 Otherwise, he would have died, I suppose.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.600
 Yeah, it's really, you've got to do it.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600
 But also, he couldn't say anything.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.600
 He couldn't say this is going to disaster's to be wrong,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.600
 because he knew that other nations on Earth were listening in.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600
 Yeah.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.600
 So...

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.600
 Oh, you're kidding.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.600
 Yeah, so he didn't say anything.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.600
 Everything's great.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.600
 Yeah.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.600
 This is awesome.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.600
 I'm just going to stay up for a few more minutes.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.600
 I love it so much.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.600
 And then, when he came back to Earth, he landed 2,000 kilometers away from where he should have been.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.600
 And he had to kind of make his way back.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.600
 And the Russian government said that he was on holiday.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.600
 Yeah.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.600
 But I actually saw a movie about this whole thing called "Spacewalker" is in Russian.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.600
 But I think you can get it in English with subtitles.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 And I watched it.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.600
 I think on the south bank, and Leonov was sat in front of us.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.600
 No.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.600
 Yeah.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.600
 And he was at the same screening as us, and they did a Q&A afterwards.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.600
 And they said that when they did the premiere in Moscow, there were two women sat next to him.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.600
 And one of them was saying, "Do you think he's going to make it?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.600
 They will whisper into each other.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600
 Do you think he's going to make it?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600
 Do you think he's going to make it alive?"

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.600
 And the other one went, "Well, I think so.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600
 He sat right on it."

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.600
 But it's an amazing movie.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.600
 It's so tense.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.600
 That's incredible.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.600
 That apparently was one of the feedback things that we're given from an audience member

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.600
 who saw a premiere of Apollo 13.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.600
 You know how they do test screenings.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.600
 One of the things was classic Hollywood endings.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.600
 They survived this improbable trip at the end as if that would really happen in real life.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.600
 That's hilarious.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.600
 Did they do the bit in the film where they apparently dropped a cauldron down to them?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.600
 So they were in the deep snow in the Urals.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.600
 Hellish was placed to accidentally land, and they'd waited three days.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.600
 And then when the rescue was arrived apparently because they were very cold,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.600
 they dropped a huge cauldron of boiling water from a helicopter down to the snow for them.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 So they could climb in and warm up.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.600
 How fun would that be?

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.600
 I guess so.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.600
 I guess it would be fun.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.600
 It doesn't sound fun climbing into a cauldron of boiling water.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.600
 No, no.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.600
 They're boiling.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.600
 It wasn't, sorry, it cooled down on the descent.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.600
 Did they play sort of witchy noises around the cauldron as they lowered it?

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.600
 Yeah.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.600
 But it was also, the place they landed was a wolf and bear riddled forest apparently.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.600
 And it was also bear.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.600
 It was mating season, so all of the bear were particularly aggressive.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.600
 So the little hybrid bearly enough children out there in the area.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 We're dropping a load of fur from the helicopter.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.600
 Just put the fur on.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.600
 You'll be fine.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.600
 Apparently it was because of this that I read this fact ages ago,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.600
 the astronauts used to be given a gun because if they landed in enemy territory or somewhere dangerous.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.600
 But I mean, it's a short-term solution to a problem.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.600
 It creates more problems than it calls if you have an astronaut landing and then trying to shoot his way out of America or whatever.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.600
 It's not for people landing in America.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.600
 Sorry, it's stopped bears from shagging you.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.600
 Linov's survived and he made it into...

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.600
 I know, he was at the cinema.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.600
 But he was in another movie as well.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.600
 I see.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.600
 He was in 2001 a space Odyssey.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.600
 His breathing, the recordings of his breathing were used by Kubrick in that film.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600
 It was cool.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.600
 Really?

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.600
 He was quite a creative chap, wasn't he?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600
 He was an artist.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.600
 I've seen the exhibition of his work as well in Moscow.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.600
 Really?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.600
 Was it good?

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.600
 Yeah, really good.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.600
 He does predictably mostly do pictures of space.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.600
 I guess you would have seen it.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.600
 If he'd been right out there.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.600
 If these things have been painted by someone else, I might not have enjoyed it quite as much.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.600
 In Russia, he's so famous.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.600
 Or he was so famous.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.600
 Only Gagarin would be more famous in space terms.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.600
 He insisted on bringing up pencil and paper, didn't he?

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.600
 In his first space trip.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:56.600
 So he drew the first pictures in space and drew portraits of his fellow astronauts and drew the first of sunrise in space.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.600
 And he tied together all his pencils to make sure they didn't float around and get lost.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.600
 That's so cool.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.600
 That's very clever.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.600
 Cool guy.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.600
 Did he tie them together in a bundle or did he tie them together end to end?

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.600
 So he had a sort of train of pencils.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600
 I think it was a train.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600
 I thought it was a train.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.600
 Yeah, because if you did them in one bundle, you won't be able to draw anything because you just have all the points at the same place.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.600
 You draw ten things at the same time.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.600
 Yeah, but they don't have the same thing.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:21.600
 Yeah.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:32.600
 Just on why spacewalking is so exhausting is partly because...

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.600
 So it's frequently just home improvement is what they're doing on the ISS these days.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.600
 They're just adjusting things and fitting new things.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.600
 But every time you turn a spanner, for example, on the outside of the ISS, your body turns the opposite direction.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.600
 Because of the lack of a thing.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.600
 So it's really knackering just to hold your whole self in space with one bit of you while you're turning a spanner with the other bit.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600
 That's probably we don't have down here.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.600
 Well, the other problem is, of course, is that you're going around the planet every 90 minutes.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.600
 So he did a five hour plus spacewalk.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.600
 And that's one of the other things.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.600
 You've got the sun directly on you for half the time.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.600
 And then you're back into ice cold of the universe for the other half.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.600
 And so that's where the sweat.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.600
 And then you go into absolute shivering.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.600
 Yeah.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.600
 Well, that's according to Scott Kelly, the astronaut.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.600
 I read once, oh gosh, I can't even remember who it is or hardly anything about it.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.600
 But there was a guy I think doing a spacewalk.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.600
 And then like a flap of his space suit kind of came off.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.600
 But it didn't expose his body, but exposed some part.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.600
 There wasn't supposed to be exposed.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.600
 And he got the worst sunburn.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.600
 Like a massive triangle of sunburn on his back.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.600
 No.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.600
 I think so.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600
 It's so vague that memory.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.600
 But what an amazing tan marker.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600
 Yeah.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.600
 You try and preserve that.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.600
 Just back to me, the astronaut, not the space station, who was rearing the geese.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600
 Who's at the top of this fact.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.600
 She's not the only astronaut who's gone to space with the help of birds to get her there.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.600
 Peggy Whitson, who is by all accounts, the most experienced astronaut today.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.600
 She was the head of the ISS.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.600
 She spent 665 days in space and total.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.600
 That's enough to go around Mars and back hypothetically.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.600
 She made that trip with the time she was there.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:17.600
 And she got there because she only got a pilot license when she sold chickens that she was raising for $2 each.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.600
 That eventually built up enough money for her to get her pilot's license,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.600
 which led her to becoming an astronaut.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.600
 Is it true that what was the reason behind her not being able to do the spacewalk in the first place?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.600
 Oh yeah, that was earlier on this year.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.600
 Yeah, that wasn't Jessica mid, but it was the person she's spacewalking with, Kristina Koch.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.600
 And this is in our book.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.600
 Probably a friend of book this year.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.600
 Yeah, is it called the Book of the Year 2019?

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.600
 That's what it's called.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.600
 Yeah, available in all good bookshops from a couple of weeks time.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.600
 And so this is news from our book from this year.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.600
 The first all-female spacewalk was supposed to happen quite a few months ago.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.600
 And it had to be cancelled because they didn't have, NASA didn't have a space suit that fitted.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.600
 And this was Anne McClaim was the other astronaut who was supposed to do it with Kristina Koch.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.600
 And it turned out when it came to the day, she trained in large and medium spacesuits.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.600
 But she realized she didn't feel comfortable in the large one.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.600
 And all Kristina was hogging the medium one.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.600
 So Anne said, all right, we'll let her man do it.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.600
 And that killed that for a few months and that was happening.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.600
 And is it because your body changes?

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600
 I think her at this.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.600
 So your body kind of changes when you're in space.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.600
 And so you can never quite tell whether you'll fit into something until you get up there.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600
 Wow.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.600
 Yeah.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.600
 And so she had done a spacewalk in a medium one exactly.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.600
 So she knew that at least that would work.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.600
 But do you get smaller in space?

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.600
 Oh no, she just didn't have access to a medium suit.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.600
 You don't drink in space.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.600
 You just further away.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.600
 You get taller in space.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.600
 Yeah.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.600
 Because the gravity's not pulling you down to your feet all the time.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.600
 Yeah.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.600
 I didn't realize it was only two women doing a spacewalk.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.600
 And that's obviously that is all female.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.600
 But when I read all female spacewalk.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.600
 You got that every one of them.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.600
 I just can't imagine like five or so, like roughly the same as girls allowed.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:02.600
 That's seen in endgame when all the girl superheroes come in that slightly.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.600
 Because you wouldn't say if you had like two singers like Pepsi and Shirley.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.600
 You wouldn't say they were an all-girl group.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600
 Really.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.600
 You would say girls allowed you an all-girl group.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.600
 Definitely.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.600
 So what's the minimum number of all for anything?

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600
 What about Sugar Babes?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.600
 Would you say they're an all-girl group?

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.600
 I actually would.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600
 Yes.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600
 I think three.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600
 I think three.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.600
 Thing is we're not calling it.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.600
 Can I just clarify an all-girl spacewalk?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.600
 It's an all-female spacewalk, guys.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.600
 I think it should be called a both-female spacewalk.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.600
 It's the only both-female spacewalk.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.600
 I don't know if it's the same ring.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:44.600
 OK, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.600
 My fact is that the Netherlands has a restaurant where if you move tables,

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.600
 there is a chance you'll end up in Belgium.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:56.600
 So this is a place called Baal.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.600
 And I'm sure I'm pronouncing it correctly, so don't write in.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.600
 And it's between the Netherlands and Belgium.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.600
 The town is basically in the Netherlands, but there are lots of enclaves,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.600
 which is a patch of land inside another country.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.600
 And those are Belgian enclaves inside the town.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.600
 And some of these borders pass through living rooms, for example,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.600
 or restaurants.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.600
 And the laws are observed there.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.600
 So there was a time when the licensing hours

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.600
 meant that you had to stop drinking in one country, but not in another one.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.600
 And so everyone would have to get up from their tables at some point in the evening.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.600
 If they wanted to keep drinking and then move across to the country where you could keep drinking.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.600
 It used to be that the legal drinking age, I don't know if it still is,

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.600
 it was 16 in Belgium and 18 in the Netherlands.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.600
 That's great.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.600
 So would you say, can I use my D?

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.600
 Can I show you my ID over there?

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.600
 I've actually been to this town.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.600
 Have you?

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.600
 Yeah, Baal Hurtog and Baal Nassau.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.600
 I went just because I'd heard about it.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.600
 I knew you would have heard about it.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.600
 Basically, I went on a holiday with my ex around Belgium and the Netherlands and dragged her to this town.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.600
 She was not impressed by it, but I was really impressed.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.600
 So I did read that there's not really much there.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600
 There is not.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.600
 There really isn't.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.600
 You get off the train and you wander around and you look at all the bothers and stuff.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.600
 And I had a wandering around looking for pornography shops and fireworks shops.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.600
 Oh, wow.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.600
 That's what I do when I'm on the holiday.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.600
 Are they separate shops or do they sell both things?

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:32.600
 No, so what I read before I went here is that pornography is more legal in the Netherlands and fireworks are more legal in Belgium.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.600
 And so they're in separate parts of this town.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.600
 But when I went there, I actually couldn't find either.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.600
 Again, still more clues to the end of this relationship.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:48.600
 Did you see there's one house where so a lot of the border doesn't affect massively houses because the border will go halfway through the house.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.600
 But there's one with a door where the border goes right down the middle of the door.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:58.600
 So that's very cool because what they have on it is they couldn't work out which side which country it belonged to for an address.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.600
 So it actually has two doorbells either side of it.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.600
 So you ring it if you want to be on the Belgian side and then you rate it.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600
 Yeah, and it's got two addresses.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:13.600
 So on the ground they have these crosses which kind of show you where the border is rather than lines that kind of like crosses with a dot cross with a dot cross with a dot.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.600
 And some of them go directly through the doorway.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:23.600
 And then also like all the houses have little flags on that are either Belgian flags or Netherlands flags so you can tell which country you're in.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.600
 And you can walk down one street and you can cross through five borders in less than a minute.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.600
 Although I couldn't tell with the house where it goes through the door.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.600
 Because the way you normally decide where the house which country it's in is by the doorway.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:43.600
 And often people or sometimes people on the border apparently have moved their doorway to be in a more tax-friendly country.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.600
 I couldn't tell which country this house counted as being in for tax purposes.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.600
 So I'm kind of here to highlight some possible tax evasion.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.600
 I think that it claims that it's in Belgium when the Netherlands guys come and vice versa.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.600
 I'm sure you're right, such a cop.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:06.600
 So if you are sitting at the table in the Belgian bit you're allowed to build a house within 300 metres of a pig farm

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.600
 which you're not allowed to do if you're sitting at a table in the Netherlands bit of the restaurant.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.600
 Who builds a house in a restaurant?

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.600
 I think, come on Adi.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.600
 You're taking the restaurant bit too far.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.600
 If you're on the Belgian side then fine.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.600
 And they have two phone systems and two police forces and two fire services.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.600
 The fire service thing is really interesting. Did you read this?

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.600
 No.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.600
 So the Belgian and Dutch fire brigades have different size hoses.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.600
 They have different thickness.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:41.600
 And so they had problems with the fire hydrants because the fire hydrants are different in the Netherlands than they are in Belgium.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.600
 That's so funny.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.600
 And so they appeal to the EU for money to kind of get all the hoses standardised and stuff like that.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600
 But they didn't do that.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:58.600
 And in the end the fire departments had to invent these adapters that could take you from one hose pipe to one fire hydrant and vice versa.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.600
 Amazing. That's so cool.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.600
 Isn't it cool? That's really good.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.600
 Just necessity as the mother of invention.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600
 Yeah.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.600
 Okay.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:13.600
 They applied to be, apparently both places applied to UNESCO to be a world heritage site because of their complex cartography.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.600
 But I don't think they have won that because as you said James and you've been there there is nothing there.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.600
 It was quite a few years ago when I was there but yeah it really was quite boring.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.600
 One fun thing you could do there apparently.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.600
 But I couldn't find if this is possible but the border goes through the middle of a road at one point.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:35.600
 So if you're driving on one side and the speed limit in Belgium is different to the Netherlands, you can drive you know twice as fast.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.600
 But as far as I can tell the numbers are the same.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.600
 Yeah that would be a very different speed limit which is double.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.600
 I mean the truth is that these two countries are very similar in many many ways.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.600
 And they're in the EU which makes them even more similar.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.600
 One of them should leave the EU and I think that would then make it quite exciting.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.600
 I don't think we need any more excitement about borders and people leaving the EU.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:04.600
 We've been talking about this place in Belgium and Netherlands where it's not really an issue.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.600
 This place being there because the countries get along well.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:13.600
 But there was a serious problem between India and Bangladesh which had 80% of the world's enclaves in it until a couple of years ago.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.600
 And so I mean there were 106 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh and 92 Bangladeshi enclaves in India.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.600
 And multiple counter enclaves within them.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.600
 So you'd have India in Bangladesh in India.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.600
 And also it had the world's only counter counter enclave.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.600
 So there was a bit of India inside a bit of Bangladesh inside a bit of India inside the whole of Bangladesh.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:40.600
 So on this border between India and Bangladesh there's a town called Hili HILI and some houses lie in the border.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.600
 So you can enter the front door in India and leave the back door in Bangladesh.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.600
 Wow.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:51.600
 And policeman Anna or police person Anna would be very interested because basically it's just place where people do a lot of smuggling.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:57.600
 I would install myself inside that house and stop anyone from moving from the kitchen at all times.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.600
 But I think it has been solved now because it was a serious problem.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:10.600
 And just for instance if you're in an Indian enclave in Bangladesh then you wouldn't be allowed to travel outside of your tiny sphere into Bangladesh without a visa or a passport.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:16.600
 But to get a visa or a passport you have to go to India proper and you can't get to India without crossing through Bangladesh.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:22.600
 So people were just trapped there and it was a major issue and I think in 2015 they finally swapped all their land back.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.600
 So this is getting ridiculous.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.600
 We never explained why this place in the Netherlands and Belgium is how it is.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:35.600
 And it's basically due to the lords of Brader and the juke of Brabant.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.600
 Brabant?

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.600
 I think Brabant.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.600
 Brabant sounds good.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.600
 Yeah.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.600
 And they basically just swaps land with each other over many many hundreds of years these two families.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.600
 And that's why you've got two places.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.600
 One's called Bal Hurtog and one's called Bal Nassau.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.600
 And the Bal Hurtog comes from the Dutch word meaning duke.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:01.600
 And the Nassau comes from the house of Nassau which was the aristocratic house which ruled Brader in that time.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.600
 And they just swaps.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.600
 Yeah they kind of just kept swapping things.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:12.600
 People would run out of money and the other people would buy some of your land and then you would buy some of their land back and stuff like that.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:19.600
 And eventually after the second World War no one could really work out anything but they found some old maps which said how it all fits it in.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600
 I think that's right.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:34.600
 But I find it unfathomable that when we reach the age of visas and passports and technology and the EU they didn't say should we now disregard the pointless stupid wins of these weird Renaissance juts and do it like a normal person.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.600
 It was the same in India.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:41.600
 The reason it happened in India was because there were Maharajas who were just playing cards and chess and waging bits of land between them.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:49.600
 Apparently it was obviously at the whim of local laws saying oh look I'll find you can have that bit of land if I can shag your wife or whatever.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:56.600
 Well you could argue the modern day nationhood in a lot of the world is down to whims of juke and so on couldn't you basically.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.600
 But it's just the tours it would imagine the harkens of the world not visiting places like this.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.600
 They would hold in minutes.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:07.600
 I hardly think there are millions of harkens like people going to these places.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.600
 Yeah how round was it when you were there.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.600
 I was just looking at some weird borders.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.600
 Interesting border disputes or territorial disputes.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:22.600
 And I didn't know about this place called beer towel which is it's a really big patch of land.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.600
 So it's over 2000 kilometers squared.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600
 It's a patch of desert.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:34.600
 It's between Egypt and Sudan and I believe it's the only place in the world which is not claimed by any country as in Egypt claims it belongs to Sudan.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.600
 Sudan claims it belongs to Egypt and neither of them wants it.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.600
 The unwanted son of geopolitics.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.600
 Yeah it's poor little lump of desert.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.600
 Is it just really crap?

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.600
 Really shit.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.600
 How crap must it be to not want that territory though?

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:56.600
 Well it's because basically there were two there were two accords which drew up the territory and decided who it belonged to.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:03.600
 And one of them decided that this place beer towel belonged to Egypt and another place called the Halaiib Triangle belonged to Sudan.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.600
 And then the other accord said it was the other way round.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.600
 And the Halaiib Triangle is great.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.600
 It's on the coast.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.600
 It's a nice patch of land.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.600
 It's much bigger.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.600
 So they both really want that.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.600
 Okay.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.600
 So if either of them claim the other place, they're sort of implicitly saying I don't want the nice triangle.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.600
 So they can't.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.600
 So if anyone wants it, it's going free.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.600
 So it's not much there though.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.600
 It's just, it's even less there than about that time.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.600
 It's on James's next holiday destination.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.600
 I would go, I think you can't, I think you're not supposed to go there.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.600
 I don't think there are, it doesn't sound like there are many fireworks or pornography shops though.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.600
 So disappointing.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.600
 Just one more thing about borders.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.600
 In China, trains crossing from Mongolia at the town of Erlien, they have to wait.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.600
 And the passengers all have to wait inside the train while the wheels are changed.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.600
 Really?

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.600
 Different gauges.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.600
 Different gauges, the tracks in China and narrow.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.600
 Classic, used to have that in Australia.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.600
 Huge issue between the states of Australia.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:05.600
 There was massive dispute between, I think it was South Australian, Victoria maybe, about the gauges.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.600
 No one wants to give up their gauges.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.600
 I can understand it in two different countries, but come on Australia, get your act together.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.600
 Same country.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.600
 Sort your shit out.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.600
 My friend, I spoke to my friend who lives in China yesterday and she's just been to visit South Korea.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.600
 And she went to the DMZ and she looks with a binoculars or a telescope over the border and saw,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.600
 I think we've discussed before, the peace village, you know, the fake village.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.600
 Oh yeah.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.600
 So yeah, I think we've mentioned this.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.600
 Well, she actually, again James, she did say it was really crap, but it sounds like you would probably enjoy it.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.600
 That would not stop me out of it, honestly.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.600
 I know.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.600
 Are you spoken about the negotiation room, the North Korea South Korean negotiation room?

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.600
 No.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.600
 This is for where they meet to sort of just discuss along the border, but the room itself is along the border.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:56.600
 So there's a table in there which is cut in two, which is one half belongs to the North and one to the South.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.600
 Why do they feel they need to cut into it?

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.600
 I guess it's a symbolic, this is our table and this is your table.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.600
 Does it have legs in the middle?

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.600
 Because otherwise, surely the table's just full of memory.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.600
 It's a long table, so yeah, it must have enough legs either side.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.600
 What if you drop your pencil and it rolls over into North Korea?

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.600
 That's why they always tie their pencil with a load of strength.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:24.600
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.600
 My fact this week is that in order to stop drought, an Indian village married two frogs.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.600
 Two months later, they had to be divorced because it would not stop raining.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.600
 This is a thing that was done out there this year.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:45.600
 This was in a place called Bhopal and they were divorced symbolically because the rain was just causing total destruction in the area.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:51.600
 They obviously couldn't find the frogs that they needed because I believe they must have been left back into the wild.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.600
 But they not have just found the one in the top part, the one in the valley.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.600
 So they were divorced by proxy?

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.600
 Yes, yes.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.600
 Wow, technically they're probably still married, I would say.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.600
 Would you say?

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.600
 They don't know it though, they don't know they've been divorced.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.600
 They don't even know their frogs.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.600
 But they'll be out there living in sin.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.600
 But this is a thing that's done a lot over in India.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:20.600
 They have marriages of frogs for rain a lot and they really go to town with the whole process of setting up a wedding.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:26.600
 So they send out invitation cards, they had custom clothes made wedding clothes for the frogs.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.600
 You would have to make custom clothes because they don't sell them off the rack.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.600
 Such a good plate.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.600
 What they actually have to go through, it's not just they just take any old frogs.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:44.600
 They actually have a procedure that has them inspected by the zoology departments that are local to them.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:50.600
 And after the selection process, they bring them together to a hotel in this case that were read a story.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.600
 They got married on a tricycle.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.600
 And yeah, and then they all go out for celebrations afterwards.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.600
 What do they do?

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.600
 Have you seen a picture of this supposed tricycle?

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.600
 No, no.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.600
 Was it a custom made tricycle?

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.600
 I think it's human size tricycle.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.600
 Really?

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.600
 I think they were taken to the venue on a tricycle.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.600
 I don't think the ceremony took place on the tricycle.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.600
 That's not good wedding inspo at all.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.600
 I think if you're not old enough to write a proper bicycle, you're not old enough to get married personally.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.600
 That's just my old marriage.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.600
 Very harsh.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.600
 I don't know.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.600
 I think that's uncontroversial.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.600
 So they got married to please Lord Indra, who is the Hindu god of reigns.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.600
 And Indra was, he's kind of a weird god.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:39.600
 So there was a goddess, a very beautiful goddess called Ahalia, which also means perfection.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.600
 And she was married to another god called Gautama.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.600
 But Indra really fancied her, really liked Ahalia.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.600
 And so decided to disguise himself as Gautama to have sex with her.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.600
 And then, as always, happens he got found out.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.600
 And so Gautama cursed him to be adorned.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.600
 His body to be adorned with 1,000 vaginas.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.600
 What?

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.600
 Wow.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.600
 That was his curse.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.600
 I didn't see that coming.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.600
 I thought he was going to get turned into a frog.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.600
 I thought the same thing.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.600
 No, 1,000 vaginas.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.600
 The very opposite got turned into a different animal.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:21.600
 Because Gautama thought, OK, 1,000 vaginas, actually that is a bit much.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.600
 You know, it was bad what he did, but 1,000 vaginas, that's a bit much.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.600
 So he swapped the vaginas for eyes.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.600
 So he was adorned with 1,000 eyes and he became...

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.600
 I would guess a peacock.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.600
 Correct.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.600
 And that's why peacocks have so many eyes on their tails, they used to be vaginas.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.600
 Right.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.600
 Really did they?

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.600
 But not functioning ones, more decorative vaginas.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.600
 I suppose so.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600
 OK.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.600
 Even if you had 1,000 functioning vaginas, it's hard to get through them.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.600
 It would take you a long time to get through them all.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.600
 It would be a need to get through them all.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.600
 You try.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.600
 You'd definitely say it's sort of that challenge.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.600
 Oh, but then keeping trackers and nightmare.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.600
 You'd have to have some sort of sticker system or some sort of...

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.600
 You're basically a colander at that stage.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.600
 Blimey or Riley.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.600
 We should say not everyone in India believes this frog stuff.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.600
 It's hot comment on the times of India when they reported this story.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:17.600
 Hot comment was stupidity has no limits as it's been proved by the people on the journalist covering the story.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.600
 So I think even in India it is the thing where people go, "Oh, right, yeah, sure."

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600
 It's pretty rare.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.600
 But it's definitely, you know, it's related to Hinduism.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:32.600
 So it's apparently that God Vishnu once took the form of kind of an amphibian and sometimes a fish.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.600
 But maybe that's also kind of sometimes a frog.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.600
 And so that's where it comes from.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.600
 So it could well be a symbolic thing rather than, you know, it's just like a prayer, really.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.600
 And they do get decorated like you think the frog sometimes get a wedding ring or they get cloaks put on them.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.600
 Or sometimes little little veils.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.600
 And there was one person who remembered being taken to...

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:57.600
 It's custom made. All custom, assume custom made unless otherwise stasis.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.600
 There was one girl who remembered when she was younger being taken to a massive frog wedding.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.600
 Sorry, was that a wedding for a massive frog?

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.600
 Or was it a massive wedding for normal size fair?

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.600
 Actually, could they could use a normal shop bought veil for that one, right?

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.600
 It was one of the few, yep.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.600
 It was, I didn't get the frog size.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.600
 It was a frog wedding that was attended by about 70 people.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:23.600
 And the frog's head is streaked with a million powder like women's heads are when they get married in Hinduism.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.600
 So that it's called sindoor, that red powder that you smear over your partying.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.600
 So the frogs get that.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.600
 And, yeah, well, lipstick quite a lot.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.600
 Put lipstick on a frog.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.600
 Which is not a saying that you can't put lipstick on a frog.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.600
 On a pig.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.600
 Yeah, on a hog sometimes.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.600
 Is the saying that you can put lipstick on a pig?

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.600
 No. Well, you can, but it doesn't make it look any better as what the point is.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.600
 It's because there's another one about rolling a turd in glitter.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600
 Yeah.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.600
 And you can, I mean, I would say you can do all these things.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.600
 You can't put lipstick on a pig, but you can't make it drink.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.600
 So it goes.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.600
 And you can actually buy a thing that makes your poo glittery as well.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.600
 Can you?

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.600
 Yeah, you eat it and it goes through your system and your poo comes out glittery.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.600
 Gosh.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.600
 Yeah.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.600
 What a useful thing to buy.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.600
 I actually was going to submit a fact for another week's podcast.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.600
 But I'll just say it now, which is that a kidners have glittery poo.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.600
 No.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600
 Yeah.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.600
 They have sparkly poo and it's only because of the, what can you guess why?

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.600
 Well, it must be something they eat.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.600
 Yep.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.600
 They're Australian.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.600
 A kidners, aren't they?

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.600
 Yep.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:33.600
 So what is, is it like when the new year parties happen in Sydney, massive party, loads of glitter,

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.600
 eat it, shit it out.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.600
 Very nice.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600
 It's very good theory.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.600
 It's not that.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.600
 Okay.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.600
 Is there something, something luminescent or phosphorescent?

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.600
 Some, oh, choir flies.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.600
 No, it's ants.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.600
 It's ant exoskeletons.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:50.600
 When they crunch them up in their bodies, they love eating ants, so they sparkle and they

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600
 make a glittery poo.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.600
 Oh, lovely.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.600
 They're crazy.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600
 Beautiful.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600
 Yeah.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600
 That's great.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.680
 Do you guys know that during the 90s, well, 1990, the Prime Minister of New Zealand appointed

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.680
 someone, the official wizard of New Zealand.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.160
 So they had an official wizard and he's only retired a few years back.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:14.360
 And the reason he's relevant to this is because he, quite famously in 1988, went and did a rain

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:19.920
 dance for a small town that had a drought called Y-Mate, that had a drought for six months.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.720
 And he went there and he brought with him four buckets of water, a horn, an umbrella under

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.360
 which he had a little red demon, a large bass drum, his magic staff, and a mug of beer.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:35.520
 And he performed a rain dance and it started to rental raining within two hours and made

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.400
 international news.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.400
 And this was their official wizard.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.800
 I mean, he's definitely checked the weather forecast, before deciding when to do this.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.640
 Well, no, so six months and it was part of the festival and the festival was not going

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.240
 to be held, but actually it turned, because of the drought, they weren't going to have it

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.240
 in this farm.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.840
 But they thought it's an actually a nice place for people to meet up.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.040
 Let's have a fun little rain dance thing going on.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.880
 The wizard rocks up, does his dance two hours later.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.880
 Rain.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.880
 It's amazing.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.880
 Yeah.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.880
 It's incredible.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:10.600
 So for instance, this week, the Pope tweeted something about praying to the saints, but he

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.600
 put #saints.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.160
 And when you do that on Twitter, sometimes it thinks you're talking about the American football

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.160
 team.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:20.920
 So it puts a little symbol of the American football team, so he tweeted, "We should all

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.920
 pray for the saints."

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.640
 So that would be American football team, and sure enough, this week they won.

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.640
 Well, there you go.

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.640
 There you go.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.640
 It must be related to this key we got.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.440
 The Pope is the official wizard of lots of people, really, isn't he?

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.440
 Yeah, he is.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.280
 Good luck getting ex-communicated for calling him the official wizard.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.040
 Yeah, I think a lot of people are able to do that.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.640
 I think in Nigeria, there's a particular problem because people charge for the services

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:46.520
 of being rainmaker and the clever trick is you do sort of check what the weather's going

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.520
 to do.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.520
 Oh, it's sort of a bit loose.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:53.480
 So if it does rain two hours later, maybe four, maybe a couple of days, you can claim

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.480
 it, can't you?

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.480
 Yeah.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:00.440
 But I was reading, there was in the Journal of Iranian Studies, there was actually a list

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:05.760
 of stuff that individuals in Iran can do in different parts of Iran to bring on rain.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.400
 There are a few things you can do.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:12.880
 So rainmaking, individual ceremonies include sticking pieces of dough to the back of a sheep.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.960
 If you've got those two things at hand, you talk about dough as in the thing you make bread

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.640
 from or a female, because that is quite disgusting.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.640
 Harrowing.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.760
 Don't cut a deer into small pieces.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.760
 It's the bread.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.760
 It's the bread stuff.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.760
 Leave the deer alone.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.240
 You can also steal the tripod of a widow.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.240
 The tripod.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.240
 Yeah.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.680
 I think that might be a cooking thing rather than a photographic thing.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.680
 Okay.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.680
 I imagine.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.320
 Or you can ride on a tree branch as on a horse.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:46.200
 And actually, if that tree was a bit wet and you jump up and down on a tree branch, it does

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.480
 cause it to sort of rain under that tree, doesn't it?

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.480
 A little sharp.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.280
 But then if your branch is wet, why are you doing it away?

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.280
 Should we finish?

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.280
 Yeah.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.920
 I've just got one slightly interesting thing.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:04.120
 There's been a mystery which is to do with sea snakes, which is how they live in, and

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.000
 it's particular species of the yellow belly sea snakes.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.440
 It's a reptile that lives in the open sea.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.280
 So it needs fresh water, but it's living in salty sea.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.280
 How does it do it?

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.240
 And there's a new study that's been done, and there's still in sort of trying to prove

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.760
 this theory entirely.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.800
 But what they think is the way they get fresh water is that when it's heavy raining, there's

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.760
 a thin lens of the rain water that sits on top of the ocean.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.840
 And that's where they go and rehydrate themselves.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.600
 So they go to the surface, and they drink from this little sort of like having a top of lemonade

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:39.960
 on your beer kind of thing, ordering a longer top, but you don't want any of the beer.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.960
 Exactly.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.960
 Yeah.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.960
 It sounds like me.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.960
 And you're inside the beer.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.960
 Do you think that a longer top?

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.720
 So you just drink the lemonade at the top, and then the rest of it's just a whole beer then.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.720
 Wow.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.200
 Because they put a ton of, yes, you have a herd of them.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.160
 You have a full beer, and they don't fully fill it up.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.280
 There's like a tiny little centimeter at the top that they fill with lemonade.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.280
 Right.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.280
 It takes the edge off a little bit.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.280
 It takes the edge off.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.240
 And famously beer is much denser than lemonade, because the lemonade just sits on top.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.040
 Now, how does it sit there of taste wise the whole time?

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.040
 Answer me that.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.040
 You can't.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.040
 Okay.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.040
 It is time.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.040
 In fact, number three.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.040
 Wait.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.040
 Wait.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.040
 We've done fact number three.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.040
 We have done fact number three.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.040
 Great.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.040
 That's exactly it.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.040
 I'm going to get you out of this.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040
 Damn it.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.040
 Okay.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.040
 Okay.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.680
 It's time for our final fact of the show.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.680
 And that is James.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.680
 Okay.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:34.040
 My fact this week is that Sainsbury's sells triple cooked chips, which you then have to cook.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.280
 It's not really a fact.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.760
 This is such a stupid fact.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.760
 It's not really a fact.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.760
 It's not really a fact.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.760
 It's not really a fact.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.760
 It's great.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:47.840
 I was just, it's more of a sort of ad or spawn than a fact.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.320
 It's more of the start of my stand-up stuff.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:56.360
 So what it was was one of the other elves were doing the our series of QI at the moment.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.880
 And one of the other elves, Matt Coward, posted a thing about re-fried beans about how re-fried

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.040
 beans aren't fried twice.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.880
 And he said, why would you fry anything twice?

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.400
 And I was like, well, you do fried chips twice to cook them.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.320
 And then someone said that Heston Blumentell tripled cooks his chips.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.080
 And so I wanted to see if anyone quadrupled cooks their chips.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.040
 And my Google just found this amazing fact.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.120
 And so triple-cooked chips are a thing that was invented by Heston Blumentell in the

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.120
 90s.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.800
 And you can buy them.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.640
 So you put them in the oven and they cook.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.160
 So they're quadrupled cooked chips.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.560
 As far as I can see, there is no quintrupled cooked chips.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.560
 I was astonished how you found this fact because the link you sent us to show that this

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:42.720
 fact was true was a Twitter question that someone called Sam put to Sainsbury's.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.920
 And this was back in 2016, I think it was of 2017.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.000
 It had one like.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.080
 And they replied to him, yes, you have to then re-cook it.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.960
 And I thought, Jesus, James is research levels.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.960
 You're insane.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.960
 He's trawling.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.480
 I mean, everything on Twitter is just in case it happens.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.080
 Yeah, did you hear his method?

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.040
 He typed quadrupled cooked chips into the internet.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.920
 There aren't many results for that.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.520
 I've given away all my tricks and things like that, thank you, I hear.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.520
 But not actually.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.560
 The Sunday Times said that Heston Blumentell inventing triple-cooked chips was arguably

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.680
 his most influential culinary invention ever.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.680
 Wow.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.680
 And it gave them a whole new lease of life, they say, chips that is.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.320
 And the way that he does it is he kind of cooks them by simmering them in water.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.880
 And then he gets rid of all the water inside them using a sous vide technique.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.640
 I'm not sure exactly what that means, well, I know what sous vide means, but I don't know

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.640
 what the technique is.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.240
 Or he does it by freezing them.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.920
 And then he deep fries them.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.880
 And then he calls them and then he deep fries them again at a really high temperature.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.080
 So they get really crispy on the outside and really fluffy in the middle.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.080
 Okay.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.800
 And then you shove them in the oven, forget about them.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.600
 And then they're just like charcoal.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.800
 But they're all right, as long as you have a lot of ketchup with them.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.800
 So I didn't know how chips, why chips are nice, basically, until research in this pack.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.520
 Why are they nice?

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.040
 So it's exactly because of that.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.760
 So it's when you deep fry chips.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.920
 What happens is you've got, obviously, just potato junks, you know, that's all they

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.400
 are, originally, but then thanks to the magic of cooking.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:20.040
 So when they touch the oil, all the moisture on their service immediately vaporizes.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.120
 And that immediately forms this dry, hard layer on the outside.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.840
 But the moisture inside that layer is trapped.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.320
 And that's when it steams the flesh of the potato.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.000
 And that's what makes it fluffy on the inside.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.880
 And obviously it's crunchy on the outside because of the sort of hard oil layer.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.840
 But you need that shelter form instantly.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.760
 Otherwise, the moisture will seep out and then you'll have, you know, basically a dry

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.400
 all the way through stick to the disaster.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:49.560
 And it's only batter and potato starch, which can form that instant, hard layer when you're

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.560
 cooking.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.560
 Yeah.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.560
 So that's why you don't need a battered chips.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.800
 And that's why you do need to batter lots of other stuff is because batter the thing that forms

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.480
 that sealed layer and makes it cook on the inside as well as the outside.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.480
 Might you have battered chip or are you fucking dumb?

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.520
 Yeah, I actually saw someone tweeting about batter chips this week.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.520
 It was just completely not even part of this research.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.080
 I just saw it and I just thought that is fit.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.080
 Yeah.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:17.800
 And that does make me worry about your Twitter habits, actually, you are going too deep.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.800
 That's really interesting.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:24.720
 And on the Heston thing, the way that he kind of gets rid of the water by freeze drying

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.120
 them, this is a technique that has been done by Peruvians for over a thousand years.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.160
 So they invented freeze drying for potatoes.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:38.400
 Because basically you live in Peru if you're at very high altitude or you have like droughts

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.520
 quite often because of El Nino, you're not always going to have potatoes all the time.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.160
 And so they've had to find ways of keeping them when they had problems.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.920
 And the way they did it was take them really, really high up mountains and they would freeze

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.240
 them and the water would come out of them and it meant that they wouldn't rot so quickly.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.240
 Yeah.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.240
 That is very interesting.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.720
 And it really is amazing because it's like almost a millennium before we invented

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.720
 the technology.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:03.400
 But the next thing they did, once they've frozen them and they've lost a lot of their

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.280
 moisture and then they trampled them underfoot.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.800
 So sometimes they still do this and it's really, really successful.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.080
 So you lay them out, lay all of your chips on the ground or your potatoes on the ground.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.080
 They didn't have chips.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.080
 Potatoes on the ground.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.880
 And then as a family, you trample them or as a little village, you trample them all down

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.800
 and you squeeze all of the moisture out and once you've trampled them all, that moisture

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.320
 is so squeezed out that they'll last for years.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.000
 So as James says, you know, you use a few potato corrupts, you're fine.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.480
 You also don't want to eat them because your horrible uncle has just walked for over

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.480
 that big sweaty feet.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.880
 Yeah, you only have them in times of real, real good.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.880
 Yeah.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.040
 Well, that's actually how cheesy chips are invented.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:43.280
 I wonder then if they have, so obviously they have farms on the ground level, but would

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.320
 you then have farm plot as it were up on the mountains?

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.320
 And so they improve.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.320
 Yeah.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.320
 Yeah, you would.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.640
 Actually, you would have people living at different altitudes.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:56.960
 And they would come up with different varieties of potato that would grow in all these

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:57.960
 different altitudes.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.680
 And that's why in Peru, I think they have something like 200 different types of potato

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.680
 in the country.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.320
 More types of potato than anywhere else.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:09.480
 And they invented the husbandry of it, not husbandry, they're growing of it.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.520
 They invented how to grow potatoes really.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.680
 And it's because when you were in Peru, you would pay your tax in potatoes or a few other

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.280
 things, but they were all with crops.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.360
 And so you needed a way that everyone would be able to grow potatoes because everyone

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.320
 needs to be able to pay their tax.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:28.040
 And so their government would almost come up with ways of the people in high altitudes

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.840
 growing potatoes so that they'd be able to collect tax from them.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.840
 Oh, really?

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:38.520
 But then the government just has loads of potatoes and then of course the government then gives

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:43.240
 the potatoes out to people and you know, people who can't grow potatoes get potatoes and

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.720
 they'd give them goods and services and got it.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.720
 It's a currency.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.720
 It's a potato currency.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.720
 Yeah.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.720
 It's amazing how many potatoes there are.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.400
 As you say, and they're still finding them.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:56.080
 Like James and I once met a potato hunter who's discovered new species that she was on

00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:01.240
 the museum of curiosity, she works at the Natural History Museum, yeah, still finding new tomato

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.120
 and potato species all over the world, yeah.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.120
 Cool.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.640
 Why do we get stuck with same old Maris Piper or Tesco value new potatoes?

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:14.840
 Well, one reason is because the potatoes are trademarked by companies.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:21.640
 So PepsiCo has been filing lawsuits against farmers in India who have been growing their special

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.520
 types of potato that they use for lay potato crisps.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.520
 It's very controversial.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.520
 I know.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.960
 But I guess if you've put a load of research and development into, you know, genetically

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:37.720
 making a better potato, you know, how pro-capitalism you are, hey, I read the economist for

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.720
 a reason.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.080
 No, it is, I mean, it's a real proper argument, isn't it?

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:47.400
 Like we wouldn't have those amazing potatoes that they can grow and feed so many people if

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.600
 they didn't know they were going to get money back for them.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.600
 Yeah.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.760
 Shouldn't there be a thing where I'm like you have with patents with medicine where you

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.520
 can have it for 10 years and then it's released to the world as...

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.520
 Yeah.

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.520
 That would be a good idea.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.520
 It's a thought.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.520
 Unleash the potatoes.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.520
 Unleash.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.520
 Unleash.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.360
 I'm speaking of big capitalist pimos, McDonald's.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.480
 It's fries in America, not vegetarian.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.480
 Really?

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.480
 Yeah.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:17.000
 So chips used to be often cooked in beef tallow, man, a lot of delicious, really good ones,

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 I guess, probably often are.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.360
 And so McDonald's fries used to be cooked in beef tallow.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.840
 And then there was this huge crusade, which I think we've mentioned before in the 1980s,

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:30.320
 which was anti-sap fat, so it was saying beef tallow is really bad for you because of the

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.320
 saturated fats.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.320
 Yeah.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:36.600
 So McDonald's started cooking them in vegetable oil, and they realised they tasted way worse.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.920
 And so now, what they do is they coat it in beef flavouring before it gets sent off to

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.920
 the McDonald's to be cooked.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:42.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:43.920
 So, yeah.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.920
 And they don't.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:45.920
 In America?

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.120
 And it was hard to confirm where else, definitely not in India, because McDonald's doesn't

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.120
 reach our meat in India, obviously.

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:54.480
 In the UK, on the McDonald's site, it does say that their chips are vegetarian.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.480
 Right.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.320
 But in America, definitely, you're coated in beef powder.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.200
 But just another quick tip of something yummy to eat, when we're talking about battered

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.200
 chips before.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.200
 I've had battered halloumi chips.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.200
 Oh.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.200
 Best thing I've had in years.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.200
 Just a little tip there.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.200
 Yeah.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.200
 They are good.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.200
 They're relatively confident.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.200
 Yeah, they are quite honest.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.200
 What?

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.000
 It's pretty standard hips to lunch.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.320
 You know, I don't think there's a lot of food in North London elitist over here.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.320
 Sorry.

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:27.520
 In 2018, last year, British chips got shorter by three centimetres.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.520
 What's that?

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.520
 I know.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.520
 There was a chip.

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.520
 There was a terrible potato crop.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:36.000
 And they usually, potatoes are usually the size of a small brick, was in the article I read.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 If you can imagine such a thing.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.920
 But, obviously, if the bricks get smaller, the chips get smaller.

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.080
 And the potatoes that were harvested were smaller last year, because there's a terrible

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.080
 potato crop.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:53.680
 And the telegraph interviewed Cedric Porter, who was the editor of World Potato Markets magazine.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.680
 Yeah.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:59.200
 And he said, "This was the hottest British summer since 1976, which any potato person

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:04.000
 will tell you was an almost mythical year."

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.040
 He said, "It is still talked about in potato circles."

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.040
 It is.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.040
 Wow.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.560
 You don't wish it had done is send our chips to space.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.560
 Right?

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.560
 Yes.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.560
 Make them taller.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.800
 Oh, that's a great idea.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.800
 Perfect.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.080
 And actually, did you read this about how to make chips in space?

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.080
 No.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:29.160
 And so, the European Space Agency used its centrifuge, and especially made deep fat fryer,

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.160
 and they made fries.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.160
 Wow.

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:36.600
 And they found that the sweet spot for the best chips was about three times the earth's

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.520
 gravity, which is about the same as you would find on Jupiter.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:45.520
 And if you cook chips there, you get the absolute perfect crispiness and fluffiness.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.880
 But if you go anywhere over three times the earth's gravity, the fry begins to lose its

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.360
 structural integrity.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.360
 Wow.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.720
 I can already see Heston looking up the next space flight to Jupiter.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:03.240
 It is amazing, because I read that too, and they built a rotating industrial fryer to

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.160
 simulate up to 9G.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.160
 Wow.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:12.920
 But they did feed the students' normal chips, and then 3G chips.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.440
 And then they found that student volunteers were unable to tell the difference between normal

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.440
 and high-tech chips.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.680
 Sorry, 3G chips and then they just have a very good internet.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.880
 Can I just say this is going way back, but you know you were talking about Andy Chips shrinking

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.880
 in size.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:26.880
 Yeah.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.880
 Did you see who wrote that article?

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.880
 I think that was in the telegraph, wasn't it?

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.880
 I didn't see who wrote the article.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.560
 Well, it was a guy called James Crisp.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.560
 Wow.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.560
 Wow.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.560
 Just thought worth mentioning.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.880
 And then, in the research for this, the next thing I researched was about the first

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:43.280
 crisp recipe, and this was actually in the early 19th century, and it was in a book called

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.320
 The Cooks Oracle, and it basically told readers to like peel potatoes, cut them into shavings,

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.640
 round and round, and then dry them with a cloth and fry them in lard or dripping, so

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.960
 for a first chip.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.480
 And that was by Dr. William Kitchener.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.480
 Wow.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.480
 Oh.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.480
 Oh.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.480
 Big day of nominative determinism.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:00.480
 Yeah.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.480
 That's good.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.480
 I've found out about a man called Eric Rim.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.480
 What was he responsible for?

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:10.480
 I don't want to know what he was doing.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:16.920
 He is a very distinguished nutritionist, but he, I think, so the US agriculture department

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:23.800
 lists a serving of French fries as 12 to 15 fries, which is very small, obviously.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:28.040
 And he prompted this huge controversy online because he was responding to this, and he was

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.280
 just saying, yeah, portions are massively bigger than they were in the 50s.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:34.680
 And he said, I think it would be nice if your meal came with a side salad and six french

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.680
 fries.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.680
 Six.

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.080
 Well, a lot of people said, I don't want six french fries.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.080
 I want more.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.080
 Which is fair.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.080
 That's not even a handful.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.080
 It's not even a handful.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.880
 No, depending on your hands, but no.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.800
 I mean, I have no more human side shots.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:54.240
 He also advised, so he'd prompted that controversy, which is one grenade into the conversation.

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:59.080
 He also said, Dynas should ask, how often a restaurant changes its oil?

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.400
 Because if you repeatedly heat and then cool and then reheat the oil, that can create

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.520
 very unhealthy fatty acids in it.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.520
 Oh, really?

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:13.320
 So, next time you go to McDonald's or Burger King, I'll ask, excuse me, how long ago did you

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:18.400
 last change the oil?

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.880
 You can, in McDonald's, confirm by McDonald's stuff, ask always for fresh chips, by the way,

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.560
 because apparently there was some rumour that the only way to get, like, you know, when

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:31.240
 they've got loads of chips lined up, and they just give them out, sometimes they're a bit cold.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.400
 And there was a rumour that you had to ask for unsalted chips, and that was the only way

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.320
 to induce them to make a fresh batch, because they all had salt.

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:41.080
 Apparently, you can just go and say, I'd like some freshly cooked chips, and they will just

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.080
 do a new say.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:47.640
 I'd like you to change the oil, and they'll make these chips.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.640
 You can try.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:54.400
 Ketchup is banned in French schools on any food stuff, apart from chips.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:59.360
 Yeah, there's more of a guideline than a ban, but it's basically, if you're a French school

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:05.640
 person, a school child, then you basically can't have ketchup, because I know I know you

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.120
 will have ketchup on literally anything.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.640
 Yeah, you've got to have ketchup on anything.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.920
 But only on French Fies, they're allowed it.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:11.920
 Wow.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:17.920
 Sorry, France, no more holidays to you, and it's to protect traditional galic cuisine.

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.760
 That's very French.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.760
 It is.

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:26.920
 And just to clarify, I don't holiday in French preps schools.

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:29.320
 But do you know why ketchup is so delicious?

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.800
 I assume because of the large number of unhealthy ingredients.

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:39.840
 It can deliver sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami, so all the tastes all at once.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.840
 Wow.

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:44.040
 Basically, lots of sugar, lots of sour stuff.

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.040
 Nice.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:49.640
 So you would have thought that might be too much, but if you put five different foods

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.940
 in your mouth, all at once, sometimes they don't go together, but that it just works and

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:54.940
 ketchup isn't it?

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:55.940
 Just works.

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:56.940
 Great.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:00.280
 You need to stop shoving all that food in your mouth.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:05.180
 I have just a very, just to me, this was very interesting, it's to do with Sainsbury's, which

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.760
 has fact started off as.

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.480
 Can I just say I'm short of the supermarket, sell this kind of stuff as well?

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.680
 I just happen to see it in the Sainsbury's.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.680
 Oh, they're worse.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.680
 Supermarkets.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.680
 I'm alright.

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.200
 But no, just quite cool, Sainsbury's was founded less than a ten minute walk from where we are

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.520
 right now, recording this podcast, Drury Lane in London.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.520
 Wow, what's that?

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:28.200
 Yeah, that's where the very first shop was, by John James Sainsbury.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.600
 It was in 1869, so it's the 150th year this year.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:38.840
 And by the time he died in 1928, 128 shops were opened around the UK, and he was a total

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:43.920
 obsessive with his work and his last words were said to be, "Keep the shops well lit."

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.560
 He was thinking about it right to the last second.

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.560
 Wow.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:53.360
 His last words were, "Do you have a Sainsbury's card?"

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.760
 Okay, that's it.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:57.920
 That is all of our facts.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.320
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.520

 Or you can go to our website, no such thing as a fish.com.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.840
 You'll find many things up there from previous episodes to upcoming tour dates.

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.560
 There's a behind the scenes look at us on tour called Behind the Gills.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.560
 You can download.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:24.880
 We'll be back again next week.

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:25.880
 We'll see you then.

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:25.880
 Goodbye.
