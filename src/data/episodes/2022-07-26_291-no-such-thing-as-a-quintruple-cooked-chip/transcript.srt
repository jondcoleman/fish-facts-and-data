2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 I don't want to get hurt or what, I guess?

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,400
 *Bell*

00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:22,400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin,

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,000
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,200
 Starting with you, Chizinski.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:47,200
 My fact this week is that one of the women about to take part in the first all-female spacewalk has spent the last eight years hand-rearing a flock of geese.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
 Wow.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
 And not in preparation for this.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
 So that isn't part of the preparation.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:05,400
 It sounds like she's going to take the geese with her... Yeah, she's flying up on the flock of geese, which would almost work because they're geese, which are famous because they can fly higher than any other bird, so they're the bar-headed geese.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
 But not in space.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
 I think space would be pushing it even for them.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,600
 Yeah, so this is Jessica Mir, and she's due to do a spacewalk on October 21st, and she's going to do it with Christina Koch.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
 And it's going to be the first all-female spacewalk, and she hasn't always been an astronaut.

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,600
 She's a physiologist, and the reason she's going up into space is to look at how space affects people's bodies.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,600
 And in the past, she's only ever really looked at this in animals.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,600
 And so one of the things she looked at is the bar-headed goose, because it flies so high.

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,600
 And so she wanted to know how it can survive, for instance, in oxygen, which is a third as much as oxygen here at ground level.

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:46,600
 And so, yeah, she realised that the only way you can look at that and look at how their physiology responds to proper sort of Everest height level conditions.

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,600
 By putting them in a wind tunnel, and blasting them with wind, and reducing their oxygen levels, and putting masks on them and stuff.

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
 And all of that really freaks geese out.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 And so you can't really do that to a bunch of geese that you've just picked up.

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,600
 And so she realised, in order to study this, you'd have to rear geese from the egg, so that they trusted her.

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
 And so she did.

28
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
 And the pictures are amazing, aren't they?

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
 I've seen the picture.

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
 There was an article by Ed Young, right?

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
 Is that what you read this as well?

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:17,600
 And they have a picture of her with all of her little geese around her, and she just looks like mother goose kind of thing.

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
 I think they followed her around and everything, right?

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
 Yeah, it looks pretty fun, because they imprinted on her.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
 I think we've probably said before that there are a lot of birds, which if you're the first thing they see,

36
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
 and if you nurture them as a youth, then they think you're their mother.

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 Yeah.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,600
 And so they love her as you train them to fly by scootering along on her motorbike, scooter thing, and they all flew next to her.

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,600
 But, well, I'm sure you read this in the piece too, it's when they got separated, like a car came in the other direction,

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,600
 they'd freak out and fly off, and then they would just land somewhere, and they would search for anyone who looked like the lady they thought was their mother.

41
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,600
 So one of them just started following people in and out of a supermarket, just on the ground.

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 How similar do you think you'd have to look to this lady?

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 I think if you had brown hair, I think that would do it.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,600
 And one of them landed in a hockey field and started chasing players around the field, so that's all it's my brilliant.

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,600
 And yeah, they had to wear a backpack and goggles, didn't they?

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
 No, was it a mask?

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
 It was a little mask.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
 Yeah, tiny mask.

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
 Yeah, it doesn't look as comical as you might be imagining.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
 I sort of imagined Biggles or something, but it's tiny little goggles.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:28,600
 And yeah, and they would blow nitrogen into their face so they could see what it would be like with low oxygen conditions that they would otherwise be flying at.

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
 And even then they didn't all cooperate.

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,600
 So they're quite stubborn and fair enough, someone shoves you in a wind tunnel and takes away your air.

54
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,600
 Seven of them cooperated, seven out of 12.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
 So she did these experiments in the wind tunnel.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 Yeah.

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
 And what did she find?

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,600
 She basically found out that they are really well adapted to these strange conditions.

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 So first of all, they've got better hemoglobin than the rest of us.

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
 So their hemoglobin is just better at taking in oxygen.

61
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
 They've got much more densely packed blood vessels.

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
 They've got bigger lungs and they take deep breaths.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,600
 So if you see a goose flying as sort of panting, it's likely to be a barheaded goose.

64
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
 Wow.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,600
 So how did NASA find her and then decide to train her as an astronaut?

66
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
 Well, I read that she was an aquanauts before she was an astronaut.

67
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 Wow.

68
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,600
 She worked for NASA in the extreme environment missions operations for, which is known as Nemo.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:30,600
 And they went to the Antarctic and they studied the Emperor penguins and elephant seals to see how they deal with cold weather and deep diving and things like that.

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,600
 But she didn't, she didn't have to raise any elephant seals from the egg.

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
 I would love to see the penguins from the people around them around the Milky Way.

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
 That would be great.

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
 Yeah.

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
 She did dive with them a lot.

75
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
 So maybe she was a sort of mother figure.

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
 So we used adjusting chains that maybe it was a bit of a typo on NASA's part.

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,600
 They meant to type astronaut, they typed aquanauts, she felt too rude to say no and that was it.

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 I think you're absolutely right.

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,600
 So Spacewalks, the man who did the first ever Spacewalk, Alexei Leonov, he died very recently.

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 He died within the last fortnight or so.

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
 And he had a terrible time when he went into space.

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
 And specifically when he walked in space.

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,600
 So he just had to put a camera on the air log and record it with the camera on his chest and then not die.

84
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
 And that was all he had to do.

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
 You make it sound like it's not difficult.

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
 No, no, no, no, it's very difficult.

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
 But he even left that out the pool.

88
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,600
 But his body temperature went up and up because obviously you're in a space suit.

89
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,600
 And I think that sort of reflected the heat inwards rather than letting it radiate outwards.

90
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,600
 And it was so inflated, his space suit, that he couldn't even reach the camera on his chest.

91
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
 You know, he was just this sort of Michelin man floating around in space.

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
 And he was so big that he couldn't get back in the air log.

93
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
 And his hand slipped out of his gloves and his feet slipped out of his boots.

94
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
 So he was just inside this very big space suit.

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
 I know.

96
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
 It must be like Mr. Blobby.

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
 It was like Mr. Blobby in space basically.

98
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
 And so he had to deflate himself, didn't he?

99
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
 Yeah.

100
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
 He had to allow some of the pressure out.

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
 But as a result of that, he got the bends like you would if you were coming back from scuba diving.

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
 So that complicated things even more.

103
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
 Yeah, he said it was incredibly difficult to squeeze in, wasn't it?

104
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,600
 And you had to go sort of head first, which you weren't supposed to.

105
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,600
 And because the deflated, the losing the pressure meant that you...

106
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,600
 I'm not sure it was exactly the bends, but it's like it involves sucking the oxygen out of his suit.

107
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,600
 So he was basically risking suffocating himself for the sake of trying to get back in.

108
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
 Otherwise, he would have died, of course.

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
 Otherwise, he would have died, I suppose.

110
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
 Yeah, it's really, you've got to do it.

111
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
 But also, he couldn't say anything.

112
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
 He couldn't say this is going to disaster's to be wrong,

113
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
 because he knew that other nations on Earth were listening in.

114
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
 Yeah.

115
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
 So...

116
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
 Oh, you're kidding.

117
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
 Yeah, so he didn't say anything.

118
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
 Everything's great.

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
 Yeah.

120
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
 This is awesome.

121
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
 I'm just going to stay up for a few more minutes.

122
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
 I love it so much.

123
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,600
 And then, when he came back to Earth, he landed 2,000 kilometers away from where he should have been.

124
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 And he had to kind of make his way back.

125
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
 And the Russian government said that he was on holiday.

126
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
 Yeah.

127
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,600
 But I actually saw a movie about this whole thing called "Spacewalker" is in Russian.

128
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
 But I think you can get it in English with subtitles.

129
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
 And I watched it.

130
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 I think on the south bank, and Leonov was sat in front of us.

131
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
 No.

132
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
 Yeah.

133
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
 And he was at the same screening as us, and they did a Q&A afterwards.

134
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,600
 And they said that when they did the premiere in Moscow, there were two women sat next to him.

135
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
 And one of them was saying, "Do you think he's going to make it?

136
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
 They will whisper into each other.

137
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
 Do you think he's going to make it?

138
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
 Do you think he's going to make it alive?"

139
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
 And the other one went, "Well, I think so.

140
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
 He sat right on it."

141
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
 But it's an amazing movie.

142
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
 It's so tense.

143
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
 That's incredible.

144
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,600
 That apparently was one of the feedback things that we're given from an audience member

145
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
 who saw a premiere of Apollo 13.

146
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
 You know how they do test screenings.

147
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
 One of the things was classic Hollywood endings.

148
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,600
 They survived this improbable trip at the end as if that would really happen in real life.

149
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
 That's hilarious.

150
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,600
 Did they do the bit in the film where they apparently dropped a cauldron down to them?

151
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,600
 So they were in the deep snow in the Urals.

152
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 Hellish was placed to accidentally land, and they'd waited three days.

153
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,600
 And then when the rescue was arrived apparently because they were very cold,

154
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,600
 they dropped a huge cauldron of boiling water from a helicopter down to the snow for them.

155
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
 So they could climb in and warm up.

156
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
 How fun would that be?

157
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
 I guess so.

158
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
 I guess it would be fun.

159
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
 It doesn't sound fun climbing into a cauldron of boiling water.

160
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
 No, no.

161
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
 They're boiling.

162
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
 It wasn't, sorry, it cooled down on the descent.

163
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
 Did they play sort of witchy noises around the cauldron as they lowered it?

164
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
 Yeah.

165
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,600
 But it was also, the place they landed was a wolf and bear riddled forest apparently.

166
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
 And it was also bear.

167
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,600
 It was mating season, so all of the bear were particularly aggressive.

168
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,600
 So the little hybrid bearly enough children out there in the area.

169
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
 We're dropping a load of fur from the helicopter.

170
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
 Just put the fur on.

171
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
 You'll be fine.

172
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,600
 Apparently it was because of this that I read this fact ages ago,

173
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,600
 the astronauts used to be given a gun because if they landed in enemy territory or somewhere dangerous.

174
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
 But I mean, it's a short-term solution to a problem.

175
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,600
 It creates more problems than it calls if you have an astronaut landing and then trying to shoot his way out of America or whatever.

176
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 It's not for people landing in America.

177
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,600
 Sorry, it's stopped bears from shagging you.

178
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,600
 Linov's survived and he made it into...

179
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
 I know, he was at the cinema.

180
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
 But he was in another movie as well.

181
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
 I see.

182
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
 He was in 2001 a space Odyssey.

183
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,600
 His breathing, the recordings of his breathing were used by Kubrick in that film.

184
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
 It was cool.

185
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
 Really?

186
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
 He was quite a creative chap, wasn't he?

187
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
 He was an artist.

188
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
 I've seen the exhibition of his work as well in Moscow.

189
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
 Really?

190
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
 Was it good?

191
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
 Yeah, really good.

192
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 He does predictably mostly do pictures of space.

193
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
 I guess you would have seen it.

194
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
 If he'd been right out there.

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
 If these things have been painted by someone else, I might not have enjoyed it quite as much.

196
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
 In Russia, he's so famous.

197
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
 Or he was so famous.

198
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,600
 Only Gagarin would be more famous in space terms.

199
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
 He insisted on bringing up pencil and paper, didn't he?

200
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
 In his first space trip.

201
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,600
 So he drew the first pictures in space and drew portraits of his fellow astronauts and drew the first of sunrise in space.

202
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,600
 And he tied together all his pencils to make sure they didn't float around and get lost.

203
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 That's so cool.

204
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
 That's very clever.

205
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
 Cool guy.

206
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,600
 Did he tie them together in a bundle or did he tie them together end to end?

207
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
 So he had a sort of train of pencils.

208
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
 I think it was a train.

209
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
 I thought it was a train.

210
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,600
 Yeah, because if you did them in one bundle, you won't be able to draw anything because you just have all the points at the same place.

211
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
 You draw ten things at the same time.

212
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 Yeah, but they don't have the same thing.

213
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 Yeah.

214
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:32,600
 Just on why spacewalking is so exhausting is partly because...

215
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,600
 So it's frequently just home improvement is what they're doing on the ISS these days.

216
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
 They're just adjusting things and fitting new things.

217
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,600
 But every time you turn a spanner, for example, on the outside of the ISS, your body turns the opposite direction.

218
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
 Because of the lack of a thing.

219
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,600
 So it's really knackering just to hold your whole self in space with one bit of you while you're turning a spanner with the other bit.

220
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
 That's probably we don't have down here.

221
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,600
 Well, the other problem is, of course, is that you're going around the planet every 90 minutes.

222
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
 So he did a five hour plus spacewalk.

223
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
 And that's one of the other things.

224
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
 You've got the sun directly on you for half the time.

225
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,600
 And then you're back into ice cold of the universe for the other half.

226
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
 And so that's where the sweat.

227
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 And then you go into absolute shivering.

228
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
 Yeah.

229
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
 Well, that's according to Scott Kelly, the astronaut.

230
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,600
 I read once, oh gosh, I can't even remember who it is or hardly anything about it.

231
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
 But there was a guy I think doing a spacewalk.

232
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,600
 And then like a flap of his space suit kind of came off.

233
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
 But it didn't expose his body, but exposed some part.

234
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
 There wasn't supposed to be exposed.

235
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
 And he got the worst sunburn.

236
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
 Like a massive triangle of sunburn on his back.

237
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
 No.

238
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
 I think so.

239
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
 It's so vague that memory.

240
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
 But what an amazing tan marker.

241
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
 Yeah.

242
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
 You try and preserve that.

243
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,600
 Just back to me, the astronaut, not the space station, who was rearing the geese.

244
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
 Who's at the top of this fact.

245
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,600
 She's not the only astronaut who's gone to space with the help of birds to get her there.

246
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,600
 Peggy Whitson, who is by all accounts, the most experienced astronaut today.

247
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
 She was the head of the ISS.

248
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,600
 She spent 665 days in space and total.

249
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
 That's enough to go around Mars and back hypothetically.

250
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
 She made that trip with the time she was there.

251
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,600
 And she got there because she only got a pilot license when she sold chickens that she was raising for $2 each.

252
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,600
 That eventually built up enough money for her to get her pilot's license,

253
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
 which led her to becoming an astronaut.

254
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,600
 Is it true that what was the reason behind her not being able to do the spacewalk in the first place?

255
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
 Oh yeah, that was earlier on this year.

256
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
 Yeah, that wasn't Jessica mid, but it was the person she's spacewalking with, Kristina Koch.

257
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 And this is in our book.

258
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
 Probably a friend of book this year.

259
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
 Yeah, is it called the Book of the Year 2019?

260
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
 That's what it's called.

261
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,600
 Yeah, available in all good bookshops from a couple of weeks time.

262
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
 And so this is news from our book from this year.

263
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
 The first all-female spacewalk was supposed to happen quite a few months ago.

264
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,600
 And it had to be cancelled because they didn't have, NASA didn't have a space suit that fitted.

265
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 And this was Anne McClaim was the other astronaut who was supposed to do it with Kristina Koch.

266
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,600
 And it turned out when it came to the day, she trained in large and medium spacesuits.

267
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
 But she realized she didn't feel comfortable in the large one.

268
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
 And all Kristina was hogging the medium one.

269
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
 So Anne said, all right, we'll let her man do it.

270
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
 And that killed that for a few months and that was happening.

271
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
 And is it because your body changes?

272
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
 I think her at this.

273
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
 So your body kind of changes when you're in space.

274
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
 And so you can never quite tell whether you'll fit into something until you get up there.

275
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
 Wow.

276
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 Yeah.

277
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
 And so she had done a spacewalk in a medium one exactly.

278
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 So she knew that at least that would work.

279
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
 But do you get smaller in space?

280
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
 Oh no, she just didn't have access to a medium suit.

281
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
 You don't drink in space.

282
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
 You just further away.

283
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 You get taller in space.

284
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
 Yeah.

285
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 Because the gravity's not pulling you down to your feet all the time.

286
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
 Yeah.

287
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
 I didn't realize it was only two women doing a spacewalk.

288
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
 And that's obviously that is all female.

289
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
 But when I read all female spacewalk.

290
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
 You got that every one of them.

291
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,600
 I just can't imagine like five or so, like roughly the same as girls allowed.

292
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,600
 That's seen in endgame when all the girl superheroes come in that slightly.

293
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,600
 Because you wouldn't say if you had like two singers like Pepsi and Shirley.

294
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
 You wouldn't say they were an all-girl group.

295
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
 Really.

296
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
 You would say girls allowed you an all-girl group.

297
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
 Definitely.

298
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 So what's the minimum number of all for anything?

299
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
 What about Sugar Babes?

300
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
 Would you say they're an all-girl group?

301
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
 I actually would.

302
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 Yes.

303
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
 I think three.

304
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
 I think three.

305
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 Thing is we're not calling it.

306
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
 Can I just clarify an all-girl spacewalk?

307
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
 It's an all-female spacewalk, guys.

308
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
 I think it should be called a both-female spacewalk.

309
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,600
 It's the only both-female spacewalk.

310
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
 I don't know if it's the same ring.

311
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,600
 OK, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

312
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,600
 My fact is that the Netherlands has a restaurant where if you move tables,

313
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,600
 there is a chance you'll end up in Belgium.

314
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,600
 So this is a place called Baal.

315
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 And I'm sure I'm pronouncing it correctly, so don't write in.

316
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
 And it's between the Netherlands and Belgium.

317
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,600
 The town is basically in the Netherlands, but there are lots of enclaves,

318
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,600
 which is a patch of land inside another country.

319
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,600
 And those are Belgian enclaves inside the town.

320
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 And some of these borders pass through living rooms, for example,

321
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
 or restaurants.

322
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
 And the laws are observed there.

323
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,600
 So there was a time when the licensing hours

324
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,600
 meant that you had to stop drinking in one country, but not in another one.

325
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
 And so everyone would have to get up from their tables at some point in the evening.

326
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,600
 If they wanted to keep drinking and then move across to the country where you could keep drinking.

327
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,600
 It used to be that the legal drinking age, I don't know if it still is,

328
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
 it was 16 in Belgium and 18 in the Netherlands.

329
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
 That's great.

330
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
 So would you say, can I use my D?

331
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
 Can I show you my ID over there?

332
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,600
 I've actually been to this town.

333
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
 Have you?

334
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
 Yeah, Baal Hurtog and Baal Nassau.

335
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,600
 I went just because I'd heard about it.

336
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
 I knew you would have heard about it.

337
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,600
 Basically, I went on a holiday with my ex around Belgium and the Netherlands and dragged her to this town.

338
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
 She was not impressed by it, but I was really impressed.

339
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 So I did read that there's not really much there.

340
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
 There is not.

341
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
 There really isn't.

342
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,600
 You get off the train and you wander around and you look at all the bothers and stuff.

343
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,600
 And I had a wandering around looking for pornography shops and fireworks shops.

344
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
 Oh, wow.

345
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
 That's what I do when I'm on the holiday.

346
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 Are they separate shops or do they sell both things?

347
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:32,600
 No, so what I read before I went here is that pornography is more legal in the Netherlands and fireworks are more legal in Belgium.

348
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,600
 And so they're in separate parts of this town.

349
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
 But when I went there, I actually couldn't find either.

350
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
 Again, still more clues to the end of this relationship.

351
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 Did you see there's one house where so a lot of the border doesn't affect massively houses because the border will go halfway through the house.

352
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
 But there's one with a door where the border goes right down the middle of the door.

353
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,600
 So that's very cool because what they have on it is they couldn't work out which side which country it belonged to for an address.

354
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 So it actually has two doorbells either side of it.

355
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,600
 So you ring it if you want to be on the Belgian side and then you rate it.

356
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
 Yeah, and it's got two addresses.

357
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:13,600
 So on the ground they have these crosses which kind of show you where the border is rather than lines that kind of like crosses with a dot cross with a dot cross with a dot.

358
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,600
 And some of them go directly through the doorway.

359
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 And then also like all the houses have little flags on that are either Belgian flags or Netherlands flags so you can tell which country you're in.

360
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,600
 And you can walk down one street and you can cross through five borders in less than a minute.

361
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,600
 Although I couldn't tell with the house where it goes through the door.

362
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
 Because the way you normally decide where the house which country it's in is by the doorway.

363
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:43,600
 And often people or sometimes people on the border apparently have moved their doorway to be in a more tax-friendly country.

364
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 I couldn't tell which country this house counted as being in for tax purposes.

365
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,600
 So I'm kind of here to highlight some possible tax evasion.

366
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,600
 I think that it claims that it's in Belgium when the Netherlands guys come and vice versa.

367
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
 I'm sure you're right, such a cop.

368
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:06,600
 So if you are sitting at the table in the Belgian bit you're allowed to build a house within 300 metres of a pig farm

369
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,600
 which you're not allowed to do if you're sitting at a table in the Netherlands bit of the restaurant.

370
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,600
 Who builds a house in a restaurant?

371
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
 I think, come on Adi.

372
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
 You're taking the restaurant bit too far.

373
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
 If you're on the Belgian side then fine.

374
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
 And they have two phone systems and two police forces and two fire services.

375
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,600
 The fire service thing is really interesting. Did you read this?

376
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
 No.

377
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
 So the Belgian and Dutch fire brigades have different size hoses.

378
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
 They have different thickness.

379
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,600
 And so they had problems with the fire hydrants because the fire hydrants are different in the Netherlands than they are in Belgium.

380
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
 That's so funny.

381
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,600
 And so they appeal to the EU for money to kind of get all the hoses standardised and stuff like that.

382
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
 But they didn't do that.

383
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:58,600
 And in the end the fire departments had to invent these adapters that could take you from one hose pipe to one fire hydrant and vice versa.

384
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
 Amazing. That's so cool.

385
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
 Isn't it cool? That's really good.

386
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
 Just necessity as the mother of invention.

387
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
 Yeah.

388
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
 Okay.

389
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:13,600
 They applied to be, apparently both places applied to UNESCO to be a world heritage site because of their complex cartography.

390
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,600
 But I don't think they have won that because as you said James and you've been there there is nothing there.

391
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,600
 It was quite a few years ago when I was there but yeah it really was quite boring.

392
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
 One fun thing you could do there apparently.

393
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,600
 But I couldn't find if this is possible but the border goes through the middle of a road at one point.

394
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,600
 So if you're driving on one side and the speed limit in Belgium is different to the Netherlands, you can drive you know twice as fast.

395
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,600
 But as far as I can tell the numbers are the same.

396
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
 Yeah that would be a very different speed limit which is double.

397
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,600
 I mean the truth is that these two countries are very similar in many many ways.

398
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,600
 And they're in the EU which makes them even more similar.

399
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,600
 One of them should leave the EU and I think that would then make it quite exciting.

400
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,600
 I don't think we need any more excitement about borders and people leaving the EU.

401
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,600
 We've been talking about this place in Belgium and Netherlands where it's not really an issue.

402
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
 This place being there because the countries get along well.

403
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:13,600
 But there was a serious problem between India and Bangladesh which had 80% of the world's enclaves in it until a couple of years ago.

404
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,600
 And so I mean there were 106 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh and 92 Bangladeshi enclaves in India.

405
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 And multiple counter enclaves within them.

406
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,600
 So you'd have India in Bangladesh in India.

407
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,600
 And also it had the world's only counter counter enclave.

408
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,600
 So there was a bit of India inside a bit of Bangladesh inside a bit of India inside the whole of Bangladesh.

409
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,600
 So on this border between India and Bangladesh there's a town called Hili HILI and some houses lie in the border.

410
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,600
 So you can enter the front door in India and leave the back door in Bangladesh.

411
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
 Wow.

412
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,600
 And policeman Anna or police person Anna would be very interested because basically it's just place where people do a lot of smuggling.

413
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,600
 I would install myself inside that house and stop anyone from moving from the kitchen at all times.

414
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
 But I think it has been solved now because it was a serious problem.

415
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 And just for instance if you're in an Indian enclave in Bangladesh then you wouldn't be allowed to travel outside of your tiny sphere into Bangladesh without a visa or a passport.

416
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,600
 But to get a visa or a passport you have to go to India proper and you can't get to India without crossing through Bangladesh.

417
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 So people were just trapped there and it was a major issue and I think in 2015 they finally swapped all their land back.

418
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
 So this is getting ridiculous.

419
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,600
 We never explained why this place in the Netherlands and Belgium is how it is.

420
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:35,600
 And it's basically due to the lords of Brader and the juke of Brabant.

421
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
 Brabant?

422
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
 I think Brabant.

423
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
 Brabant sounds good.

424
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
 Yeah.

425
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,600
 And they basically just swaps land with each other over many many hundreds of years these two families.

426
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,600
 And that's why you've got two places.

427
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,600
 One's called Bal Hurtog and one's called Bal Nassau.

428
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
 And the Bal Hurtog comes from the Dutch word meaning duke.

429
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:01,600
 And the Nassau comes from the house of Nassau which was the aristocratic house which ruled Brader in that time.

430
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
 And they just swaps.

431
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,600
 Yeah they kind of just kept swapping things.

432
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,600
 People would run out of money and the other people would buy some of your land and then you would buy some of their land back and stuff like that.

433
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:19,600
 And eventually after the second World War no one could really work out anything but they found some old maps which said how it all fits it in.

434
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
 I think that's right.

435
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:34,600
 But I find it unfathomable that when we reach the age of visas and passports and technology and the EU they didn't say should we now disregard the pointless stupid wins of these weird Renaissance juts and do it like a normal person.

436
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
 It was the same in India.

437
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,600
 The reason it happened in India was because there were Maharajas who were just playing cards and chess and waging bits of land between them.

438
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:49,600
 Apparently it was obviously at the whim of local laws saying oh look I'll find you can have that bit of land if I can shag your wife or whatever.

439
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:56,600
 Well you could argue the modern day nationhood in a lot of the world is down to whims of juke and so on couldn't you basically.

440
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,600
 But it's just the tours it would imagine the harkens of the world not visiting places like this.

441
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
 They would hold in minutes.

442
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,600
 I hardly think there are millions of harkens like people going to these places.

443
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
 Yeah how round was it when you were there.

444
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
 I was just looking at some weird borders.

445
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
 Interesting border disputes or territorial disputes.

446
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,600
 And I didn't know about this place called beer towel which is it's a really big patch of land.

447
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
 So it's over 2000 kilometers squared.

448
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
 It's a patch of desert.

449
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:34,600
 It's between Egypt and Sudan and I believe it's the only place in the world which is not claimed by any country as in Egypt claims it belongs to Sudan.

450
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,600
 Sudan claims it belongs to Egypt and neither of them wants it.

451
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
 The unwanted son of geopolitics.

452
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
 Yeah it's poor little lump of desert.

453
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
 Is it just really crap?

454
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
 Really shit.

455
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
 How crap must it be to not want that territory though?

456
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:56,600
 Well it's because basically there were two there were two accords which drew up the territory and decided who it belonged to.

457
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,600
 And one of them decided that this place beer towel belonged to Egypt and another place called the Halaiib Triangle belonged to Sudan.

458
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,600
 And then the other accord said it was the other way round.

459
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
 And the Halaiib Triangle is great.

460
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
 It's on the coast.

461
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
 It's a nice patch of land.

462
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
 It's much bigger.

463
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
 So they both really want that.

464
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
 Okay.

465
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,600
 So if either of them claim the other place, they're sort of implicitly saying I don't want the nice triangle.

466
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
 So they can't.

467
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,600
 So if anyone wants it, it's going free.

468
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
 So it's not much there though.

469
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,600
 It's just, it's even less there than about that time.

470
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
 It's on James's next holiday destination.

471
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 I would go, I think you can't, I think you're not supposed to go there.

472
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,600
 I don't think there are, it doesn't sound like there are many fireworks or pornography shops though.

473
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
 So disappointing.

474
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
 Just one more thing about borders.

475
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,600
 In China, trains crossing from Mongolia at the town of Erlien, they have to wait.

476
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
 And the passengers all have to wait inside the train while the wheels are changed.

477
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
 Really?

478
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 Different gauges.

479
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
 Different gauges, the tracks in China and narrow.

480
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
 Classic, used to have that in Australia.

481
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
 Huge issue between the states of Australia.

482
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,600
 There was massive dispute between, I think it was South Australian, Victoria maybe, about the gauges.

483
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
 No one wants to give up their gauges.

484
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,600
 I can understand it in two different countries, but come on Australia, get your act together.

485
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
 Same country.

486
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
 Sort your shit out.

487
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,600
 My friend, I spoke to my friend who lives in China yesterday and she's just been to visit South Korea.

488
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,600
 And she went to the DMZ and she looks with a binoculars or a telescope over the border and saw,

489
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,600
 I think we've discussed before, the peace village, you know, the fake village.

490
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
 Oh yeah.

491
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,600
 So yeah, I think we've mentioned this.

492
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,600
 Well, she actually, again James, she did say it was really crap, but it sounds like you would probably enjoy it.

493
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
 That would not stop me out of it, honestly.

494
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
 I know.

495
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,600
 Are you spoken about the negotiation room, the North Korea South Korean negotiation room?

496
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 No.

497
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,600
 This is for where they meet to sort of just discuss along the border, but the room itself is along the border.

498
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,600
 So there's a table in there which is cut in two, which is one half belongs to the North and one to the South.

499
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
 Why do they feel they need to cut into it?

500
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,600
 I guess it's a symbolic, this is our table and this is your table.

501
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
 Does it have legs in the middle?

502
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
 Because otherwise, surely the table's just full of memory.

503
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,600
 It's a long table, so yeah, it must have enough legs either side.

504
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,600
 What if you drop your pencil and it rolls over into North Korea?

505
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,600
 That's why they always tie their pencil with a load of strength.

506
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,600
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

507
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,600
 My fact this week is that in order to stop drought, an Indian village married two frogs.

508
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,600
 Two months later, they had to be divorced because it would not stop raining.

509
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,600
 This is a thing that was done out there this year.

510
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:45,600
 This was in a place called Bhopal and they were divorced symbolically because the rain was just causing total destruction in the area.

511
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,600
 They obviously couldn't find the frogs that they needed because I believe they must have been left back into the wild.

512
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,600
 But they not have just found the one in the top part, the one in the valley.

513
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
 So they were divorced by proxy?

514
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
 Yes, yes.

515
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
 Wow, technically they're probably still married, I would say.

516
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
 Would you say?

517
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,600
 They don't know it though, they don't know they've been divorced.

518
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
 They don't even know their frogs.

519
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
 But they'll be out there living in sin.

520
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,600
 But this is a thing that's done a lot over in India.

521
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,600
 They have marriages of frogs for rain a lot and they really go to town with the whole process of setting up a wedding.

522
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,600
 So they send out invitation cards, they had custom clothes made wedding clothes for the frogs.

523
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,600
 You would have to make custom clothes because they don't sell them off the rack.

524
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,600
 Such a good plate.

525
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
 What they actually have to go through, it's not just they just take any old frogs.

526
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,600
 They actually have a procedure that has them inspected by the zoology departments that are local to them.

527
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,600
 And after the selection process, they bring them together to a hotel in this case that were read a story.

528
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
 They got married on a tricycle.

529
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,600
 And yeah, and then they all go out for celebrations afterwards.

530
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
 What do they do?

531
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,600
 Have you seen a picture of this supposed tricycle?

532
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
 No, no.

533
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
 Was it a custom made tricycle?

534
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,600
 I think it's human size tricycle.

535
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
 Really?

536
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
 I think they were taken to the venue on a tricycle.

537
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
 I don't think the ceremony took place on the tricycle.

538
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,600
 That's not good wedding inspo at all.

539
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,600
 I think if you're not old enough to write a proper bicycle, you're not old enough to get married personally.

540
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
 That's just my old marriage.

541
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
 Very harsh.

542
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
 I don't know.

543
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
 I think that's uncontroversial.

544
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,600
 So they got married to please Lord Indra, who is the Hindu god of reigns.

545
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,600
 And Indra was, he's kind of a weird god.

546
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,600
 So there was a goddess, a very beautiful goddess called Ahalia, which also means perfection.

547
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,600
 And she was married to another god called Gautama.

548
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,600
 But Indra really fancied her, really liked Ahalia.

549
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,600
 And so decided to disguise himself as Gautama to have sex with her.

550
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 And then, as always, happens he got found out.

551
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,600
 And so Gautama cursed him to be adorned.

552
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,600
 His body to be adorned with 1,000 vaginas.

553
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
 What?

554
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
 Wow.

555
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
 That was his curse.

556
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
 I didn't see that coming.

557
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
 I thought he was going to get turned into a frog.

558
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
 I thought the same thing.

559
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
 No, 1,000 vaginas.

560
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
 The very opposite got turned into a different animal.

561
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,600
 Because Gautama thought, OK, 1,000 vaginas, actually that is a bit much.

562
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,600
 You know, it was bad what he did, but 1,000 vaginas, that's a bit much.

563
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,600
 So he swapped the vaginas for eyes.

564
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,600
 So he was adorned with 1,000 eyes and he became...

565
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
 I would guess a peacock.

566
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
 Correct.

567
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,600
 And that's why peacocks have so many eyes on their tails, they used to be vaginas.

568
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
 Right.

569
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
 Really did they?

570
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
 But not functioning ones, more decorative vaginas.

571
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
 I suppose so.

572
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
 OK.

573
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,600
 Even if you had 1,000 functioning vaginas, it's hard to get through them.

574
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
 It would take you a long time to get through them all.

575
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
 It would be a need to get through them all.

576
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
 You try.

577
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
 You'd definitely say it's sort of that challenge.

578
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
 Oh, but then keeping trackers and nightmare.

579
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,600
 You'd have to have some sort of sticker system or some sort of...

580
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,600
 You're basically a colander at that stage.

581
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
 Blimey or Riley.

582
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,600
 We should say not everyone in India believes this frog stuff.

583
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,600
 It's hot comment on the times of India when they reported this story.

584
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,600
 Hot comment was stupidity has no limits as it's been proved by the people on the journalist covering the story.

585
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,600
 So I think even in India it is the thing where people go, "Oh, right, yeah, sure."

586
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
 Yeah, yeah.

587
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
 It's pretty rare.

588
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,600
 But it's definitely, you know, it's related to Hinduism.

589
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,600
 So it's apparently that God Vishnu once took the form of kind of an amphibian and sometimes a fish.

590
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
 But maybe that's also kind of sometimes a frog.

591
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
 And so that's where it comes from.

592
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,600
 So it could well be a symbolic thing rather than, you know, it's just like a prayer, really.

593
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,600
 And they do get decorated like you think the frog sometimes get a wedding ring or they get cloaks put on them.

594
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,600
 Or sometimes little little veils.

595
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,600
 And there was one person who remembered being taken to...

596
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,600
 It's custom made. All custom, assume custom made unless otherwise stasis.

597
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,600
 There was one girl who remembered when she was younger being taken to a massive frog wedding.

598
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,600
 Sorry, was that a wedding for a massive frog?

599
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
 Or was it a massive wedding for normal size fair?

600
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,600
 Actually, could they could use a normal shop bought veil for that one, right?

601
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
 It was one of the few, yep.

602
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
 It was, I didn't get the frog size.

603
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,600
 It was a frog wedding that was attended by about 70 people.

604
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,600
 And the frog's head is streaked with a million powder like women's heads are when they get married in Hinduism.

605
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,600
 So that it's called sindoor, that red powder that you smear over your partying.

606
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
 So the frogs get that.

607
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
 And, yeah, well, lipstick quite a lot.

608
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
 Put lipstick on a frog.

609
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
 Which is not a saying that you can't put lipstick on a frog.

610
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
 On a pig.

611
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
 Yeah, on a hog sometimes.

612
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,600
 Is the saying that you can put lipstick on a pig?

613
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,600
 No. Well, you can, but it doesn't make it look any better as what the point is.

614
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,600
 It's because there's another one about rolling a turd in glitter.

615
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
 Yeah.

616
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,600
 And you can, I mean, I would say you can do all these things.

617
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,600
 You can't put lipstick on a pig, but you can't make it drink.

618
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
 So it goes.

619
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,600
 And you can actually buy a thing that makes your poo glittery as well.

620
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
 Can you?

621
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,600
 Yeah, you eat it and it goes through your system and your poo comes out glittery.

622
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
 Gosh.

623
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
 Yeah.

624
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
 What a useful thing to buy.

625
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,600
 I actually was going to submit a fact for another week's podcast.

626
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,600
 But I'll just say it now, which is that a kidners have glittery poo.

627
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
 No.

628
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
 Yeah.

629
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,600
 They have sparkly poo and it's only because of the, what can you guess why?

630
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
 Well, it must be something they eat.

631
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
 Yep.

632
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
 They're Australian.

633
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
 A kidners, aren't they?

634
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
 Yep.

635
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,600
 So what is, is it like when the new year parties happen in Sydney, massive party, loads of glitter,

636
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
 eat it, shit it out.

637
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
 Very nice.

638
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
 It's very good theory.

639
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
 It's not that.

640
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
 Okay.

641
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
 Is there something, something luminescent or phosphorescent?

642
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
 Some, oh, choir flies.

643
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
 No, it's ants.

644
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,600
 It's ant exoskeletons.

645
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,600
 When they crunch them up in their bodies, they love eating ants, so they sparkle and they

646
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
 make a glittery poo.

647
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
 Oh, lovely.

648
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
 They're crazy.

649
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
 Beautiful.

650
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
 Yeah.

651
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
 That's great.

652
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,680
 Do you guys know that during the 90s, well, 1990, the Prime Minister of New Zealand appointed

653
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,680
 someone, the official wizard of New Zealand.

654
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,160
 So they had an official wizard and he's only retired a few years back.

655
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:14,360
 And the reason he's relevant to this is because he, quite famously in 1988, went and did a rain

656
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,920
 dance for a small town that had a drought called Y-Mate, that had a drought for six months.

657
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,720
 And he went there and he brought with him four buckets of water, a horn, an umbrella under

658
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,360
 which he had a little red demon, a large bass drum, his magic staff, and a mug of beer.

659
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,520
 And he performed a rain dance and it started to rental raining within two hours and made

660
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,400
 international news.

661
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
 And this was their official wizard.

662
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,800
 I mean, he's definitely checked the weather forecast, before deciding when to do this.

663
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,640
 Well, no, so six months and it was part of the festival and the festival was not going

664
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,240
 to be held, but actually it turned, because of the drought, they weren't going to have it

665
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,240
 in this farm.

666
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,840
 But they thought it's an actually a nice place for people to meet up.

667
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,040
 Let's have a fun little rain dance thing going on.

668
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,880
 The wizard rocks up, does his dance two hours later.

669
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
 Rain.

670
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
 It's amazing.

671
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
 Yeah.

672
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
 It's incredible.

673
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:10,600
 So for instance, this week, the Pope tweeted something about praying to the saints, but he

674
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
 put #saints.

675
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,160
 And when you do that on Twitter, sometimes it thinks you're talking about the American football

676
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
 team.

677
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,920
 So it puts a little symbol of the American football team, so he tweeted, "We should all

678
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
 pray for the saints."

679
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,640
 So that would be American football team, and sure enough, this week they won.

680
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
 Well, there you go.

681
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
 There you go.

682
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
 It must be related to this key we got.

683
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,440
 The Pope is the official wizard of lots of people, really, isn't he?

684
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,440
 Yeah, he is.

685
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,280
 Good luck getting ex-communicated for calling him the official wizard.

686
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,040
 Yeah, I think a lot of people are able to do that.

687
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,640
 I think in Nigeria, there's a particular problem because people charge for the services

688
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,520
 of being rainmaker and the clever trick is you do sort of check what the weather's going

689
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
 to do.

690
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
 Oh, it's sort of a bit loose.

691
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,480
 So if it does rain two hours later, maybe four, maybe a couple of days, you can claim

692
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
 it, can't you?

693
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
 Yeah.

694
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,440
 But I was reading, there was in the Journal of Iranian Studies, there was actually a list

695
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,760
 of stuff that individuals in Iran can do in different parts of Iran to bring on rain.

696
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,400
 There are a few things you can do.

697
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,880
 So rainmaking, individual ceremonies include sticking pieces of dough to the back of a sheep.

698
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,960
 If you've got those two things at hand, you talk about dough as in the thing you make bread

699
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,640
 from or a female, because that is quite disgusting.

700
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
 Harrowing.

701
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,760
 Don't cut a deer into small pieces.

702
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
 It's the bread.

703
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
 It's the bread stuff.

704
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
 Leave the deer alone.

705
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,240
 You can also steal the tripod of a widow.

706
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
 The tripod.

707
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
 Yeah.

708
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,680
 I think that might be a cooking thing rather than a photographic thing.

709
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
 Okay.

710
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,680
 I imagine.

711
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,320
 Or you can ride on a tree branch as on a horse.

712
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,200
 And actually, if that tree was a bit wet and you jump up and down on a tree branch, it does

713
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,480
 cause it to sort of rain under that tree, doesn't it?

714
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
 A little sharp.

715
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,280
 But then if your branch is wet, why are you doing it away?

716
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,280
 Should we finish?

717
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
 Yeah.

718
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,920
 I've just got one slightly interesting thing.

719
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,120
 There's been a mystery which is to do with sea snakes, which is how they live in, and

720
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,000
 it's particular species of the yellow belly sea snakes.

721
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,440
 It's a reptile that lives in the open sea.

722
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,280
 So it needs fresh water, but it's living in salty sea.

723
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
 How does it do it?

724
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,240
 And there's a new study that's been done, and there's still in sort of trying to prove

725
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,760
 this theory entirely.

726
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,800
 But what they think is the way they get fresh water is that when it's heavy raining, there's

727
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,760
 a thin lens of the rain water that sits on top of the ocean.

728
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,840
 And that's where they go and rehydrate themselves.

729
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:33,600
 So they go to the surface, and they drink from this little sort of like having a top of lemonade

730
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:39,960
 on your beer kind of thing, ordering a longer top, but you don't want any of the beer.

731
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
 Exactly.

732
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
 Yeah.

733
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
 It sounds like me.

734
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
 And you're inside the beer.

735
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
 Do you think that a longer top?

736
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,720
 So you just drink the lemonade at the top, and then the rest of it's just a whole beer then.

737
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
 Wow.

738
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,200
 Because they put a ton of, yes, you have a herd of them.

739
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,160
 You have a full beer, and they don't fully fill it up.

740
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,280
 There's like a tiny little centimeter at the top that they fill with lemonade.

741
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,280
 Right.

742
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
 It takes the edge off a little bit.

743
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,280
 It takes the edge off.

744
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,240
 And famously beer is much denser than lemonade, because the lemonade just sits on top.

745
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,040
 Now, how does it sit there of taste wise the whole time?

746
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
 Answer me that.

747
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
 You can't.

748
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,040
 Okay.

749
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
 It is time.

750
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
 In fact, number three.

751
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
 Wait.

752
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
 Wait.

753
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,040
 We've done fact number three.

754
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
 We have done fact number three.

755
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
 Great.

756
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
 That's exactly it.

757
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
 I'm going to get you out of this.

758
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
 Damn it.

759
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
 Okay.

760
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
 Okay.

761
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,680
 It's time for our final fact of the show.

762
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,680
 And that is James.

763
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,680
 Okay.

764
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,040
 My fact this week is that Sainsbury's sells triple cooked chips, which you then have to cook.

765
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,280
 It's not really a fact.

766
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,760
 This is such a stupid fact.

767
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
 It's not really a fact.

768
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
 It's not really a fact.

769
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
 It's not really a fact.

770
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
 It's great.

771
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,840
 I was just, it's more of a sort of ad or spawn than a fact.

772
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,320
 It's more of the start of my stand-up stuff.

773
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,360
 So what it was was one of the other elves were doing the our series of QI at the moment.

774
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,880
 And one of the other elves, Matt Coward, posted a thing about re-fried beans about how re-fried

775
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,040
 beans aren't fried twice.

776
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,880
 And he said, why would you fry anything twice?

777
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,400
 And I was like, well, you do fried chips twice to cook them.

778
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,320
 And then someone said that Heston Blumentell tripled cooks his chips.

779
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,080
 And so I wanted to see if anyone quadrupled cooks their chips.

780
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,040
 And my Google just found this amazing fact.

781
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,120
 And so triple-cooked chips are a thing that was invented by Heston Blumentell in the

782
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
 90s.

783
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,800
 And you can buy them.

784
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,640
 So you put them in the oven and they cook.

785
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,160
 So they're quadrupled cooked chips.

786
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,560
 As far as I can see, there is no quintrupled cooked chips.

787
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,560
 I was astonished how you found this fact because the link you sent us to show that this

788
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,720
 fact was true was a Twitter question that someone called Sam put to Sainsbury's.

789
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,920
 And this was back in 2016, I think it was of 2017.

790
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,000
 It had one like.

791
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,080
 And they replied to him, yes, you have to then re-cook it.

792
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,960
 And I thought, Jesus, James is research levels.

793
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
 You're insane.

794
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
 He's trawling.

795
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,480
 I mean, everything on Twitter is just in case it happens.

796
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,080
 Yeah, did you hear his method?

797
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,040
 He typed quadrupled cooked chips into the internet.

798
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,920
 There aren't many results for that.

799
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,520
 I've given away all my tricks and things like that, thank you, I hear.

800
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
 But not actually.

801
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,560
 The Sunday Times said that Heston Blumentell inventing triple-cooked chips was arguably

802
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,680
 his most influential culinary invention ever.

803
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
 Wow.

804
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,680
 And it gave them a whole new lease of life, they say, chips that is.

805
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,320
 And the way that he does it is he kind of cooks them by simmering them in water.

806
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,880
 And then he gets rid of all the water inside them using a sous vide technique.

807
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,640
 I'm not sure exactly what that means, well, I know what sous vide means, but I don't know

808
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
 what the technique is.

809
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,240
 Or he does it by freezing them.

810
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,920
 And then he deep fries them.

811
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,880
 And then he calls them and then he deep fries them again at a really high temperature.

812
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,080
 So they get really crispy on the outside and really fluffy in the middle.

813
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
 Okay.

814
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,800
 And then you shove them in the oven, forget about them.

815
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,600
 And then they're just like charcoal.

816
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,800
 But they're all right, as long as you have a lot of ketchup with them.

817
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,800
 So I didn't know how chips, why chips are nice, basically, until research in this pack.

818
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,520
 Why are they nice?

819
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,040
 So it's exactly because of that.

820
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,760
 So it's when you deep fry chips.

821
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,920
 What happens is you've got, obviously, just potato junks, you know, that's all they

822
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,400
 are, originally, but then thanks to the magic of cooking.

823
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,040
 So when they touch the oil, all the moisture on their service immediately vaporizes.

824
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,120
 And that immediately forms this dry, hard layer on the outside.

825
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,840
 But the moisture inside that layer is trapped.

826
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,320
 And that's when it steams the flesh of the potato.

827
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,000
 And that's what makes it fluffy on the inside.

828
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,880
 And obviously it's crunchy on the outside because of the sort of hard oil layer.

829
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,840
 But you need that shelter form instantly.

830
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,760
 Otherwise, the moisture will seep out and then you'll have, you know, basically a dry

831
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,400
 all the way through stick to the disaster.

832
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,560
 And it's only batter and potato starch, which can form that instant, hard layer when you're

833
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
 cooking.

834
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
 Yeah.

835
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,560
 So that's why you don't need a battered chips.

836
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,800
 And that's why you do need to batter lots of other stuff is because batter the thing that forms

837
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,480
 that sealed layer and makes it cook on the inside as well as the outside.

838
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
 Might you have battered chip or are you fucking dumb?

839
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,520
 Yeah, I actually saw someone tweeting about batter chips this week.

840
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,520
 It was just completely not even part of this research.

841
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,080
 I just saw it and I just thought that is fit.

842
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,080
 Yeah.

843
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,800
 And that does make me worry about your Twitter habits, actually, you are going too deep.

844
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
 That's really interesting.

845
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,720
 And on the Heston thing, the way that he kind of gets rid of the water by freeze drying

846
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,120
 them, this is a technique that has been done by Peruvians for over a thousand years.

847
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,160
 So they invented freeze drying for potatoes.

848
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:38,400
 Because basically you live in Peru if you're at very high altitude or you have like droughts

849
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,520
 quite often because of El Nino, you're not always going to have potatoes all the time.

850
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,160
 And so they've had to find ways of keeping them when they had problems.

851
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,920
 And the way they did it was take them really, really high up mountains and they would freeze

852
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,240
 them and the water would come out of them and it meant that they wouldn't rot so quickly.

853
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
 Yeah.

854
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
 That is very interesting.

855
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,720
 And it really is amazing because it's like almost a millennium before we invented

856
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
 the technology.

857
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,400
 But the next thing they did, once they've frozen them and they've lost a lot of their

858
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,280
 moisture and then they trampled them underfoot.

859
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,800
 So sometimes they still do this and it's really, really successful.

860
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,080
 So you lay them out, lay all of your chips on the ground or your potatoes on the ground.

861
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,080
 They didn't have chips.

862
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,080
 Potatoes on the ground.

863
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,880
 And then as a family, you trample them or as a little village, you trample them all down

864
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,800
 and you squeeze all of the moisture out and once you've trampled them all, that moisture

865
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,320
 is so squeezed out that they'll last for years.

866
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,000
 So as James says, you know, you use a few potato corrupts, you're fine.

867
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,480
 You also don't want to eat them because your horrible uncle has just walked for over

868
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,480
 that big sweaty feet.

869
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,880
 Yeah, you only have them in times of real, real good.

870
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,880
 Yeah.

871
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,040
 Well, that's actually how cheesy chips are invented.

872
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,280
 I wonder then if they have, so obviously they have farms on the ground level, but would

873
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,320
 you then have farm plot as it were up on the mountains?

874
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
 And so they improve.

875
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
 Yeah.

876
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
 Yeah, you would.

877
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,640
 Actually, you would have people living at different altitudes.

878
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,960
 And they would come up with different varieties of potato that would grow in all these

879
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,960
 different altitudes.

880
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,680
 And that's why in Peru, I think they have something like 200 different types of potato

881
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
 in the country.

882
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,320
 More types of potato than anywhere else.

883
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,480
 And they invented the husbandry of it, not husbandry, they're growing of it.

884
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,520
 They invented how to grow potatoes really.

885
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
 Yeah, yeah.

886
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,680
 And it's because when you were in Peru, you would pay your tax in potatoes or a few other

887
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,280
 things, but they were all with crops.

888
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,360
 And so you needed a way that everyone would be able to grow potatoes because everyone

889
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,320
 needs to be able to pay their tax.

890
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:28,040
 And so their government would almost come up with ways of the people in high altitudes

891
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,840
 growing potatoes so that they'd be able to collect tax from them.

892
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,840
 Oh, really?

893
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:38,520
 But then the government just has loads of potatoes and then of course the government then gives

894
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,240
 the potatoes out to people and you know, people who can't grow potatoes get potatoes and

895
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,720
 they'd give them goods and services and got it.

896
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,720
 It's a currency.

897
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
 It's a potato currency.

898
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,720
 Yeah.

899
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,720
 It's amazing how many potatoes there are.

900
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,400
 As you say, and they're still finding them.

901
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,080
 Like James and I once met a potato hunter who's discovered new species that she was on

902
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,240
 the museum of curiosity, she works at the Natural History Museum, yeah, still finding new tomato

903
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,120
 and potato species all over the world, yeah.

904
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,120
 Cool.

905
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,640
 Why do we get stuck with same old Maris Piper or Tesco value new potatoes?

906
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,840
 Well, one reason is because the potatoes are trademarked by companies.

907
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:21,640
 So PepsiCo has been filing lawsuits against farmers in India who have been growing their special

908
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,520
 types of potato that they use for lay potato crisps.

909
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,520
 It's very controversial.

910
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,520
 I know.

911
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,960
 But I guess if you've put a load of research and development into, you know, genetically

912
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,720
 making a better potato, you know, how pro-capitalism you are, hey, I read the economist for

913
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,720
 a reason.

914
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,080
 No, it is, I mean, it's a real proper argument, isn't it?

915
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,400
 Like we wouldn't have those amazing potatoes that they can grow and feed so many people if

916
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,600
 they didn't know they were going to get money back for them.

917
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,600
 Yeah.

918
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,760
 Shouldn't there be a thing where I'm like you have with patents with medicine where you

919
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,520
 can have it for 10 years and then it's released to the world as...

920
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,520
 Yeah.

921
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
 That would be a good idea.

922
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
 It's a thought.

923
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,520
 Unleash the potatoes.

924
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,520
 Unleash.

925
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,520
 Unleash.

926
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,360
 I'm speaking of big capitalist pimos, McDonald's.

927
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
 Oh, yeah.

928
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,480
 It's fries in America, not vegetarian.

929
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,480
 Really?

930
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,480
 Yeah.

931
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,000
 So chips used to be often cooked in beef tallow, man, a lot of delicious, really good ones,

932
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 I guess, probably often are.

933
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,360
 And so McDonald's fries used to be cooked in beef tallow.

934
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,840
 And then there was this huge crusade, which I think we've mentioned before in the 1980s,

935
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:30,320
 which was anti-sap fat, so it was saying beef tallow is really bad for you because of the

936
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,320
 saturated fats.

937
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,320
 Yeah.

938
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,600
 So McDonald's started cooking them in vegetable oil, and they realised they tasted way worse.

939
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,920
 And so now, what they do is they coat it in beef flavouring before it gets sent off to

940
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,920
 the McDonald's to be cooked.

941
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
 Oh, yeah.

942
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,920
 So, yeah.

943
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,920
 And they don't.

944
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,920
 In America?

945
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,120
 And it was hard to confirm where else, definitely not in India, because McDonald's doesn't

946
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,120
 reach our meat in India, obviously.

947
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,480
 In the UK, on the McDonald's site, it does say that their chips are vegetarian.

948
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,480
 Right.

949
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,320
 But in America, definitely, you're coated in beef powder.

950
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,200
 But just another quick tip of something yummy to eat, when we're talking about battered

951
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
 chips before.

952
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,200
 Oh, yeah.

953
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,200
 I've had battered halloumi chips.

954
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,200
 Oh, yeah.

955
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,200
 Oh.

956
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,200
 Best thing I've had in years.

957
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
 Just a little tip there.

958
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,200
 Yeah.

959
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,200
 They are good.

960
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,200
 They're relatively confident.

961
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,200
 Yeah, they are quite honest.

962
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,200
 What?

963
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,000
 It's pretty standard hips to lunch.

964
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,320
 You know, I don't think there's a lot of food in North London elitist over here.

965
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,320
 Sorry.

966
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,520
 In 2018, last year, British chips got shorter by three centimetres.

967
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,520
 What's that?

968
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,520
 I know.

969
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,520
 There was a chip.

970
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,520
 There was a terrible potato crop.

971
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,000
 And they usually, potatoes are usually the size of a small brick, was in the article I read.

972
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 If you can imagine such a thing.

973
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,920
 But, obviously, if the bricks get smaller, the chips get smaller.

974
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,080
 And the potatoes that were harvested were smaller last year, because there's a terrible

975
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,080
 potato crop.

976
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:53,680
 And the telegraph interviewed Cedric Porter, who was the editor of World Potato Markets magazine.

977
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,680
 Yeah.

978
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:59,200
 And he said, "This was the hottest British summer since 1976, which any potato person

979
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,000
 will tell you was an almost mythical year."

980
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,040
 He said, "It is still talked about in potato circles."

981
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,040
 It is.

982
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,040
 Wow.

983
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,560
 You don't wish it had done is send our chips to space.

984
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,560
 Right?

985
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,560
 Yes.

986
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,560
 Make them taller.

987
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,800
 Oh, that's a great idea.

988
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,800
 Perfect.

989
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,080
 And actually, did you read this about how to make chips in space?

990
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,080
 No.

991
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:29,160
 And so, the European Space Agency used its centrifuge, and especially made deep fat fryer,

992
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,160
 and they made fries.

993
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,160
 Wow.

994
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,600
 And they found that the sweet spot for the best chips was about three times the earth's

995
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,520
 gravity, which is about the same as you would find on Jupiter.

996
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:45,520
 And if you cook chips there, you get the absolute perfect crispiness and fluffiness.

997
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,880
 But if you go anywhere over three times the earth's gravity, the fry begins to lose its

998
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,360
 structural integrity.

999
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,360
 Wow.

1000
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,720
 I can already see Heston looking up the next space flight to Jupiter.

1001
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:03,240
 It is amazing, because I read that too, and they built a rotating industrial fryer to

1002
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,160
 simulate up to 9G.

1003
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,160
 Wow.

1004
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:12,920
 But they did feed the students' normal chips, and then 3G chips.

1005
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,440
 And then they found that student volunteers were unable to tell the difference between normal

1006
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,440
 and high-tech chips.

1007
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,680
 Sorry, 3G chips and then they just have a very good internet.

1008
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,880
 Can I just say this is going way back, but you know you were talking about Andy Chips shrinking

1009
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,880
 in size.

1010
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,880
 Yeah.

1011
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,880
 Did you see who wrote that article?

1012
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,880
 I think that was in the telegraph, wasn't it?

1013
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,880
 I didn't see who wrote the article.

1014
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,560
 Well, it was a guy called James Crisp.

1015
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,560
 Wow.

1016
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,560
 Wow.

1017
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,560
 Just thought worth mentioning.

1018
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,880
 And then, in the research for this, the next thing I researched was about the first

1019
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:43,280
 crisp recipe, and this was actually in the early 19th century, and it was in a book called

1020
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,320
 The Cooks Oracle, and it basically told readers to like peel potatoes, cut them into shavings,

1021
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,640
 round and round, and then dry them with a cloth and fry them in lard or dripping, so

1022
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,960
 for a first chip.

1023
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,480
 And that was by Dr. William Kitchener.

1024
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,480
 Wow.

1025
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,480
 Oh.

1026
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,480
 Oh.

1027
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,480
 Big day of nominative determinism.

1028
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,480
 Yeah.

1029
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,480
 That's good.

1030
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,480
 I've found out about a man called Eric Rim.

1031
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
 What was he responsible for?

1032
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:10,480
 I don't want to know what he was doing.

1033
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,920
 He is a very distinguished nutritionist, but he, I think, so the US agriculture department

1034
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,800
 lists a serving of French fries as 12 to 15 fries, which is very small, obviously.

1035
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:28,040
 And he prompted this huge controversy online because he was responding to this, and he was

1036
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,280
 just saying, yeah, portions are massively bigger than they were in the 50s.

1037
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,680
 And he said, I think it would be nice if your meal came with a side salad and six french

1038
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,680
 fries.

1039
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,680
 Six.

1040
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,080
 Well, a lot of people said, I don't want six french fries.

1041
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,080
 I want more.

1042
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,080
 Which is fair.

1043
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,080
 That's not even a handful.

1044
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,080
 It's not even a handful.

1045
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,880
 No, depending on your hands, but no.

1046
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,800
 I mean, I have no more human side shots.

1047
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,240
 He also advised, so he'd prompted that controversy, which is one grenade into the conversation.

1048
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:59,080
 He also said, Dynas should ask, how often a restaurant changes its oil?

1049
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,400
 Because if you repeatedly heat and then cool and then reheat the oil, that can create

1050
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,520
 very unhealthy fatty acids in it.

1051
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,520
 Oh, really?

1052
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:13,320
 So, next time you go to McDonald's or Burger King, I'll ask, excuse me, how long ago did you

1053
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:18,400
 last change the oil?

1054
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,880
 You can, in McDonald's, confirm by McDonald's stuff, ask always for fresh chips, by the way,

1055
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,560
 because apparently there was some rumour that the only way to get, like, you know, when

1056
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,240
 they've got loads of chips lined up, and they just give them out, sometimes they're a bit cold.

1057
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,400
 And there was a rumour that you had to ask for unsalted chips, and that was the only way

1058
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,320
 to induce them to make a fresh batch, because they all had salt.

1059
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,080
 Apparently, you can just go and say, I'd like some freshly cooked chips, and they will just

1060
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,080
 do a new say.

1061
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:47,640
 I'd like you to change the oil, and they'll make these chips.

1062
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,640
 You can try.

1063
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,400
 Ketchup is banned in French schools on any food stuff, apart from chips.

1064
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,360
 Yeah, there's more of a guideline than a ban, but it's basically, if you're a French school

1065
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:05,640
 person, a school child, then you basically can't have ketchup, because I know I know you

1066
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,120
 will have ketchup on literally anything.

1067
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,640
 Yeah, you've got to have ketchup on anything.

1068
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,920
 But only on French Fies, they're allowed it.

1069
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,920
 Wow.

1070
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,920
 Sorry, France, no more holidays to you, and it's to protect traditional galic cuisine.

1071
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,760
 That's very French.

1072
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,760
 It is.

1073
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:26,920
 And just to clarify, I don't holiday in French preps schools.

1074
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,320
 But do you know why ketchup is so delicious?

1075
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,800
 I assume because of the large number of unhealthy ingredients.

1076
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:39,840
 It can deliver sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami, so all the tastes all at once.

1077
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,840
 Wow.

1078
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,040
 Basically, lots of sugar, lots of sour stuff.

1079
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,040
 Nice.

1080
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,640
 So you would have thought that might be too much, but if you put five different foods

1081
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,940
 in your mouth, all at once, sometimes they don't go together, but that it just works and

1082
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,940
 ketchup isn't it?

1083
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:55,940
 Just works.

1084
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,940
 Great.

1085
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,280
 You need to stop shoving all that food in your mouth.

1086
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:05,180
 I have just a very, just to me, this was very interesting, it's to do with Sainsbury's, which

1087
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,760
 has fact started off as.

1088
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,480
 Can I just say I'm short of the supermarket, sell this kind of stuff as well?

1089
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,680
 I just happen to see it in the Sainsbury's.

1090
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,680
 Oh, they're worse.

1091
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,680
 Supermarkets.

1092
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,680
 I'm alright.

1093
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,200
 But no, just quite cool, Sainsbury's was founded less than a ten minute walk from where we are

1094
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,520
 right now, recording this podcast, Drury Lane in London.

1095
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,520
 Wow, what's that?

1096
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,200
 Yeah, that's where the very first shop was, by John James Sainsbury.

1097
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,600
 It was in 1869, so it's the 150th year this year.

1098
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:38,840
 And by the time he died in 1928, 128 shops were opened around the UK, and he was a total

1099
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:43,920
 obsessive with his work and his last words were said to be, "Keep the shops well lit."

1100
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,560
 He was thinking about it right to the last second.

1101
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,560
 Wow.

1102
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:53,360
 His last words were, "Do you have a Sainsbury's card?"

1103
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,760
 Okay, that's it.

1104
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,920
 That is all of our facts.

1105
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,320
 Thank you so much for listening.

1106
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,520
