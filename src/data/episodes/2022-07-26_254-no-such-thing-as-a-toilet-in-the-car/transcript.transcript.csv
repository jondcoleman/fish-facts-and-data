00:00:04,00:00:08,"""Did you know what that woulda worked, isn't it?"""
00:00:08,00:00:16,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:16,00:00:19,to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:19,00:00:23,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and"
00:00:23,00:00:24,Anna Chazinski.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:28,00:00:33,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:33,00:00:36,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Chazinski."
00:00:36,00:00:41,My fact this week is that the rear-view mirror was invented so that racing drivers didn't
00:00:41,00:00:45,have to have a person sitting next to them in the car explaining what was going on behind
00:00:45,00:00:46,them.
00:00:46,00:00:52,"Yes, I think bizarrely I found this out because I saw a post for an insurance site or something,"
00:00:52,00:00:57,"but anyway, it was invented for the Indy 500 inaugural race in 1911, so the Indy 500 is"
00:00:57,00:00:59,that big race that happens in Indianapolis.
00:00:59,00:01:03,"1911, it was one by a guy called Ray Haroon."
00:01:03,00:01:07,And basically the reason he won it was that he realised that the cars always had two people
00:01:07,00:01:11,"in them, the driver, and then the person who had to do a number of things, one of which"
00:01:11,00:01:15,included turning round and saying if there were any cars behind them in dangerous positions
00:01:15,00:01:18,to make sure there wasn't a pile up or a big crash.
00:01:18,00:01:22,"And Ray thought that's a lot of extra weight, wonder if I can avoid that, and what he did"
00:01:22,00:01:26,"was he got a mirror and placed it in the middle of his car, hanging in the middle of his car"
00:01:26,00:01:30,"on a pole, and then he won the race because he halved the weight in the car."
00:01:30,00:01:34,"He did win the race, although we're not 100% sure that he actually won the race."
00:01:34,00:01:38,"As in, he got given the prize, but the truth was that no one really knew how to count all"
00:01:38,00:01:45,"the laps or time things or anything like that, and there were loads of pit stops, so really"
00:01:45,00:01:47,no one actually knew who won the race.
00:01:47,00:01:48,How did they decide?
00:01:48,00:01:50,"They just went, I feel like it should be over now, next person to cross the line."
00:01:50,00:01:51,A little bit like that.
00:01:51,00:01:56,"There was a guy whose job it was to kind of putt who was in the lead, and they would change"
00:01:56,00:01:58,it every now and then.
00:01:58,00:02:01,"But the truth was that some people took two minutes to change a tire, some people took"
00:02:01,00:02:07,"them 15 minutes to change a tire, some cars would come out of the pit lane, and then back"
00:02:07,00:02:12,"up over the finishing line, and then go back over again so it added an extra, that really"
00:02:12,00:02:13,happened.
00:02:13,00:02:14,Oh my god.
00:02:14,00:02:16,That couldn't have been loud.
00:02:16,00:02:18,They didn't know what was going on at all.
00:02:18,00:02:21,They just didn't have the technology to work out times or anything like this.
00:02:21,00:02:25,It sounds like a cheat that you would do in Mario Kart.
00:02:25,00:02:28,"I remember doing that kind of thing in Diddy Kong racing, and you see how close you can loop"
00:02:28,00:02:31,around the finishing kind of post for it to count.
00:02:31,00:02:32,And it never does.
00:02:32,00:02:33,Never does.
00:02:33,00:02:34,So the technology there is more advanced than that.
00:02:34,00:02:38,"There was a guy called Mulford, who was pretty sure that he'd won, and he went across"
00:02:38,00:02:39,the finishing line.
00:02:39,00:02:43,And then what you always did was you did an insurance lap at the end just to make sure
00:02:43,00:02:47,"that you've done the right distance, because people might think, oh, you've done one"
00:02:47,00:02:48,not enough.
00:02:48,00:02:51,"And so he did his insurance lap, and then when he got to the end of the insurance"
00:02:51,00:02:55,"lap, he found that someone else had claimed the victory, which was Haroon, and Haroon was"
00:02:55,00:02:57,already being shared as the victor.
00:02:57,00:02:58,"And he's like, no way."
00:02:58,00:02:59,I finished like two minutes ago.
00:02:59,00:03:00,Wow.
00:03:00,00:03:04,I think that Haroon used to work as a chauffeur.
00:03:04,00:03:09,"And he apparently, I read one account that said, he got the idea for a review mirror in"
00:03:09,00:03:12,a car from a review mirror that he saw in a horse-drawn carriage.
00:03:12,00:03:13,That's what he said.
00:03:13,00:03:14,Certainly.
00:03:14,00:03:17,"Well, that makes sense, because pretty much everything in cars came from horse-drawn"
00:03:17,00:03:18,"carriages, didn't they?"
00:03:18,00:03:19,I guess so.
00:03:19,00:03:22,I think you have a horse-drawn carriage with mirrors.
00:03:22,00:03:26,"I was looking for a horse-drawn carriage mirrors, and I don't think they were really a thing."
00:03:26,00:03:30,The only reference I could find to advising there be mirrors in horse-drawn carriages were
00:03:30,00:03:33,saying there has to be a mirror in order that the lady in the carriage at some point
00:03:33,00:03:35,might want to check her makeup.
00:03:35,00:03:40,"Yeah, it seems like that was the real innovator that guy in the horse-drawn carriage that"
00:03:40,00:03:41,he saw.
00:03:41,00:03:42,Yeah.
00:03:42,00:03:47,"Just on horse-drawn carriages and how they sort of competed with cars, there was this"
00:03:47,00:03:52,early concept in 1899 when there was a point where cars and horse-drawn carriages were into
00:03:52,00:03:56,mingling and it was scaring farmers and it was particularly scaring horses.
00:03:56,00:04:01,"So a guy called Uriah Smith, and this was in Battle Creek, Michigan, invented this contraption"
00:04:01,00:04:07,"called the horsey horseless carriage, and you put a horse's head on the front of your car,"
00:04:07,00:04:11,"and it looks like you're just riding a horse, but you're actually driving your car."
00:04:11,00:04:13,"It's all sort of except that the horse doesn't have a back end, doesn't it?"
00:04:13,00:04:16,"Yeah, I guess if you were approaching a horse, it would be like, ""Oh yeah, this is"
00:04:16,00:04:17,"a horse."""
00:04:17,00:04:21,"It's like if the horse was entering the room and only its head had popped in, you might"
00:04:21,00:04:22,think it was a horse.
00:04:22,00:04:23,Yeah.
00:04:23,00:04:24,But then?
00:04:24,00:04:26,Is it like a pantomime if one guy doesn't turn up?
00:04:26,00:04:30,"It is like that, and it's quite frightening, because it's just up to the neck."
00:04:30,00:04:33,It looks like someone's stuffed and mounted a horse's head and stuck it on the front of
00:04:33,00:04:34,their car to our eyes.
00:04:34,00:04:35,Yeah.
00:04:35,00:04:38,"And the other thing was that they said, because I read a bit about it, they said that"
00:04:38,00:04:42,"I think the horse's head was full of petrol, because it was an extra fuel reserve in case"
00:04:42,00:04:47,"you ran it in the main tank. It is a good idea until you hit something, at which point it"
00:04:47,00:04:53,"becomes a real fire liability, because you just smash a big petrol tank into someone else."
00:04:53,00:04:54,Explosion.
00:04:54,00:04:55,Oh yeah.
00:04:55,00:04:56,"But they were so paranoid, weren't they?"
00:04:56,00:05:00,"I think we did a QI episode on this a few years ago, but there was that thing where various"
00:05:00,00:05:04,"rules were written in the highway code or equivalent in America, which said things like,"
00:05:04,00:05:08,"if you're driving a car and you think a horse is approaching about a mile away, you hear"
00:05:08,00:05:13,"a horse topping in approach, you have to carry with you a scene of the surrounding countryside"
00:05:13,00:05:18,which you stop your car and you throw the countryside scene over your car.
00:05:18,00:05:24,"That's so annoying, especially when it's just a guy with two coconuts walking past you."
00:05:24,00:05:27,I thought it was that you had to dismantle the car.
00:05:27,00:05:29,And sometimes you had to dismantle the car.
00:05:29,00:05:30,The whole car.
00:05:30,00:05:33,"Yeah, you just sort of had to take it apart and hide it by the hedge."
00:05:33,00:05:34,That was written down as well.
00:05:34,00:05:40,Now I remember researching this and I think there was a lot of exaggeration about so I could
00:05:40,00:05:43,never work out what they actually did and what was actually written as a joke in the highway
00:05:43,00:05:44,code.
00:05:44,00:05:47,And I don't think they ever actually fully produced the horsey horseless thing.
00:05:47,00:05:50,"It was, yeah, it was concept designed and patented, yeah."
00:05:50,00:05:51,Yeah.
00:05:51,00:05:54,"There have been some great car patents over the years though, I was looking at some of them."
00:05:54,00:06:00,"So one car invention that never really took off was a 1935, the dog sack, which is if you"
00:06:00,00:06:04,"don't want to keep your pet in your car because it gets hair everywhere, then it's a sack"
00:06:04,00:06:08,that clamps onto the running board of the car and then it hooks onto an open window and
00:06:08,00:06:11,you tie your dog up in it and you can carry it outside the car.
00:06:11,00:06:14,"That's good because dogs like to stick their head out of the window, don't they?"
00:06:14,00:06:15,Perfect.
00:06:15,00:06:16,They're just now the whole body's outside the window.
00:06:16,00:06:17,Yeah.
00:06:17,00:06:18,That's what they've always wanted.
00:06:18,00:06:19,Just put a dog in one of those.
00:06:19,00:06:20,It would probably stick its head in the window.
00:06:20,00:06:23,I think dogs just like to stick their head through windows.
00:06:23,00:06:24,That's my theory.
00:06:24,00:06:25,Yeah.
00:06:25,00:06:26,Right.
00:06:26,00:06:27,That's true.
00:06:27,00:06:29,Did you hear about the steering wheel of death?
00:06:29,00:06:30,No.
00:06:30,00:06:34,"This is a car innovation on a Cadillac, the 1954 Cadillac El Dorado."
00:06:34,00:06:39,"This is obviously really expensive cars, you know, they're very luxurious."
00:06:39,00:06:43,But the steering wheel of this Cadillac had a kind of bullet-shaped spike in the middle
00:06:43,00:06:44,of it.
00:06:44,00:06:45,Right.
00:06:45,00:06:49,"So imagine a really large bullet, the pointy end of the bullet, you know, at the front"
00:06:49,00:06:51,end as it were.
00:06:51,00:06:53,So that was just in the middle of the steering wheel.
00:06:53,00:06:57,So obviously that's quite dangerous in the event of a crash.
00:06:57,00:06:58,And that's how it got the nickname.
00:06:58,00:07:02,"And Sammy Davis, Jr., he had a crash in one of those cars and his face hit the wheel and"
00:07:02,00:07:04,he lost an eye as a result.
00:07:04,00:07:07,So do you explain why they had this spike in the steering wheel?
00:07:07,00:07:08,Eusthetics.
00:07:08,00:07:09,No way.
00:07:09,00:07:10,Designed.
00:07:10,00:07:11,It's not useful.
00:07:11,00:07:12,It wasn't useful for anything.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"It was, you know, when that was the era when cars had these fantastic cars."
00:07:14,00:07:18,"Oh, that was the era where there were spikes in the middle of every car, like an iron"
00:07:18,00:07:19,maiden.
00:07:19,00:07:20,You would drive around.
00:07:20,00:07:21,Boxes of TNT.
00:07:21,00:07:25,It's more rounded than a full-on spike.
00:07:25,00:07:26,Right.
00:07:26,00:07:27,It doesn't look like an extra spike.
00:07:27,00:07:28,But it does look like a big bullet.
00:07:28,00:07:31,The Sammy Davis Jr. lost his eye because of that.
00:07:31,00:07:32,Wow.
00:07:32,00:07:36,"Well, there was that idea that someone came up with, which was just a design idea."
00:07:36,00:07:40,It wasn't real of putting a massive spike in every steering wheel.
00:07:40,00:07:43,And the idea is that it would just make everyone drive really carefully.
00:07:43,00:07:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:44,00:07:45,The opposite of an airbag.
00:07:45,00:07:48,It's a real carrot or stick kind of a foot.
00:07:48,00:07:49,Yeah.
00:07:49,00:07:51,The Duke of Edinburgh has been impaled again.
00:07:51,00:07:52,Yeah.
00:07:52,00:07:55,Here's another Cadillac invention just very quickly that didn't work out.
00:07:55,00:07:59,They tried to put working toilets in the inside of their cars.
00:07:59,00:08:00,That was in 1947.
00:08:00,00:08:01,You can see photos of it.
00:08:01,00:08:02,It looks really incredible.
00:08:02,00:08:03,Great idea.
00:08:03,00:08:04,It was in the back seat.
00:08:04,00:08:05,Yeah.
00:08:05,00:08:08,And you would have what was a proper toilet in this photo.
00:08:08,00:08:11,But the problem was it just didn't make sense really to have it.
00:08:11,00:08:12,What?
00:08:12,00:08:13,Why not?
00:08:13,00:08:14,Why not?
00:08:14,00:08:16,"Because the amount of space that you'd need for the tank, for the flush, the smell was"
00:08:16,00:08:17,too great.
00:08:17,00:08:21,"There was a lot of splash back, apparently, in the testing and the smells."
00:08:21,00:08:22,Yeah.
00:08:22,00:08:23,These feel like problems we can overcome.
00:08:23,00:08:24,Yeah.
00:08:24,00:08:25,It looked so cool.
00:08:25,00:08:30,"And this splash bag, for instance, obviously don't have it be water-based, silly."
00:08:30,00:08:32,"Oh, just have it like a cat litter tray."
00:08:32,00:08:33,Exactly.
00:08:33,00:08:37,It makes handcastles if you don't need the loo.
00:08:37,00:08:38,It's multi-purpose.
00:08:38,00:08:42,"That's to think there are lots of rules, aren't there, about how fun you can make things"
00:08:42,00:08:43,on the road.
00:08:43,00:08:44,Like service stations.
00:08:44,00:08:45,Right.
00:08:45,00:08:46,There are rules.
00:08:46,00:08:49,"In fact, there are laws about what you're allowed to have at a service station, because"
00:08:49,00:08:54,"the road, the motorway network is so important for people for, you know, transport that you"
00:08:54,00:09:00,"can't have say, I don't know, a casino at a service station, because you can't have anything"
00:09:00,00:09:02,"there that would mean people went there, especially."
00:09:02,00:09:06,"It's interesting though, because every single service station does have slot machines in it."
00:09:06,00:09:07,Yeah.
00:09:07,00:09:08,Remember when we were on tour?
00:09:08,00:09:09,Literally every single one.
00:09:09,00:09:10,Yeah.
00:09:10,00:09:11,Casino was a very bad example.
00:09:11,00:09:12,"I don't know, kind of thing."
00:09:12,00:09:13,Brothels?
00:09:13,00:09:14,Brothels.
00:09:14,00:09:15,Brothels.
00:09:15,00:09:16,Brothels.
00:09:16,00:09:18,That's the only reason there are no problems.
00:09:18,00:09:19,Thanks to the MNAT.
00:09:19,00:09:26,"There has to be just, you know, refueling going to the toilet and the slot machine."
00:09:26,00:09:28,There's so much fun stuff on the British highway.
00:09:28,00:09:32,"Well, they very recently opened a weather spoons in one of them, didn't they?"
00:09:32,00:09:33,And that was a massive deal.
00:09:33,00:09:35,"And everyone thought it was a terrible idea, because you shouldn't have."
00:09:35,00:09:38,"Be able to sell our collar service stations, but they didn't do."
00:09:38,00:09:42,I went into a box that simulated a hurricane on one of the slots.
00:09:42,00:09:43,On one of our tour.
00:09:43,00:09:45,Did you make a special journey?
00:09:45,00:09:46,Would you make a special journey?
00:09:46,00:09:47,"No, we weren't."
00:09:47,00:09:48,"No, no, no, no."
00:09:48,00:09:49,It was just as off as very dangerous.
00:09:49,00:09:50,I do.
00:09:50,00:09:53,"But I've never heard of that being anywhere else, like a hurricane box."
00:09:53,00:09:54,"That's true, yeah."
00:09:54,00:09:55,So which services was it?
00:09:55,00:09:57,"It was when we were on tour, our last tour."
00:09:57,00:09:59,"Well, no, Dan, don't encourage it."
00:09:59,00:10:02,This whole point is you shouldn't make special journeys to a service station.
00:10:02,00:10:03,"No, I'm going."
00:10:03,00:10:04,I'm going.
00:10:04,00:10:08,"Because then I'm going to get drunk at the weather spoons, play a bit of slot machines."
00:10:08,00:10:09,Do the hurricane thing.
00:10:09,00:10:11,Go to the brothel and then try back.
00:10:11,00:10:12,Great news.
00:10:12,00:10:13,I got blown off of the services.
00:10:13,00:10:14,I'm done.
00:10:14,00:10:16,I did the hurricane box.
00:10:16,00:10:23,"Back to the Indy 500, would you mind?"
00:10:23,00:10:27,So one of the things with the Indy 500 winners is that they drink a cup of milk after the
00:10:27,00:10:28,race.
00:10:28,00:10:31,"And it's a tradition that was born in 1936, Lewis Mayer."
00:10:31,00:10:34,He finished and he asked for buttermilk after the race.
00:10:34,00:10:38,And it was a dairy executive who saw him drinking it in a picture.
00:10:38,00:10:40,"And they sort of, they must have approached them."
00:10:40,00:10:42,And that tradition was born.
00:10:42,00:10:46,"And so when you're going to race, they ask you what kind of milk would you like just so"
00:10:46,00:10:47,we can have it ready for you?
00:10:47,00:10:50,Does that mean like a full fat or half fat?
00:10:50,00:10:51,Exactly.
00:10:51,00:10:52,"And, uh, majorotively, it's full fat."
00:10:52,00:10:56,"They found, uh, they just released the latest, um, sort of preference."
00:10:56,00:10:57,I'm sorry.
00:10:57,00:10:58,I was kidding.
00:10:58,00:10:59,Why are you surprised by that?
00:10:59,00:11:01,I'm just like something's going to milk.
00:11:01,00:11:06,"And you thought, because you're such a great racing driver, you thought, oh, my buddies."
00:11:06,00:11:10,"Well, in this, in this hipster era, they must be having to stock way more milk than"
00:11:10,00:11:11,usual.
00:11:11,00:11:15,They'll be having almond and oats and lactose free.
00:11:15,00:11:20,"In 1913, the winner was Joule Gu, who was a French driver."
00:11:20,00:11:21,"He won by 13 minutes, actually."
00:11:21,00:11:24,"Um, but he drank champagne throughout the race."
00:11:24,00:11:28,"In fact, um, some people think he might have had as many as six bottles of champagne during"
00:11:28,00:11:29,the course of the race.
00:11:29,00:11:30,Wow.
00:11:30,00:11:31,Awesome.
00:11:31,00:11:35,He definitely had at least half a pint in his first pit stop.
00:11:35,00:11:36,And then he was drinking it throughout the race.
00:11:36,00:11:37,Wow.
00:11:37,00:11:41,"So he won the race, but he did lose his driving license."
00:11:41,00:11:45,You would really have benefited from the car with a toilet in the back.
00:11:45,00:11:46,"Yes, definitely."
00:11:46,00:11:51,"You can't climb into the back of the car, I'll probably be racing."
00:11:51,00:11:55,"The trophy for the Indy 500 for people who aren't familiar with it, which I wasn't really"
00:11:55,00:11:56,is ridiculous.
00:11:56,00:11:57,It's amazing.
00:11:57,00:11:58,It's revolting.
00:11:58,00:11:59,So it is.
00:11:59,00:12:00,I love it.
00:12:00,00:12:01,Dan loves it.
00:12:01,00:12:03,"It's, um, so it's five at all."
00:12:03,00:12:04,It's ridiculously large.
00:12:04,00:12:06,"Uh, it's all made of silver."
00:12:06,00:12:10,"And as soon as you win the race, you get your head sculpted onto it and attach."
00:12:10,00:12:14,"And then they ran out of space on it and in the 80s, I think so they had to add an extra"
00:12:14,00:12:16,level so they could get more heads on it.
00:12:16,00:12:17,So it's got all the old guys heads as well.
00:12:17,00:12:18,It's the old heads.
00:12:18,00:12:21,He's got a French guy looking a bit pissed.
00:12:21,00:12:22,Yeah.
00:12:22,00:12:28,Everyone else has got like that milk mustache that you get.
00:12:28,00:12:34,"Okay, it's time for fact number two."
00:12:34,00:12:35,And that is James.
00:12:35,00:12:41,"Okay, my fact this week is that a 2018 paper suggesting that people who have a surname,"
00:12:41,00:12:45,"which occurs towards the end of the alphabet, are more likely to end up academically and"
00:12:45,00:12:51,"professionally undistinguished, was co-authored by Professor Jeffrey Zachs."
00:12:51,00:12:56,I love co-author because he couldn't even individually alter his own.
00:12:56,00:12:59,"Well, he co-authored it with a guy whose name was Corley beginning with C."
00:12:59,00:13:00,Yeah.
00:13:00,00:13:01,Yeah.
00:13:01,00:13:02,He was the brains behind it.
00:13:02,00:13:03,Wasn't he?
00:13:03,00:13:05,"Jeffrey Zachs is quite cool, actually."
00:13:05,00:13:10,He's a University of Boulder psychologist and I listened to an interview with him on a radio
00:13:10,00:13:14,"show called Top of the Mind and they asked him, you know, is there reason you're doing this"
00:13:14,00:13:18,because obviously you had a bad time of it because of your name.
00:13:18,00:13:21,"And he said he was sensitized to the issue because of that, but actually it doesn't affect"
00:13:21,00:13:24,"him because according to their studies, it doesn't affect people who are distinguished"
00:13:24,00:13:25,in any other way.
00:13:25,00:13:31,So if you're kind of top of your class at school or bottom of your class or you look different
00:13:31,00:13:33,"or you're more attractive or less attractive, it doesn't really affect you."
00:13:33,00:13:38,"It only affects people who are right in the middle, but they found that actually it does affect"
00:13:38,00:13:39,them.
00:13:39,00:13:43,"It means it gives them less distinction at high school, less satisfaction at high school and"
00:13:43,00:13:46,lower educational attainment after they've left school.
00:13:46,00:13:49,"And until you're about middle aged, it affects you quite badly according to them."
00:13:49,00:13:50,What's the justification here?
00:13:50,00:13:51,Is it just about reading out the register?
00:13:51,00:13:52,No.
00:13:52,00:13:54,So there are a few different reasons.
00:13:54,00:13:59,"It's, so for instance, infant school, a lot of kids are putting alphabetical order."
00:13:59,00:14:03,"So the kids beginning with A near the front of the class, which means they get more attention."
00:14:03,00:14:06,They don't just tend to get asked more for things.
00:14:06,00:14:10,"So for not school, for instance, if your name is towards a start of the alphabet, you're"
00:14:10,00:14:12,less likely to give money to charity.
00:14:12,00:14:16,And that's because you get run up more because your name is at the front of the alphabet and
00:14:16,00:14:17,you get more annoyed by it.
00:14:17,00:14:20,And so you're less likely to give money.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Really?
00:14:21,00:14:24,"It's also like, when it's graduation and they're handing out diplomas, this is one of"
00:14:24,00:14:25,the things mentioned.
00:14:25,00:14:26,You start 8 a.m.
00:14:26,00:14:30,"It's all really exciting at the top, but by the time you get to Zuckerberg, you know,"
00:14:30,00:14:33,"yeah, and that's why he never made anything else out of it, right?"
00:14:33,00:14:35,"But when you get to the end, most people have left because they want to get the restaurants"
00:14:35,00:14:40,early and everyone who's applauding their arms are tired and stuff like that.
00:14:40,00:14:45,"And so, and I can understand if you're marking a big pile of exam papers, and Aaron J."
00:14:45,00:14:47,Aaronson makes a point.
00:14:47,00:14:50,"And then Sammy, Sammy makes up the same point."
00:14:50,00:14:54,"You think, I read this in Aaron J. Aaronson's article and that was hours ago."
00:14:54,00:14:55,"Yeah, exactly."
00:14:55,00:14:56,Exactly.
00:14:56,00:14:59,"So, and the teacher might say, okay, can someone read the report?"
00:14:59,00:15:01,"Aaron J. Aaronson, can you do it?"
00:15:01,00:15:04,"And then by the time Zuckerberg gets there, he just never gets asked."
00:15:04,00:15:07,"And so, you have less confidence in public speaking as well."
00:15:07,00:15:09,"So, this genuinely does seem to be a thing."
00:15:09,00:15:13,"Yeah, although I'm not sure about his way of, I'm not sure about Zach's way of combating"
00:15:13,00:15:14,it.
00:15:14,00:15:17,"One of the ways he says he combats it is that he is a professor, so we ask students."
00:15:17,00:15:22,"And he always calls the class register in reverse order, which seems to be, to just be recreating"
00:15:22,00:15:24,the problem for the opposite way around.
00:15:24,00:15:28,He suggests that people should maybe do something to distinguish themselves like
00:15:28,00:15:32,dress strangely on something that's one of the specific things he said.
00:15:32,00:15:35,"Like, just so that people notice you because it's the people who aren't noticed who struggle"
00:15:35,00:15:36,the most.
00:15:36,00:15:40,"And if you're later on in the alphabet, you're more likely not to be noticed if you're otherwise"
00:15:40,00:15:41,distinguished.
00:15:41,00:15:42,"Yes, that's right."
00:15:42,00:15:43,And it works the other way around.
00:15:43,00:15:47,"So, there's another study which is that authors whose surnames are ranked towards the front"
00:15:47,00:15:50,of the alphabet are more likely to be cited in scientific papers.
00:15:50,00:15:51,Oh.
00:15:51,00:15:57,And that was lead offered by a guy called Ass Nalt.
00:15:57,00:16:01,So he has obviously seen that he's been cited more often than others because he's an
00:16:01,00:16:02,A.
00:16:02,00:16:05,"And also he has the word 'ass' in his name, which I help."
00:16:05,00:16:09,"And for presidential candidates in America, that's another thing they think influences because"
00:16:09,00:16:13,that's in alphabetical order as well when you go in for doing that.
00:16:13,00:16:15,So you're more likely to go for someone at the top of it.
00:16:15,00:16:20,"Who's this George Washington guy who would have self-implaced, isn't he?"
00:16:20,00:16:21,I know.
00:16:21,00:16:22,Who came after him?
00:16:22,00:16:23,Adams.
00:16:23,00:16:24,Yeah.
00:16:24,00:16:29,"And George Washington only became president because he sees how, as he pulled us out, he"
00:16:29,00:16:32,would put himself in never-of-one a fair election.
00:16:32,00:16:33,"Yeah, okay."
00:16:33,00:16:37,There are definitely countries where it's law that on the ballot paper you have to mix it
00:16:37,00:16:38,"up, aren't there?"
00:16:38,00:16:42,Or you do half and half on ballot papers because people just tick an A because it's a lot
00:16:42,00:16:46,of effort when you go to the ballot box and you're in a hurry to get to work anyway.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"You just cross the first one you see, don't you?"
00:16:48,00:16:51,"One thing I think Zack's found, which is encouraging, is that by the time you're in"
00:16:51,00:16:55,"your mid-30s, the effect, lessons, to the point of disappearance."
00:16:55,00:16:57,Because you've been distinguished in some other way by then.
00:16:57,00:17:01,So people are judging you not on your name but on what you've done in life.
00:17:01,00:17:02,Yeah.
00:17:02,00:17:05,"Oh, I thought it was because you weren't having registered taking any more."
00:17:05,00:17:06,"Probably not, too."
00:17:06,00:17:07,Probably.
00:17:07,00:17:08,The time is thirty-five.
00:17:08,00:17:12,"The paper, just for anyone listening, is called Alphabetism, the effects of surname"
00:17:12,00:17:16,initial and the cost of being otherwise undistinguished.
00:17:16,00:17:20,And that paper has ninety-six citations and I counted them and there are seventy-seven
00:17:20,00:17:23,from A to M and only seventeen from N to Z.
00:17:23,00:17:24,Wow.
00:17:24,00:17:26,So they're compounding the problem.
00:17:26,00:17:27,Proof.
00:17:27,00:17:31,I find it so weird that Leonardo da Vinci doesn't have a surname.
00:17:31,00:17:32,Always true.
00:17:32,00:17:34,Always thought that was his surname.
00:17:34,00:17:37,"All Vinci, just for people who were like me who didn't know that."
00:17:37,00:17:38,Yeah.
00:17:38,00:17:41,"But what do you mean by ""doesn't have a surname"" because our surnames are like that as"
00:17:41,00:17:42,well.
00:17:42,00:17:43,"In the end, that does end up being your surname."
00:17:43,00:17:47,"So there was, for instance, in 2016, I think that someone compiled a dictionary of"
00:17:47,00:17:52,fifty thousand surnames from Britain that go all the way back to like the eleventh century
00:17:52,00:17:57,"and they found that about half of the most common ones were locative, which is basically"
00:17:57,00:17:59,that ones that say what place you're from.
00:17:59,00:18:03,"You know, so like less, if your surname is Leicester or if you're surnames and I can't"
00:18:03,00:18:06,think of like Jack London or Stafford.
00:18:06,00:18:07,Stafford.
00:18:07,00:18:08,Exactly.
00:18:08,00:18:09,So it's still the same kind of thing.
00:18:09,00:18:10,George Washington.
00:18:10,00:18:11,George Washington.
00:18:11,00:18:12,Yeah.
00:18:12,00:18:13,Yeah.
00:18:13,00:18:18,I don't know if any of your surnames have a mind will be kin will be family of I should
00:18:18,00:18:19,think.
00:18:19,00:18:20,It's Irish anyway.
00:18:20,00:18:21,Yes.
00:18:21,00:18:22,Of course.
00:18:22,00:18:23,Don't know about Murray.
00:18:23,00:18:27,"Murray, I read ages ago, it's both, there's claims for it in Scotland and Ireland, the"
00:18:27,00:18:28,battle out for what you know.
00:18:28,00:18:30,Murray is a place presumably in Scotland as well.
00:18:30,00:18:31,Moray.
00:18:31,00:18:32,Yeah.
00:18:32,00:18:33,Murray.
00:18:33,00:18:34,Moray Firth.
00:18:34,00:18:35,There's a moray eel.
00:18:35,00:18:36,Yeah.
00:18:36,00:18:37,Yeah.
00:18:37,00:18:39,"Well, I think there's an eel somewhere in my family tree."
00:18:39,00:18:40,Yeah.
00:18:40,00:18:43,Tishinsky means son of Tishinsky.
00:18:43,00:18:45,Tishinsky is like a bird.
00:18:45,00:18:46,The name is like a bird.
00:18:46,00:18:50,So some are descriptors and that's one of the most common types of name you have as well
00:18:50,00:18:51,when you go back.
00:18:51,00:18:52,Why are you looking at me?
00:18:52,00:18:53,I am like a bird.
00:18:53,00:18:54,I'm like a bird.
00:18:54,00:18:55,I'm like a bird.
00:18:55,00:18:56,That's right.
00:18:56,00:19:01,"Well, about a fifth of surnames in fact in our country are like that as in descriptors."
00:19:01,00:19:02,So like good fellow.
00:19:02,00:19:04,That's a nice descriptive one.
00:19:04,00:19:05,Yeah.
00:19:05,00:19:09,Short is either means that the person who had that nickname was really short or it often
00:19:09,00:19:11,meant that they were really tall.
00:19:11,00:19:12,So you never know.
00:19:12,00:19:15,"Because it was like the funny ironic thing, you know, and you're like, all right, sure."
00:19:15,00:19:16,"See, it was a tall guy."
00:19:16,00:19:17,There were quite a lot of those.
00:19:17,00:19:18,That's sick.
00:19:18,00:19:19,Does it?
00:19:19,00:19:23,Could it mean that whoever was called Godfellow was actually a bit of a twatter?
00:19:23,00:19:24,Yeah.
00:19:24,00:19:35,Whereas we're as poor Derek Twatt from one of the nicest and kindest families in the town.
00:19:35,00:19:38,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:19:38,00:19:40,And that is my fact.
00:19:40,00:19:45,My fact this week is that grocery bags used in Hollywood movies don't rustle.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:46,00:19:47,Why aren't we allowed them?
00:19:47,00:19:48,I know.
00:19:48,00:19:53,So this is something that I read on a website called proptrics.com.
00:19:53,00:19:56,This is the website of a man who invented these bags.
00:19:56,00:19:59,I'm about to tell you about Tim Schultz's name.
00:19:59,00:20:04,"And it's when on movie sets, you see people carrying any kind of bags."
00:20:04,00:20:07,"Especially when you're recording, that makes so much noise that they can't cancel out that"
00:20:07,00:20:08,it ruins scenes.
00:20:08,00:20:10,I have to constantly rerecord scenes.
00:20:10,00:20:14,And he was on the set of a TV show back in the day that starred Martin Lawrence called
00:20:14,00:20:15,Martin.
00:20:15,00:20:20,"And Martin, as he's coming into the room, gets his pants taken off by a doorframe that he"
00:20:20,00:20:21,gets caught on.
00:20:21,00:20:26,"So he has to exit wearing only a bag and it kept rustling or rather, that was the scene"
00:20:26,00:20:29,"and he thought, how are we going to do this without it causing so much noise that you're"
00:20:29,00:20:30,not going to hear the scene?
00:20:30,00:20:33,So he went away and invented a silent grocery bag.
00:20:33,00:20:34,Wow.
00:20:34,00:20:35,Yeah.
00:20:35,00:20:36,And it's used in tons of movies now.
00:20:36,00:20:37,And he's expanded his horizons.
00:20:37,00:20:39,It's not just grocery bags.
00:20:39,00:20:43,"He's got department store bags, bakery bags, lunch store bags, doggie bags."
00:20:43,00:20:47,He's done silent gift tissue and silent cellophane for wrapping flowers in.
00:20:47,00:20:48,Wow.
00:20:48,00:20:49,Which aren't completely silent.
00:20:49,00:20:50,You can hear them slightly.
00:20:50,00:20:52,Because it would be weird if someone was wrapping up present.
00:20:52,00:20:53,That was no sound effect.
00:20:53,00:20:54,Yeah.
00:20:54,00:20:55,You would believe it.
00:20:55,00:20:56,"Well, no, that's the point."
00:20:56,00:20:57,Exactly.
00:20:57,00:20:58,You added on post with Foley.
00:20:58,00:20:59,Yeah.
00:20:59,00:21:01,So how do you know what they're made of?
00:21:01,00:21:05,"Well, I've tried to find out, but I wonder if it's if I haven't dug hard enough or it's"
00:21:05,00:21:09,"an industry secret that he's holding onto, like the secrets of Coca-Cola mix."
00:21:09,00:21:11,"He could at least tell theatres, couldn't he?"
00:21:11,00:21:14,He could at least put them on boiled sweets in theatres because I think that's where that
00:21:14,00:21:18,causes the most problems is plus the plastic crackling thing.
00:21:18,00:21:23,There is a company called Silent Snacks that in 2016 launched a whole load of products
00:21:23,00:21:27,to have in cinemas and theatres which don't Russell or don't make any noise.
00:21:27,00:21:28,Wow.
00:21:28,00:21:29,Like what?
00:21:29,00:21:31,Ground popcorn.
00:21:31,00:21:37,"No, basically, instead of being like lumps of popcorn, it's just kind of popcorn dust."
00:21:37,00:21:38,Disgusting.
00:21:38,00:21:42,Cocoa butter balls.
00:21:42,00:21:46,"They kind of melt in your mouth rather than like, I guess, like heavenms at my crunch thing."
00:21:46,00:21:49,"And crisps, they've got silent crisps."
00:21:49,00:21:53,"Well, they're dehydrated past slices."
00:21:53,00:21:58,"Apparently they're just bendy enough to be pleasant, but not too crisp."
00:21:58,00:22:01,I don't think any level of bendiness in my crisp is pleasant.
00:22:01,00:22:02,No.
00:22:02,00:22:03,"No, I don't think you want a bending crystal."
00:22:03,00:22:06,"I think, if you hear the phrase, it's just bendy enough to be pleasant."
00:22:06,00:22:09,I thought dates were taking a banter.
00:22:09,00:22:12,They also invented an anti-gas grapefruit drink.
00:22:12,00:22:13,Anti-gas.
00:22:13,00:22:14,Anti-gas.
00:22:14,00:22:15,Anti-gas.
00:22:15,00:22:17,"Stop you burping and farting, yeah."
00:22:17,00:22:19,Is that a major problem in cinemas?
00:22:19,00:22:21,It is if you go with me.
00:22:21,00:22:22,Wow.
00:22:22,00:22:25,"Could you play the last ten minutes again, please?"
00:22:25,00:22:32,"So, on movie props, the same newspaper has been being read in movies for about 20 years."
00:22:32,00:22:36,There's this one newspaper that keeps cropping up in lots and lots of films.
00:22:36,00:22:38,It's been in no country for old men.
00:22:38,00:22:40,It's been in the Texas Chainsaw massacre.
00:22:40,00:22:42,It's been in desperate housewives.
00:22:42,00:22:44,"So when you see someone in a film reading a paper, do you know other headlamps?"
00:22:44,00:22:45,Can you remember that?
00:22:45,00:22:46,"No, I don't."
00:22:46,00:22:47,I didn't write it down.
00:22:47,00:22:50,Man lands on moon.
00:22:50,00:22:58,I'll just go one more thing on how to keep a set quiet in your filming.
00:22:58,00:23:02,"Lord of the Rings, when they were filming, they obviously had a ginormous crew and there"
00:23:02,00:23:07,were two people on that crew whose job it was to sit at the local airport that they were
00:23:07,00:23:11,closest to when they were filming and to call ahead when planes were taking off.
00:23:11,00:23:15,"So they knew to not film a scene because very soon, yeah, they would have the sound."
00:23:15,00:23:18,"So you didn't have the sound of error plays, you just had lots of sounds of mobile phones"
00:23:18,00:23:19,going off.
00:23:19,00:23:24,That's what Gandalf's pocket was buzzing.
00:23:24,00:23:29,"In Lord of the Rings, one of the props they had actually was a giant ring or a big ring"
00:23:29,00:23:30,anyway.
00:23:30,00:23:32,So they had to have quite a lot of rings.
00:23:32,00:23:37,"There's one ring to rule them all, et cetera, but there's actually a number of replicas."
00:23:37,00:23:42,Bringing another one of those one rings to rule them all.
00:23:42,00:23:46,"So it can fit different fingers because different people wear it, but then also they had"
00:23:46,00:23:50,a really big one about the size of a football it looks like in the photos.
00:23:50,00:23:54,"And that's for when you do wheeled closeups, then you want it to look really intricate."
00:23:54,00:23:58,So there's a scene where when you know you can sort of tell it's a really seminal scene
00:23:58,00:24:02,"in the fellowship of the ring where Frodo drops the ring, he's supposed to be carrying"
00:24:02,00:24:03,it.
00:24:03,00:24:04,"And he's like, oh no, where's it gone?"
00:24:04,00:24:07,And he looks up and Boram is picking it up and you see the ring being picked up out
00:24:07,00:24:08,of the snow.
00:24:08,00:24:09,And that's a giant ring.
00:24:09,00:24:11,And when you make a giant hand.
00:24:11,00:24:13,"No, you don't see his hand come down."
00:24:13,00:24:17,"You see the chain attached to the ring be lifted up, so they made a big chain to go with it."
00:24:17,00:24:18,Cool.
00:24:18,00:24:19,I know.
00:24:19,00:24:22,I thought you were going to say because are they all dwarfs or something in all the rings
00:24:22,00:24:23,harbors?
00:24:23,00:24:27,"Yeah, so you'd need a big one to make it look like they're all really small."
00:24:27,00:24:30,"Is that not what I don't think that was wiper, maybe it had that."
00:24:30,00:24:31,That's so great.
00:24:31,00:24:34,So that's the only prop they had to adjust the size of the hobbits.
00:24:34,00:24:39,"So they got their hands over a ring, you can see Frodo's enormous ring."
00:24:39,00:24:40,They're not borrowers.
00:24:40,00:24:45,I haven't seen it in the in the book or in the whole thing.
00:24:45,00:24:47,Does the ring change size?
00:24:47,00:24:48,No.
00:24:48,00:24:49,No.
00:24:49,00:24:50,I think so.
00:24:50,00:24:52,Does everyone in the line of the rings like have the same size fingers?
00:24:52,00:24:53,"Yeah, that's a great question."
00:24:53,00:24:54,I don't know.
00:24:54,00:24:55,You never wear it.
00:24:55,00:24:56,You never wear the ring because of it.
00:24:56,00:24:57,"Yeah, they do."
00:24:57,00:24:58,They go disappearing.
00:24:58,00:24:59,It makes you visible.
00:24:59,00:25:03,It presumably must be magic to adjust to the owner's finger or some people it just
00:25:03,00:25:04,doesn't fit on.
00:25:04,00:25:08,"Maybe sometimes you can put it like, for instance, my wife's wedding ring will fit on my"
00:25:08,00:25:09,little finger.
00:25:09,00:25:10,Yeah.
00:25:10,00:25:11,So maybe they do that.
00:25:11,00:25:12,"No, it's not."
00:25:12,00:25:13,Okay.
00:25:13,00:25:16,This ring has the power to create evil across the world.
00:25:16,00:25:18,My wife's wedding ring.
00:25:18,00:25:22,It can adjust size according to kind of it.
00:25:22,00:25:23,Is that a thing?
00:25:23,00:25:24,I don't know if it is.
00:25:24,00:25:25,I don't know.
00:25:25,00:25:29,"So if I tried to put it on my neck, could it kind of get bigger so it went on my neck?"
00:25:29,00:25:30,It's a magic ring.
00:25:30,00:25:31,I could do whatever it wants.
00:25:31,00:25:32,No one.
00:25:32,00:25:33,But he never says.
00:25:33,00:25:35,"Oh, and then it made itself a bit smaller."
00:25:35,00:25:37,So it could hit on Frodo's tiny things.
00:25:37,00:25:38,It's not Frodo's card.
00:25:38,00:25:42,Those scenes were deleted.
00:25:42,00:25:46,"Oh, my goodness."
00:25:46,00:25:51,"Oh, I was reading a few blogs by a woman called Ellen Freund."
00:25:51,00:25:56,"I think F.R.E.U.N.D. who is, I think she's one of Hollywood's main prop makers, really."
00:25:56,00:25:57,It was really interesting.
00:25:57,00:26:01,"So she did the props for Mad Men and stuff like that, really good period pieces."
00:26:01,00:26:05,But it must be so frustrating because a lot of the props that you make as a prop maker
00:26:05,00:26:10,"never get seen by an audience, they're just to create the environment for the actors."
00:26:10,00:26:14,"So as you were saying, every single draw that someone opened in Mad Men, you wouldn't see"
00:26:14,00:26:16,inside it from the camera angle.
00:26:16,00:26:19,But the actors had to see all the stuff they thought their character might have.
00:26:19,00:26:20,You joking.
00:26:20,00:26:21,No way.
00:26:21,00:26:25,"Surely you can just put a little post it now saying there is a, you know, stuff in this"
00:26:25,00:26:26,drama.
00:26:26,00:26:27,There is stuff in this drama.
00:26:27,00:26:28,Yeah.
00:26:28,00:26:31,"No, these people can't pretend that there's stuff in this drama."
00:26:31,00:26:32,You've got to see the stuff.
00:26:32,00:26:33,That's so patsy.
00:26:33,00:26:34,Yeah.
00:26:34,00:26:35,So they're not very good actors at all.
00:26:35,00:26:39,"But if the actors are freaked out by an empty draw, imagine how they're going to be freaked"
00:26:39,00:26:43,out by the massive film crew who are on the other half of their office.
00:26:43,00:26:44,Yeah.
00:26:44,00:26:46,They all have to disguise themselves as wallpaper.
00:26:46,00:26:47,Laughter.
00:26:47,00:26:48,Laughter.
00:26:48,00:26:54,Then I'll have to hide behind the picture of the countryside.
00:26:54,00:26:58,"She made some kind of creepy also making props, Ellen did, because she said, you can obviously"
00:26:58,00:27:02,"Google stuff what things look like when you're trying to work out, you know, what a book"
00:27:02,00:27:04,would have looked like in the 1920s.
00:27:04,00:27:05,Yeah.
00:27:05,00:27:06,You can't possibly imagine.
00:27:06,00:27:11,But it shows in the one object that it hasn't really changed for a long time.
00:27:11,00:27:12,Laughter.
00:27:12,00:27:16,"She said, you, really, the only way you can get a proper idea for what, let's say she has"
00:27:16,00:27:21,"to design a bunch of stuff for 13 reasons why it was she worked on, which is contemporary"
00:27:21,00:27:22,teenagers.
00:27:22,00:27:23,Right.
00:27:23,00:27:25,"She said, you've got to go out into the world and see what they're actually wearing."
00:27:25,00:27:29,"So she said, I've got to go out and stand near high school's friends."
00:27:29,00:27:33,And I'll watch the children all day to make sure that I understand what they're back
00:27:33,00:27:34,back.
00:27:34,00:27:35,But surely they all just wear school uniforms.
00:27:35,00:27:37,And maybe she goes to the Mafty schools.
00:27:37,00:27:38,Mafty schools.
00:27:38,00:27:39,Yeah.
00:27:39,00:27:40,It is Mafty in 13 reasons why.
00:27:40,00:27:41,There you go.
00:27:41,00:27:42,Yeah.
00:27:42,00:27:43,So she goes to Mafty schools.
00:27:43,00:27:46,"And then she says, I'll go down to the mall where I know the kids are shopping and then"
00:27:46,00:27:49,"I'll watch them there to see what sort of stuff they're, I mean, she must look like a real"
00:27:49,00:27:50,weirdo.
00:27:50,00:27:51,Yeah.
00:27:51,00:27:52,Yeah.
00:27:52,00:27:54,Especially depending on the kind of thing you're filming as well.
00:27:54,00:27:55,Yes.
00:27:55,00:27:58,"If you're filming something set in a morgue, you have to go and hang out around a morgue"
00:27:58,00:27:59,or see what they're wearing.
00:27:59,00:28:01,But make sure you go to a Mafty mall.
00:28:01,00:28:02,Okay.
00:28:02,00:28:13,It's time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.
00:28:13,00:28:17,My fact is that eating ginger can make you feel better about drinking out of a toilet.
00:28:17,00:28:21,Is that because it tastes a bit better?
00:28:21,00:28:22,It's not.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"And this is a, by the way, this is a toilet that's never been used."
00:28:24,00:28:25,"Oh, okay."
00:28:25,00:28:27,So would you drink out of a toilet that's never been used?
00:28:27,00:28:28,Yes.
00:28:28,00:28:29,Do I have any other options?
00:28:29,00:28:31,"Like, could I just drink out of a glass instead?"
00:28:31,00:28:32,"No, the glass."
00:28:32,00:28:33,There's no glass.
00:28:33,00:28:34,There's no glass.
00:28:34,00:28:35,So am I really thirsty?
00:28:35,00:28:39,"No, you had a cup of tea about an hour ago."
00:28:39,00:28:41,Was there a ginger biscuit I had with this cup of tea?
00:28:41,00:28:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:42,00:28:43,All right.
00:28:43,00:28:44,Okay.
00:28:44,00:28:45,"Yeah, I'm cool."
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:47,I can see it works.
00:28:47,00:28:48,So this is an experiment.
00:28:48,00:28:51,Ginger is said to help prevent nausea.
00:28:51,00:28:55,And there's a lot of debate about whether you get disgusted because of a moral judgment
00:28:55,00:28:58,"that you've made or whether it's kind of the other way around, whether a moral judgment's"
00:28:58,00:29:01,"guide, what we then find disgusting or whether disgust is inherent."
00:29:01,00:29:03,And then we just based on that.
00:29:03,00:29:07,"So there was an experiment at the University of British Columbia, which gave patients ginger"
00:29:07,00:29:13,"capsules and it experimented how disgusting people found things when they had had those,"
00:29:13,00:29:15,as opposed to when they hadn't had those.
00:29:15,00:29:21,So the experiment found that it reduced how disgusted people were by moderately disgusting
00:29:21,00:29:25,"photos, like a photo with some snot in a napkin."
00:29:25,00:29:29,But it did not help extremely disgusting things like form it in a toilet.
00:29:29,00:29:30,Right.
00:29:30,00:29:36,"And they then tested how it affected so-called purity violations, which is a bit breaking"
00:29:36,00:29:37,taboos about purity and cleanliness.
00:29:37,00:29:43,"So for example, people who'd taken ginger were less strict about moderate violations like"
00:29:43,00:29:45,drinking from a never-used toilet bowl.
00:29:45,00:29:49,But apparently it did not have an effect on extreme purity violations like sex between
00:29:49,00:29:50,cousins.
00:29:50,00:29:51,Right.
00:29:51,00:29:56,"But if you had more ginger, do you think, yeah, how much ginger would you need?"
00:29:56,00:29:57,Just like your cousin.
00:29:57,00:30:05,"It just implies that eating ginger, you can numb your moral compass, right?"
00:30:05,00:30:08,"If you have to commit a crime, there's nothing you can do, and you're grossed out by it."
00:30:08,00:30:10,"If I have a shed load of ginger, then I'll feel less guilty."
00:30:10,00:30:14,"They said it works to a certain extent, but it depends on the crime you think it works."
00:30:14,00:30:16,"It only works on really, really minor crimes."
00:30:16,00:30:17,Yeah.
00:30:17,00:30:21,"I think that came out a few years ago that was saying that the more easily disgusted you are,"
00:30:21,00:30:25,"the more likely you are to be conservative, and it can actually be used as a predictor"
00:30:25,00:30:27,of your voting even.
00:30:27,00:30:30,And this holds true across 121 countries they looked at.
00:30:30,00:30:34,"So the more conservative people are, the more easily triggered their disgust reactions"
00:30:34,00:30:35,are.
00:30:35,00:30:41,"What I found interesting is that, like you say, the people who are more disgusted are more"
00:30:41,00:30:46,"likely to vote conservative, but also that between 2013 and 2016, the value of ginger"
00:30:46,00:30:50,imported into the UK has fallen by 15%.
00:30:50,00:30:54,So maybe that's why we've become a more conservative country.
00:30:54,00:30:55,People are eating less ginger.
00:30:55,00:30:56,Maybe.
00:30:56,00:31:01,Let's start giving out gingerbread biscuits on the streets.
00:31:01,00:31:05,"You know there's a thing called disgustology, as scientists do look into this, call themselves"
00:31:05,00:31:08,"disgustologists, kind of a self-given name."
00:31:08,00:31:11,That might become a surname in like 200 years.
00:31:11,00:31:16,"Well, one woman who could have it is Professor Val Curtis, who has a lot of the thing you"
00:31:16,00:31:20,have to do when you're one of these scientists is you have to come up with scenarios.
00:31:20,00:31:24,"And in one of her experiments, she had to come up with 70 different scenarios, and I just"
00:31:24,00:31:27,"wanted to tell you a few of them, can you just tell me whether they're disgusting or not."
00:31:27,00:31:31,So imagining a hairless old cat rubbing up against one's leg.
00:31:31,00:31:32,All right.
00:31:32,00:31:34,"I'm not a big fan of cats in general, actually."
00:31:34,00:31:35,OK.
00:31:35,00:31:37,That's a Siamese cat in my head.
00:31:37,00:31:38,All right.
00:31:38,00:31:41,Stepping on a slug in bare feet hates having actual phobia of slugs.
00:31:41,00:31:42,OK.
00:31:42,00:31:43,It's OK for me.
00:31:43,00:31:44,Feeling someone coffin to your face.
00:31:44,00:31:45,I'm OK.
00:31:45,00:31:46,I'm OK.
00:31:46,00:31:48,I'm better with that than with the slugs.
00:31:48,00:31:49,OK.
00:31:49,00:31:51,Shaking hands with someone with scabby fingers.
00:31:51,00:31:52,Fine.
00:31:52,00:31:53,That's all right.
00:31:53,00:31:56,"Yeah, I'm a bit like, but I wouldn't be disgusted."
00:31:56,00:32:00,I think I am the scabby fingers.
00:32:00,00:32:04,Finding out a friend attempted to have sex with a piece of fruit.
00:32:04,00:32:06,"I mean, you're only ever going to be amused by that."
00:32:06,00:32:10,It depends on the fruit.
00:32:10,00:32:14,What fruit would not be amusing?
00:32:14,00:32:15,It's true.
00:32:15,00:32:16,It's true.
00:32:16,00:32:17,Two more.
00:32:17,00:32:18,Learning your neighbour defecates in his back garden.
00:32:18,00:32:19,Is that disgusting?
00:32:19,00:32:21,It's his own back garden.
00:32:21,00:32:22,Yeah.
00:32:22,00:32:23,But he's your neighbour.
00:32:23,00:32:25,And the final one is this disgusting o not.
00:32:25,00:32:27,"""Seeing pus coming from a genital sore."""
00:32:27,00:32:28,That doesn't mean it.
00:32:28,00:32:29,That's up quite quickly.
00:32:29,00:32:30,Yeah.
00:32:30,00:32:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:32,00:32:33,I read a thing.
00:32:33,00:32:38,There's this psychologist have this idea that we have disgusted disposal effect.
00:32:38,00:32:43,"See, I do that if we are surrounded by things that disgust us, we really want"
00:32:43,00:32:46,to get out of the situation.
00:32:46,00:32:50,"The study showed that if you were selling stuff, if you were exposed to things that disgusted"
00:32:50,00:32:54,"you and then you had to do your deal, you would reduce the price massively just to get"
00:32:54,00:32:55,out of the situation.
00:32:55,00:32:56,Does that make sense?
00:32:56,00:33:02,"So if you're in a room that's full of vomit, and you're selling something on eBay, you"
00:33:02,00:33:06,"will accept a lower amount, but you're on a desktop computer which can't be moved out"
00:33:06,00:33:07,of the room.
00:33:07,00:33:10,And the only power point is in that room that's full of vomit.
00:33:10,00:33:11,Yeah.
00:33:11,00:33:13,We did a different thing in their experiments.
00:33:13,00:33:14,"Oh, well."
00:33:14,00:33:15,Yeah.
00:33:15,00:33:16,We'll design our experiments differently.
00:33:16,00:33:17,That's my one.
00:33:17,00:33:18,Yeah.
00:33:18,00:33:19,It's weird though.
00:33:19,00:33:24,"It does, because I think if you could then go to a market and haggle and you could manufacture,"
00:33:24,00:33:31,"like say, put a naked, hairless old cat against the man's leg who's selling you the trinket,"
00:33:31,00:33:32,you could reduce your price.
00:33:32,00:33:33,Naturally.
00:33:33,00:33:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:34,00:33:35,So I have one.
00:33:35,00:33:37,I've been a market haggling for a trinket.
00:33:37,00:33:38,Yeah.
00:33:38,00:33:40,And I've got my hairless naked old cat under my arm.
00:33:40,00:33:41,Yeah.
00:33:41,00:33:42,I need to rub that against the seller.
00:33:42,00:33:43,You might get the reduced price.
00:33:43,00:33:45,You might scabby fingers as well.
00:33:45,00:33:46,Yeah.
00:33:46,00:33:51,"But then tell you, do you know, I just tried to have sex with that mango."
00:33:51,00:33:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:52,00:33:57,"I think this is all it dulled trumps the art of the deal, isn't it?"
00:33:57,00:34:02,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:34:02,00:34:03,"OK, that's it."
