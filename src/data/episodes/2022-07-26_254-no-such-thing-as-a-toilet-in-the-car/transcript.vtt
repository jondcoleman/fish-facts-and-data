00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 "Did you know what that woulda worked, isn't it?"

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.400
 "Did you know what that woulda worked, isn't it?"

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.120
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.520
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.520
 Anna Chazinski.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.320
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.000
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Chazinski.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.200
 My fact this week is that the rear-view mirror was invented so that racing drivers didn't

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 have to have a person sitting next to them in the car explaining what was going on behind

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 them.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.600
 Yes, I think bizarrely I found this out because I saw a post for an insurance site or something,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.560
 but anyway, it was invented for the Indy 500 inaugural race in 1911, so the Indy 500 is

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.920
 that big race that happens in Indianapolis.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.800
 1911, it was one by a guy called Ray Haroon.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.600
 And basically the reason he won it was that he realised that the cars always had two people

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.720
 in them, the driver, and then the person who had to do a number of things, one of which

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.760
 included turning round and saying if there were any cars behind them in dangerous positions

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.040
 to make sure there wasn't a pile up or a big crash.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.640
 And Ray thought that's a lot of extra weight, wonder if I can avoid that, and what he did

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.800
 was he got a mirror and placed it in the middle of his car, hanging in the middle of his car

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.240
 on a pole, and then he won the race because he halved the weight in the car.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.440
 He did win the race, although we're not 100% sure that he actually won the race.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.840
 As in, he got given the prize, but the truth was that no one really knew how to count all

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.360
 the laps or time things or anything like that, and there were loads of pit stops, so really

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.320
 no one actually knew who won the race.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.320
 How did they decide?

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.840
 They just went, I feel like it should be over now, next person to cross the line.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.840
 A little bit like that.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.680
 There was a guy whose job it was to kind of putt who was in the lead, and they would change

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.000
 it every now and then.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.960
 But the truth was that some people took two minutes to change a tire, some people took

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.000
 them 15 minutes to change a tire, some cars would come out of the pit lane, and then back

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.800
 up over the finishing line, and then go back over again so it added an extra, that really

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.800
 happened.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.800
 Oh my god.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.720
 That couldn't have been loud.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.480
 They didn't know what was going on at all.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.280
 They just didn't have the technology to work out times or anything like this.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.200
 It sounds like a cheat that you would do in Mario Kart.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.560
 I remember doing that kind of thing in Diddy Kong racing, and you see how close you can loop

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.200
 around the finishing kind of post for it to count.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200
 And it never does.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200
 Never does.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.360
 So the technology there is more advanced than that.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.760
 There was a guy called Mulford, who was pretty sure that he'd won, and he went across

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.960
 the finishing line.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.520
 And then what you always did was you did an insurance lap at the end just to make sure

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.480
 that you've done the right distance, because people might think, oh, you've done one

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.480
 not enough.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.240
 And so he did his insurance lap, and then when he got to the end of the insurance

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.720
 lap, he found that someone else had claimed the victory, which was Haroon, and Haroon was

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.360
 already being shared as the victor.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.360
 And he's like, no way.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.960
 I finished like two minutes ago.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.960
 Wow.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.280
 I think that Haroon used to work as a chauffeur.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.280
 And he apparently, I read one account that said, he got the idea for a review mirror in

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.880
 a car from a review mirror that he saw in a horse-drawn carriage.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880
 That's what he said.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.880
 Certainly.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.520
 Well, that makes sense, because pretty much everything in cars came from horse-drawn

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520
 carriages, didn't they?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.520
 I guess so.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.240
 I think you have a horse-drawn carriage with mirrors.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.360
 I was looking for a horse-drawn carriage mirrors, and I don't think they were really a thing.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.000
 The only reference I could find to advising there be mirrors in horse-drawn carriages were

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.720
 saying there has to be a mirror in order that the lady in the carriage at some point

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.760
 might want to check her makeup.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.600
 Yeah, it seems like that was the real innovator that guy in the horse-drawn carriage that

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 he saw.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.600
 Yeah.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.400
 Just on horse-drawn carriages and how they sort of competed with cars, there was this

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.880
 early concept in 1899 when there was a point where cars and horse-drawn carriages were into

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.840
 mingling and it was scaring farmers and it was particularly scaring horses.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.880
 So a guy called Uriah Smith, and this was in Battle Creek, Michigan, invented this contraption

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.680
 called the horsey horseless carriage, and you put a horse's head on the front of your car,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.120
 and it looks like you're just riding a horse, but you're actually driving your car.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.600
 It's all sort of except that the horse doesn't have a back end, doesn't it?

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.800
 Yeah, I guess if you were approaching a horse, it would be like, "Oh yeah, this is

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.800
 a horse."

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.040
 It's like if the horse was entering the room and only its head had popped in, you might

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.040
 think it was a horse.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040
 Yeah.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.040
 But then?

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.120
 Is it like a pantomime if one guy doesn't turn up?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.720
 It is like that, and it's quite frightening, because it's just up to the neck.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.560
 It looks like someone's stuffed and mounted a horse's head and stuck it on the front of

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.560
 their car to our eyes.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.560
 Yeah.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.520
 And the other thing was that they said, because I read a bit about it, they said that

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.880
 I think the horse's head was full of petrol, because it was an extra fuel reserve in case

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.200
 you ran it in the main tank. It is a good idea until you hit something, at which point it

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.960
 becomes a real fire liability, because you just smash a big petrol tank into someone else.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960
 Explosion.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.960
 Oh yeah.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960
 But they were so paranoid, weren't they?

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.600
 I think we did a QI episode on this a few years ago, but there was that thing where various

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.680
 rules were written in the highway code or equivalent in America, which said things like,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.000
 if you're driving a car and you think a horse is approaching about a mile away, you hear

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.880
 a horse topping in approach, you have to carry with you a scene of the surrounding countryside

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.360
 which you stop your car and you throw the countryside scene over your car.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.760
 That's so annoying, especially when it's just a guy with two coconuts walking past you.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.080
 I thought it was that you had to dismantle the car.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.080
 And sometimes you had to dismantle the car.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.080
 The whole car.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.640
 Yeah, you just sort of had to take it apart and hide it by the hedge.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.960
 That was written down as well.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.000
 Now I remember researching this and I think there was a lot of exaggeration about so I could

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.520
 never work out what they actually did and what was actually written as a joke in the highway

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520
 code.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.440
 And I don't think they ever actually fully produced the horsey horseless thing.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.240
 It was, yeah, it was concept designed and patented, yeah.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.240
 Yeah.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.720
 There have been some great car patents over the years though, I was looking at some of them.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.480
 So one car invention that never really took off was a 1935, the dog sack, which is if you

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.640
 don't want to keep your pet in your car because it gets hair everywhere, then it's a sack

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.400
 that clamps onto the running board of the car and then it hooks onto an open window and

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.600
 you tie your dog up in it and you can carry it outside the car.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.480
 That's good because dogs like to stick their head out of the window, don't they?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.480
 Perfect.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.480
 They're just now the whole body's outside the window.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480
 Yeah.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.480
 That's what they've always wanted.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.480
 Just put a dog in one of those.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.880
 It would probably stick its head in the window.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.480
 I think dogs just like to stick their head through windows.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.480
 That's my theory.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.480
 Yeah.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.480
 Right.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.480
 That's true.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.480
 Did you hear about the steering wheel of death?

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.480
 No.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.800
 This is a car innovation on a Cadillac, the 1954 Cadillac El Dorado.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.000
 This is obviously really expensive cars, you know, they're very luxurious.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.760
 But the steering wheel of this Cadillac had a kind of bullet-shaped spike in the middle

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.760
 of it.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.760
 Right.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.920
 So imagine a really large bullet, the pointy end of the bullet, you know, at the front

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.160
 end as it were.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.280
 So that was just in the middle of the steering wheel.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.040
 So obviously that's quite dangerous in the event of a crash.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.560
 And that's how it got the nickname.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.680
 And Sammy Davis, Jr., he had a crash in one of those cars and his face hit the wheel and

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.320
 he lost an eye as a result.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.800
 So do you explain why they had this spike in the steering wheel?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.800
 Eusthetics.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800
 No way.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800
 Designed.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.800
 It's not useful.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800
 It wasn't useful for anything.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.680
 It was, you know, when that was the era when cars had these fantastic cars.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.360
 Oh, that was the era where there were spikes in the middle of every car, like an iron

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.360
 maiden.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360
 You would drive around.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360
 Boxes of TNT.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.480
 It's more rounded than a full-on spike.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.480
 Right.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.480
 It doesn't look like an extra spike.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.920
 But it does look like a big bullet.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.320
 The Sammy Davis Jr. lost his eye because of that.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.320
 Wow.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.320
 Well, there was that idea that someone came up with, which was just a design idea.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.360
 It wasn't real of putting a massive spike in every steering wheel.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.560
 And the idea is that it would just make everyone drive really carefully.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800
 The opposite of an airbag.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.200
 It's a real carrot or stick kind of a foot.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.200
 Yeah.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.840
 The Duke of Edinburgh has been impaled again.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.840
 Yeah.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.520
 Here's another Cadillac invention just very quickly that didn't work out.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.440
 They tried to put working toilets in the inside of their cars.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.760
 That was in 1947.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.760
 You can see photos of it.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.760
 It looks really incredible.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.760
 Great idea.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.760
 It was in the back seat.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760
 Yeah.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.600
 And you would have what was a proper toilet in this photo.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.000
 But the problem was it just didn't make sense really to have it.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 What?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Why not?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Why not?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.960
 Because the amount of space that you'd need for the tank, for the flush, the smell was

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.960
 too great.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.800
 There was a lot of splash back, apparently, in the testing and the smells.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.800
 Yeah.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800
 These feel like problems we can overcome.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800
 Yeah.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.800
 It looked so cool.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.480
 And this splash bag, for instance, obviously don't have it be water-based, silly.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.920
 Oh, just have it like a cat litter tray.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.920
 Exactly.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.000
 It makes handcastles if you don't need the loo.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 It's multi-purpose.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.080
 That's to think there are lots of rules, aren't there, about how fun you can make things

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080
 on the road.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.080
 Like service stations.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.080
 Right.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.080
 There are rules.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.000
 In fact, there are laws about what you're allowed to have at a service station, because

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.200
 the road, the motorway network is so important for people for, you know, transport that you

00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:00.440
 can't have say, I don't know, a casino at a service station, because you can't have anything

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.440
 there that would mean people went there, especially.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.240
 It's interesting though, because every single service station does have slot machines in it.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.240
 Yeah.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.240
 Remember when we were on tour?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.240
 Literally every single one.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.240
 Yeah.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240
 Casino was a very bad example.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.240
 I don't know, kind of thing.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.240
 Brothels?

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.240
 Brothels.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240
 Brothels.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240
 Brothels.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.240
 That's the only reason there are no problems.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240
 Thanks to the MNAT.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:26.720
 There has to be just, you know, refueling going to the toilet and the slot machine.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.720
 There's so much fun stuff on the British highway.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.320
 Well, they very recently opened a weather spoons in one of them, didn't they?

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.320
 And that was a massive deal.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.800
 And everyone thought it was a terrible idea, because you shouldn't have.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.280
 Be able to sell our collar service stations, but they didn't do.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.240
 I went into a box that simulated a hurricane on one of the slots.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240
 On one of our tour.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.240
 Did you make a special journey?

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240
 Would you make a special journey?

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240
 No, we weren't.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.240
 No, no, no, no.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.240
 It was just as off as very dangerous.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.240
 I do.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.680
 But I've never heard of that being anywhere else, like a hurricane box.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680
 That's true, yeah.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.680
 So which services was it?

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.680
 It was when we were on tour, our last tour.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.400
 Well, no, Dan, don't encourage it.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.600
 This whole point is you shouldn't make special journeys to a service station.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.600
 No, I'm going.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.600
 I'm going.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.240
 Because then I'm going to get drunk at the weather spoons, play a bit of slot machines.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.240
 Do the hurricane thing.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.240
 Go to the brothel and then try back.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240
 Great news.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.240
 I got blown off of the services.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.240
 I'm done.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.240
 I did the hurricane box.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:23.000
 Back to the Indy 500, would you mind?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.720
 So one of the things with the Indy 500 winners is that they drink a cup of milk after the

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.720
 race.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.400
 And it's a tradition that was born in 1936, Lewis Mayer.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.600
 He finished and he asked for buttermilk after the race.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.440
 And it was a dairy executive who saw him drinking it in a picture.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.240
 And they sort of, they must have approached them.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.080
 And that tradition was born.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.720
 And so when you're going to race, they ask you what kind of milk would you like just so

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.720
 we can have it ready for you?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.440
 Does that mean like a full fat or half fat?

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.440
 Exactly.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.880
 And, uh, majorotively, it's full fat.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.560
 They found, uh, they just released the latest, um, sort of preference.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.560
 I'm sorry.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.560
 I was kidding.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.560
 Why are you surprised by that?

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.560
 I'm just like something's going to milk.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.800
 And you thought, because you're such a great racing driver, you thought, oh, my buddies.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.720
 Well, in this, in this hipster era, they must be having to stock way more milk than

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.720
 usual.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.240
 They'll be having almond and oats and lactose free.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.000
 In 1913, the winner was Joule Gu, who was a French driver.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.640
 He won by 13 minutes, actually.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.200
 Um, but he drank champagne throughout the race.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.760
 In fact, um, some people think he might have had as many as six bottles of champagne during

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.960
 the course of the race.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.960
 Wow.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.960
 Awesome.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.120
 He definitely had at least half a pint in his first pit stop.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.960
 And then he was drinking it throughout the race.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.960
 Wow.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.280
 So he won the race, but he did lose his driving license.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.040
 You would really have benefited from the car with a toilet in the back.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.040
 Yes, definitely.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.080
 You can't climb into the back of the car, I'll probably be racing.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.200
 The trophy for the Indy 500 for people who aren't familiar with it, which I wasn't really

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200
 is ridiculous.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.360
 It's amazing.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.360
 It's revolting.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.360
 So it is.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.360
 I love it.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360
 Dan loves it.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.520
 It's, um, so it's five at all.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.520
 It's ridiculously large.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.680
 Uh, it's all made of silver.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.360
 And as soon as you win the race, you get your head sculpted onto it and attach.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.200
 And then they ran out of space on it and in the 80s, I think so they had to add an extra

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.240
 level so they could get more heads on it.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.960
 So it's got all the old guys heads as well.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.960
 It's the old heads.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.720
 He's got a French guy looking a bit pissed.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.720
 Yeah.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.640
 Everyone else has got like that milk mustache that you get.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.160
 Okay, it's time for fact number two.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.680
 And that is James.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:41.200
 Okay, my fact this week is that a 2018 paper suggesting that people who have a surname,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.200
 which occurs towards the end of the alphabet, are more likely to end up academically and

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.040
 professionally undistinguished, was co-authored by Professor Jeffrey Zachs.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:56.960
 I love co-author because he couldn't even individually alter his own.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.920
 Well, he co-authored it with a guy whose name was Corley beginning with C.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.920
 Yeah.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920
 Yeah.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.920
 He was the brains behind it.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.920
 Wasn't he?

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.960
 Jeffrey Zachs is quite cool, actually.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.080
 He's a University of Boulder psychologist and I listened to an interview with him on a radio

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.520
 show called Top of the Mind and they asked him, you know, is there reason you're doing this

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.000
 because obviously you had a bad time of it because of your name.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.400
 And he said he was sensitized to the issue because of that, but actually it doesn't affect

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.920
 him because according to their studies, it doesn't affect people who are distinguished

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.920
 in any other way.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.000
 So if you're kind of top of your class at school or bottom of your class or you look different

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.880
 or you're more attractive or less attractive, it doesn't really affect you.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.160
 It only affects people who are right in the middle, but they found that actually it does affect

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.160
 them.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.360
 It means it gives them less distinction at high school, less satisfaction at high school and

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.040
 lower educational attainment after they've left school.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.400
 And until you're about middle aged, it affects you quite badly according to them.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.400
 What's the justification here?

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.960
 Is it just about reading out the register?

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.960
 No.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.800
 So there are a few different reasons.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.000
 It's, so for instance, infant school, a lot of kids are putting alphabetical order.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.640
 So the kids beginning with A near the front of the class, which means they get more attention.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.320
 They don't just tend to get asked more for things.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.640
 So for not school, for instance, if your name is towards a start of the alphabet, you're

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.680
 less likely to give money to charity.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.320
 And that's because you get run up more because your name is at the front of the alphabet and

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.640
 you get more annoyed by it.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.040
 And so you're less likely to give money.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.040
 Really?

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.600
 It's also like, when it's graduation and they're handing out diplomas, this is one of

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600
 the things mentioned.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.600
 You start 8 a.m.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.560
 It's all really exciting at the top, but by the time you get to Zuckerberg, you know,

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.120
 yeah, and that's why he never made anything else out of it, right?

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.960
 But when you get to the end, most people have left because they want to get the restaurants

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.160
 early and everyone who's applauding their arms are tired and stuff like that.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.280
 And so, and I can understand if you're marking a big pile of exam papers, and Aaron J.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.040
 Aaronson makes a point.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.840
 And then Sammy, Sammy makes up the same point.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.080
 You think, I read this in Aaron J. Aaronson's article and that was hours ago.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.080
 Yeah, exactly.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.080
 Exactly.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.600
 So, and the teacher might say, okay, can someone read the report?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.720
 Aaron J. Aaronson, can you do it?

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.600
 And then by the time Zuckerberg gets there, he just never gets asked.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.200
 And so, you have less confidence in public speaking as well.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.720
 So, this genuinely does seem to be a thing.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.320
 Yeah, although I'm not sure about his way of, I'm not sure about Zach's way of combating

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.320
 it.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.760
 One of the ways he says he combats it is that he is a professor, so we ask students.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.960
 And he always calls the class register in reverse order, which seems to be, to just be recreating

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.800
 the problem for the opposite way around.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.520
 He suggests that people should maybe do something to distinguish themselves like

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.160
 dress strangely on something that's one of the specific things he said.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.760
 Like, just so that people notice you because it's the people who aren't noticed who struggle

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.760
 the most.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.360
 And if you're later on in the alphabet, you're more likely not to be noticed if you're otherwise

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.360
 distinguished.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.360
 Yes, that's right.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.840
 And it works the other way around.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.600
 So, there's another study which is that authors whose surnames are ranked towards the front

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.960
 of the alphabet are more likely to be cited in scientific papers.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960
 Oh.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.120
 And that was lead offered by a guy called Ass Nalt.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.280
 So he has obviously seen that he's been cited more often than others because he's an

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.280
 A.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.120
 And also he has the word 'ass' in his name, which I help.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.000
 And for presidential candidates in America, that's another thing they think influences because

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.120
 that's in alphabetical order as well when you go in for doing that.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.880
 So you're more likely to go for someone at the top of it.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.440
 Who's this George Washington guy who would have self-implaced, isn't he?

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440
 I know.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440
 Who came after him?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440
 Adams.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.440
 Yeah.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.920
 And George Washington only became president because he sees how, as he pulled us out, he

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.760
 would put himself in never-of-one a fair election.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.760
 Yeah, okay.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.600
 There are definitely countries where it's law that on the ballot paper you have to mix it

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600
 up, aren't there?

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.960
 Or you do half and half on ballot papers because people just tick an A because it's a lot

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.000
 of effort when you go to the ballot box and you're in a hurry to get to work anyway.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.360
 You just cross the first one you see, don't you?

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.200
 One thing I think Zack's found, which is encouraging, is that by the time you're in

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.160
 your mid-30s, the effect, lessons, to the point of disappearance.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.680
 Because you've been distinguished in some other way by then.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.040
 So people are judging you not on your name but on what you've done in life.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.040
 Yeah.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.280
 Oh, I thought it was because you weren't having registered taking any more.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.280
 Probably not, too.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.280
 Probably.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.280
 The time is thirty-five.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.640
 The paper, just for anyone listening, is called Alphabetism, the effects of surname

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.280
 initial and the cost of being otherwise undistinguished.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.600
 And that paper has ninety-six citations and I counted them and there are seventy-seven

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.600
 from A to M and only seventeen from N to Z.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.600
 Wow.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.600
 So they're compounding the problem.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.600
 Proof.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.720
 I find it so weird that Leonardo da Vinci doesn't have a surname.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.720
 Always true.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.720
 Always thought that was his surname.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.680
 All Vinci, just for people who were like me who didn't know that.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.680
 Yeah.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.120
 But what do you mean by "doesn't have a surname" because our surnames are like that as

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.120
 well.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.520
 In the end, that does end up being your surname.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.560
 So there was, for instance, in 2016, I think that someone compiled a dictionary of

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.360
 fifty thousand surnames from Britain that go all the way back to like the eleventh century

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:57.360
 and they found that about half of the most common ones were locative, which is basically

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.840
 that ones that say what place you're from.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.520
 You know, so like less, if your surname is Leicester or if you're surnames and I can't

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.040
 think of like Jack London or Stafford.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.040
 Stafford.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.040
 Exactly.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.040
 So it's still the same kind of thing.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.040
 George Washington.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.040
 George Washington.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.040
 Yeah.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.040
 Yeah.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.400
 I don't know if any of your surnames have a mind will be kin will be family of I should

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.400
 think.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.400
 It's Irish anyway.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400
 Yes.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400
 Of course.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400
 Don't know about Murray.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.240
 Murray, I read ages ago, it's both, there's claims for it in Scotland and Ireland, the

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.400
 battle out for what you know.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.840
 Murray is a place presumably in Scotland as well.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.840
 Moray.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.840
 Yeah.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.840
 Murray.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840
 Moray Firth.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840
 There's a moray eel.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.840
 Yeah.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840
 Yeah.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.840
 Well, I think there's an eel somewhere in my family tree.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.840
 Yeah.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.040
 Tishinsky means son of Tishinsky.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.000
 Tishinsky is like a bird.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.240
 The name is like a bird.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.160
 So some are descriptors and that's one of the most common types of name you have as well

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.160
 when you go back.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.160
 Why are you looking at me?

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.160
 I am like a bird.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.160
 I'm like a bird.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.160
 I'm like a bird.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.160
 That's right.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.840
 Well, about a fifth of surnames in fact in our country are like that as in descriptors.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.840
 So like good fellow.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.440
 That's a nice descriptive one.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.440
 Yeah.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.240
 Short is either means that the person who had that nickname was really short or it often

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.000
 meant that they were really tall.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 So you never know.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.800
 Because it was like the funny ironic thing, you know, and you're like, all right, sure.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800
 See, it was a tall guy.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.800
 There were quite a lot of those.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.800
 That's sick.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.800
 Does it?

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.320
 Could it mean that whoever was called Godfellow was actually a bit of a twatter?

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.320
 Yeah.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:35.960
 Whereas we're as poor Derek Twatt from one of the nicest and kindest families in the town.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.720
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.080
 And that is my fact.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.320
 My fact this week is that grocery bags used in Hollywood movies don't rustle.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.960
 Why aren't we allowed them?

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.960
 I know.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.360
 So this is something that I read on a website called proptrics.com.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.640
 This is the website of a man who invented these bags.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.720
 I'm about to tell you about Tim Schultz's name.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.000
 And it's when on movie sets, you see people carrying any kind of bags.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.360
 Especially when you're recording, that makes so much noise that they can't cancel out that

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.360
 it ruins scenes.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.160
 I have to constantly rerecord scenes.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.200
 And he was on the set of a TV show back in the day that starred Martin Lawrence called

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.440
 Martin.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.440
 And Martin, as he's coming into the room, gets his pants taken off by a doorframe that he

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.440
 gets caught on.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.520
 So he has to exit wearing only a bag and it kept rustling or rather, that was the scene

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.480
 and he thought, how are we going to do this without it causing so much noise that you're

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.680
 not going to hear the scene?

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.640
 So he went away and invented a silent grocery bag.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.640
 Wow.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.640
 Yeah.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.640
 And it's used in tons of movies now.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.960
 And he's expanded his horizons.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.120
 It's not just grocery bags.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.360
 He's got department store bags, bakery bags, lunch store bags, doggie bags.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.720
 He's done silent gift tissue and silent cellophane for wrapping flowers in.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.720
 Wow.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.720
 Which aren't completely silent.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.720
 You can hear them slightly.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.520
 Because it would be weird if someone was wrapping up present.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.520
 That was no sound effect.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.520
 Yeah.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.520
 You would believe it.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.520
 Well, no, that's the point.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.520
 Exactly.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.520
 You added on post with Foley.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.520
 Yeah.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.440
 So how do you know what they're made of?

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.440
 Well, I've tried to find out, but I wonder if it's if I haven't dug hard enough or it's

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.400
 an industry secret that he's holding onto, like the secrets of Coca-Cola mix.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.280
 He could at least tell theatres, couldn't he?

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.760
 He could at least put them on boiled sweets in theatres because I think that's where that

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.360
 causes the most problems is plus the plastic crackling thing.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.800
 There is a company called Silent Snacks that in 2016 launched a whole load of products

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.720
 to have in cinemas and theatres which don't Russell or don't make any noise.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720
 Wow.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720
 Like what?

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.040
 Ground popcorn.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:37.240
 No, basically, instead of being like lumps of popcorn, it's just kind of popcorn dust.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.240
 Disgusting.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.120
 Cocoa butter balls.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.840
 They kind of melt in your mouth rather than like, I guess, like heavenms at my crunch thing.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.600
 And crisps, they've got silent crisps.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.560
 Well, they're dehydrated past slices.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.120
 Apparently they're just bendy enough to be pleasant, but not too crisp.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.440
 I don't think any level of bendiness in my crisp is pleasant.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.440
 No.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.440
 No, I don't think you want a bending crystal.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.240
 I think, if you hear the phrase, it's just bendy enough to be pleasant.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.640
 I thought dates were taking a banter.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.720
 They also invented an anti-gas grapefruit drink.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720
 Anti-gas.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.720
 Anti-gas.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.720
 Anti-gas.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.320
 Stop you burping and farting, yeah.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.720
 Is that a major problem in cinemas?

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.960
 It is if you go with me.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.960
 Wow.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.800
 Could you play the last ten minutes again, please?

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:32.920
 So, on movie props, the same newspaper has been being read in movies for about 20 years.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.240
 There's this one newspaper that keeps cropping up in lots and lots of films.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.240
 It's been in no country for old men.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.040
 It's been in the Texas Chainsaw massacre.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.040
 It's been in desperate housewives.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.720
 So when you see someone in a film reading a paper, do you know other headlamps?

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.720
 Can you remember that?

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.720
 No, I don't.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.720
 I didn't write it down.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.720
 Man lands on moon.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:58.560
 I'll just go one more thing on how to keep a set quiet in your filming.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.680
 Lord of the Rings, when they were filming, they obviously had a ginormous crew and there

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.480
 were two people on that crew whose job it was to sit at the local airport that they were

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.520
 closest to when they were filming and to call ahead when planes were taking off.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.760
 So they knew to not film a scene because very soon, yeah, they would have the sound.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.920
 So you didn't have the sound of error plays, you just had lots of sounds of mobile phones

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.920
 going off.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:24.000
 That's what Gandalf's pocket was buzzing.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.520
 In Lord of the Rings, one of the props they had actually was a giant ring or a big ring

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.520
 anyway.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.000
 So they had to have quite a lot of rings.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.320
 There's one ring to rule them all, et cetera, but there's actually a number of replicas.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.400
 Bringing another one of those one rings to rule them all.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.760
 So it can fit different fingers because different people wear it, but then also they had

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.200
 a really big one about the size of a football it looks like in the photos.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.400
 And that's for when you do wheeled closeups, then you want it to look really intricate.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.280
 So there's a scene where when you know you can sort of tell it's a really seminal scene

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.320
 in the fellowship of the ring where Frodo drops the ring, he's supposed to be carrying

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320
 it.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.320
 And he's like, oh no, where's it gone?

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.600
 And he looks up and Boram is picking it up and you see the ring being picked up out

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.600
 of the snow.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.600
 And that's a giant ring.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.600
 And when you make a giant hand.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.800
 No, you don't see his hand come down.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.840
 You see the chain attached to the ring be lifted up, so they made a big chain to go with it.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.840
 Cool.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840
 I know.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.880
 I thought you were going to say because are they all dwarfs or something in all the rings

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.880
 harbors?

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.840
 Yeah, so you'd need a big one to make it look like they're all really small.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.560
 Is that not what I don't think that was wiper, maybe it had that.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560
 That's so great.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.360
 So that's the only prop they had to adjust the size of the hobbits.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.240
 So they got their hands over a ring, you can see Frodo's enormous ring.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.840
 They're not borrowers.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.440
 I haven't seen it in the in the book or in the whole thing.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.120
 Does the ring change size?

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.120
 No.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.120
 No.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.120
 I think so.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.120
 Does everyone in the line of the rings like have the same size fingers?

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.120
 Yeah, that's a great question.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.120
 I don't know.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.120
 You never wear it.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.120
 You never wear the ring because of it.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.120
 Yeah, they do.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.120
 They go disappearing.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.120
 It makes you visible.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.520
 It presumably must be magic to adjust to the owner's finger or some people it just

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.520
 doesn't fit on.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.760
 Maybe sometimes you can put it like, for instance, my wife's wedding ring will fit on my

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.760
 little finger.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.760
 Yeah.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.760
 So maybe they do that.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.760
 No, it's not.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.760
 Okay.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.960
 This ring has the power to create evil across the world.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.360
 My wife's wedding ring.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.400
 It can adjust size according to kind of it.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400
 Is that a thing?

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.400
 I don't know if it is.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.400
 I don't know.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.040
 So if I tried to put it on my neck, could it kind of get bigger so it went on my neck?

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.040
 It's a magic ring.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.040
 I could do whatever it wants.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.040
 No one.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.040
 But he never says.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.040
 Oh, and then it made itself a bit smaller.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.040
 So it could hit on Frodo's tiny things.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040
 It's not Frodo's card.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.320
 Those scenes were deleted.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.880
 Oh, my goodness.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.840
 Oh, I was reading a few blogs by a woman called Ellen Freund.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.760
 I think F.R.E.U.N.D. who is, I think she's one of Hollywood's main prop makers, really.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.760
 It was really interesting.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.320
 So she did the props for Mad Men and stuff like that, really good period pieces.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.080
 But it must be so frustrating because a lot of the props that you make as a prop maker

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.600
 never get seen by an audience, they're just to create the environment for the actors.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.200
 So as you were saying, every single draw that someone opened in Mad Men, you wouldn't see

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.280
 inside it from the camera angle.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.560
 But the actors had to see all the stuff they thought their character might have.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.560
 You joking.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.560
 No way.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.680
 Surely you can just put a little post it now saying there is a, you know, stuff in this

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680
 drama.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.680
 There is stuff in this drama.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.680
 Yeah.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.680
 No, these people can't pretend that there's stuff in this drama.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.680
 You've got to see the stuff.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.680
 That's so patsy.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680
 Yeah.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.960
 So they're not very good actors at all.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.400
 But if the actors are freaked out by an empty draw, imagine how they're going to be freaked

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.200
 out by the massive film crew who are on the other half of their office.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.200
 Yeah.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.200
 They all have to disguise themselves as wallpaper.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.200
 Laughter.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.200
 Laughter.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:54.040
 Then I'll have to hide behind the picture of the countryside.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.600
 She made some kind of creepy also making props, Ellen did, because she said, you can obviously

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.120
 Google stuff what things look like when you're trying to work out, you know, what a book

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.840
 would have looked like in the 1920s.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.840
 Yeah.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.840
 You can't possibly imagine.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.400
 But it shows in the one object that it hasn't really changed for a long time.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.400
 Laughter.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.520
 She said, you, really, the only way you can get a proper idea for what, let's say she has

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:21.360
 to design a bunch of stuff for 13 reasons why it was she worked on, which is contemporary

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.360
 teenagers.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.360
 Right.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.160
 She said, you've got to go out into the world and see what they're actually wearing.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.360
 So she said, I've got to go out and stand near high school's friends.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.040
 And I'll watch the children all day to make sure that I understand what they're back

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.040
 back.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.440
 But surely they all just wear school uniforms.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.400
 And maybe she goes to the Mafty schools.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.400
 Mafty schools.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.400
 Yeah.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.680
 It is Mafty in 13 reasons why.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.680
 There you go.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.680
 Yeah.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680
 So she goes to Mafty schools.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.160
 And then she says, I'll go down to the mall where I know the kids are shopping and then

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.680
 I'll watch them there to see what sort of stuff they're, I mean, she must look like a real

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.680
 weirdo.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.680
 Yeah.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.680
 Yeah.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.400
 Especially depending on the kind of thing you're filming as well.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.400
 Yes.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.400
 If you're filming something set in a morgue, you have to go and hang out around a morgue

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.400
 or see what they're wearing.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.400
 But make sure you go to a Mafty mall.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.400
 Okay.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:13.040
 It's time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.320
 My fact is that eating ginger can make you feel better about drinking out of a toilet.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:21.000
 Is that because it tastes a bit better?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 It's not.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.920
 And this is a, by the way, this is a toilet that's never been used.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.920
 Oh, okay.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.680
 So would you drink out of a toilet that's never been used?

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.680
 Yes.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.680
 Do I have any other options?

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.560
 Like, could I just drink out of a glass instead?

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.560
 No, the glass.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.560
 There's no glass.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.560
 There's no glass.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.560
 So am I really thirsty?

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.160
 No, you had a cup of tea about an hour ago.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.720
 Was there a ginger biscuit I had with this cup of tea?

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.720
 All right.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.720
 Okay.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720
 Yeah, I'm cool.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.720
 Yeah.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.720
 I can see it works.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.720
 So this is an experiment.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.200
 Ginger is said to help prevent nausea.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.160
 And there's a lot of debate about whether you get disgusted because of a moral judgment

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.440
 that you've made or whether it's kind of the other way around, whether a moral judgment's

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.680
 guide, what we then find disgusting or whether disgust is inherent.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.160
 And then we just based on that.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.280
 So there was an experiment at the University of British Columbia, which gave patients ginger

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:13.920
 capsules and it experimented how disgusting people found things when they had had those,

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.640
 as opposed to when they hadn't had those.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:21.600
 So the experiment found that it reduced how disgusted people were by moderately disgusting

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.240
 photos, like a photo with some snot in a napkin.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.000
 But it did not help extremely disgusting things like form it in a toilet.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 Right.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.080
 And they then tested how it affected so-called purity violations, which is a bit breaking

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.840
 taboos about purity and cleanliness.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:43.440
 So for example, people who'd taken ginger were less strict about moderate violations like

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.640
 drinking from a never-used toilet bowl.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.880
 But apparently it did not have an effect on extreme purity violations like sex between

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.880
 cousins.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.880
 Right.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:56.720
 But if you had more ginger, do you think, yeah, how much ginger would you need?

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.880
 Just like your cousin.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:05.480
 It just implies that eating ginger, you can numb your moral compass, right?

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.120
 If you have to commit a crime, there's nothing you can do, and you're grossed out by it.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.960
 If I have a shed load of ginger, then I'll feel less guilty.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.680
 They said it works to a certain extent, but it depends on the crime you think it works.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.880
 It only works on really, really minor crimes.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.880
 Yeah.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.400
 I think that came out a few years ago that was saying that the more easily disgusted you are,

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.080
 the more likely you are to be conservative, and it can actually be used as a predictor

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.080
 of your voting even.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.160
 And this holds true across 121 countries they looked at.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.680
 So the more conservative people are, the more easily triggered their disgust reactions

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.680
 are.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:41.000
 What I found interesting is that, like you say, the people who are more disgusted are more

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.720
 likely to vote conservative, but also that between 2013 and 2016, the value of ginger

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.960
 imported into the UK has fallen by 15%.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.440
 So maybe that's why we've become a more conservative country.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.920
 People are eating less ginger.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.920
 Maybe.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.840
 Let's start giving out gingerbread biscuits on the streets.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.640
 You know there's a thing called disgustology, as scientists do look into this, call themselves

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.120
 disgustologists, kind of a self-given name.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.400
 That might become a surname in like 200 years.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.560
 Well, one woman who could have it is Professor Val Curtis, who has a lot of the thing you

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.280
 have to do when you're one of these scientists is you have to come up with scenarios.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.720
 And in one of her experiments, she had to come up with 70 different scenarios, and I just

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.880
 wanted to tell you a few of them, can you just tell me whether they're disgusting or not.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.880
 So imagining a hairless old cat rubbing up against one's leg.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880
 All right.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.840
 I'm not a big fan of cats in general, actually.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.840
 OK.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.440
 That's a Siamese cat in my head.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.440
 All right.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.760
 Stepping on a slug in bare feet hates having actual phobia of slugs.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.760
 OK.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.760
 It's OK for me.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.760
 Feeling someone coffin to your face.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760
 I'm OK.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.760
 I'm OK.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.320
 I'm better with that than with the slugs.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.320
 OK.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.440
 Shaking hands with someone with scabby fingers.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.440
 Fine.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.440
 That's all right.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.200
 Yeah, I'm a bit like, but I wouldn't be disgusted.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.040
 I think I am the scabby fingers.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.080
 Finding out a friend attempted to have sex with a piece of fruit.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.920
 I mean, you're only ever going to be amused by that.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.840
 It depends on the fruit.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.040
 What fruit would not be amusing?

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.040
 It's true.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.040
 It's true.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.040
 Two more.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.920
 Learning your neighbour defecates in his back garden.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.920
 Is that disgusting?

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.320
 It's his own back garden.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.320
 Yeah.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.320
 But he's your neighbour.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.320
 And the final one is this disgusting o not.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.320
 "Seeing pus coming from a genital sore."

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.320
 That doesn't mean it.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.320
 That's up quite quickly.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.320
 Yeah.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.320
 I read a thing.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.640
 There's this psychologist have this idea that we have disgusted disposal effect.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.840
 See, I do that if we are surrounded by things that disgust us, we really want

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.280
 to get out of the situation.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.440
 The study showed that if you were selling stuff, if you were exposed to things that disgusted

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.440
 you and then you had to do your deal, you would reduce the price massively just to get

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.440
 out of the situation.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440
 Does that make sense?

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:02.320
 So if you're in a room that's full of vomit, and you're selling something on eBay, you

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.440
 will accept a lower amount, but you're on a desktop computer which can't be moved out

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.440
 of the room.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.520
 And the only power point is in that room that's full of vomit.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.520
 Yeah.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.520
 We did a different thing in their experiments.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.520
 Oh, well.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.520
 Yeah.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.520
 We'll design our experiments differently.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.520
 That's my one.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.520
 Yeah.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520
 It's weird though.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.640
 It does, because I think if you could then go to a market and haggle and you could manufacture,

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:31.640
 like say, put a naked, hairless old cat against the man's leg who's selling you the trinket,

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.640
 you could reduce your price.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.640
 Naturally.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.640
 So I have one.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.640
 I've been a market haggling for a trinket.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.640
 Yeah.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.640
 And I've got my hairless naked old cat under my arm.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.640
 Yeah.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.640
 I need to rub that against the seller.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.640
 You might get the reduced price.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.640
 You might scabby fingers as well.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.640
 Yeah.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.720
 But then tell you, do you know, I just tried to have sex with that mango.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.640
 I think this is all it dulled trumps the art of the deal, isn't it?

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:02.640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.640
 OK, that's it.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.120
 That is all of our facts.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.320
