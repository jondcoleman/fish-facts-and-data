00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 "Did you know what that woulda worked, isn't it?"

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,400
 "Did you know what that woulda worked, isn't it?"

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,120
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,520
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,520
 Anna Chazinski.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,320
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,000
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Chazinski.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,200
 My fact this week is that the rear-view mirror was invented so that racing drivers didn't

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,000
 have to have a person sitting next to them in the car explaining what was going on behind

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 them.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,600
 Yes, I think bizarrely I found this out because I saw a post for an insurance site or something,

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,560
 but anyway, it was invented for the Indy 500 inaugural race in 1911, so the Indy 500 is

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,920
 that big race that happens in Indianapolis.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,800
 1911, it was one by a guy called Ray Haroon.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,600
 And basically the reason he won it was that he realised that the cars always had two people

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,720
 in them, the driver, and then the person who had to do a number of things, one of which

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,760
 included turning round and saying if there were any cars behind them in dangerous positions

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,040
 to make sure there wasn't a pile up or a big crash.

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,640
 And Ray thought that's a lot of extra weight, wonder if I can avoid that, and what he did

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,800
 was he got a mirror and placed it in the middle of his car, hanging in the middle of his car

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,240
 on a pole, and then he won the race because he halved the weight in the car.

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,440
 He did win the race, although we're not 100% sure that he actually won the race.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,840
 As in, he got given the prize, but the truth was that no one really knew how to count all

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,360
 the laps or time things or anything like that, and there were loads of pit stops, so really

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,320
 no one actually knew who won the race.

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
 How did they decide?

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,840
 They just went, I feel like it should be over now, next person to cross the line.

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
 A little bit like that.

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,680
 There was a guy whose job it was to kind of putt who was in the lead, and they would change

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,000
 it every now and then.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,960
 But the truth was that some people took two minutes to change a tire, some people took

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,000
 them 15 minutes to change a tire, some cars would come out of the pit lane, and then back

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,800
 up over the finishing line, and then go back over again so it added an extra, that really

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
 happened.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
 Oh my god.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,720
 That couldn't have been loud.

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,480
 They didn't know what was going on at all.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,280
 They just didn't have the technology to work out times or anything like this.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,200
 It sounds like a cheat that you would do in Mario Kart.

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,560
 I remember doing that kind of thing in Diddy Kong racing, and you see how close you can loop

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,200
 around the finishing kind of post for it to count.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
 And it never does.

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
 Never does.

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,360
 So the technology there is more advanced than that.

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,760
 There was a guy called Mulford, who was pretty sure that he'd won, and he went across

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,960
 the finishing line.

49
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,520
 And then what you always did was you did an insurance lap at the end just to make sure

50
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,480
 that you've done the right distance, because people might think, oh, you've done one

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
 not enough.

52
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,240
 And so he did his insurance lap, and then when he got to the end of the insurance

53
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,720
 lap, he found that someone else had claimed the victory, which was Haroon, and Haroon was

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,360
 already being shared as the victor.

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
 And he's like, no way.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,960
 I finished like two minutes ago.

57
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
 Wow.

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,280
 I think that Haroon used to work as a chauffeur.

59
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,280
 And he apparently, I read one account that said, he got the idea for a review mirror in

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,880
 a car from a review mirror that he saw in a horse-drawn carriage.

61
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
 That's what he said.

62
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
 Certainly.

63
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,520
 Well, that makes sense, because pretty much everything in cars came from horse-drawn

64
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
 carriages, didn't they?

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
 I guess so.

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,240
 I think you have a horse-drawn carriage with mirrors.

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,360
 I was looking for a horse-drawn carriage mirrors, and I don't think they were really a thing.

68
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,000
 The only reference I could find to advising there be mirrors in horse-drawn carriages were

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,720
 saying there has to be a mirror in order that the lady in the carriage at some point

70
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,760
 might want to check her makeup.

71
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,600
 Yeah, it seems like that was the real innovator that guy in the horse-drawn carriage that

72
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 he saw.

73
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
 Yeah.

74
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,400
 Just on horse-drawn carriages and how they sort of competed with cars, there was this

75
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,880
 early concept in 1899 when there was a point where cars and horse-drawn carriages were into

76
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,840
 mingling and it was scaring farmers and it was particularly scaring horses.

77
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,880
 So a guy called Uriah Smith, and this was in Battle Creek, Michigan, invented this contraption

78
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,680
 called the horsey horseless carriage, and you put a horse's head on the front of your car,

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,120
 and it looks like you're just riding a horse, but you're actually driving your car.

80
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,600
 It's all sort of except that the horse doesn't have a back end, doesn't it?

81
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,800
 Yeah, I guess if you were approaching a horse, it would be like, "Oh yeah, this is

82
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
 a horse."

83
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,040
 It's like if the horse was entering the room and only its head had popped in, you might

84
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
 think it was a horse.

85
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 Yeah.

86
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
 But then?

87
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,120
 Is it like a pantomime if one guy doesn't turn up?

88
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,720
 It is like that, and it's quite frightening, because it's just up to the neck.

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,560
 It looks like someone's stuffed and mounted a horse's head and stuck it on the front of

90
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
 their car to our eyes.

91
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
 Yeah.

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,520
 And the other thing was that they said, because I read a bit about it, they said that

93
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,880
 I think the horse's head was full of petrol, because it was an extra fuel reserve in case

94
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,200
 you ran it in the main tank. It is a good idea until you hit something, at which point it

95
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,960
 becomes a real fire liability, because you just smash a big petrol tank into someone else.

96
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
 Explosion.

97
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
 Oh yeah.

98
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
 But they were so paranoid, weren't they?

99
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,600
 I think we did a QI episode on this a few years ago, but there was that thing where various

100
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,680
 rules were written in the highway code or equivalent in America, which said things like,

101
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,000
 if you're driving a car and you think a horse is approaching about a mile away, you hear

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,880
 a horse topping in approach, you have to carry with you a scene of the surrounding countryside

103
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,360
 which you stop your car and you throw the countryside scene over your car.

104
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,760
 That's so annoying, especially when it's just a guy with two coconuts walking past you.

105
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,080
 I thought it was that you had to dismantle the car.

106
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
 And sometimes you had to dismantle the car.

107
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
 The whole car.

108
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,640
 Yeah, you just sort of had to take it apart and hide it by the hedge.

109
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,960
 That was written down as well.

110
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,000
 Now I remember researching this and I think there was a lot of exaggeration about so I could

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,520
 never work out what they actually did and what was actually written as a joke in the highway

112
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 code.

113
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,440
 And I don't think they ever actually fully produced the horsey horseless thing.

114
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
 It was, yeah, it was concept designed and patented, yeah.

115
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
 Yeah.

116
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,720
 There have been some great car patents over the years though, I was looking at some of them.

117
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,480
 So one car invention that never really took off was a 1935, the dog sack, which is if you

118
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,640
 don't want to keep your pet in your car because it gets hair everywhere, then it's a sack

119
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,400
 that clamps onto the running board of the car and then it hooks onto an open window and

120
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,600
 you tie your dog up in it and you can carry it outside the car.

121
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,480
 That's good because dogs like to stick their head out of the window, don't they?

122
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
 Perfect.

123
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
 They're just now the whole body's outside the window.

124
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 Yeah.

125
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
 That's what they've always wanted.

126
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
 Just put a dog in one of those.

127
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,880
 It would probably stick its head in the window.

128
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,480
 I think dogs just like to stick their head through windows.

129
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
 That's my theory.

130
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
 Yeah.

131
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
 Right.

132
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
 That's true.

133
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
 Did you hear about the steering wheel of death?

134
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
 No.

135
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,800
 This is a car innovation on a Cadillac, the 1954 Cadillac El Dorado.

136
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,000
 This is obviously really expensive cars, you know, they're very luxurious.

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,760
 But the steering wheel of this Cadillac had a kind of bullet-shaped spike in the middle

138
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
 of it.

139
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
 Right.

140
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,920
 So imagine a really large bullet, the pointy end of the bullet, you know, at the front

141
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,160
 end as it were.

142
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,280
 So that was just in the middle of the steering wheel.

143
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,040
 So obviously that's quite dangerous in the event of a crash.

144
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,560
 And that's how it got the nickname.

145
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,680
 And Sammy Davis, Jr., he had a crash in one of those cars and his face hit the wheel and

146
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,320
 he lost an eye as a result.

147
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,800
 So do you explain why they had this spike in the steering wheel?

148
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
 Eusthetics.

149
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 No way.

150
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
 Designed.

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
 It's not useful.

152
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
 It wasn't useful for anything.

153
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,680
 It was, you know, when that was the era when cars had these fantastic cars.

154
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,360
 Oh, that was the era where there were spikes in the middle of every car, like an iron

155
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
 maiden.

156
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
 You would drive around.

157
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
 Boxes of TNT.

158
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,480
 It's more rounded than a full-on spike.

159
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
 Right.

160
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
 It doesn't look like an extra spike.

161
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,920
 But it does look like a big bullet.

162
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,320
 The Sammy Davis Jr. lost his eye because of that.

163
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
 Wow.

164
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,320
 Well, there was that idea that someone came up with, which was just a design idea.

165
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,360
 It wasn't real of putting a massive spike in every steering wheel.

166
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,560
 And the idea is that it would just make everyone drive really carefully.

167
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,800
 Oh, yeah.

168
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
 The opposite of an airbag.

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,200
 It's a real carrot or stick kind of a foot.

170
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
 Yeah.

171
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,840
 The Duke of Edinburgh has been impaled again.

172
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
 Yeah.

173
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,520
 Here's another Cadillac invention just very quickly that didn't work out.

174
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,440
 They tried to put working toilets in the inside of their cars.

175
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,760
 That was in 1947.

176
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
 You can see photos of it.

177
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
 It looks really incredible.

178
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
 Great idea.

179
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
 It was in the back seat.

180
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
 Yeah.

181
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,600
 And you would have what was a proper toilet in this photo.

182
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,000
 But the problem was it just didn't make sense really to have it.

183
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 What?

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Why not?

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Why not?

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,960
 Because the amount of space that you'd need for the tank, for the flush, the smell was

187
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
 too great.

188
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,800
 There was a lot of splash back, apparently, in the testing and the smells.

189
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
 Yeah.

190
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
 These feel like problems we can overcome.

191
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
 Yeah.

192
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
 It looked so cool.

193
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,480
 And this splash bag, for instance, obviously don't have it be water-based, silly.

194
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,920
 Oh, just have it like a cat litter tray.

195
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
 Exactly.

196
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,000
 It makes handcastles if you don't need the loo.

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 It's multi-purpose.

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,080
 That's to think there are lots of rules, aren't there, about how fun you can make things

199
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
 on the road.

200
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
 Like service stations.

201
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
 Right.

202
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
 There are rules.

203
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,000
 In fact, there are laws about what you're allowed to have at a service station, because

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,200
 the road, the motorway network is so important for people for, you know, transport that you

205
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,440
 can't have say, I don't know, a casino at a service station, because you can't have anything

206
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
 there that would mean people went there, especially.

207
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,240
 It's interesting though, because every single service station does have slot machines in it.

208
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
 Yeah.

209
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
 Remember when we were on tour?

210
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
 Literally every single one.

211
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
 Yeah.

212
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
 Casino was a very bad example.

213
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
 I don't know, kind of thing.

214
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
 Brothels?

215
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
 Brothels.

216
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
 Brothels.

217
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
 Brothels.

218
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
 That's the only reason there are no problems.

219
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
 Thanks to the MNAT.

220
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:26,720
 There has to be just, you know, refueling going to the toilet and the slot machine.

221
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
 There's so much fun stuff on the British highway.

222
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,320
 Well, they very recently opened a weather spoons in one of them, didn't they?

223
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
 And that was a massive deal.

224
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,800
 And everyone thought it was a terrible idea, because you shouldn't have.

225
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,280
 Be able to sell our collar service stations, but they didn't do.

226
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,240
 I went into a box that simulated a hurricane on one of the slots.

227
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
 On one of our tour.

228
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
 Did you make a special journey?

229
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
 Would you make a special journey?

230
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
 No, we weren't.

231
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
 No, no, no, no.

232
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
 It was just as off as very dangerous.

233
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
 I do.

234
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,680
 But I've never heard of that being anywhere else, like a hurricane box.

235
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
 That's true, yeah.

236
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
 So which services was it?

237
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
 It was when we were on tour, our last tour.

238
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,400
 Well, no, Dan, don't encourage it.

239
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,600
 This whole point is you shouldn't make special journeys to a service station.

240
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
 No, I'm going.

241
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
 I'm going.

242
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,240
 Because then I'm going to get drunk at the weather spoons, play a bit of slot machines.

243
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
 Do the hurricane thing.

244
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
 Go to the brothel and then try back.

245
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
 Great news.

246
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
 I got blown off of the services.

247
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
 I'm done.

248
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
 I did the hurricane box.

249
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,000
 Back to the Indy 500, would you mind?

250
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,720
 So one of the things with the Indy 500 winners is that they drink a cup of milk after the

251
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
 race.

252
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,400
 And it's a tradition that was born in 1936, Lewis Mayer.

253
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,600
 He finished and he asked for buttermilk after the race.

254
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,440
 And it was a dairy executive who saw him drinking it in a picture.

255
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,240
 And they sort of, they must have approached them.

256
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,080
 And that tradition was born.

257
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,720
 And so when you're going to race, they ask you what kind of milk would you like just so

258
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
 we can have it ready for you?

259
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,440
 Does that mean like a full fat or half fat?

260
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
 Exactly.

261
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
 And, uh, majorotively, it's full fat.

262
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,560
 They found, uh, they just released the latest, um, sort of preference.

263
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
 I'm sorry.

264
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
 I was kidding.

265
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
 Why are you surprised by that?

266
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
 I'm just like something's going to milk.

267
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,800
 And you thought, because you're such a great racing driver, you thought, oh, my buddies.

268
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,720
 Well, in this, in this hipster era, they must be having to stock way more milk than

269
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
 usual.

270
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,240
 They'll be having almond and oats and lactose free.

271
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,000
 In 1913, the winner was Joule Gu, who was a French driver.

272
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,640
 He won by 13 minutes, actually.

273
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,200
 Um, but he drank champagne throughout the race.

274
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,760
 In fact, um, some people think he might have had as many as six bottles of champagne during

275
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,960
 the course of the race.

276
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
 Wow.

277
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
 Awesome.

278
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,120
 He definitely had at least half a pint in his first pit stop.

279
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,960
 And then he was drinking it throughout the race.

280
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
 Wow.

281
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,280
 So he won the race, but he did lose his driving license.

282
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,040
 You would really have benefited from the car with a toilet in the back.

283
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
 Yes, definitely.

284
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,080
 You can't climb into the back of the car, I'll probably be racing.

285
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,200
 The trophy for the Indy 500 for people who aren't familiar with it, which I wasn't really

286
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
 is ridiculous.

287
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,360
 It's amazing.

288
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
 It's revolting.

289
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
 So it is.

290
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
 I love it.

291
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
 Dan loves it.

292
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,520
 It's, um, so it's five at all.

293
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
 It's ridiculously large.

294
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,680
 Uh, it's all made of silver.

295
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,360
 And as soon as you win the race, you get your head sculpted onto it and attach.

296
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,200
 And then they ran out of space on it and in the 80s, I think so they had to add an extra

297
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,240
 level so they could get more heads on it.

298
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,960
 So it's got all the old guys heads as well.

299
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
 It's the old heads.

300
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,720
 He's got a French guy looking a bit pissed.

301
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
 Yeah.

302
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,640
 Everyone else has got like that milk mustache that you get.

303
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,160
 Okay, it's time for fact number two.

304
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,680
 And that is James.

305
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,200
 Okay, my fact this week is that a 2018 paper suggesting that people who have a surname,

306
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,200
 which occurs towards the end of the alphabet, are more likely to end up academically and

307
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,040
 professionally undistinguished, was co-authored by Professor Jeffrey Zachs.

308
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,960
 I love co-author because he couldn't even individually alter his own.

309
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,920
 Well, he co-authored it with a guy whose name was Corley beginning with C.

310
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
 Yeah.

311
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
 Yeah.

312
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
 He was the brains behind it.

313
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
 Wasn't he?

314
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,960
 Jeffrey Zachs is quite cool, actually.

315
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,080
 He's a University of Boulder psychologist and I listened to an interview with him on a radio

316
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,520
 show called Top of the Mind and they asked him, you know, is there reason you're doing this

317
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,000
 because obviously you had a bad time of it because of your name.

318
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,400
 And he said he was sensitized to the issue because of that, but actually it doesn't affect

319
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,920
 him because according to their studies, it doesn't affect people who are distinguished

320
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
 in any other way.

321
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,000
 So if you're kind of top of your class at school or bottom of your class or you look different

322
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,880
 or you're more attractive or less attractive, it doesn't really affect you.

323
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,160
 It only affects people who are right in the middle, but they found that actually it does affect

324
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
 them.

325
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,360
 It means it gives them less distinction at high school, less satisfaction at high school and

326
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,040
 lower educational attainment after they've left school.

327
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,400
 And until you're about middle aged, it affects you quite badly according to them.

328
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
 What's the justification here?

329
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,960
 Is it just about reading out the register?

330
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
 No.

331
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,800
 So there are a few different reasons.

332
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,000
 It's, so for instance, infant school, a lot of kids are putting alphabetical order.

333
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,640
 So the kids beginning with A near the front of the class, which means they get more attention.

334
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,320
 They don't just tend to get asked more for things.

335
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,640
 So for not school, for instance, if your name is towards a start of the alphabet, you're

336
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,680
 less likely to give money to charity.

337
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,320
 And that's because you get run up more because your name is at the front of the alphabet and

338
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,640
 you get more annoyed by it.

339
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,040
 And so you're less likely to give money.

340
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
 Really?

341
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,600
 It's also like, when it's graduation and they're handing out diplomas, this is one of

342
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 the things mentioned.

343
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
 You start 8 a.m.

344
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,560
 It's all really exciting at the top, but by the time you get to Zuckerberg, you know,

345
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,120
 yeah, and that's why he never made anything else out of it, right?

346
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,960
 But when you get to the end, most people have left because they want to get the restaurants

347
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,160
 early and everyone who's applauding their arms are tired and stuff like that.

348
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,280
 And so, and I can understand if you're marking a big pile of exam papers, and Aaron J.

349
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,040
 Aaronson makes a point.

350
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,840
 And then Sammy, Sammy makes up the same point.

351
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,080
 You think, I read this in Aaron J. Aaronson's article and that was hours ago.

352
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
 Yeah, exactly.

353
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
 Exactly.

354
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,600
 So, and the teacher might say, okay, can someone read the report?

355
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,720
 Aaron J. Aaronson, can you do it?

356
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,600
 And then by the time Zuckerberg gets there, he just never gets asked.

357
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,200
 And so, you have less confidence in public speaking as well.

358
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,720
 So, this genuinely does seem to be a thing.

359
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,320
 Yeah, although I'm not sure about his way of, I'm not sure about Zach's way of combating

360
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
 it.

361
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,760
 One of the ways he says he combats it is that he is a professor, so we ask students.

362
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,960
 And he always calls the class register in reverse order, which seems to be, to just be recreating

363
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,800
 the problem for the opposite way around.

364
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,520
 He suggests that people should maybe do something to distinguish themselves like

365
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,160
 dress strangely on something that's one of the specific things he said.

366
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,760
 Like, just so that people notice you because it's the people who aren't noticed who struggle

367
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
 the most.

368
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,360
 And if you're later on in the alphabet, you're more likely not to be noticed if you're otherwise

369
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
 distinguished.

370
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
 Yes, that's right.

371
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,840
 And it works the other way around.

372
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,600
 So, there's another study which is that authors whose surnames are ranked towards the front

373
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,960
 of the alphabet are more likely to be cited in scientific papers.

374
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
 Oh.

375
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,120
 And that was lead offered by a guy called Ass Nalt.

376
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,280
 So he has obviously seen that he's been cited more often than others because he's an

377
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
 A.

378
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,120
 And also he has the word 'ass' in his name, which I help.

379
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,000
 And for presidential candidates in America, that's another thing they think influences because

380
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,120
 that's in alphabetical order as well when you go in for doing that.

381
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,880
 So you're more likely to go for someone at the top of it.

382
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,440
 Who's this George Washington guy who would have self-implaced, isn't he?

383
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
 I know.

384
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
 Who came after him?

385
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
 Adams.

386
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
 Yeah.

387
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,920
 And George Washington only became president because he sees how, as he pulled us out, he

388
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,760
 would put himself in never-of-one a fair election.

389
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
 Yeah, okay.

390
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,600
 There are definitely countries where it's law that on the ballot paper you have to mix it

391
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
 up, aren't there?

392
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,960
 Or you do half and half on ballot papers because people just tick an A because it's a lot

393
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,000
 of effort when you go to the ballot box and you're in a hurry to get to work anyway.

394
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,360
 You just cross the first one you see, don't you?

395
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,200
 One thing I think Zack's found, which is encouraging, is that by the time you're in

396
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,160
 your mid-30s, the effect, lessons, to the point of disappearance.

397
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,680
 Because you've been distinguished in some other way by then.

398
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,040
 So people are judging you not on your name but on what you've done in life.

399
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
 Yeah.

400
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,280
 Oh, I thought it was because you weren't having registered taking any more.

401
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
 Probably not, too.

402
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
 Probably.

403
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
 The time is thirty-five.

404
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,640
 The paper, just for anyone listening, is called Alphabetism, the effects of surname

405
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,280
 initial and the cost of being otherwise undistinguished.

406
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,600
 And that paper has ninety-six citations and I counted them and there are seventy-seven

407
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 from A to M and only seventeen from N to Z.

408
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
 Wow.

409
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
 So they're compounding the problem.

410
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
 Proof.

411
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,720
 I find it so weird that Leonardo da Vinci doesn't have a surname.

412
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
 Always true.

413
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
 Always thought that was his surname.

414
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,680
 All Vinci, just for people who were like me who didn't know that.

415
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
 Yeah.

416
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,120
 But what do you mean by "doesn't have a surname" because our surnames are like that as

417
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
 well.

418
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,520
 In the end, that does end up being your surname.

419
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,560
 So there was, for instance, in 2016, I think that someone compiled a dictionary of

420
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,360
 fifty thousand surnames from Britain that go all the way back to like the eleventh century

421
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,360
 and they found that about half of the most common ones were locative, which is basically

422
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,840
 that ones that say what place you're from.

423
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,520
 You know, so like less, if your surname is Leicester or if you're surnames and I can't

424
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,040
 think of like Jack London or Stafford.

425
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
 Stafford.

426
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
 Exactly.

427
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
 So it's still the same kind of thing.

428
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
 George Washington.

429
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
 George Washington.

430
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
 Yeah.

431
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
 Yeah.

432
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,400
 I don't know if any of your surnames have a mind will be kin will be family of I should

433
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
 think.

434
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
 It's Irish anyway.

435
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
 Yes.

436
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
 Of course.

437
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
 Don't know about Murray.

438
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,240
 Murray, I read ages ago, it's both, there's claims for it in Scotland and Ireland, the

439
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,400
 battle out for what you know.

440
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,840
 Murray is a place presumably in Scotland as well.

441
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
 Moray.

442
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
 Yeah.

443
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
 Murray.

444
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
 Moray Firth.

445
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
 There's a moray eel.

446
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
 Yeah.

447
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
 Yeah.

448
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
 Well, I think there's an eel somewhere in my family tree.

449
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
 Yeah.

450
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,040
 Tishinsky means son of Tishinsky.

451
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,000
 Tishinsky is like a bird.

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,240
 The name is like a bird.

453
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,160
 So some are descriptors and that's one of the most common types of name you have as well

454
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
 when you go back.

455
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
 Why are you looking at me?

456
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
 I am like a bird.

457
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
 I'm like a bird.

458
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
 I'm like a bird.

459
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
 That's right.

460
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,840
 Well, about a fifth of surnames in fact in our country are like that as in descriptors.

461
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
 So like good fellow.

462
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,440
 That's a nice descriptive one.

463
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
 Yeah.

464
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,240
 Short is either means that the person who had that nickname was really short or it often

465
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,000
 meant that they were really tall.

466
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 So you never know.

467
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,800
 Because it was like the funny ironic thing, you know, and you're like, all right, sure.

468
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 See, it was a tall guy.

469
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
 There were quite a lot of those.

470
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 That's sick.

471
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
 Does it?

472
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,320
 Could it mean that whoever was called Godfellow was actually a bit of a twatter?

473
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
 Yeah.

474
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:35,960
 Whereas we're as poor Derek Twatt from one of the nicest and kindest families in the town.

475
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,720
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

476
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,080
 And that is my fact.

477
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,320
 My fact this week is that grocery bags used in Hollywood movies don't rustle.

478
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
 Oh, yeah.

479
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,960
 Why aren't we allowed them?

480
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
 I know.

481
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,360
 So this is something that I read on a website called proptrics.com.

482
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,640
 This is the website of a man who invented these bags.

483
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,720
 I'm about to tell you about Tim Schultz's name.

484
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,000
 And it's when on movie sets, you see people carrying any kind of bags.

485
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,360
 Especially when you're recording, that makes so much noise that they can't cancel out that

486
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
 it ruins scenes.

487
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,160
 I have to constantly rerecord scenes.

488
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,200
 And he was on the set of a TV show back in the day that starred Martin Lawrence called

489
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,440
 Martin.

490
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,440
 And Martin, as he's coming into the room, gets his pants taken off by a doorframe that he

491
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
 gets caught on.

492
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,520
 So he has to exit wearing only a bag and it kept rustling or rather, that was the scene

493
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,480
 and he thought, how are we going to do this without it causing so much noise that you're

494
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,680
 not going to hear the scene?

495
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,640
 So he went away and invented a silent grocery bag.

496
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
 Wow.

497
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
 Yeah.

498
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
 And it's used in tons of movies now.

499
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,960
 And he's expanded his horizons.

500
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,120
 It's not just grocery bags.

501
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,360
 He's got department store bags, bakery bags, lunch store bags, doggie bags.

502
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,720
 He's done silent gift tissue and silent cellophane for wrapping flowers in.

503
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
 Wow.

504
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
 Which aren't completely silent.

505
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
 You can hear them slightly.

506
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,520
 Because it would be weird if someone was wrapping up present.

507
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
 That was no sound effect.

508
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
 Yeah.

509
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
 You would believe it.

510
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
 Well, no, that's the point.

511
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
 Exactly.

512
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
 You added on post with Foley.

513
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
 Yeah.

514
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,440
 So how do you know what they're made of?

515
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,440
 Well, I've tried to find out, but I wonder if it's if I haven't dug hard enough or it's

516
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,400
 an industry secret that he's holding onto, like the secrets of Coca-Cola mix.

517
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,280
 He could at least tell theatres, couldn't he?

518
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,760
 He could at least put them on boiled sweets in theatres because I think that's where that

519
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,360
 causes the most problems is plus the plastic crackling thing.

520
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,800
 There is a company called Silent Snacks that in 2016 launched a whole load of products

521
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,720
 to have in cinemas and theatres which don't Russell or don't make any noise.

522
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
 Wow.

523
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
 Like what?

524
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,040
 Ground popcorn.

525
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:37,240
 No, basically, instead of being like lumps of popcorn, it's just kind of popcorn dust.

526
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
 Disgusting.

527
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,120
 Cocoa butter balls.

528
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,840
 They kind of melt in your mouth rather than like, I guess, like heavenms at my crunch thing.

529
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,600
 And crisps, they've got silent crisps.

530
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,560
 Well, they're dehydrated past slices.

531
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,120
 Apparently they're just bendy enough to be pleasant, but not too crisp.

532
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,440
 I don't think any level of bendiness in my crisp is pleasant.

533
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
 No.

534
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
 No, I don't think you want a bending crystal.

535
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,240
 I think, if you hear the phrase, it's just bendy enough to be pleasant.

536
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,640
 I thought dates were taking a banter.

537
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,720
 They also invented an anti-gas grapefruit drink.

538
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
 Anti-gas.

539
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
 Anti-gas.

540
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
 Anti-gas.

541
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,320
 Stop you burping and farting, yeah.

542
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,720
 Is that a major problem in cinemas?

543
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,960
 It is if you go with me.

544
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
 Wow.

545
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,800
 Could you play the last ten minutes again, please?

546
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:32,920
 So, on movie props, the same newspaper has been being read in movies for about 20 years.

547
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,240
 There's this one newspaper that keeps cropping up in lots and lots of films.

548
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
 It's been in no country for old men.

549
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,040
 It's been in the Texas Chainsaw massacre.

550
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
 It's been in desperate housewives.

551
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,720
 So when you see someone in a film reading a paper, do you know other headlamps?

552
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
 Can you remember that?

553
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
 No, I don't.

554
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
 I didn't write it down.

555
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,720
 Man lands on moon.

556
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:58,560
 I'll just go one more thing on how to keep a set quiet in your filming.

557
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,680
 Lord of the Rings, when they were filming, they obviously had a ginormous crew and there

558
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,480
 were two people on that crew whose job it was to sit at the local airport that they were

559
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,520
 closest to when they were filming and to call ahead when planes were taking off.

560
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,760
 So they knew to not film a scene because very soon, yeah, they would have the sound.

561
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,920
 So you didn't have the sound of error plays, you just had lots of sounds of mobile phones

562
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
 going off.

563
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,000
 That's what Gandalf's pocket was buzzing.

564
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,520
 In Lord of the Rings, one of the props they had actually was a giant ring or a big ring

565
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
 anyway.

566
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,000
 So they had to have quite a lot of rings.

567
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,320
 There's one ring to rule them all, et cetera, but there's actually a number of replicas.

568
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,400
 Bringing another one of those one rings to rule them all.

569
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,760
 So it can fit different fingers because different people wear it, but then also they had

570
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,200
 a really big one about the size of a football it looks like in the photos.

571
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,400
 And that's for when you do wheeled closeups, then you want it to look really intricate.

572
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,280
 So there's a scene where when you know you can sort of tell it's a really seminal scene

573
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,320
 in the fellowship of the ring where Frodo drops the ring, he's supposed to be carrying

574
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
 it.

575
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
 And he's like, oh no, where's it gone?

576
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,600
 And he looks up and Boram is picking it up and you see the ring being picked up out

577
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
 of the snow.

578
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
 And that's a giant ring.

579
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
 And when you make a giant hand.

580
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,800
 No, you don't see his hand come down.

581
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,840
 You see the chain attached to the ring be lifted up, so they made a big chain to go with it.

582
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
 Cool.

583
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
 I know.

584
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,880
 I thought you were going to say because are they all dwarfs or something in all the rings

585
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
 harbors?

586
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,840
 Yeah, so you'd need a big one to make it look like they're all really small.

587
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,560
 Is that not what I don't think that was wiper, maybe it had that.

588
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
 That's so great.

589
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,360
 So that's the only prop they had to adjust the size of the hobbits.

590
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,240
 So they got their hands over a ring, you can see Frodo's enormous ring.

591
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,840
 They're not borrowers.

592
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,440
 I haven't seen it in the in the book or in the whole thing.

593
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,120
 Does the ring change size?

594
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
 No.

595
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
 No.

596
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
 I think so.

597
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,120
 Does everyone in the line of the rings like have the same size fingers?

598
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
 Yeah, that's a great question.

599
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
 I don't know.

600
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
 You never wear it.

601
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
 You never wear the ring because of it.

602
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
 Yeah, they do.

603
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
 They go disappearing.

604
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
 It makes you visible.

605
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,520
 It presumably must be magic to adjust to the owner's finger or some people it just

606
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
 doesn't fit on.

607
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,760
 Maybe sometimes you can put it like, for instance, my wife's wedding ring will fit on my

608
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
 little finger.

609
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,760
 Yeah.

610
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
 So maybe they do that.

611
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
 No, it's not.

612
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
 Okay.

613
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,960
 This ring has the power to create evil across the world.

614
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,360
 My wife's wedding ring.

615
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,400
 It can adjust size according to kind of it.

616
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
 Is that a thing?

617
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
 I don't know if it is.

618
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
 I don't know.

619
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,040
 So if I tried to put it on my neck, could it kind of get bigger so it went on my neck?

620
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
 It's a magic ring.

621
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
 I could do whatever it wants.

622
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
 No one.

623
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
 But he never says.

624
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
 Oh, and then it made itself a bit smaller.

625
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
 So it could hit on Frodo's tiny things.

626
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
 It's not Frodo's card.

627
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,320
 Those scenes were deleted.

628
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,880
 Oh, my goodness.

629
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,840
 Oh, I was reading a few blogs by a woman called Ellen Freund.

630
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,760
 I think F.R.E.U.N.D. who is, I think she's one of Hollywood's main prop makers, really.

631
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
 It was really interesting.

632
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,320
 So she did the props for Mad Men and stuff like that, really good period pieces.

633
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,080
 But it must be so frustrating because a lot of the props that you make as a prop maker

634
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,600
 never get seen by an audience, they're just to create the environment for the actors.

635
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,200
 So as you were saying, every single draw that someone opened in Mad Men, you wouldn't see

636
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,280
 inside it from the camera angle.

637
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,560
 But the actors had to see all the stuff they thought their character might have.

638
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
 You joking.

639
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
 No way.

640
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,680
 Surely you can just put a little post it now saying there is a, you know, stuff in this

641
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
 drama.

642
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
 There is stuff in this drama.

643
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,680
 Yeah.

644
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,680
 No, these people can't pretend that there's stuff in this drama.

645
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
 You've got to see the stuff.

646
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
 That's so patsy.

647
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
 Yeah.

648
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,960
 So they're not very good actors at all.

649
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,400
 But if the actors are freaked out by an empty draw, imagine how they're going to be freaked

650
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,200
 out by the massive film crew who are on the other half of their office.

651
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
 Yeah.

652
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
 They all have to disguise themselves as wallpaper.

653
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
 Laughter.

654
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
 Laughter.

655
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,040
 Then I'll have to hide behind the picture of the countryside.

656
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,600
 She made some kind of creepy also making props, Ellen did, because she said, you can obviously

657
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,120
 Google stuff what things look like when you're trying to work out, you know, what a book

658
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,840
 would have looked like in the 1920s.

659
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
 Yeah.

660
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
 You can't possibly imagine.

661
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,400
 But it shows in the one object that it hasn't really changed for a long time.

662
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
 Laughter.

663
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,520
 She said, you, really, the only way you can get a proper idea for what, let's say she has

664
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,360
 to design a bunch of stuff for 13 reasons why it was she worked on, which is contemporary

665
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,360
 teenagers.

666
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
 Right.

667
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,160
 She said, you've got to go out into the world and see what they're actually wearing.

668
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,360
 So she said, I've got to go out and stand near high school's friends.

669
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,040
 And I'll watch the children all day to make sure that I understand what they're back

670
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
 back.

671
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,440
 But surely they all just wear school uniforms.

672
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,400
 And maybe she goes to the Mafty schools.

673
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
 Mafty schools.

674
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
 Yeah.

675
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,680
 It is Mafty in 13 reasons why.

676
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,680
 There you go.

677
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
 Yeah.

678
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
 So she goes to Mafty schools.

679
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,160
 And then she says, I'll go down to the mall where I know the kids are shopping and then

680
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,680
 I'll watch them there to see what sort of stuff they're, I mean, she must look like a real

681
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
 weirdo.

682
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
 Yeah.

683
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
 Yeah.

684
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,400
 Especially depending on the kind of thing you're filming as well.

685
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
 Yes.

686
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,400
 If you're filming something set in a morgue, you have to go and hang out around a morgue

687
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
 or see what they're wearing.

688
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
 But make sure you go to a Mafty mall.

689
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
 Okay.

690
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:13,040
 It's time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

691
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,320
 My fact is that eating ginger can make you feel better about drinking out of a toilet.

692
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,000
 Is that because it tastes a bit better?

693
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 It's not.

694
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,920
 And this is a, by the way, this is a toilet that's never been used.

695
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
 Oh, okay.

696
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,680
 So would you drink out of a toilet that's never been used?

697
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
 Yes.

698
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
 Do I have any other options?

699
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,560
 Like, could I just drink out of a glass instead?

700
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
 No, the glass.

701
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
 There's no glass.

702
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
 There's no glass.

703
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
 So am I really thirsty?

704
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,160
 No, you had a cup of tea about an hour ago.

705
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,720
 Was there a ginger biscuit I had with this cup of tea?

706
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
 Yeah, yeah.

707
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
 All right.

708
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
 Okay.

709
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
 Yeah, I'm cool.

710
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
 Yeah.

711
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
 I can see it works.

712
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
 So this is an experiment.

713
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,200
 Ginger is said to help prevent nausea.

714
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,160
 And there's a lot of debate about whether you get disgusted because of a moral judgment

715
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,440
 that you've made or whether it's kind of the other way around, whether a moral judgment's

716
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,680
 guide, what we then find disgusting or whether disgust is inherent.

717
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,160
 And then we just based on that.

718
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,280
 So there was an experiment at the University of British Columbia, which gave patients ginger

719
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:13,920
 capsules and it experimented how disgusting people found things when they had had those,

720
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,640
 as opposed to when they hadn't had those.

721
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,600
 So the experiment found that it reduced how disgusted people were by moderately disgusting

722
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,240
 photos, like a photo with some snot in a napkin.

723
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,000
 But it did not help extremely disgusting things like form it in a toilet.

724
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Right.

725
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,080
 And they then tested how it affected so-called purity violations, which is a bit breaking

726
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,840
 taboos about purity and cleanliness.

727
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,440
 So for example, people who'd taken ginger were less strict about moderate violations like

728
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,640
 drinking from a never-used toilet bowl.

729
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,880
 But apparently it did not have an effect on extreme purity violations like sex between

730
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
 cousins.

731
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
 Right.

732
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,720
 But if you had more ginger, do you think, yeah, how much ginger would you need?

733
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,880
 Just like your cousin.

734
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:05,480
 It just implies that eating ginger, you can numb your moral compass, right?

735
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,120
 If you have to commit a crime, there's nothing you can do, and you're grossed out by it.

736
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,960
 If I have a shed load of ginger, then I'll feel less guilty.

737
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,680
 They said it works to a certain extent, but it depends on the crime you think it works.

738
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,880
 It only works on really, really minor crimes.

739
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
 Yeah.

740
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,400
 I think that came out a few years ago that was saying that the more easily disgusted you are,

741
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,080
 the more likely you are to be conservative, and it can actually be used as a predictor

742
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
 of your voting even.

743
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,160
 And this holds true across 121 countries they looked at.

744
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,680
 So the more conservative people are, the more easily triggered their disgust reactions

745
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
 are.

746
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,000
 What I found interesting is that, like you say, the people who are more disgusted are more

747
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,720
 likely to vote conservative, but also that between 2013 and 2016, the value of ginger

748
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,960
 imported into the UK has fallen by 15%.

749
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,440
 So maybe that's why we've become a more conservative country.

750
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,920
 People are eating less ginger.

751
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
 Maybe.

752
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,840
 Let's start giving out gingerbread biscuits on the streets.

753
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,640
 You know there's a thing called disgustology, as scientists do look into this, call themselves

754
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,120
 disgustologists, kind of a self-given name.

755
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,400
 That might become a surname in like 200 years.

756
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,560
 Well, one woman who could have it is Professor Val Curtis, who has a lot of the thing you

757
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,280
 have to do when you're one of these scientists is you have to come up with scenarios.

758
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,720
 And in one of her experiments, she had to come up with 70 different scenarios, and I just

759
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,880
 wanted to tell you a few of them, can you just tell me whether they're disgusting or not.

760
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,880
 So imagining a hairless old cat rubbing up against one's leg.

761
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
 All right.

762
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,840
 I'm not a big fan of cats in general, actually.

763
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,840
 OK.

764
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,440
 That's a Siamese cat in my head.

765
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
 All right.

766
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,760
 Stepping on a slug in bare feet hates having actual phobia of slugs.

767
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
 OK.

768
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
 It's OK for me.

769
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
 Feeling someone coffin to your face.

770
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
 I'm OK.

771
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
 I'm OK.

772
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,320
 I'm better with that than with the slugs.

773
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,320
 OK.

774
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,440
 Shaking hands with someone with scabby fingers.

775
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,440
 Fine.

776
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
 That's all right.

777
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,200
 Yeah, I'm a bit like, but I wouldn't be disgusted.

778
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,040
 I think I am the scabby fingers.

779
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,080
 Finding out a friend attempted to have sex with a piece of fruit.

780
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,920
 I mean, you're only ever going to be amused by that.

781
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,840
 It depends on the fruit.

782
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,040
 What fruit would not be amusing?

783
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
 It's true.

784
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
 It's true.

785
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
 Two more.

786
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,920
 Learning your neighbour defecates in his back garden.

787
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
 Is that disgusting?

788
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,320
 It's his own back garden.

789
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
 Yeah.

790
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
 But he's your neighbour.

791
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,320
 And the final one is this disgusting o not.

792
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,320
 "Seeing pus coming from a genital sore."

793
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
 That doesn't mean it.

794
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
 That's up quite quickly.

795
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
 Yeah.

796
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
 [LAUGHTER]

797
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
 I read a thing.

798
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,640
 There's this psychologist have this idea that we have disgusted disposal effect.

799
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,840
 See, I do that if we are surrounded by things that disgust us, we really want

800
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,280
 to get out of the situation.

801
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,440
 The study showed that if you were selling stuff, if you were exposed to things that disgusted

802
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,440
 you and then you had to do your deal, you would reduce the price massively just to get

803
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
 out of the situation.

804
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,440
 Does that make sense?

805
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,320
 So if you're in a room that's full of vomit, and you're selling something on eBay, you

806
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,440
 will accept a lower amount, but you're on a desktop computer which can't be moved out

807
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
 of the room.

808
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,520
 And the only power point is in that room that's full of vomit.

809
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,520
 Yeah.

810
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,520
 We did a different thing in their experiments.

811
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
 Oh, well.

812
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
 Yeah.

813
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
 We'll design our experiments differently.

814
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
 That's my one.

815
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
 Yeah.

816
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
 It's weird though.

817
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,640
 It does, because I think if you could then go to a market and haggle and you could manufacture,

818
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,640
 like say, put a naked, hairless old cat against the man's leg who's selling you the trinket,

819
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
 you could reduce your price.

820
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
 Naturally.

821
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
 [LAUGHTER]

822
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
 So I have one.

823
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
 I've been a market haggling for a trinket.

824
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
 Yeah.

825
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
 And I've got my hairless naked old cat under my arm.

826
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
 Yeah.

827
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
 I need to rub that against the seller.

828
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
 You might get the reduced price.

829
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
 You might scabby fingers as well.

830
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
 Yeah.

831
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,720
 But then tell you, do you know, I just tried to have sex with that mango.

832
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
 [LAUGHTER]

833
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,640
 I think this is all it dulled trumps the art of the deal, isn't it?
