00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.800
 Hey everyone Dan here, welcome to this week's episode of fish before we get going

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.360
 I just want to let you know about today's guest joining us this week

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.620
 We were so excited to be joined by someone who is genuinely

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.200
 British nerd royalty it is of course the lexicographer the star of dictionary corner from countdown and

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.100
 Eight out of ten cats does countdown and that is Susie Dent now Susie Dent is someone that we you know

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.040
 We basically monitor her Twitter account on a 24-hour basis

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:38.200
 She's just always pumping out incredible words with these definitions and you've never heard them before and we've never met her before

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.680
 So this was such an exciting moment for us not only to be able to meet her in person have a nice chat

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.640
 But also to sit down with her on stage in front of a crowd and dork out with her

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.960
 So yeah, I really hope you enjoy the episode. We absolutely loved it and outside of that

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.180
 I just want to quickly mention that you need to get your hands on Susie's two new upcoming books

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.220
 The first one comes out September 28th, and that one is called interesting stories about curious words

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.040
 So it's sort of all those phrases that we know stealing thunder red herrings

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.080
 But what do they actually mean so this book is going to be looking into all those phrases and terms on your behalf

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.440
 So that you now know who was sweet fanny Adams or why are circles vicious all those questions that you might have had

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.240
 She's put it into an ultimate compendium to explain it all so that's out September 28th

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.720
 But then on the 5th of October

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.880
 She also has a book coming out called roots of happiness a hundred words for joy and hope and that is a book for kids

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.160
 Basically Susie had the idea when looking through a dictionary that there's far too many negative words in there

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.960
 And that we should be highlighting the more happy ones the more uplifting ones

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.440
 So reading directly from a blurb here

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.360
 It's gonna lift you out of your mobile fubbles, which is a slightly sad mood

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.400
 Make you grin like a giggle mug, which is someone who never stopped smiling and have you feeling for blissed?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.520
 Extremely happy so do pick up both those books

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.280
 But until then enjoy Susie here live at the soho theater with no such thing as a fish on with the show

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:24.240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.480
 My name is Dan Shriver

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.200
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin Andrew Hunter Murray and Susie dance and once again

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.400
 We have gathered around our microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.200
 We go starting with fact number one and that is Susie, okay?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.600
 Samuel Johnson in his fiction with the English language from 1755

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.180
 Decided that he would not include any words beginning with the letter X because he said thus begins no word in the English language

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.280
 That's my fact and is that true were we xylophone lists at this point

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.680
 Yes, I was a century later, but also he was quite picky, you know how lexicographies today

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.900
 We are really careful about not giving any opinion whatsoever

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.640
 Even with words like Trump arenas, which are my favorite meaning something completely showy, but utterly worthless. We're not allowed to say

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.200
 Anything but he was notoriously rude to the Scots, you know about Americans

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.440
 So I think he probably didn't have much truck with anything from Greek

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.720
 We did have x words at the time we had a few x words

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.880
 But a lot of them came later lovely words often great like Xenium which is a gift to strangers

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.720
 Which I think is really nice

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.920
 But what was lovely is that it came from the Phoenicians and they had a letter

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.360
 Samek which get actually gave the letter s we think but that meant fish, so you could say there's no such thing as an X

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.520
 That's a title of the episode

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.520
 Quick as we've ever got our title

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.680
 Did they have xenophobe in those days they have a xenophobe xenophobia?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.120
 I think it most phobias are based on Greek

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.800
 But we kind of made them up a little bit later, but we based them on classical things like cool

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.960
 Raphobia fear of clowns, which I have they didn't have clowns in ancient Greece, so they chose the word for stilt walker

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.720
 Yeah, it's quite cool. What's your and are you also afraid of them because it of the sort of knock-on. It's still well

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.720
 No, I like stills. Yeah

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:40.120
 But yeah clowns definitely not really know if you've seen the new is it the Smiler the horror no, okay, don't

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.800
 The reason I ask about xenophobia is because Johnson as you say probably didn't like the Scots very much

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.360
 No, do not Americans. Yeah like the French for sure

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.600
 He predicted that he'd write the dictionary in three years

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.640
 And then when someone pointed out that had taken the French 40 years to write their own dictionary

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.080
 He said well, this is proportion 40 times 40 is 1600 as three to 1600

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.200
 So is the proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman. Yeah, right? Yeah. Wow

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.800
 So 42,000 words made it into this first dictionary that he did right 42,000 definitions and

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.920
 He had self deprecating jokes that he kind of included in there, which is quite fun

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.320
 So yeah, the word for dull the description for the word dull

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:34.280
 He explained to make dictionaries is dull work as part of his description and then also the definition of lexicographer

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.760
 He wrote a writer of dictionaries a harmless drudge. Yeah

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.280
 Look, you know it by heart. Yeah

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.040
 And also he was quite he would never admit that he didn't know a word

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.760
 Which was quite funny. So all the all the origin of a word. So

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.640
 Spider I loved he couldn't quite get to the root of spider. So he just said is this not the insect that spies from a door

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.760
 It's not an insect mate

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:10.400
 Like the any old bollocks era of of study just feels like such a great time to be alive

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.000
 You would have absolutely I would have been

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.920
 I would have been king back then. Yeah, yeah, that is true

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.440
 He was one of the last people in England to be touched for scruff. Oh, yeah, so cool

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.920
 So if you have a horrible word scruff you know scruff you know, yeah

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.440
 And it is just a skin condition and the monarch would touch people and and effectively cure them

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.160
 ineffectively cure them of scruff you know and

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.920
 Sammy Johnson's parents took him to London from his hometown when he was three years old

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.840
 You know your local parish would maybe club together raise the money

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.940
 They'd send you off and the Queen the monarch would touch you big big cues as well, right? Yeah

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.080
 The second I think we might have mentioned this before he touched something like two percent of the population of England Wow Wow

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.400
 Yeah

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.840
 Steppy it was a different time

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.280
 And and like and Johnson had it he had a gold coin

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.080
 It's a Queen Anne. Yeah, touch piece which is the sort of yeah

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.400
 It didn't work though. And actually he's quite disfigured his face through scruff you know, which is sad

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.480
 Yeah, and well, there's some really weird but lovely etymologies in there

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.520
 So tarantula was an insect insect. He does they call it an insect again

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.760
 Whose bike can only be cured by music because it was thought it could be cured by the tarantella at the dark Wow

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:33.280
 Was that proper doctors advice at the time really? Wow? Is there a doctor in the house dr. Johnson? Yes

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.400
 Get a hurdy-gurdy to this woman now

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.880
 And then he had retro mingency, which means pissing backwards. That's how we define it

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.880
 When you say pissing backwards, you don't mean sucking it up into your body

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:56.440
 Oh, I think I think it's like some animals their penis points backwards, right?

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.680
 I think and so a retro mingent mammal

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.880
 On the back of its feet

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.060
 Right, I think this is bit like Roy Keane saying shove it up your bollocks

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:15.780
 It does feel sometimes when you need to pee and you don't want to that the hold has a suck action to it as well

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:25.460
 Am I alone here in that I rather think you might be alone. No, no, but properly think about it

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.700
 You're kind of like I really need to pee and you're going you're doing you are I am I am

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:37.500
 Word for that as well if you are holding on so tight is piss you pressed and what does that mean?

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:43.700
 Desperate to use the forces mostly. So it's kind of desperate to pee but holding it in piss you crest piss you press

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.700
 It's like piss suppressed

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:51.420
 Don't do it then cuz Tika Brie. He supposedly died from doing that. Didn't he?

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:58.420
 Yeah famous astronomer and he was at a dinner and he was too polite. Yeah, and his bladder exploded. Oh

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:06.740
 So don't do that then well he I imagine Johnson would have had to pee a lot because supposedly he could drink in one sitting

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.580
 25 cups of tea in one go. No, he loved his tea

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:16.620
 He loved his food Boswell wrote about this Boswell would say that to watch him eat was like watching the most intense thing ever

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:23.100
 He would not have any conversation. He was just rampaging through his food. The veins on his head were like pulsating

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.660
 He was just a man obsessed with needing to get the and he did that with reading as well

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.940
 He would you would just have to read really hard and and 25 cups of tea is what I read as well

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.620
 Wow, that's amazing. He lived at the same time as Francis Gross. He really was gross by figure

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:45.140
 Yeah, right so Johnson always chose the classical references for his dictionary and he was quite a purist originally anyway

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:52.160
 And then Francis gross went to the brothels and the taverns and picked up all the street slang and I don't know if they ever met

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.100
 But they would have had a good dinner party

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.420
 They would have known about each other

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:03.060
 I think they would yeah, so while he's sort of harmlessly dredging away. He's thinking of this other guy. He's going

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:08.160
 Yeah, must have been terrible. Yeah, I like some of his definitions

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.120
 So the word etch is a country word of which I know not the meaning

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:20.960
 The word defluxion the definition is a defluxion

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.900
 That's a real Friday afternoon

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:31.700
 I gotta go to the brothel. I just put any answer 25 cups of tea waiting just across the room

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:39.420
 That's great a sock something put between the foot and the shoe

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.820
 Lunch this is good lunch as much food as one's hand can hold

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:51.860
 There is a word for that a galpin and a yep since a galpin is as much as you can hold in a single hand

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:59.260
 Which and I think yep, it's two hands the biscuits good for biscuit measurements. I think that's brilliant

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.140
 I've got a couple of x-word things. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.160
 The word x-ray, you know what the x and x-ray stands for

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.600
 Unknown just X. He didn't know what it was. I'm just gonna put X here for now and when they work out what it is

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.500
 We can change and it just hasn't been changed. Maybe called Runken rays. That would be a nightmare. Is that who?

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.740
 Runken he was cool from Germany. He's nice. Yeah, who can raise can do is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:31.200
 Maybe you know this one the X-Men why they called the X-Men. Oh, and no idea. Is it because they spend all the time on Twitter?

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:43.540
 Yeah, well, I thought it was because Professor X Professor Xavier. Oh, yeah, that's not exciting. Yeah, but no

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:48.340
 It's um, it's extra power which was said in a comic book. Oh, really? Yeah

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.120
 and just while we're if you insist we continue on X-Men

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:58.420
 Just discovered an amazing character from X-Men. I've never heard of before

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.680
 So did you know that there's a character in X-Men called forget me not?

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:08.700
 No, okay. No, you don't because they don't either because if if he is out of your sight

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:14.420
 No one can remember him. Oh, so the first time we meet him is someone from X-Men going. Hey, how you doing?

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.420
 He's like I've been here six years and

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:24.060
 No one can remember this guy. It's and it's that's a great superpower. Not if you want to be part of the team. Yeah, but

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:30.380
 For robbing a bank. Yeah, go in you rob a bank you leave. That's true. They just carry on with their day

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.220
 I think that's a really good super. I think the superheroes generally aren't robbing the banks

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:44.180
 But Professor X the only reason he knew he existed because he said like a alarm on his iPhone or whatever to remind him every so often

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:50.340
 Like forget me. You're not so character in in our comic book. Oh, okay. Cool. So that's the professor X isn't aware that it's a comic book

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:55.940
 That he's taking I was I was just yeah, I was leaving the foot of broke the fourth wall there

00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.380
 Anyway, I don't know. All right. Thanks for letting me get that out. I've got another X for you

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.060
 Oh, yeah

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:07.740
 X when you watch things like it not the normal speed like one times two times one yeah, yeah

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:13.060
 Okay, does it just a quick show of like whoops who here regularly watches things sped up?

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.540
 Who regularly listens to podcast sped up?

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:28.020
 I know our voices are probably like, why are they talking so slow on stage. Hello. I'm welcome to another episode. Yeah, it's a listen to our podcast sped up

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.820
 Slow down

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:40.220
 Do you follow an etiquette for your exes or messages because I was having this conversation with brilliant Greg Jenna and his story

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.500
 Oh, yeah, and so he said X

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:47.020
 It's only just being kind of okay when the last ten years

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:52.260
 Yeah, on a platonic text, you know between friends X is more romantic

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:57.140
 Yeah, and he would never put three X's and he and I said why I put three X's on my best friend all the time

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.020
 He looked up on his phone all porn. I didn't realize

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.500
 Did you realize that three X's

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.740
 Greg's phone

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:15.980
 Love right? Yeah, he thinks about the interesting thing about that is the first use we have of adding X for kisses or a greeting like that

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.220
 Is from 1763 and they did seven X's

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:25.660
 Wow, that's a lot isn't it to just go straight in with seven. Whoa. Yeah, that's intense

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:31.100
 According to the only the Christian X. Well, yeah, they think that it was like a blessing great

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.220
 Yeah, it was like the cross. Yeah, but yeah, I heard well

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:40.020
 This is in relation to X rated that it was based on the skull and crossbones. Maybe. Oh, really? Yeah

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.580
 I was exclusively films which featured pirate activity

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:50.300
 Yeah, do you know why blue joke is called blue? Sorry. Do you know why blue joke is blue? No, no

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.600
 because sensors used to have a blue pencil and also

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.100
 Sex workers in prison had to wear blue gowns. Oh, really?

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:05.140
 That's great gowns blue gowns. Yeah. Oh wait, sorry. Are they the prisoners in this in prison? Sorry. I thought they were like visiting

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:10.380
 Uniforms

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:18.260
 Imagine you've got to visit your friend lights. Sorry, we've run out of the white for visitors. Do you mind wearing blue Andy while you?

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.900
 What a visit I've had

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.940
 Good Lord

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.820
 He's lost the cocaine

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:43.500
 It is time for fact number two and that is James

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.500
 Okay, my fact this week is that in

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:50.900
 1986 a group of maths teachers organized a protest in Washington, DC

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:57.380
 Against the use of calculators in schools their protests failed because they couldn't get the numbers

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:06.500
 That felt a bit ironic at that moment you became a dad

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:13.500
 Yeah, maybe time from numbers round

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.540
 Connection since 1986 I bet no I bet no one even did at the time as well

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.140
 I think well, it was a man wasn't it a maths

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.300
 It was a gathering of six thousand maths teachers that they were at yeah

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.420
 Yeah, it wasn't a massive story in the newspapers

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.540
 I must admit but it was in the newspapers and like you say it was the National Council of Teachers of

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:41.060
 Mathematics, so they were all math teachers was six thousand of them there and there are about 15 of them

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:46.660
 We think who had placards and songs and they were protesting against calc you holics

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.080
 Because they thought that these kids because they were using calculators. They won't be able to do normal maths

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.860
 They would just kind of rely on them and they won't be able to do any kind of multiplication or anything like that

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:01.740
 Yeah, it was a simple time wasn't it it was no kids and their screens sort of terrible stuff are they doing?

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.500
 typing in boobs upside down

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:11.660
 Yeah, they're slogans are amazing the buttons nothing till the brains trained and

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.420
 They chanted calculators later we shall not be moved calculators later is good

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.940
 There was and they interviewed them in the newspaper

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:26.540
 I was reading they interviewed the leader John Saxon who organized this whole thing and they said well mr. Saxon

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:32.700
 Why are there no teachers? You know I've only got 15 people and he said teachers don't like to demonstrate because they are shy

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:39.660
 Fair enough, I guess a mental arithmetic is is an important thing. I read something about you Susie

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:45.220
 I want to know if this is something you still do but according to an interview you gave every single morning you do your

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.700
 75 times table

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.100
 I think I was being a little bit whimsical

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.820
 No, it's because

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.660
 Very very long time if 75 came up on the countdown board

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.820
 Yeah, I just gave up because I can't do five 75s

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.380
 I have to write it down. I don't know what it is and the more I

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.180
 Struggled with it the worse it got because I became fixated on it. So that was probably where it came from

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.820
 I don't know why it's stupid. No, it's not your job to get there to get the numbers though

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.220
 Is it like you can just let Rachel do all that stuff?

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:22.580
 Yeah, no, I really do try and she's very good at giving three hundred and seventy-five

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:30.340
 Yeah, thank you. Well done. Yeah, well you can't see at home is that he's got a calculator

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:37.860
 Yeah, and that we've edited this that took him 15 minutes to the guy who listens to it slow down is not gonna get to it for half an hour

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:45.820
 But I love all those old calculating methods because calculators from calculus little pebble because they counter with stones

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:50.780
 And then they had abacuses didn't they it is a political hot potato though

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.300
 Well, yeah, so for example

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:59.020
 Does it harm whether you can do mental arithmetic if you use a calculator all the time in your opinion? Yes, probably

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.020
 Okay. Well, you're you're in good company because in 2011

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:09.340
 There was a British MP who led consulate public concerns on this and said I would describe this country as in love with the calculator

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:15.020
 From a very early age and so that too easy access to calculators is available in local schools

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.460
 Oh, that MP Liz truss

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:22.620
 Command of like large numbers

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.180
 So Susie you're a great lovely lovely

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.740
 that reminds me of the petition to

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:35.060
 get rid of all French words from the British passport and

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.540
 It went online. We got quite a few signatures without realising that passport is French

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.940
 Hiding to nothing I think

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.420
 Human calculators are amazing people who can do incredible

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.780
 head so

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:57.860
 There was I was reading an interview with the 2020 world champion who is an Indian guy. He's called Neelacanthabhanu Prakash and

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.460
 He got to it quite interesting way

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.500
 He was confined to bed as a child for a year and loads of people who are amazing at mental maths have either

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:11.860
 Been confined to bed or they've been in solitary confinement or something's happened where they've lived in their imagination for a long time

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.180
 So all the way through school

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.620
 He would spend six to seven hours a day practicing mental arithmetic just doing that

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:25.100
 When he was interviewed by the BBC throughout the interview he recited his 48 times table and

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:31.100
 When he's talking to someone he will count how many times they blink just to keep himself engaged in the conversation

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.260
 Yeah, that's amazing. They're cool. Yeah, there's been loads of them over there

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:41.820
 In fact, one of the things that you have to do if Guinness wants to find out if you're the fastest at working things out is

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:47.180
 They'll give you a 100 digit number and ask you to work out the 13th route

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.920
 So the square route is two things that you times together to get to that number

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.020
 So imagine then a cube route is three things you multiply together to get to that number

00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:01.780
 You have to go all the way down to 13. So it might be 37 times 37 times 37 times 37 times 13 times

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.980
 The answer to the power of 13 is the number they give you in the first place. That's right the question

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.540
 I'll be honest. I don't think you're gonna trouble the Guinness

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:17.020
 Let's put me into a sort of defensive crouch position. Okay, so 30 through I was yeah

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.700
 And I was reading about a guy called them claim who was the record holder

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.660
 This was in the 80s about he's must be still quite close

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.240
 He managed to do it in one minute 28 seconds

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:34.200
 But his tactic was to mutter in Dutch while he was doing the calculations and he would only mutter swear words

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.420
 So imagine I'm just she'd be like fucking out. I fuck

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:44.100
 263 and it would be right every single time there is there's so much science behind

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.820
 Swearing lowering your cortisol levels and raising your serotonin levels

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.940
 And you know that experiment when you dip your arm in ice-cold water

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.660
 Yes, I've been twice as long if you're shouting bollocks and if you're shouting bus

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:05.920
 So and there's what Lalo Kezier is exactly it. So that's what he was doing. Wow, so it works. Yeah. Yeah, okay

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.080
 Would it help doing this podcast if I just said bollocks all the way through?

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.320
 Because that's what Dan's been doing for the last 10 years

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:19.240
 You and say that if we lived in the time of Samuel Johnson, right?

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:27.040
 Here's the thing you have to do at the mental calculation World Cup just another example of what so the calendar

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.600
 There's the calendar round. This is an exciting round

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.600
 You get given a list of dates from

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.200
 1600 to

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.600
 2100 the years yeah, and you've given 60 seconds to name the day of the week that every one of those dates

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.620
 Huh happened on oh, okay, so you get it right you get a minute to do it, okay? Yeah, and this great long list of

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.660
 Days like 24th of February. Yeah, great 1603 Monday, right?

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.480
 You're gonna say Monday to all of them, aren't you? Have you got the answers? No

00:22:53.480 --> 00:23:00.800
 It's funny, I can't disprove that it was a Monday, but the point might oh my god, that's so like

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:07.120
 He may have got it right. That's true. But what I'm saying is next question

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.880
 There are people who can do it even more effectively than just randomly guessing

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:20.380
 Incredibly rapidly so the record the record winner in 2012 was someone called Nafumi. Oh, Gasawara. Okay. They got

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:26.720
 57 in a minute. Wow. Well, they are they weren't all Monday though. Were they they were all Monday?

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.200
 Trick that yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that is amazing

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:38.400
 Unless Monday Thursday Tuesday Saturday, I think there are tricks out there are really I've met someone who can do that

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.760
 It takes them a tiny bit longer obviously, but we're talking about a champion here

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.680
 Yeah, but you can say any day and they go over that and they work it out

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:51.160
 There are tricks you can mark her history in certain ways to get you to that day. What well like what I don't know

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.160
 Like a civil war broke out on a Wednesday

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.880
 Three and a half years earlier who knows yeah

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:03.000
 But there was when they used to be people who would go on stage and you would ask them to multiply two numbers together

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.260
 And they just be able to do it and that would be the whole act pretty good

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.600
 It's pretty cool. It's not verifiable for everyone in the crowd as well. That's true

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.400
 But that's good

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.840
 But that's because if you've got someone on stage who's doing the SM while they do it

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.880
 Yeah, but they would be able to be up there will be able to do it much quicker than that for sure

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.760
 But so you're right would be quite unverifiable

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.640
 But the tricks that they used to use basically there's loads of math tricks like you would see on countdown

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.720
 It's like your nine times table is one way of doing it or removing things or adding things to a hundred all these different tricks

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.600
 They have but the way that they would mostly do it is someone would ask you to

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.200
 Multiply this by this and then you would go okay

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.800
 What were they again and you keep stalling a few times

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.760
 But you're already doing it in your head and then that you would multiply all the numbers and if I multiply two numbers

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.960
 I would always start from the digits and work my way up to the highest number

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.600
 But they would always start with the highest number. They might say

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:59.000
 17 million and they're working out the next ones as they go along, but they haven't even got there yet

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.920
 Wow, so they would be able to say like I can answer the question immediately

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:08.440
 But actually they're kind of working out as they went along amazing. That's pretty clever, isn't it? Yeah

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.920
 I once got brought up to the front of my school

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:18.480
 When I was a teenager in high school and told on the spot Daniel has achieved the top

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:26.280
 Percentage of people in New South Wales, Australia for mathematics in the recent exam that we took as part of thing and it was a multiple choice exam

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:31.040
 I

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:37.940
 Literally guessed every single answer because I knew nothing about mathematics and I just happened through fluke to get it

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.120
 Right, I still have a certificate at home for being one of the

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.340
 Greatest mathematicians in New South Wales of my period

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.300
 Well, they did they sort of say well, this is great because we've been wanting to put some

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:55.160
 Come on Daniel get your big old award. I was like I was an idiot. They

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.480
 Know it was it was humiliating

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.720
 Still got the certificate

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:07.560
 Yeah, it is fascinating watching Countdown and I know that you're saying that you you like to do it as well

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:12.640
 But watching Rachel be able to get to those sums is just feel like magic doesn't it?

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.860
 Yeah, it really does. Yeah, the camera crew who've been with us for such a long time as well

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.620
 They're also very nerdy

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:24.260
 So they give nods of approval for two things one is when I ever mention an orphaned negative

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.860
 Which is when you have things like really grunt old shoveled well shovel doesn't exist, but

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:37.260
 Ruthful gawm full stuff like that whenever I mention often negative they go and whenever Rachel says yes, that's the sum of two primes

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.740
 Sure

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:48.580
 Do the camera men like play along with the game do you think I think they do yeah, I think a lot of camera women as well

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.580
 But they're all brilliant and

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:57.100
 I wasn't ticking you off

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.100
 But yeah, I reckon they do

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.600
 Quite a lot of them get the conundrum not the women though

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.600
 I

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:13.000
 Got a quick protest thing another protest

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:26.820
 We have so many camera women it would be really bad me not to mention them, but I honestly wasn't having a dig

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.360
 They're called cinematographers James

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.720
 I

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:40.840
 So the thing I want to mention about protest is one of my favorite things I've learned recently in 1966 the

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.000
 procrastinators Club of America held a protest against the War of 1812

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.160
 And

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.320
 They made signs and everything they were protesting it and

00:27:53.320 --> 00:28:00.480
 The the club newsletter that came out after it announced that the protest had in fact been a success because a treaty has now been signed

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.920
 So good on them

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:13.600
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:20.320
 My fact is that for 30 years Tibetan Buddhists have been saving fish from certain death and releasing them back into nature

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:26.320
 Unfortunately, it turns out they have unwittingly been feeding them all straight to the local otters

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.480
 So there's this ritual called fangshengs very it's very, you know ancient traditional thing you do

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.440
 It's called like life release is what it means you you get animals that were destined for slaughter and

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.400
 And you sort of you you free them and you use your way of like paying a debt back to the universe

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:50.200
 It's that kind of thing and since the 1990s there are lots of Buddhists in Tibet have been buying up fish from fish markets at live

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.920
 ones and

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.360
 Releasing them into local rivers thousands of them every year and unfortunately

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.720
 There's a recent scientific report which has looked at the the state of the nearby rivers because I mean

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.160
 It's not a great thing to do in terms of ecology, you know lots of that's a really invasive species risk

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.880
 And it'll completely like mess up the local ecosystem

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.520
 Anyway, turns out that there are almost no fish left in the rivers and the otter feces are

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.320
 Full of the fish that have been released

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.840
 So they have been kind of helping nature in a way in that they've like a lot of very very fat happy otters

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:29.000
 On this river. Yeah, but the otters are stopping the the non-native fish from destroying the ecosystem

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.280
 So in many ways, it's a happy story, but not for them if they realized what they'd been doing, right?

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:38.320
 No, no, no, not for the fish that get released confused and immediately and no karma for the Buddhists

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.760
 Or what do you reckon of my pay grade?

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.640
 There's a German word for this which is I don't wonder if you've heard it Susie is

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:54.180
 Verschlimbe so wrong. Yeah, the definition. It's an attempted improvement that makes things worse. Yeah

00:29:54.180 --> 00:30:01.000
 If you just knew that I mean, I did see you peek at my notes here

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.800
 But yeah, now there's this whole industry isn't there of people

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.120
 Capturing animals so that they can then be released. Yeah

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.360
 I think and obviously is quite bad in lots of places and they looked in

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:23.080
 Singapore and in Southeast Asia and they're just finding all of these lizards and stuff which shouldn't be there and yet

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:29.200
 They are and so the Singapore Buddhist Federation is saying that maybe you should just maybe just not eat meat instead

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:36.400
 I'd give some money to animal shelters just anything other than doing this thing, which is inherently quite bad

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:41.600
 It's like it does it's a slightly mess things up, but there is something to be said about if you go to a restaurant

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.200
 I speak as a veggie here, but go to a restaurant and you see a tank full of lobsters

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:52.840
 I mean, that's just I would do anything to rescue those things. Yeah, I would go and dump them in the local loch. Yeah

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.840
 I can see why I can see why I definitely understand it

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:04.120
 Yeah, for sure you get in Shanghai what happens is that again when it whether the people turn up to carry out the fang sheng ritual a

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.400
 Lot of people turn up

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:12.280
 Selling them live turtles at very inflated prices. So already like they've created a secondary market in

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.400
 Turtles at this point, but then there are also fishermen waiting down. Sorry fish a folk

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.480
 Anglers

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:30.120
 Waiting with nets but literally 20 meters away. So yeah, yeah, yeah, it creates a lot of it's an interesting from an economics point of view

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:37.080
 Yeah, but also like the temple ponds tend to be full of turtles because people just shove loads and loads of them in and obviously you

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:42.520
 Can only have so many turtles living in a pond before they have a bad time of it. Yeah, so these fish were carp, weren't they?

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.200
 Yes, they were in yeah, why do you know?

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:50.680
 I was just sitting in there that I was thinking why do we carp on about something when that's got anything to do with the fish?

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:57.280
 Oh, I know that is from a Latin where meaning to pull two pieces likewise carpet is sort of like tufts that you kind of pull

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:03.280
 But I don't think I think she would fish. What about do we say that car park? I thought it's hop on you can hop on as well

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.280
 So what's harping on versus?

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:11.560
 Endlessly playing the same note on a heart and to carp on is to criticize and just kind of constantly have a go stop

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:16.080
 Carping you know that kind of thing. Yeah, yeah, I think she was a fish. I've got a question. Yes

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.280
 Is carp pulling something apart related to carpal tunnel syndrome?

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:26.560
 Condition oh, that's interesting. Yeah, maybe I don't know is the answer. That's a very good one

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.560
 I think it's related

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:39.080
 My favorite fish is the cod. Oh, yeah because cod meant scrotum and the fish is supposed to look sorry. Sorry James

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.180
 What a bit of your beer? I'll have the haddock. Yeah

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:50.840
 It's because it looks like a bag apparently the fish. Yeah, and the cod piece piece for you as grotum and

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:56.520
 Brackets go back to a Spanish word meaning cod piece because they're a bit of support

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.940
 So architectural brackets, but also they kind of support a bit of your sentence

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.620
 Well, it's not that lovely Andy

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.440
 If you heard the start of this great, well, I know it's great

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:13.140
 But that's not I think that's nice that you think if you're scrotum as a sort of set of brackets. Yes gently supporting

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.080
 the things that need

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.280
 With words otherwise, isn't it cod piece? Yeah

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:28.400
 What if you cod to someone because the cod is a practical joke as well, isn't it?

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:36.320
 I'm kidding, but I'm not I'm cutting. Yeah, I'm cutting. I wonder if that's got anything to do with you talking balls or something

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.320
 I didn't know

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:46.240
 I've never heard of carping I've never heard of cutting I've never heard of cutting either. No, yeah to cod to cause one

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.680
 I think I might be Irish. I'm not sure and Cods wallet this can be different

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.920
 We're learning a lot

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:59.360
 Do you know Gary Larson the far side? Yeah, the comic books

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:04.680
 He he was someone who was also into saving animals and and sort of playing around

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.440
 So when he was a when he was a cartoonist in his early days, he was being paid

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.240
 But it wasn't a lot of money so he needed to get a secondary job

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:16.360
 So he applied to be an animal cruelty investigator for the Seattle Humane Society

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:22.260
 But he never ended up doing the job because in the car on the way to the interview. He hit a dog and so

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.760
 He thought that's a bad start

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:29.840
 The dog was fine, but he didn't end up doing it as a result. Yeah, I was reading a bit about

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:36.360
 Reintroductions, you know, because this is about reintroducing animal. Maybe where it should be. Maybe it shouldn't and you know, like Britain is

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.240
 is

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.840
 kicking off beaver

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.200
 Reintroductions, which is very exciting because they they beavers are a bit controversial

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.440
 Basically, they do do a lot of good in a lot of places

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:52.160
 They create wetlands and wetlands store carbon and they're more resistant to fire and you know, they're very in danger

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.720
 Like the wetlands themselves were endangered beavers help bring them back

00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:00.440
 So this year North London got two beavers called Sigourney beaver and Justin beaver

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:07.080
 Did we literally only get to because they were the only puns

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.160
 Sort of coming back, but anyway, like I say it has caused some controversy

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:21.420
 So there was a headline from the Daily Mail earlier this year could rewilding animals turn Britain into a modern-day Jurassic Park

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:28.600
 With beavers what firstly exactly yeah beavers and secondly Jurassic Park is set in the modern day

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:35.120
 Sloppy headline writing

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.640
 And there's a problem in America, you know when if you go to the coast often

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:45.080
 There are baby turtles that are born and you might wander into the city because they see the lights

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:45.640
 Yeah

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.040
 You often get people going to the beach and they see these turtles and put them in

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.600
 Into the water, but the problem is that in those areas especially around Florida

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:59.600
 There's also a lot of tortoises around there and people don't know the difference between turtles and tortoises

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.760
 One difference being that one could swim and one can't swim

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:11.560
 So number one don't go around grabbing turtles anyway, because you know there are people who'll do it who know what they're doing

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:17.740
 Yeah, but secondly tortoises have toes. Oh, that's that's the way to tell. Oh, that's good public service

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:24.800
 Let's call them totals. Oh, yeah, that'll do it

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.840
 Don't touch that it's a total

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.600
 It's hard to say

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.040
 That's probably why it didn't happen

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:43.240
 Red kites near me they're red kites. They've really done well with yeah. Yeah, and the kite that we play with is from the bird

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:51.000
 Yeah, they're beautiful. They're gorgeous. Yeah, they've done they've done amazingly everywhere wild cats might get new wild cats

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.400
 Devon and Cornwall this is exciting right and you don't need permission to introduce them because there are already a few in

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:04.200
 Scotland so if something is if something is non-existent in the UK like a wolf then you need permission from the environment secretary and very

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.960
 Boringly they are not

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.960
 Allowing us to have wolves everywhere

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:16.400
 So why would you and I just drive up to Scotland grab a few wildcats drive down and just set them free

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:21.320
 It doesn't sound like it's loud it would be a lot would it

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.480
 Feel like a hell of a car ride

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:29.960
 The thing is we both have electric cars as well, so we have to stop about five times

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.920
 I don't know if it would and I'm sorry to rain on your parade James

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:40.440
 But the problem is the wildcats in Scotland they get described as functionally extinct so this is weird

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.960
 They're real they exist, but they're also extinct because

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:49.320
 They there are a few hundred of them left only and basically they spend all their time shagging domestic cats

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.220
 To the extent that the gene pool is just completely

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:58.960
 Like scientists have studied lots and lots of dead cats from about the last hundred years

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.560
 And they found that you need a particular kind like wildcats are quite a specific thing

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.600
 But they're they're Randy and they will just

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:10.520
 Wildcat are they really vicious wildcats or they just quite cute a bit of a bit of a loaded way of describing them

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.600
 They're just I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I see they are. Yeah, they're not they're not massive either

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:19.900
 That's sort of two cats and the size of two cats. I would say okay roughly a cat and a half two cats

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:25.720
 No, no, I think they very rarely take a human young

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:32.540
 But I mean domestic cats are quite vicious and they they kill a lot of birds and stuff

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:39.720
 Wildcats are quite similar. I just think it must be a pretty exciting day if you're just a normal domestic cat

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:45.680
 Wildcat comes in town. Ah wild. It'd be like John Travolta and Olivia Newton John, wouldn't it?

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:52.600
 It would just be like the leather-bound dude walking in it must be like if a yeti was to approach you and have sex with you Dan

00:38:52.600 --> 00:39:01.120
 Because it's bigger it's hairier. It's like it's a little slightly different species, but still recognisably humanoid. Yeah, and it's on

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:07.040
 My wife and I have an agreement

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:17.680
 Completely monogamous. She's got a list of celebs. Yeah, she's got yeti and Brian blessed. Those are the two

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.640
 That make it in

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:29.880
 It is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact my fact this week is

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.560
 Mathematician David Cox has two things named after him a

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:40.340
 Geometric coordinate ring and an algorithm that he invented with Steven Zucker

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:45.960
 They are known as the Cox ring and the cocksucker machine

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:51.120
 So

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:59.360
 What's particularly exciting about this is that in the 1970s Cox and Zucker met each other and went oh, we've got to write a paper

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.400
 The invention came after the juvenile

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.160
 Dream of having a cocksucker paper

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:16.880
 So then the these things that coordinate rings and algorithms as the greatest mathematician New South Wales has ever produced

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.840
 Explained that's what they are

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:29.160
 Yes, I would James because I have a maths degree and I fucking can't yeah, is it complicated. I really tried

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.560
 I really tried to understand it when I say really tried I just knew I was going to throw it to James and if he can't

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.480
 I feel fine and it's yeah

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:42.040
 No, it is it is really really complicated the second thing that he invented was not an invention

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:46.680
 It was attributed to him by two other students because he was the inspiration for it

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:52.880
 So the cocks ring was inspired by his earlier work and they thought let's play into the gag here

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.840
 But they came up with it and then they named it yeah, and it's just this wonderful thing about academics having a sense of humor

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.160
 This is something this is interesting

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:03.200
 There's a thing called Stigler's law of eponymy right and what it states is that no

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:09.640
 Scientific discovery is actually named after the person who discovered it in the first place. So like Pythagoras's theorem

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.160
 Named after Pythagoras not discovered by him

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.680
 Halley didn't discover Halley's comet been known about a bit earlier

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:21.720
 And so this is the Stigler law of economy and it was coined by a sociologist who was called Robert Merton

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:29.440
 Who named after someone else yeah, and these these two guys when they did this by the way

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.600
 They were studying at Princeton University

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.160
 So the reason I came across this fact is because I found out that you studied at Princeton University

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.920
 You studied German there. I know I'm weird. No, that's that's very cool

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.680
 Did you mean was it a good degree or was it ever slim?

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.920
 No, it was

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:51.920
 No, it's brilliant. I mean German is just so it just gets given such a hard wrap in it is honestly the most lyrical

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.440
 Beautiful, we're just used to people shouting orders in more films

00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:00.680
 But it's really really beautiful, but they people always say why isn't there a word for this in English?

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.120
 and then they will always say well, I bet there's one in German and

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.400
 And usually is because it is quite like Lego, isn't it? You can just pile

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:14.060
 Do you ever have been shot on your no love - he wrote this brilliant book called shot and Freud, which?

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:19.840
 Was it basically finding as many gaps in English as he could find and then getting a German translator to

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.960
 Make up a word and my favorite one was

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:28.000
 Depenfarer beoigung, which is the compulsion to stare at the person you're overtaking in your car

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:38.440
 That's really good. Yeah, well, that was that was him. It's very good. These people cocks and zucker

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:44.960
 I was looking at some other people with similar kind of names that what we call that double barrel names

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.600
 Yeah, if you go on the internet you can find loads of

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.840
 Examples of people who got married and had quite unfortunate names

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.800
 I'm not sure all of them are true

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.920
 But I have looked at them all in the newspaper archives and found some that are definitely are true

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:03.040
 And I'm gonna do a little quiz see if you can I'm gonna tell you the name of one of the people in this relationship

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.520
 And you can see if you can guess the name of the person they married

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:12.200
 This is an easy one Elizabeth McDonald and John had a farm

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.440
 I

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:21.240
 Know

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:32.960
 You can get this Elizabeth McDonald married and double barrel the names take away

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:41.800
 They didn't necessarily always double barrel, but when you have the newspaper things it says this person married this person

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.400
 They call it the McDonald burger wedding

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.760
 So, okay, I can pull this back. You've got it right you can do this andy

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.800
 Amy wide wide wide OH YDE Stephen Fanny

00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:04.040
 Sorry birth birth is good, but that would be great. You were closest. It was Alexander whole

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.040
 Amy and Alexander white hole

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.700
 Joe Looney, so what Looney Looney, Judy, Judy

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.840
 Ben Ben, no, she's close

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:24.900
 Isn't quite a normal surname Matthew tick Looney tick Looney take very good Shelby Ward

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:30.680
 Looney what one final one Teresa come on

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.720
 Michael England

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.480
 Tim Michael Tim

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:46.040
 Arnold my back

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:53.520
 Down down down

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.400
 Mr. David I lead

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:05.440
 Anyone in the audience no it was Teresa come on and Frankie top of me

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.440
 Oh

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:19.680
 And I should also say that I was reading the reddit of Jill Stein, you know the Green Party leader in America

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:26.080
 Yeah, and she did an AMA so it was like ask her anything and the second most popular question

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:32.740
 They asked Jill Stein was Dr. Stein. Have you ever thought about marrying Senator Al Franken and hyphenating your last name?

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.860
 Oh

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:40.500
 Very good, so good. Um, there's only one street in the world named after John Major and

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.660
 He didn't know it was named after him and no one told him they were naming it after him

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.520
 Oh, it was going to be Sir John Major close sounds menacing

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.100
 But it's

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.780
 But it's gonna be called Sir John Major close, but then the London Fire Brigade said that's a bit complicated

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:02.060
 We might get confused if someone rings up and so they just called it major close. There's cut out the sir job

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.780
 And then when when he was asked about it

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:09.600
 He said I think it's most unlikely they'd name a street after me and he just hadn't been told no one informed him

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.180
 Margaret that has loads of stuff that Margaret that has a peninsula named after her

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.940
 anyway

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:22.100
 That's quite interesting because in Europe for every ten streets that are named after a man

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:28.860
 Yeah, there's only one named after a woman is much more likely that you would be named after a man if you're a woman is it?

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.060
 Well

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:38.220
 Interestingly, okay taking that in mind the most popular person in European streets names is a woman

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:46.260
 No, Andy's right it is the Virgin Mary in Europe of course, so lots of

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:52.220
 Does actually have virgin in the names or is it? No, it's usually just Mary

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:56.660
 Yeah, and it's usually named after the church. Yeah, yeah goes to so yeah

00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:01.100
 Well Santa Maria Santa Maria, which I would argue is named after Santa and

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:04.940
 So we should lob those off her numbers

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:15.900
 Audrey is another religious one that is an eponym because tawdry comes, you know, something's tawdry

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:19.540
 It's really shoddy and that goes back to st. Audrey that she was

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:26.640
 An abyss and eventually a saint and she wore lots of kind of necklace

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:31.700
 In her youth and then as a nun she got a throat cancer and she thought this was revenge

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.520
 Because she would just wear such fripply

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:41.020
 Wow, anyway lace such as the one that she wore around her neck was sold at fairs and it was st. Audrey lace

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:46.560
 Oh, that's brilliant tawdry lace. Yeah. What was it about being 55 minutes into this show that make you think of the word tawdry?

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:54.440
 It's the religious the religious side of it. Yeah, you know the Chippendales the dance troupe. Yeah

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:58.280
 Oh, yeah, they're named after the the the oven and yeah

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:04.040
 Oh, no, I was thinking of a Thomas Chippendale the person who made all the furniture. Oh, thank you the children's cut

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:09.600
 That one, you know

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:16.300
 They were named after the furniture in the club where they performed

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.120
 It designed to look like

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:24.980
 Thomas Chippendale furniture because they were kind of, you know, like muscular I guess they were sort of muscular and you know

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:30.880
 Impressive looking so with the chairs. Oh, I think they do sit on stage and the you sit on their laps, right?

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:35.440
 Surely not. I think so. They become the chairs. I think so. That's what I'm saying. They are

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.440
 Oh, don't pretend. Oh, I think

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.760
 This is from the man who suggested coming my back a few minutes ago

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.480
 And I was looking into just a scientist who have humor

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.960
 I like it when it makes it into a paper and I just found a couple of papers. They've been published

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.000
 I really like the titles of so a couple of them here

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.200
 They are the mouth the anus and the blaster poor open questions about questionable openings

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:08.240
 Another paper the effects of having Christmas dinner with in-laws on gut microbiota composition

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:15.040
 And then the third one head and neck injury risks in heavy metal headbangers stuck between rock and a hard base

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.520
 Oh

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:23.200
 I'm gonna have to wrap us up. So guys, we've got to the end. I was just looking at very unintentionally unintentional

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:28.080
 Because this is about something where it was intentionally very rude. Yeah, I was trying to find examples of things were unintentionally rude

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:33.120
 Okay, I'm just like a couple of very tiny quick ones. So yolo williams welsh naturalist

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:41.360
 Okay, it was co-presenter on spring watch in 2016. He was discussing diving seabirds with a female conservationist

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.680
 And they watched one plunge into the water in front of them and he just turned her and said so

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.920
 Is that the deepest jag you've ever had?

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:52.880
 And she got to say no we have had tea for them that

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:56.000
 And we've I feel like we should end with

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.600
 Like I think some of you will have heard this before I know the all-time classic harry carpenter after the boat race

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:10.240
 1977 was reporting it live on tv and said, ah, isn't that nice the wife of the cambridge president is kissing the cox of the oxford crew

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:16.560
 Can I just do one more I know that's really good, but

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:24.560
 In 2012 fiza the drug company came up with a new drug for osteoarthritis in dogs called rimadil

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:30.480
 And I went on to the newspaper archives for the adverts for this. This is genuinely true

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:38.640
 There was an advert that said fiza animal health the manufacturers of rimadil have launched a program available only through veterinary hospitals

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.000
 Register online at rimadog.com
