00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:16,00:00:18,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:19,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:19,00:00:22,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:22,00:00:24,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:00:24,00:00:26,"with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:26,00:00:27,and James Harkin.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"Once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:29,00:00:32,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:32,00:00:35,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:35,00:00:38,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:00:38,00:00:41,- My fact this week is that ironing in Egypt
00:00:41,00:00:45,"is traditionally a man's job, and they do it with their feet."
00:00:45,00:00:45,- Yeah.
00:00:45,00:00:46,(laughing)
00:00:46,00:00:48,- And that's why we shouldn't let men do the ironing.
00:00:48,00:00:49,(laughing)
00:00:49,00:00:52,"- Do they put the shirt on the ground,"
00:00:52,00:00:54,or do they put their foot on the board?
00:00:54,00:00:55,"- Yeah, good question."
00:00:55,00:00:57,"- And also, do they use an iron,"
00:00:57,00:00:58,"or do they have really, really flat feet?"
00:00:58,00:01:00,"- Hot, hot feet."
00:01:00,00:01:02,"Well, it's in the desert, right?"
00:01:02,00:01:04,You just stand them the sand for 10 minutes
00:01:04,00:01:06,until your feet get warm.
00:01:06,00:01:06,- That's it.
00:01:06,00:01:09,"No, they use an iron, a normal iron,"
00:01:09,00:01:11,"so these are people called the makwagi,"
00:01:11,00:01:15,and the makwagi regal are specifically the foot ironers.
00:01:15,00:01:18,"Makwami's iron, and it's been going on for hundreds of years,"
00:01:18,00:01:21,"and on every street corner, you'd have a man"
00:01:21,00:01:23,"who does your ironing, you take your ironing to him."
00:01:23,00:01:26,"It's passed down from fathers to sons,"
00:01:26,00:01:27,"and traditionally it was done with feet,"
00:01:27,00:01:30,"so you'd have a big, heavy iron."
00:01:30,00:01:32,I read one reputable source saying
00:01:32,00:01:35,that the irons can weigh 40 kilos.
00:01:35,00:01:36,"- What, 40 kilos?"
00:01:36,00:01:38,"- I know, it doesn't seem plausible, does it?"
00:01:38,00:01:39,- Do they lift it with their feet?
00:01:39,00:01:41,"- Well, they just push it. - They just push it,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,"and they look like a classic old iron,"
00:01:43,00:01:45,"so they're just an iron that's heated over coals,"
00:01:45,00:01:48,"or in a stove, right, like a big metal iron."
00:01:48,00:01:49,They're not plugged in.
00:01:49,00:01:49,- Not plugged in.
00:01:49,00:01:51,You kind of got that little water button
00:01:51,00:01:53,that you press or the steaming up there.
00:01:53,00:01:54,- Dan's trying to pretend that
00:01:54,00:01:56,ironing is a man's job in his household as well.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"- I think, I could confidently say,"
00:01:58,00:02:00,we all know I iron non-star.
00:02:00,00:02:02,"- Dan is an obsessive, Dan and Andy, actually,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,"I feel like you spend half your life ironing,"
00:02:04,00:02:06,"it's quite sad, but it's not sad when these guys do it."
00:02:06,00:02:08,"- I'm sorry, can I just say"
00:02:08,00:02:11,"that I don't just let my wife do all my ironing,"
00:02:11,00:02:13,I just like to be creased.
00:02:13,00:02:16,"- In answer to your question about the spray,"
00:02:16,00:02:17,"this is one of the coolest things,"
00:02:17,00:02:20,and I was going back to old 19th century sources
00:02:20,00:02:22,"when people visited Egypt and reported on it happening there,"
00:02:22,00:02:25,"to spritz the garments, so they're a bit wet."
00:02:25,00:02:28,"They spit, and so now these days, I think--"
00:02:28,00:02:31,"- Terrific, all right, does that cost extra?"
00:02:31,00:02:34,"- There are accounts of the real pros,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,"the real traditional ones, having just a continuous spray"
00:02:37,00:02:39,constantly coming from their lips.
00:02:39,00:02:42,"- But if you were walking the streets,"
00:02:42,00:02:44,"looking for someone to do your ironing,"
00:02:44,00:02:47,"and presumably there might be a bunch of competition,"
00:02:47,00:02:50,"what you wanna see is just one old guy dribbling like crazy,"
00:02:50,00:02:51,"and that's the one you go for, right?"
00:02:51,00:02:52,That's the best version.
00:02:52,00:02:56,- How did this industry fair during COVID?
00:02:56,00:02:58,(laughing)
00:02:58,00:03:02,"- That's a really good question,"
00:03:02,00:03:05,and I forgot to investigate.
00:03:05,00:03:07,"- Actually, people used to spit on their irons"
00:03:07,00:03:08,in the UK as well.
00:03:08,00:03:08,- Really?
00:03:08,00:03:12,"- Yeah, yeah, so we're talking from the 17th century onwards,"
00:03:12,00:03:14,"we had something called sad irons,"
00:03:14,00:03:17,and sad meant solid in those days.
00:03:17,00:03:20,"So there were solid irons, and they're kind of pretty much,"
00:03:20,00:03:22,"you know, like when you play Monopoly and you're the iron,"
00:03:22,00:03:23,it's that kind of thing.
00:03:23,00:03:26,"So again, it's just like a piece of metal."
00:03:26,00:03:28,"You put it in the fire until it's hot enough,"
00:03:28,00:03:30,"and then you would use it to iron things,"
00:03:30,00:03:33,"and to find out when it was hot enough,"
00:03:33,00:03:34,you would spit on it.
00:03:34,00:03:37,And if the spit sort of laid and frosted around
00:03:37,00:03:39,"and spat around on the iron,"
00:03:39,00:03:41,then you knew it was ready to go.
00:03:41,00:03:42,- Interesting.
00:03:42,00:03:43,"- But you don't want it too hot, presumably,"
00:03:43,00:03:44,'cause then you burn your clothes.
00:03:44,00:03:45,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:03:45,00:03:46,"- As well as the sad iron things,"
00:03:46,00:03:49,"there were slug irons, which I like as well,"
00:03:49,00:03:50,"where you have a slug of metal,"
00:03:50,00:03:52,"literally, I just didn't like an ingot of metal,"
00:03:52,00:03:54,"that you put in the fire for ages,"
00:03:54,00:03:56,"and you draw it out of the fire and shove it in the iron,"
00:03:56,00:03:57,and that makes it hot.
00:03:57,00:03:58,- Nice.
00:03:58,00:03:59,- There were rough irons.
00:03:59,00:04:01,"So they're called a goffering iron,"
00:04:01,00:04:04,where you could iron fabrics into a scalloped edge.
00:04:04,00:04:06,So you know all those amazing Elizabethan ruffs?
00:04:06,00:04:07,- Yes.
00:04:07,00:04:09,"- They had to be ironed into place, basically."
00:04:09,00:04:10,"- I do your first level ironing,"
00:04:10,00:04:12,"which is I just want things flat and uncreased,"
00:04:12,00:04:13,"but there is an art to ironing,"
00:04:13,00:04:15,where you do put in these ruffles.
00:04:15,00:04:17,You do put in the line on your trousers.
00:04:17,00:04:18,I aspire to be there.
00:04:18,00:04:20,You'll put a crease to the shirt sleeve though.
00:04:20,00:04:21,"- Yeah, you might do."
00:04:21,00:04:22,- You gotta have a crease on the shirt sleeve.
00:04:22,00:04:23,- You gotta have a crease.
00:04:23,00:04:24,"But here's the thing, back in the day,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,ironing wasn't just for getting your clothes
00:04:26,00:04:29,"to be uncreased, it was for cleaning as well."
00:04:29,00:04:32,"So there's reports of, let's say during the Crimean War,"
00:04:32,00:04:35,there's a report there where cannibals might be heated
00:04:35,00:04:37,and used as a makeshift iron.
00:04:37,00:04:39,"And it wasn't so that people went,"
00:04:39,00:04:40,"you know, I want to look uncreased"
00:04:40,00:04:42,when I'm going into battle.
00:04:42,00:04:43,It was because you would have things like lice
00:04:43,00:04:45,living on your clothes that you want to get rid of.
00:04:45,00:04:46,"So it was burning it off, basically."
00:04:46,00:04:48,So it was doing a double job.
00:04:48,00:04:50,- It's very hard though to aim it correctly
00:04:50,00:04:51,for an ironing job.
00:04:51,00:04:54,So it just gets the ironing right.
00:04:54,00:04:55,It's a difficult method.
00:04:55,00:04:59,Can I ask Dan as the only other ironer in the room?
00:04:59,00:05:02,"I suspect, another question about this."
00:05:02,00:05:03,What was your opinion on wrinkle-free shirts?
00:05:03,00:05:05,"Sorry, James, I mean, James is wearing a collared shirt now"
00:05:05,00:05:06,and it looks actually very nice.
00:05:06,00:05:10,"- No, no, I've never really ironed any item of clothing"
00:05:10,00:05:13,since I left a proper job about 25 years ago.
00:05:13,00:05:14,"- Fair enough, fair enough."
00:05:14,00:05:16,And I live in a hope of getting a proper job.
00:05:16,00:05:18,"So I'm constantly heading to interviews,"
00:05:18,00:05:19,so I do mean those shirts.
00:05:19,00:05:21,(all laughing)
00:05:21,00:05:23,So what was the question again?
00:05:23,00:05:26,"- Would you wear a wrinkle-free shirt,"
00:05:26,00:05:28,like a non-iron shirt?
00:05:28,00:05:29,'Cause a lot of shirts sold these days are non-iron.
00:05:29,00:05:33,"- I definitely wore those when I was at university, for sure."
00:05:33,00:05:35,"It was the one thing, if I went to a men's wear shop,"
00:05:35,00:05:38,I would look to see if it would need an iron or not.
00:05:38,00:05:38,- Really? - Yeah.
00:05:38,00:05:40,- Why would you? - And the clip on tie as well.
00:05:40,00:05:42,"Don't talk to angry colleagues strangling you,"
00:05:42,00:05:43,that's very helpful.
00:05:43,00:05:44,- I was talking about at university
00:05:44,00:05:45,"whether we went clubbing,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,we didn't always wear ties.
00:05:47,00:05:48,- How were you letting in?
00:05:48,00:05:49,- Ridiculous.
00:05:49,00:05:51,(all laughing)
00:05:51,00:05:53,"We borrow one from the bounce scene,"
00:05:53,00:05:54,"he's going over to his jacket,"
00:05:54,00:05:56,"he's got a big rack of ties in there,"
00:05:56,00:05:58,and he picks one that goes with your complexion and shirt.
00:05:58,00:05:59,"- Yeah, okay."
00:05:59,00:06:03,"- So wrink non-iron shirts are made with formaldehyde,"
00:06:03,00:06:05,"or they certainly used to be,"
00:06:05,00:06:07,"they've been treated with the special chemical,"
00:06:07,00:06:10,"which means that they don't crease, which is very clever."
00:06:10,00:06:12,"- But they make you need to do a poo, right?"
00:06:12,00:06:14,We've talked before about how formaldehyde
00:06:14,00:06:16,"makes you need to poo, that is true."
00:06:16,00:06:18,I think the good thing is that the formaldehyde
00:06:18,00:06:19,"is locked into the shirt,"
00:06:19,00:06:23,"so actually it doesn't do you any harm as the wearer,"
00:06:23,00:06:24,"but the people who made it,"
00:06:24,00:06:28,"people who worked in the non-iron shirt factories,"
00:06:28,00:06:30,"they all go quite sick, I think."
00:06:30,00:06:31,"- Right, really?"
00:06:31,00:06:33,- I think there's a higher proportion of cancer
00:06:33,00:06:34,in people who work in those factories
00:06:34,00:06:35,than in the general population.
00:06:35,00:06:38,"- Well, they don't sound like good residents"
00:06:38,00:06:38,that get used to them.
00:06:38,00:06:42,"I don't know whether they've ironed out these problems yet,"
00:06:42,00:06:43,"but from what you're saying,"
00:06:43,00:06:46,it sounds like that might still be a thing.
00:06:46,00:06:50,- The study with this of the incidence of cancer was 20 or nine.
00:06:50,00:06:51,"- Okay, okay, okay."
00:06:51,00:06:53,"- But yeah, ironing basically, okay,"
00:06:53,00:06:55,"so let's say you've got a cotton shirt,"
00:06:55,00:06:59,"it's made up of loads of fibres, chains of cellulose,"
00:06:59,00:07:01,"and when you put it in the washing machine,"
00:07:01,00:07:03,"the cellulose goes a bit wonky,"
00:07:03,00:07:05,"and it comes out and it's all creased,"
00:07:05,00:07:09,"and the ironing works by loosening these cellulose threads,"
00:07:09,00:07:11,"and when they're loose, when they're nice and--"
00:07:11,00:07:12,- It's warm and relaxed.
00:07:12,00:07:15,"- It's warm and relaxed, then they can get into a line,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,you press them down and they'll stay in that line.
00:07:17,00:07:18,That's how it works.
00:07:18,00:07:19,- Interesting.
00:07:19,00:07:21,"- But the non-iron ones,"
00:07:21,00:07:24,the formaldehyde basically locks those cellulode fibres
00:07:24,00:07:25,in place.
00:07:25,00:07:28,"- When you join the army, if you go to Sandhurst,"
00:07:28,00:07:31,"which is a very, very posh British army--"
00:07:31,00:07:33,- Sprint's Harry's Place was an academy.
00:07:33,00:07:34,"- Yeah, probably went to Sandhurst."
00:07:34,00:07:36,- You have to carry in your own ironing board.
00:07:36,00:07:37,- Really?
00:07:37,00:07:39,"- Yeah, and I asked a friend of mine who went to Sandhurst,"
00:07:39,00:07:40,"and he said, ""Yes, you do."""
00:07:40,00:07:41,- Do you? - Of course you do.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"- Of course you do, you don't bring your ironing board."
00:07:43,00:07:46,- Could you not share an ironing board between a barrack?
00:07:46,00:07:48,- There's simply so much ironing to do with.
00:07:48,00:07:51,You've got so many different kinds of uniform
00:07:51,00:07:53,"as a modern, heroic, action-man type."
00:07:53,00:07:53,"- Okay, yeah."
00:07:53,00:07:55,- And because they don't have so many cannonballs
00:07:55,00:07:56,in warfare these days.
00:07:56,00:07:57,(all laughing)
00:07:57,00:07:59,- You can't just wait for it to happen naturally.
00:07:59,00:08:01,- I was very hard with a cruise missile
00:08:01,00:08:03,to get a really crisp line on that track.
00:08:03,00:08:04,- I wonder if they're bulletproof
00:08:04,00:08:07,"or if the fabric is Kevlar,"
00:08:07,00:08:10,because that is a fantastic defense shield
00:08:10,00:08:11,that you could double up an ironing board with.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"- Yeah, it's basically human size, isn't it?"
00:08:13,00:08:14,"- It is, that's a human-sized shield."
00:08:14,00:08:16,- You're suggesting people wear their ironing boards
00:08:16,00:08:17,into battle.
00:08:17,00:08:18,- Are we not talking about the front lines here?
00:08:18,00:08:20,We're just talking about back at the barracks.
00:08:20,00:08:22,- You don't do that. (all laughing)
00:08:22,00:08:25,- Here's a really British thing that I'd never heard of
00:08:25,00:08:27,before that used to happen in the past with ironing.
00:08:27,00:08:30,"Some homes, and we still know a few examples of these homes,"
00:08:30,00:08:33,had a room for ironing newspapers.
00:08:33,00:08:34,- Fantastic.
00:08:34,00:08:36,"- That's the dream, that is the dream."
00:08:36,00:08:38,"- Yeah, I read about this in Bill Bryson's book at home,"
00:08:38,00:08:41,"and it was featured, I think, in Downton Abbey,"
00:08:41,00:08:44,but the idea was before the master of the house
00:08:44,00:08:45,"would be given the newspapers,"
00:08:45,00:08:47,"the butler would take it into the ironing room,"
00:08:47,00:08:50,"and they would iron the newspapers, not for creases,"
00:08:50,00:08:53,but to make sure that the ink becomes dry
00:08:53,00:08:54,and solid into the newspaper
00:08:54,00:08:55,so they can wear their white gloves
00:08:55,00:08:57,as they're leafing through the newspaper
00:08:57,00:08:59,and not worry about ink smudging on them.
00:08:59,00:09:00,- I didn't know that was why it was.
00:09:00,00:09:02,I think I honestly always thought it was to make
00:09:02,00:09:04,the newspapers nice and flat for the posh people.
00:09:04,00:09:06,- We should say ironing's at risk.
00:09:06,00:09:07,- What? - Sorry?
00:09:07,00:09:08,"- Ironing's at risk, big risk."
00:09:08,00:09:09,"- Right, what?"
00:09:09,00:09:10,- From the youth.
00:09:10,00:09:11,- Oh yeah.
00:09:11,00:09:11,- Yeah.
00:09:11,00:09:14,"- 30% of 18 to 34 year olds,"
00:09:14,00:09:15,"many of whom may be listening,"
00:09:15,00:09:17,don't own an iron and never do any ironing.
00:09:17,00:09:18,- What do they do instead?
00:09:18,00:09:19,- I don't know.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"- They do, like me, just be wrinkled."
00:09:21,00:09:22,"- I think so, yeah."
00:09:22,00:09:24,"And they will claim things like they're closed,"
00:09:24,00:09:24,don't need ironing.
00:09:24,00:09:26,"- They don't, our mind don't, and James' don't."
00:09:26,00:09:29,"- Honestly, I would always wear mine flat."
00:09:29,00:09:31,"So what I would do is I would wash my shirt,"
00:09:31,00:09:33,"and then just before it was dry,"
00:09:33,00:09:35,"then I would start wearing it,"
00:09:35,00:09:38,and my natural body shape would flatten the shirt.
00:09:38,00:09:39,"- I mean, it's clever."
00:09:39,00:09:41,- You want it to have that shape of your body.
00:09:41,00:09:43,"You do, I mean, that's the point, isn't it?"
00:09:43,00:09:45,If you iron it to a non-realistic standard
00:09:45,00:09:46,"of a completely flat person,"
00:09:46,00:09:48,which is not what any of us are.
00:09:48,00:09:49,- Of course it's gonna crease.
00:09:49,00:09:51,- My whole body is actually creased.
00:09:51,00:09:55,"When I'm naked, I have these terrible creases all over."
00:09:55,00:09:57,- That's a good idea.
00:09:57,00:10:00,Although a better version would be to put it on someone
00:10:00,00:10:01,"whose body you aspire to look like,"
00:10:01,00:10:02,"so that when you get it back,"
00:10:02,00:10:05,you can feel what you want to eventually not break it.
00:10:05,00:10:07,- And your body can iron itself into the shirt.
00:10:07,00:10:08,- Exactly.
00:10:08,00:10:09,- Yeah.
00:10:09,00:10:12,"- Speaking of nightclubs, as I was,"
00:10:12,00:10:14,I am in boards are good for DJs.
00:10:14,00:10:17,Let's say you're an aspiring DJ.
00:10:17,00:10:19,You're going to a house party.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"You've got your decks,"
00:10:21,00:10:23,"but you don't really wanna bring a big old sort of,"
00:10:23,00:10:25,like all the stand.
00:10:25,00:10:26,- I'm a hog on your table.
00:10:26,00:10:31,- So what do you need?
00:10:31,00:10:33,"- You need something that's flat,"
00:10:33,00:10:36,but also you need it to be a very certain height.
00:10:36,00:10:37,- Yeah.
00:10:37,00:10:39,"- You don't want the decks to be up at your eye level,"
00:10:39,00:10:40,"or at your knee level,"
00:10:40,00:10:43,but the good thing about ironing boards is they're adjustable.
00:10:43,00:10:44,- Yes.
00:10:44,00:10:45,- There you go.
00:10:45,00:10:46,- That's so cool.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"- So you look at interviews with DJs and they say,"
00:10:48,00:10:51,"oh yeah, my first ever DJ gig was on an ironing board."
00:10:51,00:10:52,- That's so funny.
00:10:52,00:10:55,"And if you pop some, pop a pair of pants under the decks,"
00:10:55,00:10:56,"by the time your set's finished,"
00:10:56,00:10:57,they'll be lovely and crisp.
00:10:57,00:10:58,That's your journey home.
00:10:58,00:11:02,- It's actually probably the heat of the decks.
00:11:02,00:11:03,- Might do it.
00:11:03,00:11:03,- Yeah.
00:11:03,00:11:04,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:11:04,00:11:05,- Yeah.
00:11:05,00:11:06,"- Do you think in the future,"
00:11:06,00:11:07,"they'll be looking at these ironing boards and saying,"
00:11:07,00:11:09,did you know these used to be used for ironing?
00:11:09,00:11:10,(laughing)
00:11:10,00:11:11,- Before they became--
00:11:11,00:11:12,- With everyone's a DJ.
00:11:12,00:11:13,"- On the DJ boards, yeah."
00:11:13,00:11:16,"- There is actually a guy called DJ Ironing Board,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,who built his rig that fits perfectly
00:11:18,00:11:21,on a normal ironing board and he does festivals and stuff.
00:11:21,00:11:22,- That's awesome.
00:11:22,00:11:23,"- Oh, wow."
00:11:23,00:11:24,"But I mean, you've got to be careful."
00:11:24,00:11:26,"And that's so many times when I'm mid iron,"
00:11:26,00:11:28,you hit the little handle underneath
00:11:28,00:11:29,that sends the entire thing down.
00:11:29,00:11:31,You don't want that.
00:11:31,00:11:32,- How do you do that?
00:11:32,00:11:33,I've never had that experience.
00:11:33,00:11:34,- Happens to be nonstop.
00:11:34,00:11:35,- I've never done it.
00:11:35,00:11:36,- No one else?
00:11:36,00:11:37,- No.
00:11:37,00:11:39,- Can I give you another use for an ironing board?
00:11:39,00:11:39,- Yeah.
00:11:39,00:11:41,- If you want to be Pope.
00:11:41,00:11:43,- Okay.
00:11:43,00:11:44,- Quite neat.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"- Well, for instance, the most recent guy who was Pope"
00:11:46,00:11:50,"was Robert Provost, Pope Leo XIV."
00:11:50,00:11:52,"And as a child, he played it being a priest"
00:11:52,00:11:55,"by using the family's ironing board as an altar,"
00:11:55,00:11:56,according to his brother.
00:11:56,00:11:58,So he would get the ironing board up.
00:11:58,00:12:00,He would get a load of biscuits
00:12:00,00:12:01,and then put them there.
00:12:01,00:12:03,And his family would come round
00:12:03,00:12:05,"and he would give them a Kit Kat and say,"
00:12:05,00:12:06,"""Buddy of Christ."""
00:12:06,00:12:06,- Really?
00:12:06,00:12:07,- Oh my God.
00:12:07,00:12:08,- Are you serious?
00:12:08,00:12:09,- Absolutely.
00:12:09,00:12:11,"- And again, you can alter the altar as you're growing up."
00:12:11,00:12:12,- Alter the altar.
00:12:12,00:12:13,- So it's all good.
00:12:13,00:12:16,"- I mean, they must have thought he was on,"
00:12:16,00:12:17,that was a pretty long shot
00:12:17,00:12:19,when he was a kid doing the Kit Kat thing.
00:12:19,00:12:20,But that's incredible.
00:12:20,00:12:23,"Like, they're laughing on the other side of their face now."
00:12:23,00:12:24,- He works in mysterious ways.
00:12:24,00:12:27,- This is good news for the world of ironing
00:12:27,00:12:30,"because actually the last Pope, Francis,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,actively announced that ironing needed to stop
00:12:32,00:12:34,and so did in homes.
00:12:34,00:12:36,So there was a question about all these Italian kids
00:12:36,00:12:38,that weren't leaving home and what do I do
00:12:38,00:12:40,to get my son a job and get him out of the house?
00:12:40,00:12:43,"And the Pope said, ""Stop ironing for him."""
00:12:43,00:12:44,And that was like-
00:12:44,00:12:44,- Like mums overlooked.
00:12:44,00:12:45,- Exactly.
00:12:45,00:12:46,Why would he leave home?
00:12:46,00:12:48,He's got his stuff being ironed every day by you.
00:12:48,00:12:50,You're mollycolling him.
00:12:50,00:12:51,"- And an interesting thing to focus on as Pope,"
00:12:51,00:12:54,"but you know, they're focused on worse, I suppose."
00:12:54,00:12:57,- It turns out they're all obsessed.
00:12:57,00:12:59,- Another great world leader
00:12:59,00:13:02,"who did a spot of ironing in her day, Margaret Thatcher."
00:13:02,00:13:03,- Really?
00:13:03,00:13:04,"- Even after she was an MP,"
00:13:04,00:13:07,"she would iron her husband, Dennis's shirts, in parliament."
00:13:07,00:13:08,- In what?
00:13:08,00:13:11,- Not on the floor of the House of Commons.
00:13:11,00:13:12,- Okay.
00:13:12,00:13:13,- Just on the dispatch board.
00:13:13,00:13:15,"- There is a desk there, actually, isn't there?"
00:13:15,00:13:16,- Yeah.
00:13:16,00:13:16,- I think it's wooden.
00:13:16,00:13:17,I think that would be very bad for it.
00:13:17,00:13:19,"- Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right."
00:13:19,00:13:21,"No, there was a ladies' room."
00:13:21,00:13:23,And this was a time when there were fewer female MPs
00:13:23,00:13:23,than there are now.
00:13:23,00:13:27,There was a need for women to have their own space in parliament.
00:13:27,00:13:29,"And it had an ironing board in it,"
00:13:29,00:13:33,and she frankly monopolised that iron.
00:13:33,00:13:34,"- Well, she was a fan of monopolies."
00:13:34,00:13:35,- Yeah.
00:13:35,00:13:36,"- Brilliant, absolutely brilliant."
00:13:36,00:13:38,That's the best batch of ironing monopolies
00:13:38,00:13:41,track you'll hear on any podcast this week.
00:13:41,00:13:41,- This week.
00:13:41,00:13:46,"- But if he listens to ""Off Lady"" next week..."
00:13:46,00:13:47,- They come up these days.
00:13:48,00:13:50,(upbeat music)
00:13:50,00:13:56,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:13:56,00:13:57,and that is Andy.
00:13:57,00:13:59,"- My fact is that 900 years ago,"
00:13:59,00:14:01,England beat Scotland in a battle
00:14:01,00:14:03,"with an earth horn super weapon,"
00:14:03,00:14:06,which scattered the Scots by frightening their cows.
00:14:06,00:14:09,Lot to unpack.
00:14:09,00:14:09,- Yeah.
00:14:09,00:14:11,- What's an earth horn?
00:14:11,00:14:12,- Glad you asked.
00:14:12,00:14:14,It's not a common thing anymore.
00:14:14,00:14:15,This was word of the day
00:14:15,00:14:17,on the OED website the other day.
00:14:17,00:14:18,"- Highly recommended, you know."
00:14:18,00:14:19,"If you're listening to this,"
00:14:19,00:14:21,just go over to the Oxford English Dictionary website
00:14:21,00:14:23,and see what the word of the day is.
00:14:23,00:14:24,And this is earth horn.
00:14:24,00:14:27,I think this was the first and maybe last time it was used.
00:14:27,00:14:29,"- Yes, it's a hapax legomenon."
00:14:29,00:14:30,- Yeah.
00:14:30,00:14:32,- As in there's only one mention of it
00:14:32,00:14:33,in the whole of literature.
00:14:33,00:14:35,"- The whole of literature, yeah."
00:14:35,00:14:37,"So it didn't take off basically this earth horn,"
00:14:37,00:14:40,"like secret weapon, whatever it was."
00:14:40,00:14:41,Seems to have been a big horn.
00:14:41,00:14:43,- Despite working apparently.
00:14:43,00:14:44,"- Yeah, you're right."
00:14:44,00:14:45,- You're absolutely right.
00:14:45,00:14:46,- The other thing to say as well
00:14:46,00:14:50,is it was only mentioned once and that was in 1338.
00:14:50,00:14:53,And it referred to a battle that happened in 1138.
00:14:53,00:14:54,- Okay.
00:14:54,00:14:55,"- Yes, so."
00:14:55,00:14:57,- It's like the 200th anniversary of this battle.
00:14:57,00:14:59,"- Finally, we're gonna uncover this secret weapon"
00:14:59,00:15:00,that we used.
00:15:00,00:15:03,No one's mentioned it before now.
00:15:03,00:15:05,"- And again, it's not completely clear from the OED source"
00:15:05,00:15:09,why frightening the cows was a key factor
00:15:09,00:15:10,in the end of the battle.
00:15:10,00:15:11,- Okay.
00:15:11,00:15:13,"Well, give us everything we know about it then"
00:15:13,00:15:14,from the description.
00:15:14,00:15:15,- Definitely huge amount of it.
00:15:15,00:15:16,- That's it.
00:15:16,00:15:17,- It's a thing called the Derethorn.
00:15:17,00:15:19,"- We don't know anything about the earth horn, definitely."
00:15:19,00:15:20,- We don't know if it was a sound.
00:15:20,00:15:21,"I mean, horn implies it."
00:15:21,00:15:23,- And what do we know why earth?
00:15:23,00:15:24,Is it made of earth?
00:15:24,00:15:25,Is it comes from the earth?
00:15:25,00:15:27,"- I can't stress enough, this was 900 years ago."
00:15:27,00:15:30,"As James says, first recorded 200 years later"
00:15:30,00:15:31,for the first and last time.
00:15:31,00:15:33,We really don't know much about it.
00:15:33,00:15:35,This is my challenge fact for the week.
00:15:35,00:15:39,"- As I said, it happened in 1138."
00:15:39,00:15:40,So what was going on?
00:15:40,00:15:42,- What was going on was a thousand years of conflict
00:15:42,00:15:44,between England and Scotland on and off.
00:15:45,00:15:47,But quite a lot of on.
00:15:47,00:15:51,So what I found was the earliest battle recorded
00:15:51,00:15:53,"between Angles and the Scots slash Picts,"
00:15:53,00:15:56,that was in 596 AD.
00:15:56,00:15:57,- Wow.
00:15:57,00:15:59,- And the last battle between England and Scotland
00:15:59,00:16:03,"as completely independent kingdoms was, when was it?"
00:16:03,00:16:05,"That was 1547, correct?"
00:16:05,00:16:06,"- This particular one that we're talking about,"
00:16:06,00:16:08,"the Battle of North Allerton,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,also known as the Battle of the Standards.
00:16:10,00:16:15,This was that time when Henry had died Matilda
00:16:16,00:16:18,was maybe going to be our queen.
00:16:18,00:16:20,Stephen was maybe going to be the king.
00:16:20,00:16:22,There was a whole load of conflict
00:16:22,00:16:23,about who was going to take over.
00:16:23,00:16:26,And the Scots were on the side of Matilda.
00:16:26,00:16:28,And a lot of the Barons in England
00:16:28,00:16:30,were on the side of Stephen.
00:16:30,00:16:31,And so there was a big old battle
00:16:31,00:16:33,because the Scots wanted to help out
00:16:33,00:16:36,because Matilda was the daughter of a Scottish kick.
00:16:36,00:16:41,- I read that this battle took place on Calton Moor.
00:16:41,00:16:42,- Jesus.
00:16:42,00:16:43,- Is that interesting?
00:16:43,00:16:44,- That is interesting.
00:16:44,00:16:45,- Moor.
00:16:45,00:16:45,- Do you want to say that again?
00:16:45,00:16:47,- Calton Moor.
00:16:47,00:16:49,- You didn't want to stress the cow part.
00:16:49,00:16:51,"- Well, that was obvious."
00:16:51,00:16:53,The Moor was going to be a bit more difficult.
00:16:53,00:16:54,- Yeah.
00:16:54,00:16:55,"- No, I think that's really good, Dan."
00:16:55,00:16:55,"- Yeah, that's very good."
00:16:55,00:16:58,- Give them lots of cows at the end of the battle.
00:16:58,00:17:00,- We talked about this when David Mitchell
00:17:00,00:17:01,was on the podcast.
00:17:01,00:17:02,"- This era we did, yeah."
00:17:02,00:17:04,"- If you've got your English history,"
00:17:04,00:17:05,"Kings and Queens ruler,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,"it's the bit that goes Willy, Willy, Harry, Steve."
00:17:07,00:17:10,"It's the Steve bit, of course, King Stephen."
00:17:10,00:17:13,- And if you've got the ruler that goes all the way forward
00:17:13,00:17:15,and just to emphasise how much the Scots in English
00:17:15,00:17:16,"didn't like each other back then,"
00:17:16,00:17:18,"and obviously it's all water on the bridge now,"
00:17:18,00:17:21,"but between 1040 and 1745,"
00:17:21,00:17:24,33 out of the 36 English monarchs
00:17:24,00:17:27,"either invaded or were invaded by Scotland,"
00:17:27,00:17:28,which is strong.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"It's a strong record, isn't it?"
00:17:30,00:17:31,- So it's a long old skirmish.
00:17:31,00:17:32,- I know.
00:17:32,00:17:33,"- Although it could have all been avoided,"
00:17:33,00:17:36,"or the worst bits could have been avoided,"
00:17:36,00:17:40,if it weren't for just a small diplomatic cock-up.
00:17:40,00:17:41,"So the worst phase,"
00:17:41,00:17:42,"and with all the famous battles,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,"like your Bannock Burns and your Mel Gibson's,"
00:17:44,00:17:47,"was 13th and 14th centuries,"
00:17:47,00:17:49,and that was the Wars of Independence.
00:17:49,00:17:53,And it all kicked off when Alexander III of Scotland dies
00:17:53,00:17:56,in early 1290s.
00:17:56,00:17:57,"And there were these two guys,"
00:17:57,00:17:58,"John Balliol and Robert Bruce,"
00:17:58,00:18:01,who was the grandfather of the famous Robert Bruce.
00:18:01,00:18:02,"- Sorry, it was one Robert the Bruce,"
00:18:02,00:18:04,and the other one was just Robert Bruce.
00:18:04,00:18:05,"- Yeah, that was his middle name."
00:18:05,00:18:08,"- Yeah, you sometimes got to slip that in there"
00:18:08,00:18:09,to differentiate.
00:18:09,00:18:11,"- So no, there was a guy called John Balliol,"
00:18:11,00:18:13,there was a guy called Robert Bruce.
00:18:13,00:18:16,Robert Bruce's grandson was also called Robert Bruce.
00:18:16,00:18:17,"He's the famous one,"
00:18:17,00:18:20,who for bad reasons we now call Robert the Bruce.
00:18:20,00:18:22,I think related to the fact that he was Robert the Bruce.
00:18:22,00:18:25,- He's brave heart for anyone who knows that movie.
00:18:25,00:18:27,"This is Mel Gibson's granddad, Robert Bruce."
00:18:27,00:18:28,- Exactly.
00:18:28,00:18:29,They couldn't decide who was gonna be king.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"So they asked Edward I of England,"
00:18:31,00:18:33,"as their neighbor and friend,"
00:18:33,00:18:34,"as an impartial observer,"
00:18:34,00:18:36,to say which one of us should be king.
00:18:36,00:18:37,"- Man, that's it, right."
00:18:37,00:18:40,"- Edward I thought, great, here's my chance."
00:18:40,00:18:41,"And he said, okay, I'll do that."
00:18:41,00:18:43,"But first of all, I need to have legal authority"
00:18:43,00:18:46,over Scotland to have this kind of authority
00:18:46,00:18:48,to decide who's king.
00:18:48,00:18:49,"And so little legal loophole,"
00:18:49,00:18:51,he gave himself authority over all of Scotland.
00:18:51,00:18:53,And then the rest is history.
00:18:53,00:18:55,He just started getting in the way all the time.
00:18:55,00:18:56,And what a cock up.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"- Yeah, Berwick upon Tweed is the,"
00:18:59,00:19:02,"now, if you're heading north from England to Scotland,"
00:19:02,00:19:05,it's pretty much the last English town you pass through.
00:19:05,00:19:07,- If you're heading on the east coast.
00:19:07,00:19:08,"- If you're heading on the east coast, absolutely."
00:19:08,00:19:11,"- Sorry, a big fan of the west coast mainline over here."
00:19:11,00:19:12,- I love the west coast mainline.
00:19:12,00:19:15,"But for international listeners, let us simplify."
00:19:15,00:19:18,Just saying it's the last term before Scotland.
00:19:18,00:19:23,"So Berwick upon Tweed, very, very northern English town."
00:19:23,00:19:27,It has changed hands 13 times over the last thousand years.
00:19:27,00:19:30,"I mean, mostly like centuries ago."
00:19:30,00:19:32,"And all the times it changed hands,"
00:19:32,00:19:33,it wasn't just being captured in battles.
00:19:33,00:19:37,"So in 1174, Scotland gave it to England"
00:19:37,00:19:39,because William I had been captured.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"And that was part of the ransom is like,"
00:19:41,00:19:42,we want Berwick upon Tweed.
00:19:42,00:19:44,"Then 20 years later, Scotland bought it back"
00:19:44,00:19:47,'cause King Richard needed money for a crusade.
00:19:47,00:19:48,"They're like, what can I flog off?"
00:19:48,00:19:51,"Oh, so Berwick upon Tweed, the Scots love that."
00:19:51,00:19:51,(laughing)
00:19:51,00:19:55,"For about 200 years, once every 15 years, it changed hands."
00:19:55,00:19:57,- Do you think the people in Berwick upon Tweed
00:19:57,00:19:59,"going about their lives, do you think they ever knew?"
00:19:59,00:20:00,- They just say they're from Berwick.
00:20:00,00:20:02,"A lot of people there just say I'm a Berwicker, you know."
00:20:02,00:20:04,"There's a guy called Derek Sharman,"
00:20:04,00:20:06,who's a local historian who says this a lot.
00:20:06,00:20:07,- Derek from Berwick?
00:20:07,00:20:09,- Derek from Berwick upon Tweed.
00:20:09,00:20:14,- He says that basically they're all just Berricas.
00:20:14,00:20:16,"And actually, if you're from north of the river"
00:20:16,00:20:19,"and south of the river, that's kind of a distinguishable"
00:20:19,00:20:21,sort of almost nationality as well.
00:20:21,00:20:22,"- I was it, that's where the next big civil war"
00:20:22,00:20:24,"is happening, isn't it?"
00:20:24,00:20:28,"Edward I, who was the famous antagonist,"
00:20:28,00:20:29,the hammer of the Scots.
00:20:29,00:20:30,- Hammer of the Scots.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"- Long shanks, lots of nicknames."
00:20:33,00:20:36,"He is still in Westminster Abbey,"
00:20:36,00:20:39,"buried just in a very plain lead casket,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,not with the normal regalia of English monarchs.
00:20:41,00:20:43,- Is that to not upset the Scots?
00:20:43,00:20:46,"- It's the absolute opposite, James, it's because--"
00:20:46,00:20:47,"- Oh, no."
00:20:47,00:20:48,- It's a properly wind them up.
00:20:48,00:20:49,- It's a really fucking piss them off.
00:20:49,00:20:51,"No, I think it would give the Scots,"
00:20:51,00:20:53,"it would gratify them, 'cause basically,"
00:20:53,00:20:55,he said I don't want to be buried properly
00:20:55,00:20:57,until the Scots are finally conquered.
00:20:57,00:21:00,And they haven't yet finally been conquered.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"And so, no one's yet exhumed him"
00:21:02,00:21:03,and buried him in a poor basket.
00:21:03,00:21:05,- Did they not consider when we beat them
00:21:05,00:21:08,in Euro 96-21 with that coal gas coin gold?
00:21:08,00:21:10,- People were battering away at Westminster Abbey
00:21:10,00:21:11,with spades.
00:21:11,00:21:13,(laughing)
00:21:13,00:21:14,"- How interesting, yeah, Edward I,"
00:21:14,00:21:17,the really interesting thing about him
00:21:17,00:21:19,"is the Siege of Stirling Castle,"
00:21:19,00:21:22,when he got this enormous trebuchet built.
00:21:22,00:21:25,"So, a trebuchet is like a catapult,"
00:21:25,00:21:27,and it was called the War Wolf.
00:21:27,00:21:29,It was 90 meters tall.
00:21:29,00:21:31,"It took three months to build,"
00:21:31,00:21:35,"and the Scots, when they saw it sort of trundling up,"
00:21:35,00:21:37,"they went, ""Oh, shit."""
00:21:37,00:21:38,"And they said, ""It's okay, we surrender,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,"""we surrender, we surrender."""
00:21:40,00:21:43,"And King Edward went, ""Oh, I've spent three months"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"""making this now, so we attack them anyway."""
00:21:46,00:21:48,Even though they surrendered.
00:21:48,00:21:49,"- Yeah, Deneep, it was basically going,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,"""Okay, I'm just going to test it though,"
00:21:51,00:21:53,"""and you're not allowed to leave the castle"
00:21:53,00:21:55,"""until the test is over."""
00:21:55,00:21:57,"Good Lord. - Yeah, pretty wild."
00:21:57,00:21:59,"- Well, it's a great name, the War Wolf."
00:21:59,00:22:00,"- Yeah. - Yeah, that is cool."
00:22:00,00:22:02,"- You don't want to waste work like that, do you?"
00:22:02,00:22:04,"You know, you can see its point."
00:22:04,00:22:06,- We'll just wheel it on to the next place.
00:22:06,00:22:07,"- I'll tell you what, the War Wolf was good"
00:22:07,00:22:09,"against this castle, but it was even better"
00:22:09,00:22:10,against the castle made of sticks
00:22:10,00:22:12,and the castle made of straw.
00:22:12,00:22:15,- Hey. (laughs)
00:22:15,00:22:16,"- Get it, I get it. - Yeah."
00:22:16,00:22:19,- One of the chief nobles who led the Scottish rebellions
00:22:19,00:22:21,"after over the first little land grab there,"
00:22:21,00:22:24,"he was called Andrew Demore, or Andrew Murray."
00:22:24,00:22:25,"- Oh, really? - Oh, really?"
00:22:25,00:22:27,- He was like the other William Wallace.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"- He was the one who wasn't William Wallace, basically."
00:22:28,00:22:30,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's Demore."
00:22:30,00:22:32,(all laugh)
00:22:32,00:22:37,- Branickburn is where-- - Freedom.
00:22:37,00:22:38,- Freedom was won. - That was the moment?
00:22:38,00:22:41,"- For Andrew Murray here, then deceased, but--"
00:22:41,00:22:43,- Was it you or was it William Wallace?
00:22:43,00:22:44,- I think I was dead by this point.
00:22:44,00:22:45,"- Right, you were. - I think it was"
00:22:45,00:22:47,"an earlier battle where I did very, very well, by the way,"
00:22:47,00:22:49,but then I got injured and died.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"- It was Sterling Bridge, in fact, sadly."
00:22:51,00:22:53,"- That's so would be on your tooth, so I did."
00:22:53,00:22:57,"- Very well, actually. (all laugh)"
00:22:57,00:22:58,- Red like a four-star battle.
00:22:58,00:23:01,(all laugh)
00:23:01,00:23:04,"- When you're killed in a fight, but you still did all right,"
00:23:04,00:23:08,"that's Demore, which has so many battles over the centuries."
00:23:08,00:23:09,It's kind of insane.
00:23:09,00:23:12,Scotland had a huge role in what gets called
00:23:12,00:23:14,"the English Civil War, which turns out,"
00:23:14,00:23:15,"we shouldn't call the English Civil War,"
00:23:15,00:23:17,it should be called the War of the Three Kingdoms.
00:23:17,00:23:18,"- Is that the War of the Roses,"
00:23:18,00:23:21,or is it the War of the Ramtheads versus Cavaliers?
00:23:21,00:23:25,"- The War of the Roses ends in 1485,"
00:23:25,00:23:28,with Henry III and Battle of Bosworth
00:23:28,00:23:30,and Henry VII taking over.
00:23:30,00:23:31,What gets called the English Civil War
00:23:31,00:23:33,"is the 1640s, basically."
00:23:33,00:23:36,"It started partly because Charles I,"
00:23:36,00:23:38,"who was basically a useless,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,like imagine a useless king.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"- Oh, you thought the Cromwell Kool-Aid, didn't you?"
00:23:43,00:23:46,"- He's a big floppy, rough, suspicious continental practices."
00:23:46,00:23:48,"People worried, he was a Catholic, that kind of stuff."
00:23:48,00:23:49,- Imagine the ironing it took to get to that level.
00:23:49,00:23:51,(laughing)
00:23:51,00:23:54,"- He had tried to interfere with the Church of Scotland,"
00:23:54,00:23:55,and he'd tried to impose his own prayer books
00:23:55,00:23:58,on the Kirk in 1637.
00:23:58,00:24:00,This went down phenomenally badly.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"It led to a thing called the Bishop's Wars,"
00:24:02,00:24:04,"where it just, like, Ecclesiast people."
00:24:04,00:24:05,- They all attacked diagonally.
00:24:05,00:24:06,(laughing)
00:24:06,00:24:08,- Superb.
00:24:08,00:24:10,- That's the best Bishop this week.
00:24:10,00:24:11,- This week.
00:24:11,00:24:13,"- I don't know, you haven't heard parenting hell"
00:24:13,00:24:14,"this week, haven't you, Andy?"
00:24:14,00:24:17,(laughing)
00:24:17,00:24:18,- And Scotland got so angry
00:24:18,00:24:20,about this prayer book difference
00:24:20,00:24:21,"that they occupied Northern England,"
00:24:21,00:24:23,"and he had to not only back down,"
00:24:23,00:24:24,"he had to pay expenses,"
00:24:24,00:24:25,which is so humiliating after a war.
00:24:25,00:24:28,"- Pay expenses, what, like, we bought these train tickets"
00:24:28,00:24:30,"to get down to Leeds, can you?"
00:24:30,00:24:31,"- Pretty much, yes."
00:24:31,00:24:34,"- We've not really, excuse me, 10 pounds 60 at Pratt."
00:24:34,00:24:34,(laughing)
00:24:34,00:24:35,"- Who was this, guys?"
00:24:35,00:24:36,"- It was a sandwich and a drink,"
00:24:36,00:24:38,it was expensive these days.
00:24:38,00:24:39,(laughing)
00:24:39,00:24:42,"So Charles then had to ask for money from Parliament,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,"'cause of the war debt that had been imposed,"
00:24:44,00:24:46,and that helped kick off the entire Civil War period.
00:24:46,00:24:48,"And then at the end of it,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,"the English Execute Charles, Cromwell, comes in,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,"and the Scots are furious,"
00:24:52,00:24:53,"and that leads to another battle,"
00:24:53,00:24:54,"because they were so angry about,"
00:24:54,00:24:56,"as they saw it, their king."
00:24:56,00:24:57,"Getting a say, chopped off."
00:24:57,00:24:58,"- Yeah, I know. - Okay."
00:24:58,00:25:00,Do you know this William Wallace period?
00:25:00,00:25:01,Robert the Bruce.
00:25:01,00:25:05,"Robert the Bruce don't hear too much about him these days,"
00:25:05,00:25:06,but he influenced something great
00:25:06,00:25:08,in modern popular culture.
00:25:08,00:25:10,Someone was named after him.
00:25:10,00:25:12,"- Someone was named after Robert Bruce, Bruce Fawceth."
00:25:12,00:25:14,- No. - Bruce Brinkstein.
00:25:14,00:25:15,- No.
00:25:15,00:25:16,- Robert...
00:25:17,00:25:18,- Mugabe.
00:25:18,00:25:19,- Okay.
00:25:19,00:25:22,"- Is that, are we saying that's popular culture?"
00:25:22,00:25:24,"- Oh, his middle name, Winnie the Pooh."
00:25:24,00:25:27,(laughing)
00:25:27,00:25:31,"- Now it's Bruce, and it is in the world of fiction."
00:25:31,00:25:32,- Bruce Almighty.
00:25:32,00:25:33,- Nope.
00:25:33,00:25:34,- Bruce.
00:25:34,00:25:35,- He's the most famous Bruce.
00:25:35,00:25:36,- Bruce Dickinson.
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- The guy from Matilda, the fat kid."
00:25:38,00:25:39,"- Yes, Anna."
00:25:39,00:25:40,- Bruce Banner from the Hulk.
00:25:40,00:25:41,- You're so close.
00:25:41,00:25:42,- Bruce.
00:25:42,00:25:43,- Superhero.
00:25:43,00:25:44,"- Bruce, is he Australian?"
00:25:44,00:25:45,"- Oh, Bruce Wayne."
00:25:45,00:25:46,- Bruce Wayne.
00:25:46,00:25:48,- Who's Bruce Wayne?
00:25:48,00:25:50,"- What do you mean, who's Bruce Wayne?"
00:25:50,00:25:51,"Oh, you only know Batman."
00:25:51,00:25:53,"Okay, so Batman."
00:25:53,00:25:54,- Bruce Wayne is Batman?
00:25:54,00:25:56,(laughing)
00:25:56,00:26:05,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:26:05,00:26:06,and that is my fact.
00:26:06,00:26:09,"My fact this week is that in 1999,"
00:26:09,00:26:14,the first ever TV ad made for Cats was broadcast on ITV
00:26:14,00:26:18,and had an estimated viewership of three million cats.
00:26:18,00:26:19,- Three million.
00:26:19,00:26:20,- Three million.
00:26:20,00:26:21,"- Well, the numbers."
00:26:21,00:26:23,- 'Cause the number you sent around was seven million.
00:26:23,00:26:26,"- Yeah, but then I did some additional research."
00:26:26,00:26:27,"- Interestingly, I have two million."
00:26:27,00:26:29,- I have two million as well.
00:26:29,00:26:32,- I've had to go over my numbers quite a few times.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"Basically, this was a commercial that was put together"
00:26:35,00:26:37,"by whiskers, the cat food people,"
00:26:37,00:26:39,and they wanted to put something together
00:26:39,00:26:41,"that was specifically for cats,"
00:26:41,00:26:43,and so they asked someone what would generate
00:26:43,00:26:45,"a cat's interest, and it turns out"
00:26:45,00:26:49,an incredibly surreal 40-second animation
00:26:49,00:26:52,"full of weird ping noises, little sounds,"
00:26:52,00:26:55,"a mouse running up, a line going up and down the screen,"
00:26:55,00:26:57,"very random stuff, and they made a big deal out of it."
00:26:57,00:26:58,"It was a big promo thing,"
00:26:58,00:27:01,"and on the 27th of January, 1999,"
00:27:01,00:27:04,"there was an announcement just before it was coming on,"
00:27:04,00:27:06,a pre-ad to say we were about to play
00:27:06,00:27:08,the first ever ad for Cats.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"Get your cat, let's do this."
00:27:10,00:27:12,- I think it was also announced in like the newspapers
00:27:12,00:27:14,"and stuff beforehand, 'cause I remember it happening."
00:27:14,00:27:16,- They had to advertise the advert.
00:27:16,00:27:18,"It's like clever, really, 'cause you get publicity"
00:27:18,00:27:19,out of the fact you're doing an advert.
00:27:19,00:27:20,That's very hard to do.
00:27:20,00:27:22,"- They've won a lot of awards, basically, for innovation,"
00:27:22,00:27:23,of getting the interest of the people
00:27:23,00:27:25,to make sure that their cats were in.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"Now, the numbers are dodgy, obviously."
00:27:27,00:27:29,1999 was a period where it went from viewership
00:27:29,00:27:32,"to households, so you don't know how many people"
00:27:32,00:27:33,would be in a household.
00:27:33,00:27:36,"So 2.2 people per household, roughly,"
00:27:36,00:27:39,is what the ratings would suggest we're watching.
00:27:39,00:27:40,- How many cats?
00:27:40,00:27:41,"- Well, let's get to Hang on, guys."
00:27:41,00:27:43,"Don't have a head on the numbers, okay?"
00:27:43,00:27:44,So we know what the numbers were
00:27:44,00:27:45,of the viewing figures that night.
00:27:45,00:27:49,"It was 18,520,000."
00:27:49,00:27:49,That's what we're watching.
00:27:49,00:27:52,"However, that's viewers, not households, right?"
00:27:52,00:27:54,"Okay, so if we're talking houses"
00:27:54,00:27:56,"that might have a cat in it, we've got to look at houses."
00:27:56,00:27:58,"Yeah, so let's 2.2 people."
00:27:58,00:28:00,"So you've got to bring that down, that number,"
00:28:00,00:28:03,"basically split that number in half, right?"
00:28:03,00:28:06,Then it wasn't just shown on ITV that night.
00:28:06,00:28:09,It was also shown on Channel 4 and Channel 5.
00:28:09,00:28:10,So we need to add those in.
00:28:10,00:28:12,So that's 21.2 million viewers.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"Split that in half, it's roughly 10.6 households."
00:28:14,00:28:16,- I'm not counting the Channel 5 viewers
00:28:16,00:28:17,'cause I remember Channel 5 in the '90s
00:28:17,00:28:19,and it was too blurry to make anything out.
00:28:19,00:28:20,- Okay.
00:28:20,00:28:22,- They didn't see any of those inches.
00:28:22,00:28:23,"- And how many did it contain a cat,"
00:28:23,00:28:24,"I suppose, for the next one?"
00:28:24,00:28:26,"- Well, at that time, it's estimated"
00:28:26,00:28:29,that a quarter of all houses in the UK had cats.
00:28:29,00:28:31,- And then what percentage of households
00:28:31,00:28:33,invited their cats into the room to watch when it happened?
00:28:33,00:28:34,- And do they have one cat or two cats?
00:28:34,00:28:36,So most houses had 1.6 cats.
00:28:36,00:28:37,So you then got to add those in.
00:28:37,00:28:39,"- It was a gruesome time, the '90s."
00:28:39,00:28:41,"- So roughly when you add all those numbers together,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,"in theory, there could be roughly around 3 million cats"
00:28:43,00:28:45,that were in front of a screen in the room.
00:28:45,00:28:47,- So are you having 3 million as your number?
00:28:47,00:28:48,- I'm gonna go for 3 million
00:28:48,00:28:49,because I'm also gonna add in the fact
00:28:49,00:28:50,it was played in America
00:28:50,00:28:52,and so those numbers are gonna add up.
00:28:52,00:28:56,"- Can I say, I think the number might be 3 million and one"
00:28:56,00:28:59,"because I let Harley watch it this week, my cat."
00:28:59,00:29:02,"And if you wanna know what she thought of it,"
00:29:02,00:29:04,then go on my TikTok or Instagram
00:29:04,00:29:05,'cause I'll put the video up.
00:29:05,00:29:07,"- Oh, that's very exciting."
00:29:07,00:29:10,We'll add for another format within our show.
00:29:10,00:29:12,You're doing what the cat people did.
00:29:12,00:29:14,"- Yeah, that's what you think is James Harkin, get on there."
00:29:14,00:29:16,"- Wow, that's very good."
00:29:16,00:29:17,It was considered a success.
00:29:17,00:29:21,"So successful, they released it on video, VHS."
00:29:21,00:29:24,- And I actually found it on eBay.
00:29:24,00:29:27,So this is the first ever commercial for cats.
00:29:27,00:29:28,- Oh my God.
00:29:28,00:29:31,"- Officially released by Whiskers, an old VHS."
00:29:31,00:29:32,- Wow.
00:29:32,00:29:33,- And it reads--
00:29:33,00:29:34,- Why is everyone calling it the first ever
00:29:34,00:29:37,as though now we are inundated by cat adverts?
00:29:37,00:29:38,"- Well, perhaps at the time they thought"
00:29:38,00:29:40,"this is gonna be massive, right?"
00:29:40,00:29:42,So the back says thousands of cats
00:29:42,00:29:45,across the length and breadth of Britain.
00:29:45,00:29:46,"Jumping, staring, cutting--"
00:29:46,00:29:48,- Thousands of thousands.
00:29:48,00:29:50,- Thousands of cats.
00:29:50,00:29:52,So one in a thousand viewers of the advert
00:29:52,00:29:54,had any reaction whatsoever.
00:29:54,00:29:57,"So yeah, so we don't know the numbers"
00:29:57,00:30:00,and they've just muddied the waters even more.
00:30:00,00:30:00,- Amazing.
00:30:00,00:30:01,- It's advertising.
00:30:01,00:30:02,"- Yeah, but it did good for them."
00:30:02,00:30:03,It did really good.
00:30:03,00:30:04,- Oh yeah.
00:30:04,00:30:05,You know what else did well for Whiskers?
00:30:05,00:30:06,Eight out of 10 cats.
00:30:06,00:30:07,- Really?
00:30:07,00:30:08,- That's one of theirs.
00:30:08,00:30:09,- Yeah.
00:30:09,00:30:10,- What do you mean that's one of theirs?
00:30:10,00:30:12,"- Yeah, so there's a TV show Eight Out of 10 Cats"
00:30:12,00:30:13,"and Eight Out of 10 Cats does countdown,"
00:30:13,00:30:15,"but that came from a slogan by Whiskers,"
00:30:15,00:30:19,"which was, ""Eight out of 10 cats prefer our product."""
00:30:19,00:30:20,- Really?
00:30:20,00:30:21,- And they ran it for quite a lot of years
00:30:21,00:30:24,until the advertising standards authority
00:30:24,00:30:26,encouraged them to change it.
00:30:26,00:30:27,"And they changed it to,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,"""Eight out of 10 owners who expressed a preference"
00:30:29,00:30:32,"said that their cat prefers it."""
00:30:32,00:30:34,And the problem was that basically
00:30:34,00:30:36,they'd been doing this Eight Out of 10 Cats for ages
00:30:36,00:30:37,and everyone knew at the time.
00:30:37,00:30:39,And then they went up to nine out of 10 cats.
00:30:39,00:30:42,So they did a survey in 2001
00:30:42,00:30:44,and they thought that actually now it's nine out of 10.
00:30:44,00:30:48,"And when they did that, the people at Friskies,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,"who is another cat food company, said,"
00:30:50,00:30:52,"""Oh, we're not having this."""
00:30:52,00:30:53,And they went to the ASA and they said
00:30:53,00:30:55,that this is a biased survey
00:30:55,00:30:57,and it wasn't a fair reflection.
00:30:57,00:30:59,"- Well, if it's eight out of 10 owners"
00:30:59,00:31:00,"who expressed a preference,"
00:31:00,00:31:01,"that leads to other questions, doesn't it?"
00:31:01,00:31:03,How many owners express a preference?
00:31:03,00:31:03,- Absolutely.
00:31:03,00:31:04,"- Yeah, that's fair enough."
00:31:04,00:31:05,But does this mean that Jimmy Carr
00:31:05,00:31:08,"has to change the title of the show as well, surely?"
00:31:08,00:31:08,"- Yeah, let's do it."
00:31:08,00:31:09,- Yeah. - Cool.
00:31:09,00:31:10,Let's get in contact.
00:31:10,00:31:12,"They were very good whiskers, by the way,"
00:31:12,00:31:14,with their promotion in 1999 specifically.
00:31:14,00:31:16,"So over in Australia,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,there was an Aussie rules footballer called Gary Hawking
00:31:18,00:31:21,who changed his name by depot to whiskers.
00:31:21,00:31:23,"And the idea was that as he was playing,"
00:31:23,00:31:25,"they had no choice but to say,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,"""Oh, whiskers has got the ball."""
00:31:26,00:31:29,- Did they do that or did they just use his old name?
00:31:29,00:31:31,Like that's what happens when football teams
00:31:31,00:31:35,change the name of the stadium to a company name.
00:31:35,00:31:36,People just call it the old name.
00:31:36,00:31:39,"- Yep, the AFL were very against calling them whiskers"
00:31:39,00:31:41,and really stuck to Gary Hawking.
00:31:41,00:31:43,They were paid a couple of hundred grand
00:31:43,00:31:44,in order to advertise them generally.
00:31:44,00:31:47,And this was a sort of extra move by Gary Hawking
00:31:47,00:31:48,"'cause he thought, ""It's gonna be funny."""
00:31:48,00:31:49,And it made news stories.
00:31:49,00:31:50,It did the job right.
00:31:50,00:31:51,Like that's all that this needs to do.
00:31:51,00:31:53,"- It's like when the snooker player, Jimmy White,"
00:31:53,00:31:57,changed his name to Jimmy Brown to advertise HP Source.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"- Oh, did he? - Yeah."
00:31:59,00:32:00,- One of us should change our names to something.
00:32:00,00:32:02,"- I have changed my name years ago to Maserati,"
00:32:02,00:32:06,"but no one, they keep asking me to stop."
00:32:06,00:32:09,"No one here uses it, nightmare."
00:32:09,00:32:11,"- Videos actually look cracked, cats."
00:32:11,00:32:12,This TV advert would have looked rubbish
00:32:12,00:32:14,because they see so much better than us.
00:32:14,00:32:16,They see about a hundred frames a second.
00:32:16,00:32:18,So we only need to see 20 frames a second
00:32:18,00:32:20,for stuff to look smooth to us.
00:32:20,00:32:24,And I think TV is about 24 or TV is 30 and films are 24.
00:32:24,00:32:25,"So to cats, it's just gonna look like"
00:32:25,00:32:26,a series of photographs.
00:32:26,00:32:29,"- So cat videos in general,"
00:32:29,00:32:31,"can you think of a role, famous role"
00:32:31,00:32:33,that was inspired by cat videos?
00:32:33,00:32:35,- Catwoman.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"- Well, there's no fun if you're gonna get it immediately."
00:32:37,00:32:41,"When Anne Hathaway, the actress, she played catwoman."
00:32:41,00:32:42,- It's just 'cause we did the Batman thing together.
00:32:42,00:32:43,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:32:43,00:32:44,- Wow.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:32:45,00:32:46,- But catwoman isn't an actual cat.
00:32:46,00:32:50,"- Well, no, but she's gone to justify her fee somehow, Anna."
00:32:50,00:32:53,"So she's gonna say, well, I spent a couple of weeks"
00:32:53,00:32:55,looking at cat videos online.
00:32:55,00:32:56,Absolutely another million quid.
00:32:56,00:32:58,"- Daniel Day-Lewis went for the same party,"
00:32:58,00:33:00,just sat there licking his ass for three weeks.
00:33:00,00:33:02,(laughing)
00:33:02,00:33:03,"- Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis."
00:33:03,00:33:06,We've actually received enough half mice.
00:33:06,00:33:08,(laughing)
00:33:08,00:33:11,"- But that way going with Hathaway, I'm sorry."
00:33:11,00:33:12,- She fits the suit better.
00:33:12,00:33:14,(laughing)
00:33:14,00:33:15,- That's been done by a bunch of them.
00:33:15,00:33:18,Tom Holland studied the movements of a spider
00:33:18,00:33:19,in order to--
00:33:19,00:33:20,- Such a shit.
00:33:20,00:33:23,- Robert Downey Jr. watched ironing videos non-stop.
00:33:23,00:33:25,(laughing)
00:33:25,00:33:27,"- It's something to say in an interview, isn't it?"
00:33:27,00:33:29,"- You run out of stuff to say in interviews, yeah."
00:33:29,00:33:30,- I read a really good article.
00:33:30,00:33:32,It was like an inside look at
00:33:32,00:33:35,"the Waltham Pet Care Science Institute at Melton-Mowbury,"
00:33:35,00:33:37,"which is the science arm of Mars Pet Care,"
00:33:37,00:33:40,which is where all of our pet food comes from.
00:33:40,00:33:41,Mars makes it all.
00:33:41,00:33:44,They go to such great lengths to look after their cats there
00:33:44,00:33:47,and to test really advanced foods on them.
00:33:47,00:33:49,They found out that cats prefer Asian cuisine
00:33:49,00:33:52,"because their favorite flavors are,"
00:33:52,00:33:53,"well, you can probably guess."
00:33:53,00:33:54,- Plum sauce.
00:33:54,00:33:54,(laughing)
00:33:54,00:33:56,"- Plum sauce, the same flavor, yeah."
00:33:56,00:33:57,- Umami.
00:33:57,00:33:58,- Umami.
00:33:58,00:34:00,"And the new one, kukumi."
00:34:00,00:34:02,"- Yeah, kukumi, yeah."
00:34:02,00:34:03,"I'm sorry, for those of us not up on our flavors,"
00:34:03,00:34:04,what's that?
00:34:04,00:34:07,"- So it's, I think it's like fullness and richness."
00:34:07,00:34:08,- Kukumi.
00:34:08,00:34:09,"- Yeah, they keep--"
00:34:09,00:34:12,"- It's not like a flavor so much as an enhanced,"
00:34:12,00:34:13,"and it is officially a flavor,"
00:34:13,00:34:17,but it's like enhances salty things and rising like MSG.
00:34:17,00:34:18,"- No, that's sumami."
00:34:18,00:34:19,- Yeah.
00:34:19,00:34:20,- Okay.
00:34:20,00:34:23,- And once all the cats are tested on at Melton-Mowbury
00:34:23,00:34:24,"at this site, they get taken home and adopted"
00:34:24,00:34:26,by one of the people who work there.
00:34:26,00:34:27,- Wow.
00:34:27,00:34:29,"- And in other words, they get turned into pot pies."
00:34:29,00:34:30,"Yeah, we know what you mean."
00:34:30,00:34:32,(laughing)
00:34:32,00:34:34,- They're very good owners to the extent
00:34:34,00:34:37,that one of the research scientists called Scott McGrane
00:34:37,00:34:40,adopted a cat and then noticed when he took it home
00:34:40,00:34:43,that the cat was a bit perplexed by his telly
00:34:43,00:34:44,'cause they had never seen one before.
00:34:44,00:34:46,"And since then they've installed loads of TVs,"
00:34:46,00:34:48,a TV room for the cats there.
00:34:48,00:34:49,- Why?
00:34:49,00:34:50,"- So that when they get adopted,"
00:34:50,00:34:52,they don't get confused by TVs.
00:34:52,00:34:54,- Is that a massive like safeguarding welfare thing
00:34:54,00:34:56,for cats being confused by TVs?
00:34:56,00:34:57,"When they go to their forever homes,"
00:34:57,00:34:58,is that really a problem for them?
00:34:58,00:35:00,"- The RSPCA is clamping down, yes."
00:35:00,00:35:03,- Can I just say Scott McGrane is very much a name
00:35:03,00:35:04,you would come up with if you were trying to come up
00:35:04,00:35:07,with a name for a Scottish person and failing.
00:35:07,00:35:09,(laughing)
00:35:09,00:35:11,"- Scott, you've been mentioned on the show this week."
00:35:11,00:35:12,(laughing)
00:35:12,00:35:13,- Listen in.
00:35:13,00:35:16,"- You know, cats falling off things"
00:35:16,00:35:18,and flipping the right way up and landing on the feet.
00:35:18,00:35:19,"- Yeah, they land on the feet."
00:35:19,00:35:22,- So this was a physics puzzle
00:35:22,00:35:25,"for much of the 19th century, how it happens."
00:35:25,00:35:29,'Cause there was a scientist called George Gabriel Stokes.
00:35:29,00:35:31,"James, you did math, you may have heard of him."
00:35:31,00:35:33,"- Yeah, Stokes Equation, I've heard of that."
00:35:33,00:35:35,"Yeah, it's about fluid mechanics or something."
00:35:35,00:35:36,"- Okay, perfect."
00:35:36,00:35:39,So he was a Lucacean Professor of Maths at Cambridge
00:35:39,00:35:41,"and other holders of the role were people like Isaac Newton,"
00:35:41,00:35:42,"Stephen Hawking. - Oh, Hawking, yeah."
00:35:42,00:35:45,"- So big brain, George Gabriel Stokes."
00:35:45,00:35:47,"He and his colleague, James Clark Maxwell,"
00:35:47,00:35:50,"another big physics name, they were there at the same time."
00:35:50,00:35:53,"And they could not work out, right, cats,"
00:35:53,00:35:57,"if you drop them, they fall onto their feet, how?"
00:35:57,00:35:59,Because they seem to be violating the law
00:35:59,00:36:02,"about the conservation of angular momentum,"
00:36:02,00:36:03,"which is if something rotates,"
00:36:03,00:36:05,"it has to have something to rotate against,"
00:36:05,00:36:06,"which rotates the opposite way, right?"
00:36:06,00:36:07,"- Yeah, got it."
00:36:07,00:36:10,- So how does the cat rotate with nothing to push against?
00:36:10,00:36:12,- Let's say you jump off a diving board.
00:36:12,00:36:14,You've pushed off against that
00:36:14,00:36:16,and you use that kind of a momentum
00:36:16,00:36:17,to twizz around in the air.
00:36:17,00:36:18,- Exactly.
00:36:18,00:36:20,"- But if the cat's just falling, how do they do that?"
00:36:20,00:36:21,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:36:21,00:36:23,- Can I just ask a further clarifying question?
00:36:23,00:36:25,"If I didn't dive off the diving board,"
00:36:25,00:36:27,"if I let myself just fall forward,"
00:36:27,00:36:29,can I swing around to my back?
00:36:29,00:36:31,- I think Andy's about to answer.
00:36:31,00:36:32,"- Right, yeah."
00:36:32,00:36:34,"- But the judges will mug you down for that, Dan."
00:36:34,00:36:37,(all laughing)
00:36:37,00:36:39,- I've just proved Maxwell's theorem.
00:36:39,00:36:42,"- Two, two, George."
00:36:42,00:36:45,(all laughing)
00:36:45,00:36:46,"- So this was so interesting,"
00:36:46,00:36:48,like how on earth are they doing it?
00:36:48,00:36:52,"It turns out what the cats do as they start to drop, right?"
00:36:52,00:36:55,It uses its own mass to rotate around.
00:36:55,00:36:56,How?
00:36:56,00:36:59,"It flips in its four legs, it pulls them in,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,"and that means, like a gymnast,"
00:37:01,00:37:02,"its top half spins faster,"
00:37:02,00:37:05,then it flips out its four limbs
00:37:05,00:37:06,and it flips in its back limbs
00:37:06,00:37:09,and now its back half is revolving faster.
00:37:09,00:37:12,"And it like switches back and forth between those two,"
00:37:12,00:37:16,so it creates its own momentum using its limbs like an athlete.
00:37:16,00:37:19,So that is how the cat rotates.
00:37:19,00:37:21,- And it can do that as quick as falling off this table
00:37:21,00:37:22,that we're recording or something.
00:37:22,00:37:23,"- Yeah, right."
00:37:23,00:37:24,"- I mean, so quickly."
00:37:24,00:37:25,"In 1998, there was an Italian researcher"
00:37:25,00:37:29,who dropped a cat called Esther 600 times
00:37:29,00:37:31,and determined that.
00:37:31,00:37:33,- RSPCA had to get involved at some stage.
00:37:33,00:37:35,- They're too busy with the telly thing.
00:37:35,00:37:37,(all laughing)
00:37:37,00:37:39,- Who are you in for?
00:37:39,00:37:41,Introducing a cat to my home
00:37:41,00:37:42,without briefing it about the TV.
00:37:42,00:37:45,"- Me, oh no, I dropped mine 600 times."
00:37:45,00:37:48,"- Anyway, it came to the very important conclusion."
00:37:48,00:37:50,She could fall on her feet when she was dropped
00:37:50,00:37:51,"from anywhere between two and six feet,"
00:37:51,00:37:53,but not from one foot.
00:37:53,00:37:54,"So it was only from two feet up,"
00:37:54,00:37:57,they could do all this math with gymnastics in the air.
00:37:57,00:37:59,"- And I read the same thing, Anna, it was so good."
00:37:59,00:38:02,He dropped Esther from the height of one foot
00:38:02,00:38:03,100 times in a row
00:38:03,00:38:06,to make sure she definitely couldn't do it.
00:38:06,00:38:08,And she didn't land on her feet once.
00:38:08,00:38:09,- Yeah.
00:38:09,00:38:10,- It's much bigger than the sample size
00:38:10,00:38:11,that you statistically need.
00:38:11,00:38:14,"- I know, he did write in his paper."
00:38:14,00:38:15,I want to thank the cat Esther
00:38:15,00:38:18,for her initial cooperation in this experiment.
00:38:18,00:38:21,(all laughing)
00:38:21,00:38:23,So we didn't get an answer to my question.
00:38:23,00:38:25,"Would if I fell off a diving board,"
00:38:25,00:38:27,do humans have the muscles to do what cats do?
00:38:27,00:38:30,"- I'll hand over to James, he's got a physics degree."
00:38:30,00:38:32,(all laughing)
00:38:32,00:38:35,- I think that you would not be able to do that.
00:38:35,00:38:35,- Maybe not fast enough.
00:38:35,00:38:37,"- I would think if you trained for long enough,"
00:38:37,00:38:38,you might be able to.
00:38:38,00:38:39,"'Cause the physics is there, right?"
00:38:39,00:38:43,"It is possible, but I think it would take training."
00:38:43,00:38:44,"- 'Cause you're not flexible enough,"
00:38:44,00:38:47,like we can't shift our bodies like a cat.
00:38:47,00:38:49,"'Cause they have got, not extra vertebrae,"
00:38:49,00:38:50,"but you know what I mean, they can move,"
00:38:50,00:38:51,they can very flex a lot.
00:38:51,00:38:52,"- They're very flexible, yeah."
00:38:52,00:38:54,"- I think, yeah, with training,"
00:38:54,00:38:55,"other way I thought of it,"
00:38:55,00:38:56,"and I think I skinned it more than Andy,"
00:38:56,00:38:57,"so this is probably wrong,"
00:38:57,00:39:00,but I thought of it as like squeezing a cat like a sponge.
00:39:00,00:39:01,"You know, when you squeeze a sponge out,"
00:39:01,00:39:03,"you have to turn it in two different directions at once,"
00:39:03,00:39:04,don't you?
00:39:04,00:39:05,And that's the only way
00:39:05,00:39:06,that it's going to be able to twist around it.
00:39:06,00:39:08,"- Okay, so Dan, stand up."
00:39:08,00:39:11,How easy is it for you to twist your top half
00:39:11,00:39:13,in one direction and your bottom half
00:39:13,00:39:14,in the other direction?
00:39:15,00:39:17,"- Yeah, you see like, this part."
00:39:17,00:39:18,"Oh, dear."
00:39:18,00:39:19,"- Oh, wow."
00:39:19,00:39:20,- Uh-oh.
00:39:20,00:39:21,- Wow.
00:39:21,00:39:22,(laughing)
00:39:22,00:39:23,- Holy moly.
00:39:23,00:39:23,"- Oh, wow."
00:39:23,00:39:24,- I'm still doing up there.
00:39:24,00:39:27,"- Dan, that is going to be the TikTok craze,"
00:39:27,00:39:28,dance craze of 2025.
00:39:28,00:39:29,(laughing)
00:39:29,00:39:31,- Did you film a change?
00:39:31,00:39:32,Can I make a cameo?
00:39:32,00:39:33,- That is amazing.
00:39:33,00:39:34,- Ow.
00:39:34,00:39:35,"- I'm sorry about that, Dan."
00:39:35,00:39:36,"- No, that's fine."
00:39:36,00:39:39,"- Do you think if you were sat holding a cat right now,"
00:39:39,00:39:40,"and I took a photo,"
00:39:40,00:39:42,"and then we put it on your dating profile,"
00:39:42,00:39:45,people would find you more attractive or less attractive.
00:39:45,00:39:45,Let's say women.
00:39:45,00:39:46,"- Okay, well, first off,"
00:39:46,00:39:47,my wife doesn't know about that account.
00:39:47,00:39:52,"So let's, yeah, I'd say they think you're more attractive."
00:39:52,00:39:53,- With a cat?
00:39:53,00:39:53,- Absolutely.
00:39:53,00:39:55,- I would say maybe less.
00:39:55,00:39:57,"- Yeah, Anna."
00:39:57,00:39:59,"- I asked the woman in the room, I'm going to say less."
00:39:59,00:40:00,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:40:00,00:40:00,"- Yeah, it's a good feeling."
00:40:00,00:40:03,"- Women view men as less masculine,"
00:40:03,00:40:06,"higher in neuroticism, agreeableness and openness,"
00:40:06,00:40:07,but less datable.
00:40:07,00:40:09,- I wonder if I'm not getting any swipes.
00:40:09,00:40:10,- Friend material.
00:40:10,00:40:11,- Less flexible.
00:40:11,00:40:12,"No, it doesn't."
00:40:12,00:40:13,(laughing)
00:40:13,00:40:15,- And is there like a league table of animals?
00:40:15,00:40:18,"Like if I pose with a water bowl, am I?"
00:40:18,00:40:19,(laughing)
00:40:19,00:40:20,- Oh yeah.
00:40:20,00:40:22,"- Or a mink, or a koala must be?"
00:40:22,00:40:26,"- Do you remember when you did your first Edinburgh show,"
00:40:26,00:40:28,and I wanted you to do a poster
00:40:28,00:40:29,"where you were completely naked,"
00:40:29,00:40:32,"but with a water bowl over your privates,"
00:40:32,00:40:33,and we were going to call it socks and gloves
00:40:33,00:40:34,and cock and bowl.
00:40:34,00:40:36,"- Yeah, I do, I do."
00:40:36,00:40:37,(laughing)
00:40:37,00:40:38,- Why did you never go for that?
00:40:38,00:40:39,- Why did you not do that?
00:40:39,00:40:41,"- Just ran out of time on the shoot, mate."
00:40:41,00:40:42,(laughing)
00:40:42,00:40:44,"- That's such a shame, I had the vault."
00:40:44,00:40:46,(laughing)
00:40:46,00:40:49,- Can I ask James a question?
00:40:49,00:40:49,- Yeah.
00:40:49,00:40:50,- As the cat owner in the room.
00:40:50,00:40:51,- Yeah.
00:40:51,00:40:52,"- Do you want a cat owner, no?"
00:40:52,00:40:53,- Half done in the past.
00:40:53,00:40:55,"- Okay, well as a current cat owner, James,"
00:40:55,00:40:58,would you buy a matching outfit for yourself and your cat?
00:40:58,00:41:00,"- No, my cat only wears what God gave her."
00:41:00,00:41:01,- Okay.
00:41:01,00:41:02,- And she insists on not being ironed every day
00:41:02,00:41:04,since she's so very different.
00:41:04,00:41:07,"- No, I would never buy clothes for animals really."
00:41:07,00:41:10,- Then you're part of the nine in 10 in your age group
00:41:10,00:41:12,who would not buy a matching outfit for yourself
00:41:12,00:41:17,"and your cat, whereas a third of 19 to 28 year olds"
00:41:17,00:41:19,would do that.
00:41:19,00:41:20,- Really?
00:41:20,00:41:22,"- Yeah, that's the Instagram generation, isn't it?"
00:41:22,00:41:24,"- Would they be able to get the clothes on the cat, though?"
00:41:24,00:41:25,That's my question.
00:41:25,00:41:27,"- I don't know, it depends on the clothes, doesn't it,"
00:41:27,00:41:30,"as well, if it's a shapeless sort of Bernouce"
00:41:30,00:41:32,"or a Moomoo or something, it might be quite easy."
00:41:32,00:41:33,(laughing)
00:41:33,00:41:38,- I don't know why the two items of clothing
00:41:40,00:41:43,came to my mind were a Bernouce or a Moomoo.
00:41:43,00:41:44,- What are they?
00:41:44,00:41:45,- What is a Bernouce?
00:41:45,00:41:50,- It's a sort of North African desert car business.
00:41:50,00:41:54,Lawrence of Arabia might have got around in a Bernouce.
00:41:54,00:41:56,"- Have you ever seen that show, ""Mr. and Mrs."""
00:41:56,00:41:58,where you write it down and your partner's gonna have
00:41:58,00:41:59,to guess what you said?
00:41:59,00:42:03,"One, two items of clothing as Andy."
00:42:03,00:42:08,"- I'm gonna go for shirts and pats, I'm afraid not."
00:42:08,00:42:09,He went for a Bernouce.
00:42:09,00:42:12,(laughing)
00:42:12,00:42:13,- You must be kicking yourself.
00:42:13,00:42:15,(laughing)
00:42:15,00:42:18,(upbeat music)
00:42:18,00:42:23,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:42:23,00:42:25,and that is James.
00:42:25,00:42:27,"- Okay, my fact this week is that America's"
00:42:27,00:42:32,"newest of the year, 1973, who also invented a contraption"
00:42:32,00:42:35,that allowed him to sunbathe in sub-zero temperatures
00:42:35,00:42:37,was a man called Dick Bacon.
00:42:39,00:42:42,- The name's Bacon.
00:42:42,00:42:43,- Dick Bacon.
00:42:43,00:42:45,- What a guy.
00:42:45,00:42:48,"- Oh, Dick Bacon is an absolute legend."
00:42:48,00:42:52,So I found this in an obituary of Dick Bacon.
00:42:52,00:42:57,"- You always find out about these people too late, right?"
00:42:57,00:42:59,- He spent his life on Lake Michigan sunbathing
00:42:59,00:43:02,and anyone who has been to Lake Michigan
00:43:02,00:43:04,or lives there knows that in the winter
00:43:04,00:43:05,"it gets very, very cold."
00:43:05,00:43:08,But the newspaper said that he set up a series
00:43:08,00:43:12,of reflective shields to protect him from the wind
00:43:12,00:43:14,and inside the temperature would get
00:43:14,00:43:15,high enough for him to tan.
00:43:15,00:43:17,"- Still gonna be pretty cold, though, isn't it?"
00:43:17,00:43:18,"And it was naked, wasn't it?"
00:43:18,00:43:21,- He was actually usually bathed in a small swimsuit
00:43:21,00:43:23,but that was just to keep on the right side of the law
00:43:23,00:43:26,and he definitely preferred to be nude.
00:43:26,00:43:28,He began his nudism when he was 25.
00:43:28,00:43:32,He worked as a live model at the University of Wisconsin
00:43:32,00:43:33,but he didn't want tan lines.
00:43:33,00:43:36,He thought it was unfair on the people drawing him
00:43:36,00:43:38,that they had to draw in the tan lines.
00:43:38,00:43:40,"So he thought, well, I'm just gonna not wear any clothes"
00:43:40,00:43:42,"anymore, that's amazing."
00:43:42,00:43:44,"And he basically just went, okay, how do I make it"
00:43:44,00:43:46,so that every single day I can be out there
00:43:46,00:43:46,all year round?
00:43:46,00:43:48,So he worked in a brewery.
00:43:48,00:43:49,He always took the second and third shifts in there.
00:43:49,00:43:51,So he always had the morning free.
00:43:51,00:43:52,So he was a morning...
00:43:52,00:43:53,- That's interesting.
00:43:53,00:43:56,"- So just every day, go get the sun as it's going up."
00:43:56,00:43:58,He married someone and he had this line
00:43:58,00:43:59,that I just absolutely love.
00:43:59,00:44:02,"He met this girl and she said, ""What's your name?"""
00:44:02,00:44:05,"And he replied, ""Bacon, wanna strip?"""
00:44:05,00:44:07,And that works on two levels.
00:44:07,00:44:09,"- Yeah, I think..."
00:44:09,00:44:10,- Like a strip of bacon.
00:44:10,00:44:12,And strip hasn't taken your clothes off.
00:44:12,00:44:13,- I'm a nudist.
00:44:13,00:44:13,Let's go strip.
00:44:13,00:44:15,"Wow, that's just a wonderful double entendre."
00:44:15,00:44:16,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:16,00:44:17,- It's very strong.
00:44:17,00:44:17,- That is good.
00:44:17,00:44:21,"- In fact, it's better than fancy some porky."
00:44:21,00:44:23,(laughing)
00:44:23,00:44:24,- It's better than that.
00:44:24,00:44:26,- It is better than that.
00:44:26,00:44:28,"He won nudist of the year in 73, like I said,"
00:44:28,00:44:30,but he won that by accident.
00:44:30,00:44:31,(laughing)
00:44:31,00:44:31,"- No, stop."
00:44:31,00:44:32,"- Okay, he did."
00:44:32,00:44:33,- He did too far.
00:44:33,00:44:34,- He did.
00:44:34,00:44:38,- He just so happened to be in this place called Naked City
00:44:38,00:44:39,when the competition was taking place.
00:44:39,00:44:42,He didn't deliberately go there for the competition.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"And he said after his win,"
00:44:44,00:44:45,they interviewed him in the newspapers
00:44:45,00:44:49,and they said that he was aiming to reach his natural color.
00:44:49,00:44:51,Although the Daily Herald where I read this said
00:44:51,00:44:53,that he was already a deep red.
00:44:53,00:44:54,- Yeah.
00:44:54,00:44:55,(laughing)
00:44:55,00:44:56,"- The idea of having a natural color is a bit weird,"
00:44:56,00:44:57,isn't it?
00:44:57,00:44:59,Do we have a natural color?
00:44:59,00:45:00,"- Yeah, good point."
00:45:00,00:45:01,"- 'Cause you turn, it depends"
00:45:01,00:45:02,whether you've been in the sun or not.
00:45:02,00:45:02,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:45:02,00:45:04,"- My natural color is incredibly pale,"
00:45:04,00:45:06,but that's because I haven't been in the sun.
00:45:06,00:45:08,"- Well, you're looking tan today, I would say."
00:45:08,00:45:10,"- Well, I'm trying to sort that out."
00:45:10,00:45:10,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:45:10,00:45:12,- I thought that's why I got this Bernouce with me.
00:45:12,00:45:14,(laughing)
00:45:14,00:45:16,"He was arrested a lot, Mr. Bacon."
00:45:16,00:45:17,"- He was, yeah."
00:45:17,00:45:20,"- For nude bathing and lewd and lascivious behavior,"
00:45:20,00:45:21,but he was a campaigner.
00:45:21,00:45:24,He was saying this isn't harming people.
00:45:24,00:45:26,"This is a natural, healthy,"
00:45:26,00:45:29,almost sporting way of living in harmony with the elements.
00:45:29,00:45:31,I completely backed that.
00:45:31,00:45:32,- And he was in very good shape.
00:45:32,00:45:34,"In fact, I was recently on a nudist beach,"
00:45:34,00:45:37,"a partially nudist beach, not by choice."
00:45:37,00:45:38,"- Partly nudist, that's just a beach."
00:45:38,00:45:39,(laughing)
00:45:39,00:45:41,"You were on a partially nudist beach, not by choice."
00:45:41,00:45:43,The plot is thickening.
00:45:43,00:45:45,"- I was on a beach where a lot of people were nudist,"
00:45:45,00:45:48,"including myself, but there were a lot of nudists."
00:45:48,00:45:50,"And it's completely fine,"
00:45:50,00:45:51,"but they're not all in amazing shape,"
00:45:51,00:45:55,"whereas he was like a gladiator, wasn't he?"
00:45:55,00:45:56,"- Yeah, I guess he would be"
00:45:56,00:45:56,if he won all the awards that he has.
00:45:56,00:45:58,"- Well, he won Mr. Nude America."
00:45:58,00:46:02,"He won Mr. Nude Apollo, Mr. Nude Galaxy."
00:46:02,00:46:04,- Are any of these awards big awards?
00:46:04,00:46:05,- The galaxy?
00:46:05,00:46:07,"Yeah, I think it might be."
00:46:07,00:46:08,- Yeah.
00:46:08,00:46:11,"- You know, if you put fact 50 sun cream on,"
00:46:11,00:46:13,will it stop your skin aging?
00:46:13,00:46:15,"- I guess so, probably."
00:46:15,00:46:17,- Or make it age more slowly?
00:46:17,00:46:19,"Nothing can stop your skin aging, guys."
00:46:19,00:46:23,"- Well, I would have thought that UV rays might age your skin"
00:46:23,00:46:25,and so the lotion might stop that.
00:46:25,00:46:26,"- Yeah, you're more leathery, right?"
00:46:26,00:46:31,"- They absolutely do age your skin, but only UVA waves."
00:46:31,00:46:34,So what they don't tell you on the sun creams
00:46:34,00:46:35,"is that when they say the factor,"
00:46:35,00:46:38,UV rays are split into UVA and UVB
00:46:38,00:46:40,and it's basically about the wavelengths.
00:46:40,00:46:43,So UVB have shorter wavelengths
00:46:43,00:46:44,and they're the ones that cause sunburn
00:46:44,00:46:46,and they're the most carcinogenic.
00:46:46,00:46:48,"So when you've got factor X sun cream,"
00:46:48,00:46:52,"it's just blocking the UVB rays or sorry, reducing them,"
00:46:52,00:46:53,but it doesn't refer to UVA
00:46:53,00:46:55,and they're the ones that cause skin aging.
00:46:55,00:46:56,They're the ones that go deeper
00:46:56,00:46:59,and make you wrinkly and crusty.
00:46:59,00:47:01,So you need to look at the star rating as well.
00:47:01,00:47:04,"If you want to not go wrinking, crusty."
00:47:04,00:47:07,- I've never seen a star rating on my sun cream.
00:47:07,00:47:08,- They often don't have them.
00:47:08,00:47:09,- Do they not?
00:47:09,00:47:10,"- If they don't have a star rating,"
00:47:10,00:47:12,does that mean they don't protect against the UVA?
00:47:12,00:47:15,"- I think I believe it does, yeah, careful."
00:47:15,00:47:18,"- Okay, can I run a tanning practice past you guys?"
00:47:18,00:47:19,"- Yes, please."
00:47:19,00:47:24,- Have any of you heard of or you two done testicle tanning?
00:47:24,00:47:27,"- Jesus Christ, was it last week or the week before"
00:47:27,00:47:29,when you were talking about perineal tanning?
00:47:29,00:47:31,"- Yeah, testicle tanning is completely different."
00:47:31,00:47:32,- Of course.
00:47:32,00:47:34,"- This is actually, it's not sunlight."
00:47:34,00:47:36,You don't have to go down to the beach and bury yourself.
00:47:36,00:47:39,"- I always, I do do that, but I always iron mine first."
00:47:39,00:47:41,(laughing)
00:47:41,00:47:45,It does take one of those 40 kilogram irons to get them flat.
00:47:45,00:47:47,(laughing)
00:47:47,00:47:51,"- This is actually, it's not even a real tanning."
00:47:51,00:47:54,It's a very dubious medical thing.
00:47:54,00:47:57,It's just blasting red light at your knackers
00:47:57,00:48:00,and claiming that it'll improve your testosterone
00:48:00,00:48:03,and a load of male energy and hormones and stuff.
00:48:03,00:48:04,"- Is that, and people are doing this,"
00:48:04,00:48:06,"are they, in their bucket loads?"
00:48:06,00:48:08,"- Not, thankfully, I don't think it's very popular,"
00:48:08,00:48:11,but it is the kind of thing that a lot of dubious Americans
00:48:11,00:48:14,have basically glommed onto and started saying is a good idea.
00:48:14,00:48:14,And it's not done.
00:48:14,00:48:16,"- Well, unless you want to save the poor life drawing class,"
00:48:16,00:48:19,"which apparently was Dick Bacon's motivation,"
00:48:19,00:48:21,you can't draw two shades of skin color.
00:48:21,00:48:24,(laughing)
00:48:24,00:48:27,"Well, this is very similar to perineum tanning."
00:48:27,00:48:29,- Which we did talk about a couple of weeks ago.
00:48:29,00:48:31,"- Right under the podcast, very scientifically."
00:48:31,00:48:32,"- Yeah, but I wasn't there."
00:48:32,00:48:34,And so I insist on revisiting it.
00:48:34,00:48:37,And there was something I found interesting about this
00:48:37,00:48:40,'cause it's mostly obviously just a TikTok nonsense thing
00:48:40,00:48:42,where there's like one person who says it's a really good
00:48:42,00:48:44,thing to expose your bum hole to the sun.
00:48:44,00:48:46,"And after 30 seconds, you get the same benefits"
00:48:46,00:48:49,that you get exposing your body for a day and it's nonsense.
00:48:49,00:48:53,"And there is Josh Brolin, the actor, put a thing up saying--"
00:48:53,00:48:55,- So he's Thanos and Avengers.
00:48:55,00:48:57,"And yeah, no country for old men."
00:48:57,00:48:59,He's in that if you want to picture his face.
00:48:59,00:49:01,"- Yes, and he put a thing up that--"
00:49:01,00:49:03,"- That is the part of who I want to picture,"
00:49:03,00:49:04,I must have been in this fact.
00:49:04,00:49:06,(laughing)
00:49:06,00:49:07,"- Thanos, more likely."
00:49:07,00:49:09,(laughing)
00:49:09,00:49:13,"- He said, ""Don't try this on your Thanos"
00:49:13,00:49:17,"because I did it and my pocket hole is crazily burnt."""
00:49:17,00:49:19,"I mean, he obviously didn't, he's taking the piss."
00:49:19,00:49:21,I assume he's not an insane person.
00:49:21,00:49:23,"But what I quite like is that, you know,"
00:49:23,00:49:26,conspiracy theories always come from a kernel of truth.
00:49:26,00:49:27,"And the woman who started this said,"
00:49:27,00:49:29,"""It's an ancient Taoist practice"
00:49:29,00:49:31,"to bathe your bum hole in the sun."""
00:49:31,00:49:36,"And actually, it does come from this idea in Taoism."
00:49:36,00:49:40,"So Taoism is like ancient Chinese philosophy, basically."
00:49:40,00:49:43,And the Hui Yin is the collection point
00:49:43,00:49:45,of all Yin energy in your body.
00:49:45,00:49:47,And that is your perineum.
00:49:47,00:49:49,"So all of Yin, you know, you got Yin and Yang,"
00:49:49,00:49:52,the two opposing forces that work together.
00:49:52,00:49:54,Yin is all gathered in your perineum.
00:49:54,00:49:56,And they do believe that it's good to bathe
00:49:56,00:49:59,in sunlight and moonlight for wellness.
00:49:59,00:50:03,"And so, you know, there's a kernel of truth in this bullocks."
00:50:03,00:50:04,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:50:04,00:50:08,"Brazil, home of great tanning culture."
00:50:08,00:50:09,- Yeah.
00:50:09,00:50:12,- Do you know what the fashionable bikini is
00:50:12,00:50:14,to wear in Brazil at the moment?
00:50:14,00:50:17,"- Is it like a full body, like a bikini,"
00:50:17,00:50:18,"but it's very, very stiff."
00:50:18,00:50:20,So your arms go out like Christ the Redeemer.
00:50:20,00:50:21,"- Oh, wow. - That's true."
00:50:21,00:50:23,- It's a stanched banoosophagus.
00:50:23,00:50:25,(both laughing)
00:50:25,00:50:26,- Is it?
00:50:26,00:50:27,"- Well, okay."
00:50:27,00:50:27,Like Brazilian.
00:50:27,00:50:28,- Yeah.
00:50:28,00:50:30,"- You would think, okay, very thongy."
00:50:30,00:50:31,- It's very thongy.
00:50:31,00:50:33,"- Oh, is it that borat one?"
00:50:33,00:50:34,Is it that big? - It's not the mankini.
00:50:34,00:50:35,- Not the mankini.
00:50:35,00:50:36,- What's it made of?
00:50:36,00:50:37,What fabric is it made of?
00:50:37,00:50:38,- Cashmere.
00:50:38,00:50:39,- No.
00:50:39,00:50:40,(both laughing)
00:50:40,00:50:41,- I love it.
00:50:41,00:50:42,- I love it.
00:50:42,00:50:44,(both laughing)
00:50:44,00:50:45,- I know.
00:50:45,00:50:46,Spider silk.
00:50:46,00:50:49,- Just one piece of spider silk up the crack.
00:50:49,00:50:50,(both laughing)
00:50:50,00:50:53,"- Oh, you already feel that."
00:50:53,00:50:54,The aim of it is to give you
00:50:54,00:50:57,incredibly crisp turn lines.
00:50:57,00:50:59,- So something that blocks all of the--
00:50:59,00:51:00,- It blocks really effectively.
00:51:00,00:51:03,- So like a lead or a hazmat suit.
00:51:03,00:51:04,- I'm gonna tell you.
00:51:04,00:51:04,I'm gonna tell you.
00:51:04,00:51:05,- Yeah.
00:51:05,00:51:06,- It's electrical tape.
00:51:06,00:51:08,- Do you give yourself a Brazilian when you take it off?
00:51:08,00:51:11,"- Well, what you need is this thing,"
00:51:11,00:51:13,"the Marquina De Fita, the little tape mark,"
00:51:13,00:51:14,"and you go to a salon,"
00:51:14,00:51:18,"they will put literally tape a bikini onto you,"
00:51:18,00:51:19,and they'll give you a little bit of fabric
00:51:19,00:51:20,for your nips and stuff like that.
00:51:20,00:51:22,"- Of course, 'cause I was thinking like,"
00:51:22,00:51:23,lead is the same as the swimming costume.
00:51:23,00:51:25,"They all block it, but what you need is for your body"
00:51:25,00:51:27,not to be able to shift underneath it at all.
00:51:27,00:51:28,Is that right?
00:51:28,00:51:30,"- Exactly, so it's just that one bit of skin"
00:51:30,00:51:31,that is covered with the fabric.
00:51:31,00:51:32,- So you could super glue your swimming costume
00:51:32,00:51:33,to yourself as well.
00:51:33,00:51:36,"- Well, look, there are all sorts of roads to the answer."
00:51:36,00:51:37,"Yes, but this is--"
00:51:37,00:51:38,- But this is the biggie?
00:51:38,00:51:39,- There are salons where you just go
00:51:39,00:51:41,and people go up to the roof.
00:51:41,00:51:42,"You pay about eight quid,"
00:51:42,00:51:43,which includes a breakfast buffet.
00:51:43,00:51:44,- What?
00:51:44,00:51:46,- I would do this.
00:51:46,00:51:46,- Eight quid?
00:51:46,00:51:49,"- I know how cheap that is, travel lunch."
00:51:49,00:51:50,- You're not gonna be--
00:51:50,00:51:52,- And they don't do anything to your nips.
00:51:52,00:51:53,- You're not gonna be beach body ready
00:51:53,00:51:55,after a full English.
00:51:55,00:51:58,(laughing)
00:51:58,00:51:59,"- Yeah, and then people lie there"
00:51:59,00:52:00,and they spray you with water every now and again
00:52:00,00:52:02,and that's how you get those incredibly crisp lines.
00:52:02,00:52:03,"- Hey, sugar nips."
00:52:03,00:52:06,"- Thank you, yes, sweetie possum, yes, go on."
00:52:06,00:52:07,Do you know what sugar nips are?
00:52:07,00:52:09,I read this today and I'd never heard it before.
00:52:09,00:52:11,"- No, I thought it was just something,"
00:52:11,00:52:12,how you used it just then.
00:52:12,00:52:14,"- Me too, right?"
00:52:14,00:52:16,So sugar nips were like a little pair of scissors
00:52:16,00:52:18,you would use.
00:52:18,00:52:20,And if you had a block of sugar in your house
00:52:20,00:52:21,"or sugar loaf, they would call it."
00:52:21,00:52:23,"In fact, sugar loaf mountain just outside Rio,"
00:52:23,00:52:26,but you would have a sugar loaf on your table
00:52:26,00:52:27,and you would use your sugar nips
00:52:27,00:52:29,to nip off a little bit of sugar.
00:52:29,00:52:30,- That's incredible.
00:52:30,00:52:31,- Wow.
00:52:31,00:52:32,"- Yeah, I'd never heard that before."
00:52:32,00:52:34,"- That is a kind, that's 'cause you guys know"
00:52:34,00:52:36,"I like a rare bit of croqueries, cutlery."
