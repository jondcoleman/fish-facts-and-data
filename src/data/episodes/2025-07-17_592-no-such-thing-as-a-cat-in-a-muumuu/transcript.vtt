00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.560
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.240
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.960
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.200
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.240
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.440
 with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.640
 and James Harkin.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.840
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.920
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.640
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.240
 - My fact this week is that ironing in Egypt

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.000
 is traditionally a man's job, and they do it with their feet.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 - Yeah.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.660
 (laughing)

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.360
 - And that's why we shouldn't let men do the ironing.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.880
 (laughing)

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.360
 - Do they put the shirt on the ground,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.280
 or do they put their foot on the board?

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.120
 - Yeah, good question.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.040
 - And also, do they use an iron,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.960
 or do they have really, really flat feet?

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.920
 - Hot, hot feet.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.360
 Well, it's in the desert, right?

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.840
 You just stand them the sand for 10 minutes

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.000
 until your feet get warm.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 - That's it.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.240
 No, they use an iron, a normal iron,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.400
 so these are people called the makwagi,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.400
 and the makwagi regal are specifically the foot ironers.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.600
 Makwami's iron, and it's been going on for hundreds of years,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.240
 and on every street corner, you'd have a man

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660
 who does your ironing, you take your ironing to him.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.200
 It's passed down from fathers to sons,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.920
 and traditionally it was done with feet,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.240
 so you'd have a big, heavy iron.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.560
 I read one reputable source saying

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.320
 that the irons can weigh 40 kilos.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.880
 - What, 40 kilos?

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.200
 - I know, it doesn't seem plausible, does it?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.920
 - Do they lift it with their feet?

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.560
 - Well, they just push it. - They just push it,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.240
 and they look like a classic old iron,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.920
 so they're just an iron that's heated over coals,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.080
 or in a stove, right, like a big metal iron.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.000
 They're not plugged in.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.840
 - Not plugged in.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.680
 You kind of got that little water button

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.320
 that you press or the steaming up there.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.640
 - Dan's trying to pretend that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.920
 ironing is a man's job in his household as well.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 - I think, I could confidently say,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.840
 we all know I iron non-star.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.920
 - Dan is an obsessive, Dan and Andy, actually,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.640
 I feel like you spend half your life ironing,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.760
 it's quite sad, but it's not sad when these guys do it.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.640
 - I'm sorry, can I just say

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.520
 that I don't just let my wife do all my ironing,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.040
 I just like to be creased.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.400
 - In answer to your question about the spray,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.840
 this is one of the coolest things,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.320
 and I was going back to old 19th century sources

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.840
 when people visited Egypt and reported on it happening there,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.360
 to spritz the garments, so they're a bit wet.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.120
 They spit, and so now these days, I think--

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.400
 - Terrific, all right, does that cost extra?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.960
 - There are accounts of the real pros,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.680
 the real traditional ones, having just a continuous spray

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.480
 constantly coming from their lips.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.520
 - But if you were walking the streets,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.520
 looking for someone to do your ironing,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.120
 and presumably there might be a bunch of competition,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.160
 what you wanna see is just one old guy dribbling like crazy,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.600
 and that's the one you go for, right?

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.840
 That's the best version.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.120
 - How did this industry fair during COVID?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.360
 (laughing)

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.200
 - That's a really good question,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.160
 and I forgot to investigate.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.080
 - Actually, people used to spit on their irons

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.120
 in the UK as well.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.960
 - Really?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.280
 - Yeah, yeah, so we're talking from the 17th century onwards,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.760
 we had something called sad irons,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.680
 and sad meant solid in those days.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.160
 So there were solid irons, and they're kind of pretty much,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.640
 you know, like when you play Monopoly and you're the iron,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.960
 it's that kind of thing.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.160
 So again, it's just like a piece of metal.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.880
 You put it in the fire until it's hot enough,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.960
 and then you would use it to iron things,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.120
 and to find out when it was hot enough,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.320
 you would spit on it.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.440
 And if the spit sort of laid and frosted around

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.800
 and spat around on the iron,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.320
 then you knew it was ready to go.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.160
 - Interesting.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.360
 - But you don't want it too hot, presumably,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360
 'cause then you burn your clothes.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.480
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.880
 - As well as the sad iron things,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.240
 there were slug irons, which I like as well,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.440
 where you have a slug of metal,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.880
 literally, I just didn't like an ingot of metal,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.280
 that you put in the fire for ages,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.000
 and you draw it out of the fire and shove it in the iron,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.640
 and that makes it hot.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.480
 - Nice.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.400
 - There were rough irons.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.280
 So they're called a goffering iron,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.520
 where you could iron fabrics into a scalloped edge.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.480
 So you know all those amazing Elizabethan ruffs?

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.320
 - Yes.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.160
 - They had to be ironed into place, basically.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.440
 - I do your first level ironing,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.360
 which is I just want things flat and uncreased,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.600
 but there is an art to ironing,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.000
 where you do put in these ruffles.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.680
 You do put in the line on your trousers.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.960
 I aspire to be there.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.720
 You'll put a crease to the shirt sleeve though.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.560
 - Yeah, you might do.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.400
 - You gotta have a crease on the shirt sleeve.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.240
 - You gotta have a crease.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.360
 But here's the thing, back in the day,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.960
 ironing wasn't just for getting your clothes

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.840
 to be uncreased, it was for cleaning as well.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.640
 So there's reports of, let's say during the Crimean War,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.760
 there's a report there where cannibals might be heated

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.440
 and used as a makeshift iron.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.280
 And it wasn't so that people went,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.800
 you know, I want to look uncreased

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.120
 when I'm going into battle.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.920
 It was because you would have things like lice

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.240
 living on your clothes that you want to get rid of.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.920
 So it was burning it off, basically.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.040
 So it was doing a double job.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.800
 - It's very hard though to aim it correctly

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.840
 for an ironing job.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.440
 So it just gets the ironing right.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.600
 It's a difficult method.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.280
 Can I ask Dan as the only other ironer in the room?

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.160
 I suspect, another question about this.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.840
 What was your opinion on wrinkle-free shirts?

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.960
 Sorry, James, I mean, James is wearing a collared shirt now

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.960
 and it looks actually very nice.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.760
 - No, no, I've never really ironed any item of clothing

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.400
 since I left a proper job about 25 years ago.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.440
 - Fair enough, fair enough.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.400
 And I live in a hope of getting a proper job.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.520
 So I'm constantly heading to interviews,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.800
 so I do mean those shirts.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.640
 (all laughing)

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.280
 So what was the question again?

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.520
 - Would you wear a wrinkle-free shirt,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.040
 like a non-iron shirt?

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.920
 'Cause a lot of shirts sold these days are non-iron.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.160
 - I definitely wore those when I was at university, for sure.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.760
 It was the one thing, if I went to a men's wear shop,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.040
 I would look to see if it would need an iron or not.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.880
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.920
 - Why would you? - And the clip on tie as well.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.840
 Don't talk to angry colleagues strangling you,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.680
 that's very helpful.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.720
 - I was talking about at university

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.640
 whether we went clubbing,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.840
 we didn't always wear ties.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.680
 - How were you letting in?

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.520
 - Ridiculous.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.440
 (all laughing)

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.000
 We borrow one from the bounce scene,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.320
 he's going over to his jacket,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.320
 he's got a big rack of ties in there,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.520
 and he picks one that goes with your complexion and shirt.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.840
 - Yeah, okay.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.640
 - So wrink non-iron shirts are made with formaldehyde,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.120
 or they certainly used to be,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.080
 they've been treated with the special chemical,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.760
 which means that they don't crease, which is very clever.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.520
 - But they make you need to do a poo, right?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.160
 We've talked before about how formaldehyde

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.200
 makes you need to poo, that is true.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.280
 I think the good thing is that the formaldehyde

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.760
 is locked into the shirt,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.320
 so actually it doesn't do you any harm as the wearer,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.840
 but the people who made it,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.960
 people who worked in the non-iron shirt factories,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.280
 they all go quite sick, I think.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.600
 - Right, really?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.240
 - I think there's a higher proportion of cancer

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.720
 in people who work in those factories

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.840
 than in the general population.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.040
 - Well, they don't sound like good residents

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.880
 that get used to them.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.800
 I don't know whether they've ironed out these problems yet,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.640
 but from what you're saying,

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.800
 it sounds like that might still be a thing.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.680
 - The study with this of the incidence of cancer was 20 or nine.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.800
 - Okay, okay, okay.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.240
 - But yeah, ironing basically, okay,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.480
 so let's say you've got a cotton shirt,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.600
 it's made up of loads of fibres, chains of cellulose,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.840
 and when you put it in the washing machine,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.880
 the cellulose goes a bit wonky,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.640
 and it comes out and it's all creased,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.720
 and the ironing works by loosening these cellulose threads,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.800
 and when they're loose, when they're nice and--

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800
 - It's warm and relaxed.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.240
 - It's warm and relaxed, then they can get into a line,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.480
 you press them down and they'll stay in that line.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.320
 That's how it works.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.160
 - Interesting.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.400
 - But the non-iron ones,

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.560
 the formaldehyde basically locks those cellulode fibres

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.720
 in place.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.400
 - When you join the army, if you go to Sandhurst,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.320
 which is a very, very posh British army--

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.040
 - Sprint's Harry's Place was an academy.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.360
 - Yeah, probably went to Sandhurst.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.600
 - You have to carry in your own ironing board.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.440
 - Really?

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.320
 - Yeah, and I asked a friend of mine who went to Sandhurst,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.160
 and he said, "Yes, you do."

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.000
 - Do you? - Of course you do.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.280
 - Of course you do, you don't bring your ironing board.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.040
 - Could you not share an ironing board between a barrack?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.400
 - There's simply so much ironing to do with.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.040
 You've got so many different kinds of uniform

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.000
 as a modern, heroic, action-man type.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.840
 - Okay, yeah.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.600
 - And because they don't have so many cannonballs

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.760
 in warfare these days.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.600
 (all laughing)

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.600
 - You can't just wait for it to happen naturally.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.000
 - I was very hard with a cruise missile

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.760
 to get a really crisp line on that track.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.760
 - I wonder if they're bulletproof

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.280
 or if the fabric is Kevlar,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.000
 because that is a fantastic defense shield

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.280
 that you could double up an ironing board with.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.160
 - Yeah, it's basically human size, isn't it?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.800
 - It is, that's a human-sized shield.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.640
 - You're suggesting people wear their ironing boards

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.480
 into battle.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.560
 - Are we not talking about the front lines here?

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.160
 We're just talking about back at the barracks.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.520
 - You don't do that. (all laughing)

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.440
 - Here's a really British thing that I'd never heard of

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.960
 before that used to happen in the past with ironing.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.800
 Some homes, and we still know a few examples of these homes,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.600
 had a room for ironing newspapers.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.440
 - Fantastic.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.040
 - That's the dream, that is the dream.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.400
 - Yeah, I read about this in Bill Bryson's book at home,

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.240
 and it was featured, I think, in Downton Abbey,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.200
 but the idea was before the master of the house

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.880
 would be given the newspapers,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.760
 the butler would take it into the ironing room,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.560
 and they would iron the newspapers, not for creases,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.400
 but to make sure that the ink becomes dry

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.640
 and solid into the newspaper

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.920
 so they can wear their white gloves

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.560
 as they're leafing through the newspaper

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.440
 and not worry about ink smudging on them.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.720
 - I didn't know that was why it was.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.360
 I think I honestly always thought it was to make

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.520
 the newspapers nice and flat for the posh people.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.280
 - We should say ironing's at risk.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.120
 - What? - Sorry?

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.600
 - Ironing's at risk, big risk.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.440
 - Right, what?

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.280
 - From the youth.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.120
 - Oh yeah.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.960
 - Yeah.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.200
 - 30% of 18 to 34 year olds,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.480
 many of whom may be listening,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.720
 don't own an iron and never do any ironing.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.920
 - What do they do instead?

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.760
 - I don't know.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.000
 - They do, like me, just be wrinkled.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.080
 - I think so, yeah.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.000
 And they will claim things like they're closed,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.840
 don't need ironing.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.960
 - They don't, our mind don't, and James' don't.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.280
 - Honestly, I would always wear mine flat.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.840
 So what I would do is I would wash my shirt,

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.720
 and then just before it was dry,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.400
 then I would start wearing it,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.200
 and my natural body shape would flatten the shirt.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.520
 - I mean, it's clever.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.480
 - You want it to have that shape of your body.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.000
 You do, I mean, that's the point, isn't it?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.240
 If you iron it to a non-realistic standard

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.800
 of a completely flat person,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.080
 which is not what any of us are.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.120
 - Of course it's gonna crease.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.520
 - My whole body is actually creased.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.480
 When I'm naked, I have these terrible creases all over.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.560
 - That's a good idea.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.000
 Although a better version would be to put it on someone

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.680
 whose body you aspire to look like,

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.680
 so that when you get it back,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.640
 you can feel what you want to eventually not break it.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.760
 - And your body can iron itself into the shirt.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.600
 - Exactly.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.840
 - Yeah.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.520
 - Speaking of nightclubs, as I was,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.440
 I am in boards are good for DJs.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.440
 Let's say you're an aspiring DJ.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.760
 You're going to a house party.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.120
 You've got your decks,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.600
 but you don't really wanna bring a big old sort of,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.680
 like all the stand.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.760
 - I'm a hog on your table.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.320
 - So what do you need?

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.400
 - You need something that's flat,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.680
 but also you need it to be a very certain height.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.520
 - Yeah.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.520
 - You don't want the decks to be up at your eye level,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.520
 or at your knee level,

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.600
 but the good thing about ironing boards is they're adjustable.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.440
 - Yes.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.280
 - There you go.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.120
 - That's so cool.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.520
 - So you look at interviews with DJs and they say,

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.360
 oh yeah, my first ever DJ gig was on an ironing board.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.200
 - That's so funny.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.040
 And if you pop some, pop a pair of pants under the decks,

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.040
 by the time your set's finished,

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.240
 they'll be lovely and crisp.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.880
 That's your journey home.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.160
 - It's actually probably the heat of the decks.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.000
 - Might do it.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.840
 - Yeah.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.680
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.520
 - Yeah.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.360
 - Do you think in the future,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.400
 they'll be looking at these ironing boards and saying,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.560
 did you know these used to be used for ironing?

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.400
 (laughing)

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.240
 - Before they became--

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.240
 - With everyone's a DJ.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.560
 - On the DJ boards, yeah.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.240
 - There is actually a guy called DJ Ironing Board,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.520
 who built his rig that fits perfectly

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.240
 on a normal ironing board and he does festivals and stuff.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.080
 - That's awesome.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.080
 - Oh, wow.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.440
 But I mean, you've got to be careful.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.480
 And that's so many times when I'm mid iron,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.040
 you hit the little handle underneath

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.920
 that sends the entire thing down.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.400
 You don't want that.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.240
 - How do you do that?

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.560
 I've never had that experience.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.720
 - Happens to be nonstop.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.560
 - I've never done it.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.400
 - No one else?

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.240
 - No.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.040
 - Can I give you another use for an ironing board?

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.880
 - Yeah.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.440
 - If you want to be Pope.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.440
 - Okay.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.280
 - Quite neat.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.480
 - Well, for instance, the most recent guy who was Pope

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.200
 was Robert Provost, Pope Leo XIV.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.560
 And as a child, he played it being a priest

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.360
 by using the family's ironing board as an altar,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.840
 according to his brother.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.600
 So he would get the ironing board up.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.200
 He would get a load of biscuits

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.520
 and then put them there.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.160
 And his family would come round

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.040
 and he would give them a Kit Kat and say,

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.000
 "Buddy of Christ."

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.840
 - Really?

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.680
 - Oh my God.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.520
 - Are you serious?

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.360
 - Absolutely.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.400
 - And again, you can alter the altar as you're growing up.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.240
 - Alter the altar.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.800
 - So it's all good.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.040
 - I mean, they must have thought he was on,

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.040
 that was a pretty long shot

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.720
 when he was a kid doing the Kit Kat thing.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.560
 But that's incredible.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.320
 Like, they're laughing on the other side of their face now.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.800
 - He works in mysterious ways.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.080
 - This is good news for the world of ironing

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.240
 because actually the last Pope, Francis,

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.680
 actively announced that ironing needed to stop

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.000
 and so did in homes.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.280
 So there was a question about all these Italian kids

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.280
 that weren't leaving home and what do I do

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.560
 to get my son a job and get him out of the house?

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.240
 And the Pope said, "Stop ironing for him."

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.080
 And that was like-

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.920
 - Like mums overlooked.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.920
 - Exactly.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.840
 Why would he leave home?

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.960
 He's got his stuff being ironed every day by you.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.200
 You're mollycolling him.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.920
 - And an interesting thing to focus on as Pope,

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.400
 but you know, they're focused on worse, I suppose.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.120
 - It turns out they're all obsessed.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.160
 - Another great world leader

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.320
 who did a spot of ironing in her day, Margaret Thatcher.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.160
 - Really?

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.000
 - Even after she was an MP,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.560
 she would iron her husband, Dennis's shirts, in parliament.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.400
 - In what?

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.800
 - Not on the floor of the House of Commons.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.640
 - Okay.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.480
 - Just on the dispatch board.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.160
 - There is a desk there, actually, isn't there?

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.000
 - Yeah.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.840
 - I think it's wooden.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.880
 I think that would be very bad for it.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.800
 - Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.360
 No, there was a ladies' room.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.040
 And this was a time when there were fewer female MPs

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.880
 than there are now.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.440
 There was a need for women to have their own space in parliament.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.680
 And it had an ironing board in it,

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.160
 and she frankly monopolised that iron.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.720
 - Well, she was a fan of monopolies.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.560
 - Yeah.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.680
 - Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.360
 That's the best batch of ironing monopolies

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.000
 track you'll hear on any podcast this week.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.840
 - This week.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.040
 - But if he listens to "Off Lady" next week...

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.400
 - They come up these days.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.660
 (upbeat music)

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:56.360
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.640
 and that is Andy.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.200
 - My fact is that 900 years ago,

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.200
 England beat Scotland in a battle

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.720
 with an earth horn super weapon,

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.880
 which scattered the Scots by frightening their cows.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.120
 Lot to unpack.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.960
 - Yeah.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.400
 - What's an earth horn?

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.240
 - Glad you asked.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.160
 It's not a common thing anymore.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.360
 This was word of the day

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.240
 on the OED website the other day.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.960
 - Highly recommended, you know.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.800
 If you're listening to this,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.520
 just go over to the Oxford English Dictionary website

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.040
 and see what the word of the day is.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.400
 And this is earth horn.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.360
 I think this was the first and maybe last time it was used.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.800
 - Yes, it's a hapax legomenon.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.640
 - Yeah.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.680
 - As in there's only one mention of it

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.920
 in the whole of literature.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.840
 - The whole of literature, yeah.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.960
 So it didn't take off basically this earth horn,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.160
 like secret weapon, whatever it was.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.320
 Seems to have been a big horn.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.280
 - Despite working apparently.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.760
 - Yeah, you're right.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.600
 - You're absolutely right.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.880
 - The other thing to say as well

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.240
 is it was only mentioned once and that was in 1338.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.560
 And it referred to a battle that happened in 1138.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.400
 - Okay.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.220
 - Yes, so.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.400
 - It's like the 200th anniversary of this battle.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.480
 - Finally, we're gonna uncover this secret weapon

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.320
 that we used.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.000
 No one's mentioned it before now.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.480
 - And again, it's not completely clear from the OED source

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.480
 why frightening the cows was a key factor

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.680
 in the end of the battle.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.720
 - Okay.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.880
 Well, give us everything we know about it then

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.720
 from the description.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.560
 - Definitely huge amount of it.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.400
 - That's it.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.240
 - It's a thing called the Derethorn.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.360
 - We don't know anything about the earth horn, definitely.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.520
 - We don't know if it was a sound.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.800
 I mean, horn implies it.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.240
 - And what do we know why earth?

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.480
 Is it made of earth?

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.680
 Is it comes from the earth?

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.960
 - I can't stress enough, this was 900 years ago.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.160
 As James says, first recorded 200 years later

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.480
 for the first and last time.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.440
 We really don't know much about it.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.320
 This is my challenge fact for the week.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.040
 - As I said, it happened in 1138.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.600
 So what was going on?

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.520
 - What was going on was a thousand years of conflict

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.880
 between England and Scotland on and off.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.000
 But quite a lot of on.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.400
 So what I found was the earliest battle recorded

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.480
 between Angles and the Scots slash Picts,

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.200
 that was in 596 AD.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.040
 - Wow.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.200
 - And the last battle between England and Scotland

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.360
 as completely independent kingdoms was, when was it?

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.200
 That was 1547, correct?

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.760
 - This particular one that we're talking about,

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.320
 the Battle of North Allerton,

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.520
 also known as the Battle of the Standards.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.520
 This was that time when Henry had died Matilda

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.160
 was maybe going to be our queen.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.680
 Stephen was maybe going to be the king.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.200
 There was a whole load of conflict

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.720
 about who was going to take over.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.760
 And the Scots were on the side of Matilda.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.680
 And a lot of the Barons in England

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.080
 were on the side of Stephen.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.440
 And so there was a big old battle

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.240
 because the Scots wanted to help out

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.320
 because Matilda was the daughter of a Scottish kick.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.360
 - I read that this battle took place on Calton Moor.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.200
 - Jesus.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.040
 - Is that interesting?

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.240
 - That is interesting.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.080
 - Moor.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.920
 - Do you want to say that again?

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.880
 - Calton Moor.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.840
 - You didn't want to stress the cow part.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.160
 - Well, that was obvious.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.400
 The Moor was going to be a bit more difficult.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.240
 - Yeah.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.080
 - No, I think that's really good, Dan.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.920
 - Yeah, that's very good.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.720
 - Give them lots of cows at the end of the battle.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.960
 - We talked about this when David Mitchell

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.800
 was on the podcast.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.960
 - This era we did, yeah.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.120
 - If you've got your English history,

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.200
 Kings and Queens ruler,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.480
 it's the bit that goes Willy, Willy, Harry, Steve.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.600
 It's the Steve bit, of course, King Stephen.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.200
 - And if you've got the ruler that goes all the way forward

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.320
 and just to emphasise how much the Scots in English

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.360
 didn't like each other back then,

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.600
 and obviously it's all water on the bridge now,

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.960
 but between 1040 and 1745,

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.600
 33 out of the 36 English monarchs

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.520
 either invaded or were invaded by Scotland,

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.840
 which is strong.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.040
 It's a strong record, isn't it?

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.760
 - So it's a long old skirmish.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.600
 - I know.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.800
 - Although it could have all been avoided,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.360
 or the worst bits could have been avoided,

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.120
 if it weren't for just a small diplomatic cock-up.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.360
 So the worst phase,

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.520
 and with all the famous battles,

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.760
 like your Bannock Burns and your Mel Gibson's,

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.760
 was 13th and 14th centuries,

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.680
 and that was the Wars of Independence.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.240
 And it all kicked off when Alexander III of Scotland dies

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.040
 in early 1290s.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.160
 And there were these two guys,

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.480
 John Balliol and Robert Bruce,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.160
 who was the grandfather of the famous Robert Bruce.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.960
 - Sorry, it was one Robert the Bruce,

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.680
 and the other one was just Robert Bruce.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.800
 - Yeah, that was his middle name.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.480
 - Yeah, you sometimes got to slip that in there

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.640
 to differentiate.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.720
 - So no, there was a guy called John Balliol,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.280
 there was a guy called Robert Bruce.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.720
 Robert Bruce's grandson was also called Robert Bruce.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.800
 He's the famous one,

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.400
 who for bad reasons we now call Robert the Bruce.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.960
 I think related to the fact that he was Robert the Bruce.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.440
 - He's brave heart for anyone who knows that movie.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.320
 This is Mel Gibson's granddad, Robert Bruce.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.160
 - Exactly.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.400
 They couldn't decide who was gonna be king.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.400
 So they asked Edward I of England,

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.040
 as their neighbor and friend,

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.080
 as an impartial observer,

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.320
 to say which one of us should be king.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.160
 - Man, that's it, right.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.000
 - Edward I thought, great, here's my chance.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.480
 And he said, okay, I'll do that.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.880
 But first of all, I need to have legal authority

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.280
 over Scotland to have this kind of authority

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.040
 to decide who's king.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.680
 And so little legal loophole,

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.760
 he gave himself authority over all of Scotland.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.320
 And then the rest is history.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.120
 He just started getting in the way all the time.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.720
 And what a cock up.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.720
 - Yeah, Berwick upon Tweed is the,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.920
 now, if you're heading north from England to Scotland,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.240
 it's pretty much the last English town you pass through.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.140
 - If you're heading on the east coast.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.920
 - If you're heading on the east coast, absolutely.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.000
 - Sorry, a big fan of the west coast mainline over here.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.480
 - I love the west coast mainline.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.760
 But for international listeners, let us simplify.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.400
 Just saying it's the last term before Scotland.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.240
 So Berwick upon Tweed, very, very northern English town.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.520
 It has changed hands 13 times over the last thousand years.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.880
 I mean, mostly like centuries ago.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.320
 And all the times it changed hands,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.960
 it wasn't just being captured in battles.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.620
 So in 1174, Scotland gave it to England

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.780
 because William I had been captured.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.300
 And that was part of the ransom is like,

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.580
 we want Berwick upon Tweed.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.980
 Then 20 years later, Scotland bought it back

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.300
 'cause King Richard needed money for a crusade.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.780
 They're like, what can I flog off?

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.020
 Oh, so Berwick upon Tweed, the Scots love that.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:51.860
 (laughing)

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.300
 For about 200 years, once every 15 years, it changed hands.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.620
 - Do you think the people in Berwick upon Tweed

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.300
 going about their lives, do you think they ever knew?

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.620
 - They just say they're from Berwick.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.420
 A lot of people there just say I'm a Berwicker, you know.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.360
 There's a guy called Derek Sharman,

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.320
 who's a local historian who says this a lot.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.260
 - Derek from Berwick?

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.300
 - Derek from Berwick upon Tweed.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:14.380
 - He says that basically they're all just Berricas.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.700
 And actually, if you're from north of the river

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.340
 and south of the river, that's kind of a distinguishable

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.460
 sort of almost nationality as well.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.900
 - I was it, that's where the next big civil war

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.460
 is happening, isn't it?

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.180
 Edward I, who was the famous antagonist,

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.460
 the hammer of the Scots.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.580
 - Hammer of the Scots.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.580
 - Long shanks, lots of nicknames.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.180
 He is still in Westminster Abbey,

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.260
 buried just in a very plain lead casket,

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.860
 not with the normal regalia of English monarchs.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.700
 - Is that to not upset the Scots?

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.340
 - It's the absolute opposite, James, it's because--

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.180
 - Oh, no.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.500
 - It's a properly wind them up.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.980
 - It's a really fucking piss them off.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.300
 No, I think it would give the Scots,

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.100
 it would gratify them, 'cause basically,

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.220
 he said I don't want to be buried properly

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.540
 until the Scots are finally conquered.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.620
 And they haven't yet finally been conquered.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.700
 And so, no one's yet exhumed him

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.540
 and buried him in a poor basket.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.060
 - Did they not consider when we beat them

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.540
 in Euro 96-21 with that coal gas coin gold?

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.580
 - People were battering away at Westminster Abbey

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.660
 with spades.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.220
 (laughing)

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.900
 - How interesting, yeah, Edward I,

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.220
 the really interesting thing about him

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.580
 is the Siege of Stirling Castle,

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.660
 when he got this enormous trebuchet built.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.300
 So, a trebuchet is like a catapult,

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.300
 and it was called the War Wolf.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.500
 It was 90 meters tall.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.500
 It took three months to build,

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.060
 and the Scots, when they saw it sort of trundling up,

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.540
 they went, "Oh, shit."

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.900
 And they said, "It's okay, we surrender,

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.740
 "we surrender, we surrender."

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.180
 And King Edward went, "Oh, I've spent three months

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.700
 "making this now, so we attack them anyway."

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.340
 Even though they surrendered.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.820
 - Yeah, Deneep, it was basically going,

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.620
 "Okay, I'm just going to test it though,

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.980
 "and you're not allowed to leave the castle

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.820
 "until the test is over."

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.140
 Good Lord. - Yeah, pretty wild.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.380
 - Well, it's a great name, the War Wolf.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.700
 - Yeah. - Yeah, that is cool.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.900
 - You don't want to waste work like that, do you?

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.340
 You know, you can see its point.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.180
 - We'll just wheel it on to the next place.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.820
 - I'll tell you what, the War Wolf was good

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.380
 against this castle, but it was even better

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.940
 against the castle made of sticks

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.260
 and the castle made of straw.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.380
 - Hey. (laughs)

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.900
 - Get it, I get it. - Yeah.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.620
 - One of the chief nobles who led the Scottish rebellions

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.340
 after over the first little land grab there,

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.260
 he was called Andrew Demore, or Andrew Murray.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.500
 - Oh, really? - Oh, really?

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.140
 - He was like the other William Wallace.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.780
 - He was the one who wasn't William Wallace, basically.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.100
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's Demore.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.680
 (all laugh)

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.180
 - Branickburn is where-- - Freedom.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.620
 - Freedom was won. - That was the moment?

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.340
 - For Andrew Murray here, then deceased, but--

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.260
 - Was it you or was it William Wallace?

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.580
 - I think I was dead by this point.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.420
 - Right, you were. - I think it was

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.700
 an earlier battle where I did very, very well, by the way,

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.300
 but then I got injured and died.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.140
 - It was Sterling Bridge, in fact, sadly.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.780
 - That's so would be on your tooth, so I did.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.060
 - Very well, actually. (all laugh)

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.640
 - Red like a four-star battle.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.220
 (all laugh)

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.300
 - When you're killed in a fight, but you still did all right,

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.900
 that's Demore, which has so many battles over the centuries.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.740
 It's kind of insane.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.060
 Scotland had a huge role in what gets called

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.220
 the English Civil War, which turns out,

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.500
 we shouldn't call the English Civil War,

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.300
 it should be called the War of the Three Kingdoms.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.780
 - Is that the War of the Roses,

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.860
 or is it the War of the Ramtheads versus Cavaliers?

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.560
 - The War of the Roses ends in 1485,

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.420
 with Henry III and Battle of Bosworth

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.620
 and Henry VII taking over.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.820
 What gets called the English Civil War

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.900
 is the 1640s, basically.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.460
 It started partly because Charles I,

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.460
 who was basically a useless,

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.020
 like imagine a useless king.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.140
 - Oh, you thought the Cromwell Kool-Aid, didn't you?

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.780
 - He's a big floppy, rough, suspicious continental practices.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.340
 People worried, he was a Catholic, that kind of stuff.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.780
 - Imagine the ironing it took to get to that level.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.980
 (laughing)

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.020
 - He had tried to interfere with the Church of Scotland,

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.980
 and he'd tried to impose his own prayer books

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.540
 on the Kirk in 1637.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.060
 This went down phenomenally badly.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.540
 It led to a thing called the Bishop's Wars,

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.220
 where it just, like, Ecclesiast people.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.180
 - They all attacked diagonally.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.980
 (laughing)

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.140
 - Superb.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.880
 - That's the best Bishop this week.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.720
 - This week.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.460
 - I don't know, you haven't heard parenting hell

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.660
 this week, haven't you, Andy?

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.340
 (laughing)

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.900
 - And Scotland got so angry

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.380
 about this prayer book difference

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.980
 that they occupied Northern England,

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.100
 and he had to not only back down,

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.140
 he had to pay expenses,

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.980
 which is so humiliating after a war.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.900
 - Pay expenses, what, like, we bought these train tickets

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.540
 to get down to Leeds, can you?

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.380
 - Pretty much, yes.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.140
 - We've not really, excuse me, 10 pounds 60 at Pratt.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:34.980
 (laughing)

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:35.820
 - Who was this, guys?

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:36.640
 - It was a sandwich and a drink,

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.220
 it was expensive these days.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.900
 (laughing)

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.500
 So Charles then had to ask for money from Parliament,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.300
 'cause of the war debt that had been imposed,

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.940
 and that helped kick off the entire Civil War period.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.060
 And then at the end of it,

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.660
 the English Execute Charles, Cromwell, comes in,

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.060
 and the Scots are furious,

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.260
 and that leads to another battle,

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.740
 because they were so angry about,

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.060
 as they saw it, their king.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.140
 Getting a say, chopped off.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.740
 - Yeah, I know. - Okay.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.780
 Do you know this William Wallace period?

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.780
 Robert the Bruce.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.020
 Robert the Bruce don't hear too much about him these days,

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.900
 but he influenced something great

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.740
 in modern popular culture.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.420
 Someone was named after him.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.860
 - Someone was named after Robert Bruce, Bruce Fawceth.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.340
 - No. - Bruce Brinkstein.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.180
 - No.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.020
 - Robert...

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.540
 - Mugabe.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.860
 - Okay.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.500
 - Is that, are we saying that's popular culture?

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.780
 - Oh, his middle name, Winnie the Pooh.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.020
 (laughing)

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.540
 - Now it's Bruce, and it is in the world of fiction.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.460
 - Bruce Almighty.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.300
 - Nope.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.140
 - Bruce.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.380
 - He's the most famous Bruce.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.220
 - Bruce Dickinson.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.460
 - The guy from Matilda, the fat kid.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.460
 - Yes, Anna.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.940
 - Bruce Banner from the Hulk.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.780
 - You're so close.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.620
 - Bruce.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.460
 - Superhero.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.700
 - Bruce, is he Australian?

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.540
 - Oh, Bruce Wayne.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.860
 - Bruce Wayne.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.260
 - Who's Bruce Wayne?

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.100
 - What do you mean, who's Bruce Wayne?

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.300
 Oh, you only know Batman.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.140
 Okay, so Batman.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.380
 - Bruce Wayne is Batman?

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.620
 (laughing)

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:05.460
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.700
 and that is my fact.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.180
 My fact this week is that in 1999,

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:14.180
 the first ever TV ad made for Cats was broadcast on ITV

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:18.820
 and had an estimated viewership of three million cats.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.660
 - Three million.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.500
 - Three million.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.940
 - Well, the numbers.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.820
 - 'Cause the number you sent around was seven million.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.260
 - Yeah, but then I did some additional research.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.700
 - Interestingly, I have two million.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.460
 - I have two million as well.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.720
 - I've had to go over my numbers quite a few times.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.260
 Basically, this was a commercial that was put together

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.580
 by whiskers, the cat food people,

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.540
 and they wanted to put something together

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.220
 that was specifically for cats,

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.740
 and so they asked someone what would generate

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.700
 a cat's interest, and it turns out

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:49.020
 an incredibly surreal 40-second animation

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.260
 full of weird ping noises, little sounds,

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.020
 a mouse running up, a line going up and down the screen,

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.140
 very random stuff, and they made a big deal out of it.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.220
 It was a big promo thing,

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.660
 and on the 27th of January, 1999,

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.100
 there was an announcement just before it was coming on,

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.260
 a pre-ad to say we were about to play

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.260
 the first ever ad for Cats.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.140
 Get your cat, let's do this.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.460
 - I think it was also announced in like the newspapers

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.340
 and stuff beforehand, 'cause I remember it happening.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.100
 - They had to advertise the advert.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.060
 It's like clever, really, 'cause you get publicity

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.260
 out of the fact you're doing an advert.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.260
 That's very hard to do.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.340
 - They've won a lot of awards, basically, for innovation,

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.860
 of getting the interest of the people

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.460
 to make sure that their cats were in.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.060
 Now, the numbers are dodgy, obviously.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.940
 1999 was a period where it went from viewership

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.220
 to households, so you don't know how many people

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.380
 would be in a household.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.300
 So 2.2 people per household, roughly,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.100
 is what the ratings would suggest we're watching.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.180
 - How many cats?

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.500
 - Well, let's get to Hang on, guys.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.500
 Don't have a head on the numbers, okay?

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.820
 So we know what the numbers were

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.940
 of the viewing figures that night.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:49.100
 It was 18,520,000.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:49.940
 That's what we're watching.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.340
 However, that's viewers, not households, right?

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.100
 Okay, so if we're talking houses

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.820
 that might have a cat in it, we've got to look at houses.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.940
 Yeah, so let's 2.2 people.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.620
 So you've got to bring that down, that number,

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.260
 basically split that number in half, right?

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.140
 Then it wasn't just shown on ITV that night.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.100
 It was also shown on Channel 4 and Channel 5.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.020
 So we need to add those in.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.740
 So that's 21.2 million viewers.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.780
 Split that in half, it's roughly 10.6 households.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.260
 - I'm not counting the Channel 5 viewers

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.540
 'cause I remember Channel 5 in the '90s

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.580
 and it was too blurry to make anything out.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.420
 - Okay.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.060
 - They didn't see any of those inches.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.300
 - And how many did it contain a cat,

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.140
 I suppose, for the next one?

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.020
 - Well, at that time, it's estimated

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.700
 that a quarter of all houses in the UK had cats.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.060
 - And then what percentage of households

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.220
 invited their cats into the room to watch when it happened?

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.700
 - And do they have one cat or two cats?

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.460
 So most houses had 1.6 cats.

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.460
 So you then got to add those in.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.100
 - It was a gruesome time, the '90s.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.140
 - So roughly when you add all those numbers together,

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.740
 in theory, there could be roughly around 3 million cats

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.380
 that were in front of a screen in the room.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.420
 - So are you having 3 million as your number?

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.260
 - I'm gonna go for 3 million

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.620
 because I'm also gonna add in the fact

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.580
 it was played in America

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.540
 and so those numbers are gonna add up.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.060
 - Can I say, I think the number might be 3 million and one

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.580
 because I let Harley watch it this week, my cat.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.460
 And if you wanna know what she thought of it,

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.220
 then go on my TikTok or Instagram

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.340
 'cause I'll put the video up.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.540
 - Oh, that's very exciting.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.740
 We'll add for another format within our show.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.220
 You're doing what the cat people did.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.620
 - Yeah, that's what you think is James Harkin, get on there.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.060
 - Wow, that's very good.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.620
 It was considered a success.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:21.060
 So successful, they released it on video, VHS.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.740
 - And I actually found it on eBay.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.500
 So this is the first ever commercial for cats.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.500
 - Oh my God.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.380
 - Officially released by Whiskers, an old VHS.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.460
 - Wow.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.300
 - And it reads--

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.460
 - Why is everyone calling it the first ever

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.140
 as though now we are inundated by cat adverts?

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.460
 - Well, perhaps at the time they thought

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.500
 this is gonna be massive, right?

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.900
 So the back says thousands of cats

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.140
 across the length and breadth of Britain.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.740
 Jumping, staring, cutting--

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.140
 - Thousands of thousands.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.380
 - Thousands of cats.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.580
 So one in a thousand viewers of the advert

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.340
 had any reaction whatsoever.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.820
 So yeah, so we don't know the numbers

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.020
 and they've just muddied the waters even more.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:00.860
 - Amazing.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:01.700
 - It's advertising.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.540
 - Yeah, but it did good for them.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.380
 It did really good.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.220
 - Oh yeah.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.220
 You know what else did well for Whiskers?

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.860
 Eight out of 10 cats.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:07.700
 - Really?

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:08.520
 - That's one of theirs.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.360
 - Yeah.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.200
 - What do you mean that's one of theirs?

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.660
 - Yeah, so there's a TV show Eight Out of 10 Cats

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.980
 and Eight Out of 10 Cats does countdown,

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.860
 but that came from a slogan by Whiskers,

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:19.420
 which was, "Eight out of 10 cats prefer our product."

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.260
 - Really?

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.780
 - And they ran it for quite a lot of years

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.340
 until the advertising standards authority

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.100
 encouraged them to change it.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.140
 And they changed it to,

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.820
 "Eight out of 10 owners who expressed a preference

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.420
 said that their cat prefers it."

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.160
 And the problem was that basically

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.060
 they'd been doing this Eight Out of 10 Cats for ages

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.620
 and everyone knew at the time.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.940
 And then they went up to nine out of 10 cats.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.140
 So they did a survey in 2001

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.980
 and they thought that actually now it's nine out of 10.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.500
 And when they did that, the people at Friskies,

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.700
 who is another cat food company, said,

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.180
 "Oh, we're not having this."

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.940
 And they went to the ASA and they said

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.500
 that this is a biased survey

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.940
 and it wasn't a fair reflection.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.020
 - Well, if it's eight out of 10 owners

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.100
 who expressed a preference,

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.500
 that leads to other questions, doesn't it?

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.100
 How many owners express a preference?

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:03.940
 - Absolutely.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:04.780
 - Yeah, that's fair enough.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.820
 But does this mean that Jimmy Carr

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.140
 has to change the title of the show as well, surely?

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:08.980
 - Yeah, let's do it.

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:09.820
 - Yeah. - Cool.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.900
 Let's get in contact.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.180
 They were very good whiskers, by the way,

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.580
 with their promotion in 1999 specifically.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.060
 So over in Australia,

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.700
 there was an Aussie rules footballer called Gary Hawking

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.820
 who changed his name by depot to whiskers.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.580
 And the idea was that as he was playing,

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.220
 they had no choice but to say,

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.860
 "Oh, whiskers has got the ball."

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.340
 - Did they do that or did they just use his old name?

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.660
 Like that's what happens when football teams

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:35.580
 change the name of the stadium to a company name.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.900
 People just call it the old name.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.420
 - Yep, the AFL were very against calling them whiskers

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.460
 and really stuck to Gary Hawking.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.500
 They were paid a couple of hundred grand

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.940
 in order to advertise them generally.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.060
 And this was a sort of extra move by Gary Hawking

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.540
 'cause he thought, "It's gonna be funny."

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.380
 And it made news stories.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.220
 It did the job right.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.700
 Like that's all that this needs to do.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.700
 - It's like when the snooker player, Jimmy White,

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.020
 changed his name to Jimmy Brown to advertise HP Source.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.180
 - Oh, did he? - Yeah.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.660
 - One of us should change our names to something.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.620
 - I have changed my name years ago to Maserati,

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.460
 but no one, they keep asking me to stop.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.100
 No one here uses it, nightmare.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.420
 - Videos actually look cracked, cats.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.900
 This TV advert would have looked rubbish

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.860
 because they see so much better than us.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.500
 They see about a hundred frames a second.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.300
 So we only need to see 20 frames a second

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.300
 for stuff to look smooth to us.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.300
 And I think TV is about 24 or TV is 30 and films are 24.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.580
 So to cats, it's just gonna look like

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.860
 a series of photographs.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.740
 - So cat videos in general,

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.260
 can you think of a role, famous role

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.020
 that was inspired by cat videos?

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.220
 - Catwoman.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.300
 - Well, there's no fun if you're gonna get it immediately.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:41.140
 When Anne Hathaway, the actress, she played catwoman.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.820
 - It's just 'cause we did the Batman thing together.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:43.660
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.500
 - Wow.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.340
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.180
 - But catwoman isn't an actual cat.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:50.700
 - Well, no, but she's gone to justify her fee somehow, Anna.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.540
 So she's gonna say, well, I spent a couple of weeks

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.140
 looking at cat videos online.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.660
 Absolutely another million quid.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.420
 - Daniel Day-Lewis went for the same party,

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.420
 just sat there licking his ass for three weeks.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.820
 (laughing)

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:03.660
 - Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:06.340
 We've actually received enough half mice.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.500
 (laughing)

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.260
 - But that way going with Hathaway, I'm sorry.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.420
 - She fits the suit better.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.180
 (laughing)

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.300
 - That's been done by a bunch of them.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.180
 Tom Holland studied the movements of a spider

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.220
 in order to--

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.060
 - Such a shit.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.060
 - Robert Downey Jr. watched ironing videos non-stop.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.220
 (laughing)

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.180
 - It's something to say in an interview, isn't it?

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.620
 - You run out of stuff to say in interviews, yeah.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:30.740
 - I read a really good article.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.860
 It was like an inside look at

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.660
 the Waltham Pet Care Science Institute at Melton-Mowbury,

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.780
 which is the science arm of Mars Pet Care,

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.020
 which is where all of our pet food comes from.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.100
 Mars makes it all.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.420
 They go to such great lengths to look after their cats there

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.020
 and to test really advanced foods on them.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.500
 They found out that cats prefer Asian cuisine

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.260
 because their favorite flavors are,

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.180
 well, you can probably guess.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.020
 - Plum sauce.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:54.860
 (laughing)

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.820
 - Plum sauce, the same flavor, yeah.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:57.660
 - Umami.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.860
 - Umami.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.500
 And the new one, kukumi.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.140
 - Yeah, kukumi, yeah.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.900
 I'm sorry, for those of us not up on our flavors,

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.740
 what's that?

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.980
 - So it's, I think it's like fullness and richness.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.820
 - Kukumi.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:09.660
 - Yeah, they keep--

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.260
 - It's not like a flavor so much as an enhanced,

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.860
 and it is officially a flavor,

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.580
 but it's like enhances salty things and rising like MSG.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.900
 - No, that's sumami.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.740
 - Yeah.

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.660
 - Okay.

00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.060
 - And once all the cats are tested on at Melton-Mowbury

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.980
 at this site, they get taken home and adopted

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.780
 by one of the people who work there.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.620
 - Wow.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.580
 - And in other words, they get turned into pot pies.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.420
 Yeah, we know what you mean.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.860
 (laughing)

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.620
 - They're very good owners to the extent

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.940
 that one of the research scientists called Scott McGrane

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.660
 adopted a cat and then noticed when he took it home

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.100
 that the cat was a bit perplexed by his telly

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.700
 'cause they had never seen one before.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.980
 And since then they've installed loads of TVs,

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.740
 a TV room for the cats there.

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.580
 - Why?

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.420
 - So that when they get adopted,

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.100
 they don't get confused by TVs.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.580
 - Is that a massive like safeguarding welfare thing

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.460
 for cats being confused by TVs?

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.620
 When they go to their forever homes,

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.820
 is that really a problem for them?

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.820
 - The RSPCA is clamping down, yes.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.220
 - Can I just say Scott McGrane is very much a name

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.540
 you would come up with if you were trying to come up

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.140
 with a name for a Scottish person and failing.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.100
 (laughing)

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.220
 - Scott, you've been mentioned on the show this week.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.820
 (laughing)

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.940
 - Listen in.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.260
 - You know, cats falling off things

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.260
 and flipping the right way up and landing on the feet.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.620
 - Yeah, they land on the feet.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.380
 - So this was a physics puzzle

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.820
 for much of the 19th century, how it happens.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.340
 'Cause there was a scientist called George Gabriel Stokes.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.060
 James, you did math, you may have heard of him.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.260
 - Yeah, Stokes Equation, I've heard of that.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.180
 Yeah, it's about fluid mechanics or something.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.020
 - Okay, perfect.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.420
 So he was a Lucacean Professor of Maths at Cambridge

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.620
 and other holders of the role were people like Isaac Newton,

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:42.620
 Stephen Hawking. - Oh, Hawking, yeah.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.380
 - So big brain, George Gabriel Stokes.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.660
 He and his colleague, James Clark Maxwell,

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.980
 another big physics name, they were there at the same time.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.700
 And they could not work out, right, cats,

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:57.140
 if you drop them, they fall onto their feet, how?

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.620
 Because they seem to be violating the law

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.340
 about the conservation of angular momentum,

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.660
 which is if something rotates,

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.020
 it has to have something to rotate against,

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.820
 which rotates the opposite way, right?

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.660
 - Yeah, got it.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.220
 - So how does the cat rotate with nothing to push against?

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.940
 - Let's say you jump off a diving board.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.660
 You've pushed off against that

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.420
 and you use that kind of a momentum

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.860
 to twizz around in the air.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.700
 - Exactly.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.700
 - But if the cat's just falling, how do they do that?

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.540
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.460
 - Can I just ask a further clarifying question?

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.740
 If I didn't dive off the diving board,

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.580
 if I let myself just fall forward,

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.340
 can I swing around to my back?

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.060
 - I think Andy's about to answer.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.540
 - Right, yeah.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.740
 - But the judges will mug you down for that, Dan.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.420
 (all laughing)

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.820
 - I've just proved Maxwell's theorem.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.700
 - Two, two, George.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.180
 (all laughing)

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.460
 - So this was so interesting,

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.380
 like how on earth are they doing it?

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.300
 It turns out what the cats do as they start to drop, right?

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.740
 It uses its own mass to rotate around.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.620
 How?

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.140
 It flips in its four legs, it pulls them in,

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.100
 and that means, like a gymnast,

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.900
 its top half spins faster,

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.140
 then it flips out its four limbs

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.500
 and it flips in its back limbs

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:09.260
 and now its back half is revolving faster.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.220
 And it like switches back and forth between those two,

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.900
 so it creates its own momentum using its limbs like an athlete.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.060
 So that is how the cat rotates.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.620
 - And it can do that as quick as falling off this table

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.620
 that we're recording or something.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.460
 - Yeah, right.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.300
 - I mean, so quickly.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.940
 In 1998, there was an Italian researcher

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.620
 who dropped a cat called Esther 600 times

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.100
 and determined that.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.420
 - RSPCA had to get involved at some stage.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.140
 - They're too busy with the telly thing.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.720
 (all laughing)

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.860
 - Who are you in for?

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.060
 Introducing a cat to my home

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.780
 without briefing it about the TV.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.140
 - Me, oh no, I dropped mine 600 times.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.220
 - Anyway, it came to the very important conclusion.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.140
 She could fall on her feet when she was dropped

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.860
 from anywhere between two and six feet,

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.300
 but not from one foot.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.620
 So it was only from two feet up,

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.100
 they could do all this math with gymnastics in the air.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.580
 - And I read the same thing, Anna, it was so good.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.380
 He dropped Esther from the height of one foot

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.980
 100 times in a row

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.260
 to make sure she definitely couldn't do it.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.540
 And she didn't land on her feet once.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.380
 - Yeah.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.500
 - It's much bigger than the sample size

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.540
 that you statistically need.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.300
 - I know, he did write in his paper.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.980
 I want to thank the cat Esther

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.420
 for her initial cooperation in this experiment.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.180
 (all laughing)

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.340
 So we didn't get an answer to my question.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.100
 Would if I fell off a diving board,

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.780
 do humans have the muscles to do what cats do?

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.060
 - I'll hand over to James, he's got a physics degree.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.420
 (all laughing)

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.140
 - I think that you would not be able to do that.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:35.980
 - Maybe not fast enough.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.780
 - I would think if you trained for long enough,

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:38.620
 you might be able to.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:39.940
 'Cause the physics is there, right?

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.140
 It is possible, but I think it would take training.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.260
 - 'Cause you're not flexible enough,

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.700
 like we can't shift our bodies like a cat.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.660
 'Cause they have got, not extra vertebrae,

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.660
 but you know what I mean, they can move,

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.860
 they can very flex a lot.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.700
 - They're very flexible, yeah.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.020
 - I think, yeah, with training,

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.020
 other way I thought of it,

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.620
 and I think I skinned it more than Andy,

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:57.460
 so this is probably wrong,

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.140
 but I thought of it as like squeezing a cat like a sponge.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.860
 You know, when you squeeze a sponge out,

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.940
 you have to turn it in two different directions at once,

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.780
 don't you?

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:05.620
 And that's the only way

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.500
 that it's going to be able to twist around it.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.780
 - Okay, so Dan, stand up.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.620
 How easy is it for you to twist your top half

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.100
 in one direction and your bottom half

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.340
 in the other direction?

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.940
 - Yeah, you see like, this part.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:18.780
 Oh, dear.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.620
 - Oh, wow.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.460
 - Uh-oh.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.300
 - Wow.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.120
 (laughing)

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.060
 - Holy moly.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:23.900
 - Oh, wow.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.740
 - I'm still doing up there.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.060
 - Dan, that is going to be the TikTok craze,

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.820
 dance craze of 2025.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:29.860
 (laughing)

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.580
 - Did you film a change?

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.580
 Can I make a cameo?

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.540
 - That is amazing.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.380
 - Ow.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.220
 - I'm sorry about that, Dan.

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.060
 - No, that's fine.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.260
 - Do you think if you were sat holding a cat right now,

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.380
 and I took a photo,

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.700
 and then we put it on your dating profile,

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.140
 people would find you more attractive or less attractive.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:45.980
 Let's say women.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:46.800
 - Okay, well, first off,

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.820
 my wife doesn't know about that account.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:52.180
 So let's, yeah, I'd say they think you're more attractive.

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.020
 - With a cat?

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:53.860
 - Absolutely.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.580
 - I would say maybe less.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.140
 - Yeah, Anna.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.100
 - I asked the woman in the room, I'm going to say less.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.060
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:00.900
 - Yeah, it's a good feeling.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.060
 - Women view men as less masculine,

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.540
 higher in neuroticism, agreeableness and openness,

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.700
 but less datable.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.260
 - I wonder if I'm not getting any swipes.

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.380
 - Friend material.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.540
 - Less flexible.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.380
 No, it doesn't.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.220
 (laughing)

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.700
 - And is there like a league table of animals?

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.380
 Like if I pose with a water bowl, am I?

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.340
 (laughing)

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.180
 - Oh yeah.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.700
 - Or a mink, or a koala must be?

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.220
 - Do you remember when you did your first Edinburgh show,

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.020
 and I wanted you to do a poster

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.640
 where you were completely naked,

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.140
 but with a water bowl over your privates,

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.900
 and we were going to call it socks and gloves

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.980
 and cock and bowl.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.540
 - Yeah, I do, I do.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.460
 (laughing)

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.460
 - Why did you never go for that?

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.540
 - Why did you not do that?

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.260
 - Just ran out of time on the shoot, mate.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.780
 (laughing)

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.100
 - That's such a shame, I had the vault.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.340
 (laughing)

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.020
 - Can I ask James a question?

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:49.860
 - Yeah.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:50.700
 - As the cat owner in the room.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.520
 - Yeah.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.360
 - Do you want a cat owner, no?

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.200
 - Half done in the past.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.140
 - Okay, well as a current cat owner, James,

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.020
 would you buy a matching outfit for yourself and your cat?

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.620
 - No, my cat only wears what God gave her.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:01.460
 - Okay.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.580
 - And she insists on not being ironed every day

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.260
 since she's so very different.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.260
 - No, I would never buy clothes for animals really.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.380
 - Then you're part of the nine in 10 in your age group

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.700
 who would not buy a matching outfit for yourself

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:17.620
 and your cat, whereas a third of 19 to 28 year olds

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.620
 would do that.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:20.460
 - Really?

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.580
 - Yeah, that's the Instagram generation, isn't it?

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.420
 - Would they be able to get the clothes on the cat, though?

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:25.260
 That's my question.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.140
 - I don't know, it depends on the clothes, doesn't it,

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.220
 as well, if it's a shapeless sort of Bernouce

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.340
 or a Moomoo or something, it might be quite easy.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.580
 (laughing)

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:38.580
 - I don't know why the two items of clothing

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:43.460
 came to my mind were a Bernouce or a Moomoo.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.300
 - What are they?

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.460
 - What is a Bernouce?

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.460
 - It's a sort of North African desert car business.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.700
 Lawrence of Arabia might have got around in a Bernouce.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.300
 - Have you ever seen that show, "Mr. and Mrs."

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.340
 where you write it down and your partner's gonna have

00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.660
 to guess what you said?

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.260
 One, two items of clothing as Andy.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:08.620
 - I'm gonna go for shirts and pats, I'm afraid not.

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.980
 He went for a Bernouce.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.220
 (laughing)

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:13.780
 - You must be kicking yourself.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.540
 (laughing)

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.120
 (upbeat music)

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:23.580
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.020
 and that is James.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.700
 - Okay, my fact this week is that America's

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:32.820
 newest of the year, 1973, who also invented a contraption

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:35.940
 that allowed him to sunbathe in sub-zero temperatures

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.980
 was a man called Dick Bacon.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.260
 - The name's Bacon.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.660
 - Dick Bacon.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.980
 - What a guy.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.820
 - Oh, Dick Bacon is an absolute legend.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.000
 So I found this in an obituary of Dick Bacon.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.440
 - You always find out about these people too late, right?

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.940
 - He spent his life on Lake Michigan sunbathing

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.740
 and anyone who has been to Lake Michigan

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.100
 or lives there knows that in the winter

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.780
 it gets very, very cold.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.420
 But the newspaper said that he set up a series

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.020
 of reflective shields to protect him from the wind

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.180
 and inside the temperature would get

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.820
 high enough for him to tan.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.180
 - Still gonna be pretty cold, though, isn't it?

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.300
 And it was naked, wasn't it?

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.940
 - He was actually usually bathed in a small swimsuit

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.940
 but that was just to keep on the right side of the law

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.180
 and he definitely preferred to be nude.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.660
 He began his nudism when he was 25.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:32.140
 He worked as a live model at the University of Wisconsin

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.420
 but he didn't want tan lines.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.420
 He thought it was unfair on the people drawing him

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.260
 that they had to draw in the tan lines.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.140
 So he thought, well, I'm just gonna not wear any clothes

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.100
 anymore, that's amazing.

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.140
 And he basically just went, okay, how do I make it

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.020
 so that every single day I can be out there

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:46.860
 all year round?

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.020
 So he worked in a brewery.

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.820
 He always took the second and third shifts in there.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.020
 So he always had the morning free.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.260
 So he was a morning...

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.100
 - That's interesting.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:56.220
 - So just every day, go get the sun as it's going up.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.300
 He married someone and he had this line

00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.860
 that I just absolutely love.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.040
 He met this girl and she said, "What's your name?"

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.740
 And he replied, "Bacon, wanna strip?"

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.400
 And that works on two levels.

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.260
 - Yeah, I think...

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.700
 - Like a strip of bacon.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.220
 And strip hasn't taken your clothes off.

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.060
 - I'm a nudist.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:13.900
 Let's go strip.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.380
 Wow, that's just a wonderful double entendre.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.220
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.060
 - It's very strong.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:17.900
 - That is good.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:21.240
 - In fact, it's better than fancy some porky.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.980
 (laughing)

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:24.820
 - It's better than that.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.140
 - It is better than that.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.780
 He won nudist of the year in 73, like I said,

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.300
 but he won that by accident.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.140
 (laughing)

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:31.980
 - No, stop.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.820
 - Okay, he did.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.660
 - He did too far.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.480
 - He did.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.060
 - He just so happened to be in this place called Naked City

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.660
 when the competition was taking place.

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.780
 He didn't deliberately go there for the competition.

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.280
 And he said after his win,

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.620
 they interviewed him in the newspapers

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:49.120
 and they said that he was aiming to reach his natural color.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.460
 Although the Daily Herald where I read this said

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.540
 that he was already a deep red.

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.380
 - Yeah.

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:55.220
 (laughing)

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.900
 - The idea of having a natural color is a bit weird,

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:57.740
 isn't it?

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.380
 Do we have a natural color?

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.220
 - Yeah, good point.

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.260
 - 'Cause you turn, it depends

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.100
 whether you've been in the sun or not.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:02.940
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.640
 - My natural color is incredibly pale,

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.200
 but that's because I haven't been in the sun.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.240
 - Well, you're looking tan today, I would say.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.080
 - Well, I'm trying to sort that out.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:10.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.360
 - I thought that's why I got this Bernouce with me.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.840
 (laughing)

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.840
 He was arrested a lot, Mr. Bacon.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.680
 - He was, yeah.

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.340
 - For nude bathing and lewd and lascivious behavior,

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.960
 but he was a campaigner.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.200
 He was saying this isn't harming people.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.280
 This is a natural, healthy,

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.800
 almost sporting way of living in harmony with the elements.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.320
 I completely backed that.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.680
 - And he was in very good shape.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.780
 In fact, I was recently on a nudist beach,

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.100
 a partially nudist beach, not by choice.

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.580
 - Partly nudist, that's just a beach.

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.920
 (laughing)

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.940
 You were on a partially nudist beach, not by choice.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.680
 The plot is thickening.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.980
 - I was on a beach where a lot of people were nudist,

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:48.940
 including myself, but there were a lot of nudists.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.020
 And it's completely fine,

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.980
 but they're not all in amazing shape,

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:55.180
 whereas he was like a gladiator, wasn't he?

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.020
 - Yeah, I guess he would be

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:56.860
 if he won all the awards that he has.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.980
 - Well, he won Mr. Nude America.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:02.540
 He won Mr. Nude Apollo, Mr. Nude Galaxy.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.400
 - Are any of these awards big awards?

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.240
 - The galaxy?

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.600
 Yeah, I think it might be.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.440
 - Yeah.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.360
 - You know, if you put fact 50 sun cream on,

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.240
 will it stop your skin aging?

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.400
 - I guess so, probably.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.080
 - Or make it age more slowly?

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.800
 Nothing can stop your skin aging, guys.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.160
 - Well, I would have thought that UV rays might age your skin

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.600
 and so the lotion might stop that.

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.920
 - Yeah, you're more leathery, right?

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:31.920
 - They absolutely do age your skin, but only UVA waves.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.200
 So what they don't tell you on the sun creams

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.920
 is that when they say the factor,

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.340
 UV rays are split into UVA and UVB

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.020
 and it's basically about the wavelengths.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.060
 So UVB have shorter wavelengths

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.600
 and they're the ones that cause sunburn

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.320
 and they're the most carcinogenic.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.200
 So when you've got factor X sun cream,

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.160
 it's just blocking the UVB rays or sorry, reducing them,

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.600
 but it doesn't refer to UVA

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.500
 and they're the ones that cause skin aging.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.520
 They're the ones that go deeper

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.000
 and make you wrinkly and crusty.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.900
 So you need to look at the star rating as well.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.600
 If you want to not go wrinking, crusty.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.200
 - I've never seen a star rating on my sun cream.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.400
 - They often don't have them.

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.220
 - Do they not?

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.560
 - If they don't have a star rating,

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.280
 does that mean they don't protect against the UVA?

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.520
 - I think I believe it does, yeah, careful.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.640
 - Okay, can I run a tanning practice past you guys?

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.480
 - Yes, please.

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:24.480
 - Have any of you heard of or you two done testicle tanning?

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.280
 - Jesus Christ, was it last week or the week before

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.400
 when you were talking about perineal tanning?

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.640
 - Yeah, testicle tanning is completely different.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.460
 - Of course.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.100
 - This is actually, it's not sunlight.

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.860
 You don't have to go down to the beach and bury yourself.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.960
 - I always, I do do that, but I always iron mine first.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.840
 (laughing)

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:45.680
 It does take one of those 40 kilogram irons to get them flat.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.920
 (laughing)

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.980
 - This is actually, it's not even a real tanning.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.720
 It's a very dubious medical thing.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.860
 It's just blasting red light at your knackers

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.380
 and claiming that it'll improve your testosterone

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.360
 and a load of male energy and hormones and stuff.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.560
 - Is that, and people are doing this,

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.000
 are they, in their bucket loads?

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.680
 - Not, thankfully, I don't think it's very popular,

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.260
 but it is the kind of thing that a lot of dubious Americans

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.120
 have basically glommed onto and started saying is a good idea.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:14.960
 And it's not done.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.920
 - Well, unless you want to save the poor life drawing class,

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.720
 which apparently was Dick Bacon's motivation,

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.780
 you can't draw two shades of skin color.

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.560
 (laughing)

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.480
 Well, this is very similar to perineum tanning.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.800
 - Which we did talk about a couple of weeks ago.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.220
 - Right under the podcast, very scientifically.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.420
 - Yeah, but I wasn't there.

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.340
 And so I insist on revisiting it.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:37.700
 And there was something I found interesting about this

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.540
 'cause it's mostly obviously just a TikTok nonsense thing

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.780
 where there's like one person who says it's a really good

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.780
 thing to expose your bum hole to the sun.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.900
 And after 30 seconds, you get the same benefits

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.620
 that you get exposing your body for a day and it's nonsense.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.540
 And there is Josh Brolin, the actor, put a thing up saying--

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.460
 - So he's Thanos and Avengers.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.700
 And yeah, no country for old men.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.620
 He's in that if you want to picture his face.

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:01.520
 - Yes, and he put a thing up that--

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.160
 - That is the part of who I want to picture,

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.660
 I must have been in this fact.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.280
 (laughing)

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.560
 - Thanos, more likely.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.800
 (laughing)

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:13.400
 - He said, "Don't try this on your Thanos

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:17.200
 because I did it and my pocket hole is crazily burnt."

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.280
 I mean, he obviously didn't, he's taking the piss.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.440
 I assume he's not an insane person.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.440
 But what I quite like is that, you know,

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.160
 conspiracy theories always come from a kernel of truth.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.600
 And the woman who started this said,

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.540
 "It's an ancient Taoist practice

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.860
 to bathe your bum hole in the sun."

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:36.340
 And actually, it does come from this idea in Taoism.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:40.140
 So Taoism is like ancient Chinese philosophy, basically.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.420
 And the Hui Yin is the collection point

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.580
 of all Yin energy in your body.

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.860
 And that is your perineum.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.900
 So all of Yin, you know, you got Yin and Yang,

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.340
 the two opposing forces that work together.

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.540
 Yin is all gathered in your perineum.

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.740
 And they do believe that it's good to bathe

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.760
 in sunlight and moonlight for wellness.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.220
 And so, you know, there's a kernel of truth in this bullocks.

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.480
 Brazil, home of great tanning culture.

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.320
 - Yeah.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.480
 - Do you know what the fashionable bikini is

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.280
 to wear in Brazil at the moment?

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.000
 - Is it like a full body, like a bikini,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.480
 but it's very, very stiff.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.640
 So your arms go out like Christ the Redeemer.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.480
 - Oh, wow. - That's true.

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.800
 - It's a stanched banoosophagus.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.440
 (both laughing)

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.280
 - Is it?

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.100
 - Well, okay.

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:27.940
 Like Brazilian.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.780
 - Yeah.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.580
 - You would think, okay, very thongy.

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:31.420
 - It's very thongy.

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.500
 - Oh, is it that borat one?

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.740
 Is it that big? - It's not the mankini.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.580
 - Not the mankini.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.420
 - What's it made of?

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.540
 What fabric is it made of?

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:38.380
 - Cashmere.

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.220
 - No.

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:40.700
 (both laughing)

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.540
 - I love it.

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.380
 - I love it.

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.700
 (both laughing)

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:45.540
 - I know.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.380
 Spider silk.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.340
 - Just one piece of spider silk up the crack.

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.980
 (both laughing)

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.060
 - Oh, you already feel that.

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.460
 The aim of it is to give you

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.440
 incredibly crisp turn lines.

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.360
 - So something that blocks all of the--

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.360
 - It blocks really effectively.

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.320
 - So like a lead or a hazmat suit.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.160
 - I'm gonna tell you.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:04.980
 I'm gonna tell you.

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:05.820
 - Yeah.

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:06.660
 - It's electrical tape.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.560
 - Do you give yourself a Brazilian when you take it off?

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.000
 - Well, what you need is this thing,

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.240
 the Marquina De Fita, the little tape mark,

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.480
 and you go to a salon,

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.320
 they will put literally tape a bikini onto you,

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.480
 and they'll give you a little bit of fabric

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.480
 for your nips and stuff like that.

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.000
 - Of course, 'cause I was thinking like,

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.560
 lead is the same as the swimming costume.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.700
 They all block it, but what you need is for your body

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.700
 not to be able to shift underneath it at all.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:28.540
 Is that right?

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:30.260
 - Exactly, so it's just that one bit of skin

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.300
 that is covered with the fabric.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.820
 - So you could super glue your swimming costume

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:33.820
 to yourself as well.

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.500
 - Well, look, there are all sorts of roads to the answer.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.480
 Yes, but this is--

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.380
 - But this is the biggie?

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.980
 - There are salons where you just go

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.260
 and people go up to the roof.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:42.260
 You pay about eight quid,

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.980
 which includes a breakfast buffet.

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:44.820
 - What?

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.140
 - I would do this.

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:46.980
 - Eight quid?

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.460
 - I know how cheap that is, travel lunch.

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:50.300
 - You're not gonna be--

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.540
 - And they don't do anything to your nips.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:53.860
 - You're not gonna be beach body ready

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:55.160
 after a full English.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.000
 (laughing)

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.200
 - Yeah, and then people lie there

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.520
 and they spray you with water every now and again

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.240
 and that's how you get those incredibly crisp lines.

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.800
 - Hey, sugar nips.

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.320
 - Thank you, yes, sweetie possum, yes, go on.

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.480
 Do you know what sugar nips are?

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.400
 I read this today and I'd never heard it before.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.720
 - No, I thought it was just something,

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.760
 how you used it just then.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.160
 - Me too, right?

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.900
 So sugar nips were like a little pair of scissors

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.040
 you would use.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.480
 And if you had a block of sugar in your house

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.680
 or sugar loaf, they would call it.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.940
 In fact, sugar loaf mountain just outside Rio,

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.300
 but you would have a sugar loaf on your table

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.860
 and you would use your sugar nips

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.500
 to nip off a little bit of sugar.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.340
 - That's incredible.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.180
 - Wow.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.020
 - Yeah, I'd never heard that before.

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.020
 - That is a kind, that's 'cause you guys know

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.540
 I like a rare bit of croqueries, cutlery.

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.660
 - I'm surprised and disappointed

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:38.700
 that you weren't familiar with them

00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.140
 and in fact don't own a pair, Andy.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.100
 - No, and I'm actually now regretting it

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:43.900
 'cause I could have bought you some for your birthday.

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.100
 - I'm gonna hop straight on eBay after this

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.460
 to go with the asparagus tongs and the butter spade.

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:50.580
 - Probably when you Google sugar nips.

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.580
 (laughing)

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.420
 - I'll take my chances.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:53.760
 - I'll take my chances.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.960
 (laughing)

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.540
 (upbeat music)

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.560
 - Okay, that is it.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.960
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.240

 which is our wonderful hidden private members club

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.620
 where we put a lot of bonus episodes up and so on.

00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:48.020

 and we will see you then.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:53.060
 Goodbye.

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:55.640
 (upbeat music)

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.220

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:00.920
