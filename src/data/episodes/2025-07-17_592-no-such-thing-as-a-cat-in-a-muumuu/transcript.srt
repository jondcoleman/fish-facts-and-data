1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,560
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,240
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,960
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,200
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,240
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,440
 with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray,

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,640
 and James Harkin.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,840
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,920
 and in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,640
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,240
 - My fact this week is that ironing in Egypt

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,000
 is traditionally a man's job, and they do it with their feet.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,840
 - Yeah.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,660
 (laughing)

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,360
 - And that's why we shouldn't let men do the ironing.

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,880
 (laughing)

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,360
 - Do they put the shirt on the ground,

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,280
 or do they put their foot on the board?

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,120
 - Yeah, good question.

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,040
 - And also, do they use an iron,

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,960
 or do they have really, really flat feet?

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,920
 - Hot, hot feet.

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,360
 Well, it's in the desert, right?

26
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,840
 You just stand them the sand for 10 minutes

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,000
 until your feet get warm.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,840
 - That's it.

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,240
 No, they use an iron, a normal iron,

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,400
 so these are people called the makwagi,

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,400
 and the makwagi regal are specifically the foot ironers.

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,600
 Makwami's iron, and it's been going on for hundreds of years,

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,240
 and on every street corner, you'd have a man

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,660
 who does your ironing, you take your ironing to him.

35
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,200
 It's passed down from fathers to sons,

36
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,920
 and traditionally it was done with feet,

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,240
 so you'd have a big, heavy iron.

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
 I read one reputable source saying

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,320
 that the irons can weigh 40 kilos.

40
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,880
 - What, 40 kilos?

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,200
 - I know, it doesn't seem plausible, does it?

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,920
 - Do they lift it with their feet?

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,560
 - Well, they just push it. - They just push it,

44
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,240
 and they look like a classic old iron,

45
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,920
 so they're just an iron that's heated over coals,

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,080
 or in a stove, right, like a big metal iron.

47
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,000
 They're not plugged in.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,840
 - Not plugged in.

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
 You kind of got that little water button

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,320
 that you press or the steaming up there.

51
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,640
 - Dan's trying to pretend that

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,920
 ironing is a man's job in his household as well.

53
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
 - I think, I could confidently say,

54
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,840
 we all know I iron non-star.

55
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,920
 - Dan is an obsessive, Dan and Andy, actually,

56
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,640
 I feel like you spend half your life ironing,

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,760
 it's quite sad, but it's not sad when these guys do it.

58
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,640
 - I'm sorry, can I just say

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,520
 that I don't just let my wife do all my ironing,

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,040
 I just like to be creased.

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,400
 - In answer to your question about the spray,

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,840
 this is one of the coolest things,

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,320
 and I was going back to old 19th century sources

64
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,840
 when people visited Egypt and reported on it happening there,

65
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,360
 to spritz the garments, so they're a bit wet.

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,120
 They spit, and so now these days, I think--

67
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,400
 - Terrific, all right, does that cost extra?

68
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,960
 - There are accounts of the real pros,

69
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,680
 the real traditional ones, having just a continuous spray

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,480
 constantly coming from their lips.

71
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,520
 - But if you were walking the streets,

72
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
 looking for someone to do your ironing,

73
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,120
 and presumably there might be a bunch of competition,

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,160
 what you wanna see is just one old guy dribbling like crazy,

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,600
 and that's the one you go for, right?

76
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,840
 That's the best version.

77
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,120
 - How did this industry fair during COVID?

78
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,360
 (laughing)

79
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,200
 - That's a really good question,

80
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,160
 and I forgot to investigate.

81
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,080
 - Actually, people used to spit on their irons

82
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,120
 in the UK as well.

83
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
 - Really?

84
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,280
 - Yeah, yeah, so we're talking from the 17th century onwards,

85
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,760
 we had something called sad irons,

86
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,680
 and sad meant solid in those days.

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,160
 So there were solid irons, and they're kind of pretty much,

88
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,640
 you know, like when you play Monopoly and you're the iron,

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,960
 it's that kind of thing.

90
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,160
 So again, it's just like a piece of metal.

91
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,880
 You put it in the fire until it's hot enough,

92
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,960
 and then you would use it to iron things,

93
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,120
 and to find out when it was hot enough,

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,320
 you would spit on it.

95
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,440
 And if the spit sort of laid and frosted around

96
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,800
 and spat around on the iron,

97
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,320
 then you knew it was ready to go.

98
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
 - Interesting.

99
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,360
 - But you don't want it too hot, presumably,

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
 'cause then you burn your clothes.

101
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,480
 - Yeah, absolutely.

102
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,880
 - As well as the sad iron things,

103
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,240
 there were slug irons, which I like as well,

104
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,440
 where you have a slug of metal,

105
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,880
 literally, I just didn't like an ingot of metal,

106
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,280
 that you put in the fire for ages,

107
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,000
 and you draw it out of the fire and shove it in the iron,

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,640
 and that makes it hot.

109
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,480
 - Nice.

110
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,400
 - There were rough irons.

111
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,280
 So they're called a goffering iron,

112
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,520
 where you could iron fabrics into a scalloped edge.

113
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,480
 So you know all those amazing Elizabethan ruffs?

114
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,320
 - Yes.

115
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,160
 - They had to be ironed into place, basically.

116
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,440
 - I do your first level ironing,

117
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,360
 which is I just want things flat and uncreased,

118
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,600
 but there is an art to ironing,

119
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,000
 where you do put in these ruffles.

120
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,680
 You do put in the line on your trousers.

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,960
 I aspire to be there.

122
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,720
 You'll put a crease to the shirt sleeve though.

123
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,560
 - Yeah, you might do.

124
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,400
 - You gotta have a crease on the shirt sleeve.

125
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,240
 - You gotta have a crease.

126
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,360
 But here's the thing, back in the day,

127
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,960
 ironing wasn't just for getting your clothes

128
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
 to be uncreased, it was for cleaning as well.

129
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,640
 So there's reports of, let's say during the Crimean War,

130
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,760
 there's a report there where cannibals might be heated

131
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,440
 and used as a makeshift iron.

132
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,280
 And it wasn't so that people went,

133
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,800
 you know, I want to look uncreased

134
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,120
 when I'm going into battle.

135
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,920
 It was because you would have things like lice

136
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,240
 living on your clothes that you want to get rid of.

137
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,920
 So it was burning it off, basically.

138
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,040
 So it was doing a double job.

139
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,800
 - It's very hard though to aim it correctly

140
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,840
 for an ironing job.

141
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,440
 So it just gets the ironing right.

142
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,600
 It's a difficult method.

143
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,280
 Can I ask Dan as the only other ironer in the room?

144
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,160
 I suspect, another question about this.

145
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
 What was your opinion on wrinkle-free shirts?

146
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,960
 Sorry, James, I mean, James is wearing a collared shirt now

147
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
 and it looks actually very nice.

148
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,760
 - No, no, I've never really ironed any item of clothing

149
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,400
 since I left a proper job about 25 years ago.

150
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,440
 - Fair enough, fair enough.

151
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,400
 And I live in a hope of getting a proper job.

152
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,520
 So I'm constantly heading to interviews,

153
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,800
 so I do mean those shirts.

154
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,640
 (all laughing)

155
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,280
 So what was the question again?

156
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,520
 - Would you wear a wrinkle-free shirt,

157
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,040
 like a non-iron shirt?

158
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,920
 'Cause a lot of shirts sold these days are non-iron.

159
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,160
 - I definitely wore those when I was at university, for sure.

160
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,760
 It was the one thing, if I went to a men's wear shop,

161
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,040
 I would look to see if it would need an iron or not.

162
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,880
 - Really? - Yeah.

163
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,920
 - Why would you? - And the clip on tie as well.

164
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,840
 Don't talk to angry colleagues strangling you,

165
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,680
 that's very helpful.

166
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,720
 - I was talking about at university

167
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,640
 whether we went clubbing,

168
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,840
 we didn't always wear ties.

169
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,680
 - How were you letting in?

170
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,520
 - Ridiculous.

171
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,440
 (all laughing)

172
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,000
 We borrow one from the bounce scene,

173
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,320
 he's going over to his jacket,

174
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
 he's got a big rack of ties in there,

175
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,520
 and he picks one that goes with your complexion and shirt.

176
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,840
 - Yeah, okay.

177
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,640
 - So wrink non-iron shirts are made with formaldehyde,

178
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,120
 or they certainly used to be,

179
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,080
 they've been treated with the special chemical,

180
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,760
 which means that they don't crease, which is very clever.

181
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,520
 - But they make you need to do a poo, right?

182
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,160
 We've talked before about how formaldehyde

183
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,200
 makes you need to poo, that is true.

184
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,280
 I think the good thing is that the formaldehyde

185
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,760
 is locked into the shirt,

186
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,320
 so actually it doesn't do you any harm as the wearer,

187
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,840
 but the people who made it,

188
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,960
 people who worked in the non-iron shirt factories,

189
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,280
 they all go quite sick, I think.

190
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,600
 - Right, really?

191
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,240
 - I think there's a higher proportion of cancer

192
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,720
 in people who work in those factories

193
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,840
 than in the general population.

194
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,040
 - Well, they don't sound like good residents

195
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,880
 that get used to them.

196
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,800
 I don't know whether they've ironed out these problems yet,

197
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,640
 but from what you're saying,

198
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,800
 it sounds like that might still be a thing.

199
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,680
 - The study with this of the incidence of cancer was 20 or nine.

200
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,800
 - Okay, okay, okay.

201
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,240
 - But yeah, ironing basically, okay,

202
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,480
 so let's say you've got a cotton shirt,

203
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,600
 it's made up of loads of fibres, chains of cellulose,

204
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,840
 and when you put it in the washing machine,

205
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,880
 the cellulose goes a bit wonky,

206
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,640
 and it comes out and it's all creased,

207
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,720
 and the ironing works by loosening these cellulose threads,

208
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,800
 and when they're loose, when they're nice and--

209
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
 - It's warm and relaxed.

210
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,240
 - It's warm and relaxed, then they can get into a line,

211
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,480
 you press them down and they'll stay in that line.

212
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,320
 That's how it works.

213
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,160
 - Interesting.

214
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,400
 - But the non-iron ones,

215
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,560
 the formaldehyde basically locks those cellulode fibres

216
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,720
 in place.

217
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,400
 - When you join the army, if you go to Sandhurst,

218
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,320
 which is a very, very posh British army--

219
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,040
 - Sprint's Harry's Place was an academy.

220
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,360
 - Yeah, probably went to Sandhurst.

221
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,600
 - You have to carry in your own ironing board.

222
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,440
 - Really?

223
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,320
 - Yeah, and I asked a friend of mine who went to Sandhurst,

224
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,160
 and he said, "Yes, you do."

225
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,000
 - Do you? - Of course you do.

226
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,280
 - Of course you do, you don't bring your ironing board.

227
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,040
 - Could you not share an ironing board between a barrack?

228
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,400
 - There's simply so much ironing to do with.

229
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,040
 You've got so many different kinds of uniform

230
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,000
 as a modern, heroic, action-man type.

231
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
 - Okay, yeah.

232
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,600
 - And because they don't have so many cannonballs

233
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,760
 in warfare these days.

234
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,600
 (all laughing)

235
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
 - You can't just wait for it to happen naturally.

236
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,000
 - I was very hard with a cruise missile

237
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,760
 to get a really crisp line on that track.

238
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
 - I wonder if they're bulletproof

239
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,280
 or if the fabric is Kevlar,

240
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,000
 because that is a fantastic defense shield

241
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,280
 that you could double up an ironing board with.

242
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,160
 - Yeah, it's basically human size, isn't it?

243
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,800
 - It is, that's a human-sized shield.

244
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,640
 - You're suggesting people wear their ironing boards

245
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,480
 into battle.

246
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,560
 - Are we not talking about the front lines here?

247
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,160
 We're just talking about back at the barracks.

248
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,520
 - You don't do that. (all laughing)

249
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,440
 - Here's a really British thing that I'd never heard of

250
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,960
 before that used to happen in the past with ironing.

251
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,800
 Some homes, and we still know a few examples of these homes,

252
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,600
 had a room for ironing newspapers.

253
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
 - Fantastic.

254
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,040
 - That's the dream, that is the dream.

255
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,400
 - Yeah, I read about this in Bill Bryson's book at home,

256
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,240
 and it was featured, I think, in Downton Abbey,

257
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,200
 but the idea was before the master of the house

258
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,880
 would be given the newspapers,

259
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,760
 the butler would take it into the ironing room,

260
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,560
 and they would iron the newspapers, not for creases,

261
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,400
 but to make sure that the ink becomes dry

262
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,640
 and solid into the newspaper

263
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,920
 so they can wear their white gloves

264
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,560
 as they're leafing through the newspaper

265
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,440
 and not worry about ink smudging on them.

266
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,720
 - I didn't know that was why it was.

267
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,360
 I think I honestly always thought it was to make

268
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,520
 the newspapers nice and flat for the posh people.

269
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,280
 - We should say ironing's at risk.

270
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,120
 - What? - Sorry?

271
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,600
 - Ironing's at risk, big risk.

272
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,440
 - Right, what?

273
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,280
 - From the youth.

274
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,120
 - Oh yeah.

275
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
 - Yeah.

276
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,200
 - 30% of 18 to 34 year olds,

277
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,480
 many of whom may be listening,

278
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,720
 don't own an iron and never do any ironing.

279
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,920
 - What do they do instead?

280
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,760
 - I don't know.

281
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,000
 - They do, like me, just be wrinkled.

282
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,080
 - I think so, yeah.

283
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,000
 And they will claim things like they're closed,

284
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,840
 don't need ironing.

285
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,960
 - They don't, our mind don't, and James' don't.

286
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,280
 - Honestly, I would always wear mine flat.

287
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,840
 So what I would do is I would wash my shirt,

288
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,720
 and then just before it was dry,

289
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,400
 then I would start wearing it,

290
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,200
 and my natural body shape would flatten the shirt.

291
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,520
 - I mean, it's clever.

292
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,480
 - You want it to have that shape of your body.

293
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,000
 You do, I mean, that's the point, isn't it?

294
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,240
 If you iron it to a non-realistic standard

295
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,800
 of a completely flat person,

296
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,080
 which is not what any of us are.

297
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,120
 - Of course it's gonna crease.

298
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,520
 - My whole body is actually creased.

299
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,480
 When I'm naked, I have these terrible creases all over.

300
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,560
 - That's a good idea.

301
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,000
 Although a better version would be to put it on someone

302
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,680
 whose body you aspire to look like,

303
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
 so that when you get it back,

304
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,640
 you can feel what you want to eventually not break it.

305
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,760
 - And your body can iron itself into the shirt.

306
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,600
 - Exactly.

307
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,840
 - Yeah.

308
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,520
 - Speaking of nightclubs, as I was,

309
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,440
 I am in boards are good for DJs.

310
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,440
 Let's say you're an aspiring DJ.

311
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,760
 You're going to a house party.

312
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,120
 You've got your decks,

313
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,600
 but you don't really wanna bring a big old sort of,

314
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
 like all the stand.

315
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,760
 - I'm a hog on your table.

316
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,320
 - So what do you need?

317
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,400
 - You need something that's flat,

318
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,680
 but also you need it to be a very certain height.

319
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,520
 - Yeah.

320
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
 - You don't want the decks to be up at your eye level,

321
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
 or at your knee level,

322
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,600
 but the good thing about ironing boards is they're adjustable.

323
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,440
 - Yes.

324
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,280
 - There you go.

325
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,120
 - That's so cool.

326
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,520
 - So you look at interviews with DJs and they say,

327
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,360
 oh yeah, my first ever DJ gig was on an ironing board.

328
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,200
 - That's so funny.

329
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,040
 And if you pop some, pop a pair of pants under the decks,

330
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
 by the time your set's finished,

331
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,240
 they'll be lovely and crisp.

332
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,880
 That's your journey home.

333
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,160
 - It's actually probably the heat of the decks.

334
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,000
 - Might do it.

335
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,840
 - Yeah.

336
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,680
 - Yeah, yeah.

337
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,520
 - Yeah.

338
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,360
 - Do you think in the future,

339
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,400
 they'll be looking at these ironing boards and saying,

340
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,560
 did you know these used to be used for ironing?

341
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,400
 (laughing)

342
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,240
 - Before they became--

343
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
 - With everyone's a DJ.

344
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,560
 - On the DJ boards, yeah.

345
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,240
 - There is actually a guy called DJ Ironing Board,

346
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,520
 who built his rig that fits perfectly

347
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,240
 on a normal ironing board and he does festivals and stuff.

348
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,080
 - That's awesome.

349
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
 - Oh, wow.

350
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
 But I mean, you've got to be careful.

351
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,480
 And that's so many times when I'm mid iron,

352
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,040
 you hit the little handle underneath

353
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,920
 that sends the entire thing down.

354
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,400
 You don't want that.

355
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,240
 - How do you do that?

356
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,560
 I've never had that experience.

357
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,720
 - Happens to be nonstop.

358
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,560
 - I've never done it.

359
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,400
 - No one else?

360
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
 - No.

361
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,040
 - Can I give you another use for an ironing board?

362
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,880
 - Yeah.

363
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,440
 - If you want to be Pope.

364
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
 - Okay.

365
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,280
 - Quite neat.

366
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,480
 - Well, for instance, the most recent guy who was Pope

367
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,200
 was Robert Provost, Pope Leo XIV.

368
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,560
 And as a child, he played it being a priest

369
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,360
 by using the family's ironing board as an altar,

370
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,840
 according to his brother.

371
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,600
 So he would get the ironing board up.

372
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,200
 He would get a load of biscuits

373
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,520
 and then put them there.

374
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,160
 And his family would come round

375
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,040
 and he would give them a Kit Kat and say,

376
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,000
 "Buddy of Christ."

377
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
 - Really?

378
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,680
 - Oh my God.

379
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,520
 - Are you serious?

380
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,360
 - Absolutely.

381
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,400
 - And again, you can alter the altar as you're growing up.

382
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,240
 - Alter the altar.

383
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,800
 - So it's all good.

384
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,040
 - I mean, they must have thought he was on,

385
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
 that was a pretty long shot

386
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,720
 when he was a kid doing the Kit Kat thing.

387
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,560
 But that's incredible.

388
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,320
 Like, they're laughing on the other side of their face now.

389
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,800
 - He works in mysterious ways.

390
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,080
 - This is good news for the world of ironing

391
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,240
 because actually the last Pope, Francis,

392
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,680
 actively announced that ironing needed to stop

393
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,000
 and so did in homes.

394
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,280
 So there was a question about all these Italian kids

395
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
 that weren't leaving home and what do I do

396
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,560
 to get my son a job and get him out of the house?

397
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,240
 And the Pope said, "Stop ironing for him."

398
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,080
 And that was like-

399
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,920
 - Like mums overlooked.

400
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
 - Exactly.

401
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,840
 Why would he leave home?

402
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,960
 He's got his stuff being ironed every day by you.

403
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,200
 You're mollycolling him.

404
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,920
 - And an interesting thing to focus on as Pope,

405
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,400
 but you know, they're focused on worse, I suppose.

406
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,120
 - It turns out they're all obsessed.

407
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,160
 - Another great world leader

408
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,320
 who did a spot of ironing in her day, Margaret Thatcher.

409
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,160
 - Really?

410
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,000
 - Even after she was an MP,

411
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,560
 she would iron her husband, Dennis's shirts, in parliament.

412
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,400
 - In what?

413
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,800
 - Not on the floor of the House of Commons.

414
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,640
 - Okay.

415
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,480
 - Just on the dispatch board.

416
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,160
 - There is a desk there, actually, isn't there?

417
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,000
 - Yeah.

418
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,840
 - I think it's wooden.

419
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,880
 I think that would be very bad for it.

420
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,800
 - Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.

421
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,360
 No, there was a ladies' room.

422
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
 And this was a time when there were fewer female MPs

423
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,880
 than there are now.

424
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,440
 There was a need for women to have their own space in parliament.

425
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,680
 And it had an ironing board in it,

426
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,160
 and she frankly monopolised that iron.

427
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,720
 - Well, she was a fan of monopolies.

428
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,560
 - Yeah.

429
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,680
 - Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.

430
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,360
 That's the best batch of ironing monopolies

431
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,000
 track you'll hear on any podcast this week.

432
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,840
 - This week.

433
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,040
 - But if he listens to "Off Lady" next week...

434
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,400
 - They come up these days.

435
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,660
 (upbeat music)

436
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,360
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

437
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,640
 and that is Andy.

438
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,200
 - My fact is that 900 years ago,

439
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
 England beat Scotland in a battle

440
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,720
 with an earth horn super weapon,

441
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,880
 which scattered the Scots by frightening their cows.

442
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,120
 Lot to unpack.

443
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,960
 - Yeah.

444
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,400
 - What's an earth horn?

445
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,240
 - Glad you asked.

446
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,160
 It's not a common thing anymore.

447
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,360
 This was word of the day

448
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,240
 on the OED website the other day.

449
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,960
 - Highly recommended, you know.

450
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,800
 If you're listening to this,

451
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,520
 just go over to the Oxford English Dictionary website

452
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,040
 and see what the word of the day is.

453
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,400
 And this is earth horn.

454
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,360
 I think this was the first and maybe last time it was used.

455
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,800
 - Yes, it's a hapax legomenon.

456
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,640
 - Yeah.

457
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,680
 - As in there's only one mention of it

458
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,920
 in the whole of literature.

459
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,840
 - The whole of literature, yeah.

460
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,960
 So it didn't take off basically this earth horn,

461
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,160
 like secret weapon, whatever it was.

462
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,320
 Seems to have been a big horn.

463
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,280
 - Despite working apparently.

464
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,760
 - Yeah, you're right.

465
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,600
 - You're absolutely right.

466
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,880
 - The other thing to say as well

467
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,240
 is it was only mentioned once and that was in 1338.

468
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,560
 And it referred to a battle that happened in 1138.

469
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,400
 - Okay.

470
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,220
 - Yes, so.

471
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,400
 - It's like the 200th anniversary of this battle.

472
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,480
 - Finally, we're gonna uncover this secret weapon

473
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,320
 that we used.

474
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,000
 No one's mentioned it before now.

475
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,480
 - And again, it's not completely clear from the OED source

476
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,480
 why frightening the cows was a key factor

477
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,680
 in the end of the battle.

478
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,720
 - Okay.

479
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,880
 Well, give us everything we know about it then

480
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,720
 from the description.

481
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,560
 - Definitely huge amount of it.

482
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,400
 - That's it.

483
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,240
 - It's a thing called the Derethorn.

484
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,360
 - We don't know anything about the earth horn, definitely.

485
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,520
 - We don't know if it was a sound.

486
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,800
 I mean, horn implies it.

487
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,240
 - And what do we know why earth?

488
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,480
 Is it made of earth?

489
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
 Is it comes from the earth?

490
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,960
 - I can't stress enough, this was 900 years ago.

491
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,160
 As James says, first recorded 200 years later

492
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,480
 for the first and last time.

493
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,440
 We really don't know much about it.

494
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,320
 This is my challenge fact for the week.

495
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,040
 - As I said, it happened in 1138.

496
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,600
 So what was going on?

497
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,520
 - What was going on was a thousand years of conflict

498
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,880
 between England and Scotland on and off.

499
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,000
 But quite a lot of on.

500
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,400
 So what I found was the earliest battle recorded

501
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,480
 between Angles and the Scots slash Picts,

502
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,200
 that was in 596 AD.

503
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,040
 - Wow.

504
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,200
 - And the last battle between England and Scotland

505
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,360
 as completely independent kingdoms was, when was it?

506
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,200
 That was 1547, correct?

507
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,760
 - This particular one that we're talking about,

508
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,320
 the Battle of North Allerton,

509
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,520
 also known as the Battle of the Standards.

510
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,520
 This was that time when Henry had died Matilda

511
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,160
 was maybe going to be our queen.

512
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,680
 Stephen was maybe going to be the king.

513
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,200
 There was a whole load of conflict

514
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,720
 about who was going to take over.

515
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,760
 And the Scots were on the side of Matilda.

516
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,680
 And a lot of the Barons in England

517
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,080
 were on the side of Stephen.

518
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,440
 And so there was a big old battle

519
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,240
 because the Scots wanted to help out

520
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,320
 because Matilda was the daughter of a Scottish kick.

521
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,360
 - I read that this battle took place on Calton Moor.

522
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,200
 - Jesus.

523
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,040
 - Is that interesting?

524
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,240
 - That is interesting.

525
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,080
 - Moor.

526
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,920
 - Do you want to say that again?

527
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,880
 - Calton Moor.

528
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,840
 - You didn't want to stress the cow part.

529
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,160
 - Well, that was obvious.

530
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,400
 The Moor was going to be a bit more difficult.

531
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,240
 - Yeah.

532
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,080
 - No, I think that's really good, Dan.

533
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,920
 - Yeah, that's very good.

534
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,720
 - Give them lots of cows at the end of the battle.

535
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,960
 - We talked about this when David Mitchell

536
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,800
 was on the podcast.

537
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,960
 - This era we did, yeah.

538
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,120
 - If you've got your English history,

539
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,200
 Kings and Queens ruler,

540
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,480
 it's the bit that goes Willy, Willy, Harry, Steve.

541
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,600
 It's the Steve bit, of course, King Stephen.

542
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,200
 - And if you've got the ruler that goes all the way forward

543
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,320
 and just to emphasise how much the Scots in English

544
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,360
 didn't like each other back then,

545
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,600
 and obviously it's all water on the bridge now,

546
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,960
 but between 1040 and 1745,

547
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,600
 33 out of the 36 English monarchs

548
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,520
 either invaded or were invaded by Scotland,

549
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,840
 which is strong.

550
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,040
 It's a strong record, isn't it?

551
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,760
 - So it's a long old skirmish.

552
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,600
 - I know.

553
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,800
 - Although it could have all been avoided,

554
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,360
 or the worst bits could have been avoided,

555
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,120
 if it weren't for just a small diplomatic cock-up.

556
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,360
 So the worst phase,

557
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,520
 and with all the famous battles,

558
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,760
 like your Bannock Burns and your Mel Gibson's,

559
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,760
 was 13th and 14th centuries,

560
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,680
 and that was the Wars of Independence.

561
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,240
 And it all kicked off when Alexander III of Scotland dies

562
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,040
 in early 1290s.

563
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,160
 And there were these two guys,

564
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,480
 John Balliol and Robert Bruce,

565
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,160
 who was the grandfather of the famous Robert Bruce.

566
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,960
 - Sorry, it was one Robert the Bruce,

567
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,680
 and the other one was just Robert Bruce.

568
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,800
 - Yeah, that was his middle name.

569
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,480
 - Yeah, you sometimes got to slip that in there

570
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,640
 to differentiate.

571
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,720
 - So no, there was a guy called John Balliol,

572
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,280
 there was a guy called Robert Bruce.

573
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,720
 Robert Bruce's grandson was also called Robert Bruce.

574
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,800
 He's the famous one,

575
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,400
 who for bad reasons we now call Robert the Bruce.

576
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,960
 I think related to the fact that he was Robert the Bruce.

577
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,440
 - He's brave heart for anyone who knows that movie.

578
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,320
 This is Mel Gibson's granddad, Robert Bruce.

579
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,160
 - Exactly.

580
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,400
 They couldn't decide who was gonna be king.

581
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
 So they asked Edward I of England,

582
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,040
 as their neighbor and friend,

583
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,080
 as an impartial observer,

584
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,320
 to say which one of us should be king.

585
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,160
 - Man, that's it, right.

586
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,000
 - Edward I thought, great, here's my chance.

587
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,480
 And he said, okay, I'll do that.

588
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,880
 But first of all, I need to have legal authority

589
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,280
 over Scotland to have this kind of authority

590
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,040
 to decide who's king.

591
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,680
 And so little legal loophole,

592
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,760
 he gave himself authority over all of Scotland.

593
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,320
 And then the rest is history.

594
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,120
 He just started getting in the way all the time.

595
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,720
 And what a cock up.

596
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,720
 - Yeah, Berwick upon Tweed is the,

597
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,920
 now, if you're heading north from England to Scotland,

598
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,240
 it's pretty much the last English town you pass through.

599
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,140
 - If you're heading on the east coast.

600
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,920
 - If you're heading on the east coast, absolutely.

601
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,000
 - Sorry, a big fan of the west coast mainline over here.

602
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,480
 - I love the west coast mainline.

603
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,760
 But for international listeners, let us simplify.

604
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,400
 Just saying it's the last term before Scotland.

605
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,240
 So Berwick upon Tweed, very, very northern English town.

606
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,520
 It has changed hands 13 times over the last thousand years.

607
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,880
 I mean, mostly like centuries ago.

608
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,320
 And all the times it changed hands,

609
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,960
 it wasn't just being captured in battles.

610
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,620
 So in 1174, Scotland gave it to England

611
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,780
 because William I had been captured.

612
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,300
 And that was part of the ransom is like,

613
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,580
 we want Berwick upon Tweed.

614
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,980
 Then 20 years later, Scotland bought it back

615
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,300
 'cause King Richard needed money for a crusade.

616
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,780
 They're like, what can I flog off?

617
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,020
 Oh, so Berwick upon Tweed, the Scots love that.

618
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,860
 (laughing)

619
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,300
 For about 200 years, once every 15 years, it changed hands.

620
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,620
 - Do you think the people in Berwick upon Tweed

621
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,300
 going about their lives, do you think they ever knew?

622
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,620
 - They just say they're from Berwick.

623
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,420
 A lot of people there just say I'm a Berwicker, you know.

624
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,360
 There's a guy called Derek Sharman,

625
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,320
 who's a local historian who says this a lot.

626
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,260
 - Derek from Berwick?

627
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,300
 - Derek from Berwick upon Tweed.

628
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,380
 - He says that basically they're all just Berricas.

629
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,700
 And actually, if you're from north of the river

630
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,340
 and south of the river, that's kind of a distinguishable

631
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,460
 sort of almost nationality as well.

632
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,900
 - I was it, that's where the next big civil war

633
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,460
 is happening, isn't it?

634
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,180
 Edward I, who was the famous antagonist,

635
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,460
 the hammer of the Scots.

636
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,580
 - Hammer of the Scots.

637
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,580
 - Long shanks, lots of nicknames.

638
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,180
 He is still in Westminster Abbey,

639
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,260
 buried just in a very plain lead casket,

640
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,860
 not with the normal regalia of English monarchs.

641
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,700
 - Is that to not upset the Scots?

642
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,340
 - It's the absolute opposite, James, it's because--

643
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,180
 - Oh, no.

644
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,500
 - It's a properly wind them up.

645
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,980
 - It's a really fucking piss them off.

646
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,300
 No, I think it would give the Scots,

647
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,100
 it would gratify them, 'cause basically,

648
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,220
 he said I don't want to be buried properly

649
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,540
 until the Scots are finally conquered.

650
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,620
 And they haven't yet finally been conquered.

651
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,700
 And so, no one's yet exhumed him

652
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,540
 and buried him in a poor basket.

653
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,060
 - Did they not consider when we beat them

654
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,540
 in Euro 96-21 with that coal gas coin gold?

655
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,580
 - People were battering away at Westminster Abbey

656
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,660
 with spades.

657
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,220
 (laughing)

658
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,900
 - How interesting, yeah, Edward I,

659
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,220
 the really interesting thing about him

660
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,580
 is the Siege of Stirling Castle,

661
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,660
 when he got this enormous trebuchet built.

662
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,300
 So, a trebuchet is like a catapult,

663
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
 and it was called the War Wolf.

664
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,500
 It was 90 meters tall.

665
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
 It took three months to build,

666
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,060
 and the Scots, when they saw it sort of trundling up,

667
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,540
 they went, "Oh, shit."

668
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,900
 And they said, "It's okay, we surrender,

669
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,740
 "we surrender, we surrender."

670
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,180
 And King Edward went, "Oh, I've spent three months

671
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,700
 "making this now, so we attack them anyway."

672
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,340
 Even though they surrendered.

673
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,820
 - Yeah, Deneep, it was basically going,

674
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,620
 "Okay, I'm just going to test it though,

675
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,980
 "and you're not allowed to leave the castle

676
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,820
 "until the test is over."

677
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,140
 Good Lord. - Yeah, pretty wild.

678
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,380
 - Well, it's a great name, the War Wolf.

679
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,700
 - Yeah. - Yeah, that is cool.

680
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,900
 - You don't want to waste work like that, do you?

681
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,340
 You know, you can see its point.

682
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,180
 - We'll just wheel it on to the next place.

683
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,820
 - I'll tell you what, the War Wolf was good

684
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,380
 against this castle, but it was even better

685
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,940
 against the castle made of sticks

686
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,260
 and the castle made of straw.

687
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,380
 - Hey. (laughs)

688
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,900
 - Get it, I get it. - Yeah.

689
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,620
 - One of the chief nobles who led the Scottish rebellions

690
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,340
 after over the first little land grab there,

691
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,260
 he was called Andrew Demore, or Andrew Murray.

692
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,500
 - Oh, really? - Oh, really?

693
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,140
 - He was like the other William Wallace.

694
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,780
 - He was the one who wasn't William Wallace, basically.

695
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,100
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's Demore.

696
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,680
 (all laugh)

697
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,180
 - Branickburn is where-- - Freedom.

698
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,620
 - Freedom was won. - That was the moment?

699
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,340
 - For Andrew Murray here, then deceased, but--

700
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,260
 - Was it you or was it William Wallace?

701
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,580
 - I think I was dead by this point.

702
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,420
 - Right, you were. - I think it was

703
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,700
 an earlier battle where I did very, very well, by the way,

704
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,300
 but then I got injured and died.

705
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,140
 - It was Sterling Bridge, in fact, sadly.

706
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,780
 - That's so would be on your tooth, so I did.

707
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,060
 - Very well, actually. (all laugh)

708
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,640
 - Red like a four-star battle.

709
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,220
 (all laugh)

710
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,300
 - When you're killed in a fight, but you still did all right,

711
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,900
 that's Demore, which has so many battles over the centuries.

712
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,740
 It's kind of insane.

713
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,060
 Scotland had a huge role in what gets called

714
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,220
 the English Civil War, which turns out,

715
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,500
 we shouldn't call the English Civil War,

716
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,300
 it should be called the War of the Three Kingdoms.

717
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,780
 - Is that the War of the Roses,

718
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,860
 or is it the War of the Ramtheads versus Cavaliers?

719
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,560
 - The War of the Roses ends in 1485,

720
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,420
 with Henry III and Battle of Bosworth

721
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,620
 and Henry VII taking over.

722
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,820
 What gets called the English Civil War

723
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,900
 is the 1640s, basically.

724
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,460
 It started partly because Charles I,

725
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,460
 who was basically a useless,

726
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,020
 like imagine a useless king.

727
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,140
 - Oh, you thought the Cromwell Kool-Aid, didn't you?

728
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,780
 - He's a big floppy, rough, suspicious continental practices.

729
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,340
 People worried, he was a Catholic, that kind of stuff.

730
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,780
 - Imagine the ironing it took to get to that level.

731
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,980
 (laughing)

732
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,020
 - He had tried to interfere with the Church of Scotland,

733
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,980
 and he'd tried to impose his own prayer books

734
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,540
 on the Kirk in 1637.

735
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,060
 This went down phenomenally badly.

736
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,540
 It led to a thing called the Bishop's Wars,

737
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,220
 where it just, like, Ecclesiast people.

738
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,180
 - They all attacked diagonally.

739
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,980
 (laughing)

740
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,140
 - Superb.

741
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,880
 - That's the best Bishop this week.

742
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,720
 - This week.

743
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,460
 - I don't know, you haven't heard parenting hell

744
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,660
 this week, haven't you, Andy?

745
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,340
 (laughing)

746
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,900
 - And Scotland got so angry

747
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,380
 about this prayer book difference

748
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,980
 that they occupied Northern England,

749
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,100
 and he had to not only back down,

750
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,140
 he had to pay expenses,

751
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,980
 which is so humiliating after a war.

752
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,900
 - Pay expenses, what, like, we bought these train tickets

753
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,540
 to get down to Leeds, can you?

754
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,380
 - Pretty much, yes.

755
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,140
 - We've not really, excuse me, 10 pounds 60 at Pratt.

756
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,980
 (laughing)

757
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,820
 - Who was this, guys?

758
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,640
 - It was a sandwich and a drink,

759
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,220
 it was expensive these days.

760
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,900
 (laughing)

761
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,500
 So Charles then had to ask for money from Parliament,

762
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,300
 'cause of the war debt that had been imposed,

763
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,940
 and that helped kick off the entire Civil War period.

764
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,060
 And then at the end of it,

765
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,660
 the English Execute Charles, Cromwell, comes in,

766
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,060
 and the Scots are furious,

767
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,260
 and that leads to another battle,

768
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,740
 because they were so angry about,

769
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,060
 as they saw it, their king.

770
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,140
 Getting a say, chopped off.

771
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,740
 - Yeah, I know. - Okay.

772
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,780
 Do you know this William Wallace period?

773
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,780
 Robert the Bruce.

774
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,020
 Robert the Bruce don't hear too much about him these days,

775
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,900
 but he influenced something great

776
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,740
 in modern popular culture.

777
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,420
 Someone was named after him.

778
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,860
 - Someone was named after Robert Bruce, Bruce Fawceth.

779
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,340
 - No. - Bruce Brinkstein.

780
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,180
 - No.

781
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,020
 - Robert...

782
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,540
 - Mugabe.

783
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,860
 - Okay.

784
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,500
 - Is that, are we saying that's popular culture?

785
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,780
 - Oh, his middle name, Winnie the Pooh.

786
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,020
 (laughing)

787
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,540
 - Now it's Bruce, and it is in the world of fiction.

788
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,460
 - Bruce Almighty.

789
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,300
 - Nope.

790
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,140
 - Bruce.

791
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,380
 - He's the most famous Bruce.

792
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,220
 - Bruce Dickinson.

793
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,460
 - The guy from Matilda, the fat kid.

794
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,460
 - Yes, Anna.

795
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,940
 - Bruce Banner from the Hulk.

796
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,780
 - You're so close.

797
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,620
 - Bruce.

798
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,460
 - Superhero.

799
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,700
 - Bruce, is he Australian?

800
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,540
 - Oh, Bruce Wayne.

801
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,860
 - Bruce Wayne.

802
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,260
 - Who's Bruce Wayne?

803
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,100
 - What do you mean, who's Bruce Wayne?

804
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,300
 Oh, you only know Batman.

805
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,140
 Okay, so Batman.

806
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,380
 - Bruce Wayne is Batman?

807
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,620
 (laughing)

808
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:05,460
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

809
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,700
 and that is my fact.

810
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,180
 My fact this week is that in 1999,

811
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:14,180
 the first ever TV ad made for Cats was broadcast on ITV

812
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,820
 and had an estimated viewership of three million cats.

813
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,660
 - Three million.

814
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,500
 - Three million.

815
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,940
 - Well, the numbers.

816
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,820
 - 'Cause the number you sent around was seven million.

817
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,260
 - Yeah, but then I did some additional research.

818
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,700
 - Interestingly, I have two million.

819
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,460
 - I have two million as well.

820
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,720
 - I've had to go over my numbers quite a few times.

821
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,260
 Basically, this was a commercial that was put together

822
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,580
 by whiskers, the cat food people,

823
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,540
 and they wanted to put something together

824
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,220
 that was specifically for cats,

825
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,740
 and so they asked someone what would generate

826
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,700
 a cat's interest, and it turns out

827
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,020
 an incredibly surreal 40-second animation

828
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,260
 full of weird ping noises, little sounds,

829
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,020
 a mouse running up, a line going up and down the screen,

830
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,140
 very random stuff, and they made a big deal out of it.

831
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,220
 It was a big promo thing,

832
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,660
 and on the 27th of January, 1999,

833
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,100
 there was an announcement just before it was coming on,

834
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,260
 a pre-ad to say we were about to play

835
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,260
 the first ever ad for Cats.

836
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,140
 Get your cat, let's do this.

837
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,460
 - I think it was also announced in like the newspapers

838
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,340
 and stuff beforehand, 'cause I remember it happening.

839
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,100
 - They had to advertise the advert.

840
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,060
 It's like clever, really, 'cause you get publicity

841
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,260
 out of the fact you're doing an advert.

842
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,260
 That's very hard to do.

843
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,340
 - They've won a lot of awards, basically, for innovation,

844
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,860
 of getting the interest of the people

845
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,460
 to make sure that their cats were in.

846
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,060
 Now, the numbers are dodgy, obviously.

847
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,940
 1999 was a period where it went from viewership

848
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,220
 to households, so you don't know how many people

849
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,380
 would be in a household.

850
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,300
 So 2.2 people per household, roughly,

851
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,100
 is what the ratings would suggest we're watching.

852
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,180
 - How many cats?

853
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,500
 - Well, let's get to Hang on, guys.

854
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
 Don't have a head on the numbers, okay?

855
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,820
 So we know what the numbers were

856
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,940
 of the viewing figures that night.

857
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,100
 It was 18,520,000.

858
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,940
 That's what we're watching.

859
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,340
 However, that's viewers, not households, right?

860
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,100
 Okay, so if we're talking houses

861
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,820
 that might have a cat in it, we've got to look at houses.

862
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,940
 Yeah, so let's 2.2 people.

863
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,620
 So you've got to bring that down, that number,

864
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,260
 basically split that number in half, right?

865
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,140
 Then it wasn't just shown on ITV that night.

866
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,100
 It was also shown on Channel 4 and Channel 5.

867
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,020
 So we need to add those in.

868
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,740
 So that's 21.2 million viewers.

869
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,780
 Split that in half, it's roughly 10.6 households.

870
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,260
 - I'm not counting the Channel 5 viewers

871
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,540
 'cause I remember Channel 5 in the '90s

872
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,580
 and it was too blurry to make anything out.

873
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,420
 - Okay.

874
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,060
 - They didn't see any of those inches.

875
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,300
 - And how many did it contain a cat,

876
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,140
 I suppose, for the next one?

877
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,020
 - Well, at that time, it's estimated

878
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,700
 that a quarter of all houses in the UK had cats.

879
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,060
 - And then what percentage of households

880
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,220
 invited their cats into the room to watch when it happened?

881
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,700
 - And do they have one cat or two cats?

882
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,460
 So most houses had 1.6 cats.

883
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,460
 So you then got to add those in.

884
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,100
 - It was a gruesome time, the '90s.

885
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,140
 - So roughly when you add all those numbers together,

886
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,740
 in theory, there could be roughly around 3 million cats

887
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,380
 that were in front of a screen in the room.

888
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,420
 - So are you having 3 million as your number?

889
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,260
 - I'm gonna go for 3 million

890
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,620
 because I'm also gonna add in the fact

891
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,580
 it was played in America

892
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,540
 and so those numbers are gonna add up.

893
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,060
 - Can I say, I think the number might be 3 million and one

894
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,580
 because I let Harley watch it this week, my cat.

895
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,460
 And if you wanna know what she thought of it,

896
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,220
 then go on my TikTok or Instagram

897
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,340
 'cause I'll put the video up.

898
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,540
 - Oh, that's very exciting.

899
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,740
 We'll add for another format within our show.

900
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,220
 You're doing what the cat people did.

901
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,620
 - Yeah, that's what you think is James Harkin, get on there.

902
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,060
 - Wow, that's very good.

903
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,620
 It was considered a success.

904
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,060
 So successful, they released it on video, VHS.

905
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,740
 - And I actually found it on eBay.

906
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,500
 So this is the first ever commercial for cats.

907
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
 - Oh my God.

908
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,380
 - Officially released by Whiskers, an old VHS.

909
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,460
 - Wow.

910
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,300
 - And it reads--

911
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,460
 - Why is everyone calling it the first ever

912
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,140
 as though now we are inundated by cat adverts?

913
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,460
 - Well, perhaps at the time they thought

914
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,500
 this is gonna be massive, right?

915
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,900
 So the back says thousands of cats

916
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,140
 across the length and breadth of Britain.

917
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,740
 Jumping, staring, cutting--

918
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,140
 - Thousands of thousands.

919
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,380
 - Thousands of cats.

920
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,580
 So one in a thousand viewers of the advert

921
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,340
 had any reaction whatsoever.

922
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,820
 So yeah, so we don't know the numbers

923
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,020
 and they've just muddied the waters even more.

924
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,860
 - Amazing.

925
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,700
 - It's advertising.

926
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,540
 - Yeah, but it did good for them.

927
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,380
 It did really good.

928
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,220
 - Oh yeah.

929
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,220
 You know what else did well for Whiskers?

930
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,860
 Eight out of 10 cats.

931
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,700
 - Really?

932
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,520
 - That's one of theirs.

933
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,360
 - Yeah.

934
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,200
 - What do you mean that's one of theirs?

935
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,660
 - Yeah, so there's a TV show Eight Out of 10 Cats

936
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,980
 and Eight Out of 10 Cats does countdown,

937
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,860
 but that came from a slogan by Whiskers,

938
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,420
 which was, "Eight out of 10 cats prefer our product."

939
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,260
 - Really?

940
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,780
 - And they ran it for quite a lot of years

941
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,340
 until the advertising standards authority

942
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,100
 encouraged them to change it.

943
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,140
 And they changed it to,

944
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,820
 "Eight out of 10 owners who expressed a preference

945
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,420
 said that their cat prefers it."

946
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,160
 And the problem was that basically

947
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,060
 they'd been doing this Eight Out of 10 Cats for ages

948
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,620
 and everyone knew at the time.

949
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,940
 And then they went up to nine out of 10 cats.

950
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,140
 So they did a survey in 2001

951
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,980
 and they thought that actually now it's nine out of 10.

952
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,500
 And when they did that, the people at Friskies,

953
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,700
 who is another cat food company, said,

954
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,180
 "Oh, we're not having this."

955
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,940
 And they went to the ASA and they said

956
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,500
 that this is a biased survey

957
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,940
 and it wasn't a fair reflection.

958
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,020
 - Well, if it's eight out of 10 owners

959
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,100
 who expressed a preference,

960
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,500
 that leads to other questions, doesn't it?

961
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,100
 How many owners express a preference?

962
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,940
 - Absolutely.

963
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,780
 - Yeah, that's fair enough.

964
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,820
 But does this mean that Jimmy Carr

965
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,140
 has to change the title of the show as well, surely?

966
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,980
 - Yeah, let's do it.

967
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,820
 - Yeah. - Cool.

968
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,900
 Let's get in contact.

969
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,180
 They were very good whiskers, by the way,

970
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,580
 with their promotion in 1999 specifically.

971
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,060
 So over in Australia,

972
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,700
 there was an Aussie rules footballer called Gary Hawking

973
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,820
 who changed his name by depot to whiskers.

974
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,580
 And the idea was that as he was playing,

975
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,220
 they had no choice but to say,

976
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,860
 "Oh, whiskers has got the ball."

977
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,340
 - Did they do that or did they just use his old name?

978
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,660
 Like that's what happens when football teams

979
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,580
 change the name of the stadium to a company name.

980
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,900
 People just call it the old name.

981
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,420
 - Yep, the AFL were very against calling them whiskers

982
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,460
 and really stuck to Gary Hawking.

983
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,500
 They were paid a couple of hundred grand

984
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,940
 in order to advertise them generally.

985
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,060
 And this was a sort of extra move by Gary Hawking

986
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,540
 'cause he thought, "It's gonna be funny."

987
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,380
 And it made news stories.

988
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,220
 It did the job right.

989
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,700
 Like that's all that this needs to do.

990
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,700
 - It's like when the snooker player, Jimmy White,

991
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,020
 changed his name to Jimmy Brown to advertise HP Source.

992
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,180
 - Oh, did he? - Yeah.

993
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,660
 - One of us should change our names to something.

994
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,620
 - I have changed my name years ago to Maserati,

995
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,460
 but no one, they keep asking me to stop.

996
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,100
 No one here uses it, nightmare.

997
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,420
 - Videos actually look cracked, cats.

998
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,900
 This TV advert would have looked rubbish

999
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,860
 because they see so much better than us.

1000
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,500
 They see about a hundred frames a second.

1001
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,300
 So we only need to see 20 frames a second

1002
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,300
 for stuff to look smooth to us.

1003
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,300
 And I think TV is about 24 or TV is 30 and films are 24.

1004
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,580
 So to cats, it's just gonna look like

1005
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,860
 a series of photographs.

1006
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,740
 - So cat videos in general,

1007
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,260
 can you think of a role, famous role

1008
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,020
 that was inspired by cat videos?

1009
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,220
 - Catwoman.

1010
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,300
 - Well, there's no fun if you're gonna get it immediately.

1011
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,140
 When Anne Hathaway, the actress, she played catwoman.

1012
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,820
 - It's just 'cause we did the Batman thing together.

1013
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,660
 - Yeah, yeah.

1014
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,500
 - Wow.

1015
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,340
 - Yeah, yeah.

1016
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,180
 - But catwoman isn't an actual cat.

1017
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,700
 - Well, no, but she's gone to justify her fee somehow, Anna.

1018
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,540
 So she's gonna say, well, I spent a couple of weeks

1019
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,140
 looking at cat videos online.

1020
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,660
 Absolutely another million quid.

1021
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,420
 - Daniel Day-Lewis went for the same party,

1022
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,420
 just sat there licking his ass for three weeks.

1023
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,820
 (laughing)

1024
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,660
 - Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis.

1025
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,340
 We've actually received enough half mice.

1026
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,500
 (laughing)

1027
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,260
 - But that way going with Hathaway, I'm sorry.

1028
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,420
 - She fits the suit better.

1029
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,180
 (laughing)

1030
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,300
 - That's been done by a bunch of them.

1031
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,180
 Tom Holland studied the movements of a spider

1032
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,220
 in order to--

1033
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,060
 - Such a shit.

1034
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,060
 - Robert Downey Jr. watched ironing videos non-stop.

1035
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,220
 (laughing)

1036
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,180
 - It's something to say in an interview, isn't it?

1037
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,620
 - You run out of stuff to say in interviews, yeah.

1038
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,740
 - I read a really good article.

1039
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,860
 It was like an inside look at

1040
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,660
 the Waltham Pet Care Science Institute at Melton-Mowbury,

1041
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,780
 which is the science arm of Mars Pet Care,

1042
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,020
 which is where all of our pet food comes from.

1043
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,100
 Mars makes it all.

1044
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,420
 They go to such great lengths to look after their cats there

1045
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,020
 and to test really advanced foods on them.

1046
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,500
 They found out that cats prefer Asian cuisine

1047
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,260
 because their favorite flavors are,

1048
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,180
 well, you can probably guess.

1049
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,020
 - Plum sauce.

1050
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,860
 (laughing)

1051
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,820
 - Plum sauce, the same flavor, yeah.

1052
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,660
 - Umami.

1053
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,860
 - Umami.

1054
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,500
 And the new one, kukumi.

1055
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,140
 - Yeah, kukumi, yeah.

1056
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,900
 I'm sorry, for those of us not up on our flavors,

1057
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,740
 what's that?

1058
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,980
 - So it's, I think it's like fullness and richness.

1059
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,820
 - Kukumi.

1060
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,660
 - Yeah, they keep--

1061
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,260
 - It's not like a flavor so much as an enhanced,

1062
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,860
 and it is officially a flavor,

1063
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,580
 but it's like enhances salty things and rising like MSG.

1064
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,900
 - No, that's sumami.

1065
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,740
 - Yeah.

1066
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,660
 - Okay.

1067
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,060
 - And once all the cats are tested on at Melton-Mowbury

1068
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,980
 at this site, they get taken home and adopted

1069
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,780
 by one of the people who work there.

1070
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,620
 - Wow.

1071
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,580
 - And in other words, they get turned into pot pies.

1072
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,420
 Yeah, we know what you mean.

1073
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,860
 (laughing)

1074
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,620
 - They're very good owners to the extent

1075
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,940
 that one of the research scientists called Scott McGrane

1076
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,660
 adopted a cat and then noticed when he took it home

1077
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,100
 that the cat was a bit perplexed by his telly

1078
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,700
 'cause they had never seen one before.

1079
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,980
 And since then they've installed loads of TVs,

1080
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,740
 a TV room for the cats there.

1081
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,580
 - Why?

1082
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,420
 - So that when they get adopted,

1083
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,100
 they don't get confused by TVs.

1084
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,580
 - Is that a massive like safeguarding welfare thing

1085
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,460
 for cats being confused by TVs?

1086
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,620
 When they go to their forever homes,

1087
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,820
 is that really a problem for them?

1088
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,820
 - The RSPCA is clamping down, yes.

1089
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,220
 - Can I just say Scott McGrane is very much a name

1090
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,540
 you would come up with if you were trying to come up

1091
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,140
 with a name for a Scottish person and failing.

1092
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,100
 (laughing)

1093
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,220
 - Scott, you've been mentioned on the show this week.

1094
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,820
 (laughing)

1095
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,940
 - Listen in.

1096
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,260
 - You know, cats falling off things

1097
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,260
 and flipping the right way up and landing on the feet.

1098
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,620
 - Yeah, they land on the feet.

1099
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,380
 - So this was a physics puzzle

1100
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,820
 for much of the 19th century, how it happens.

1101
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,340
 'Cause there was a scientist called George Gabriel Stokes.

1102
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,060
 James, you did math, you may have heard of him.

1103
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,260
 - Yeah, Stokes Equation, I've heard of that.

1104
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,180
 Yeah, it's about fluid mechanics or something.

1105
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,020
 - Okay, perfect.

1106
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,420
 So he was a Lucacean Professor of Maths at Cambridge

1107
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,620
 and other holders of the role were people like Isaac Newton,

1108
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,620
 Stephen Hawking. - Oh, Hawking, yeah.

1109
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,380
 - So big brain, George Gabriel Stokes.

1110
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,660
 He and his colleague, James Clark Maxwell,

1111
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,980
 another big physics name, they were there at the same time.

1112
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,700
 And they could not work out, right, cats,

1113
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,140
 if you drop them, they fall onto their feet, how?

1114
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,620
 Because they seem to be violating the law

1115
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,340
 about the conservation of angular momentum,

1116
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,660
 which is if something rotates,

1117
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,020
 it has to have something to rotate against,

1118
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,820
 which rotates the opposite way, right?

1119
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,660
 - Yeah, got it.

1120
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,220
 - So how does the cat rotate with nothing to push against?

1121
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,940
 - Let's say you jump off a diving board.

1122
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,660
 You've pushed off against that

1123
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,420
 and you use that kind of a momentum

1124
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,860
 to twizz around in the air.

1125
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,700
 - Exactly.

1126
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
 - But if the cat's just falling, how do they do that?

1127
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,540
 - Yeah, exactly.

1128
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,460
 - Can I just ask a further clarifying question?

1129
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,740
 If I didn't dive off the diving board,

1130
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,580
 if I let myself just fall forward,

1131
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,340
 can I swing around to my back?

1132
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,060
 - I think Andy's about to answer.

1133
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,540
 - Right, yeah.

1134
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,740
 - But the judges will mug you down for that, Dan.

1135
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,420
 (all laughing)

1136
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,820
 - I've just proved Maxwell's theorem.

1137
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,700
 - Two, two, George.

1138
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,180
 (all laughing)

1139
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,460
 - So this was so interesting,

1140
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,380
 like how on earth are they doing it?

1141
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,300
 It turns out what the cats do as they start to drop, right?

1142
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,740
 It uses its own mass to rotate around.

1143
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,620
 How?

1144
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,140
 It flips in its four legs, it pulls them in,

1145
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,100
 and that means, like a gymnast,

1146
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,900
 its top half spins faster,

1147
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,140
 then it flips out its four limbs

1148
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,500
 and it flips in its back limbs

1149
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,260
 and now its back half is revolving faster.

1150
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,220
 And it like switches back and forth between those two,

1151
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,900
 so it creates its own momentum using its limbs like an athlete.

1152
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,060
 So that is how the cat rotates.

1153
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,620
 - And it can do that as quick as falling off this table

1154
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,620
 that we're recording or something.

1155
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,460
 - Yeah, right.

1156
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,300
 - I mean, so quickly.

1157
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,940
 In 1998, there was an Italian researcher

1158
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,620
 who dropped a cat called Esther 600 times

1159
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,100
 and determined that.

1160
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,420
 - RSPCA had to get involved at some stage.

1161
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,140
 - They're too busy with the telly thing.

1162
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,720
 (all laughing)

1163
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,860
 - Who are you in for?

1164
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,060
 Introducing a cat to my home

1165
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,780
 without briefing it about the TV.

1166
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,140
 - Me, oh no, I dropped mine 600 times.

1167
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,220
 - Anyway, it came to the very important conclusion.

1168
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,140
 She could fall on her feet when she was dropped

1169
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,860
 from anywhere between two and six feet,

1170
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,300
 but not from one foot.

1171
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,620
 So it was only from two feet up,

1172
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,100
 they could do all this math with gymnastics in the air.

1173
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,580
 - And I read the same thing, Anna, it was so good.

1174
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,380
 He dropped Esther from the height of one foot

1175
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,980
 100 times in a row

1176
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,260
 to make sure she definitely couldn't do it.

1177
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,540
 And she didn't land on her feet once.

1178
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,380
 - Yeah.

1179
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,500
 - It's much bigger than the sample size

1180
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,540
 that you statistically need.

1181
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,300
 - I know, he did write in his paper.

1182
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,980
 I want to thank the cat Esther

1183
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,420
 for her initial cooperation in this experiment.

1184
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,180
 (all laughing)

1185
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,340
 So we didn't get an answer to my question.

1186
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,100
 Would if I fell off a diving board,

1187
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,780
 do humans have the muscles to do what cats do?

1188
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,060
 - I'll hand over to James, he's got a physics degree.

1189
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,420
 (all laughing)

1190
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,140
 - I think that you would not be able to do that.

1191
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,980
 - Maybe not fast enough.

1192
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,780
 - I would think if you trained for long enough,

1193
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,620
 you might be able to.

1194
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,940
 'Cause the physics is there, right?

1195
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,140
 It is possible, but I think it would take training.

1196
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,260
 - 'Cause you're not flexible enough,

1197
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,700
 like we can't shift our bodies like a cat.

1198
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,660
 'Cause they have got, not extra vertebrae,

1199
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,660
 but you know what I mean, they can move,

1200
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,860
 they can very flex a lot.

1201
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,700
 - They're very flexible, yeah.

1202
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,020
 - I think, yeah, with training,

1203
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,020
 other way I thought of it,

1204
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,620
 and I think I skinned it more than Andy,

1205
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,460
 so this is probably wrong,

1206
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,140
 but I thought of it as like squeezing a cat like a sponge.

1207
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,860
 You know, when you squeeze a sponge out,

1208
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,940
 you have to turn it in two different directions at once,

1209
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,780
 don't you?

1210
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,620
 And that's the only way

1211
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,500
 that it's going to be able to twist around it.

1212
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,780
 - Okay, so Dan, stand up.

1213
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,620
 How easy is it for you to twist your top half

1214
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,100
 in one direction and your bottom half

1215
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,340
 in the other direction?

1216
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,940
 - Yeah, you see like, this part.

1217
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,780
 Oh, dear.

1218
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,620
 - Oh, wow.

1219
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,460
 - Uh-oh.

1220
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,300
 - Wow.

1221
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,120
 (laughing)

1222
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,060
 - Holy moly.

1223
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,900
 - Oh, wow.

1224
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,740
 - I'm still doing up there.

1225
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,060
 - Dan, that is going to be the TikTok craze,

1226
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,820
 dance craze of 2025.

1227
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,860
 (laughing)

1228
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,580
 - Did you film a change?

1229
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,580
 Can I make a cameo?

1230
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,540
 - That is amazing.

1231
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,380
 - Ow.

1232
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,220
 - I'm sorry about that, Dan.

1233
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,060
 - No, that's fine.

1234
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,260
 - Do you think if you were sat holding a cat right now,

1235
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,380
 and I took a photo,

1236
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,700
 and then we put it on your dating profile,

1237
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,140
 people would find you more attractive or less attractive.

1238
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,980
 Let's say women.

1239
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,800
 - Okay, well, first off,

1240
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,820
 my wife doesn't know about that account.

1241
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,180
 So let's, yeah, I'd say they think you're more attractive.

1242
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,020
 - With a cat?

1243
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,860
 - Absolutely.

1244
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,580
 - I would say maybe less.

1245
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,140
 - Yeah, Anna.

1246
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,100
 - I asked the woman in the room, I'm going to say less.

1247
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,060
 - Yeah, absolutely.

1248
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,900
 - Yeah, it's a good feeling.

1249
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,060
 - Women view men as less masculine,

1250
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,540
 higher in neuroticism, agreeableness and openness,

1251
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,700
 but less datable.

1252
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,260
 - I wonder if I'm not getting any swipes.

1253
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,380
 - Friend material.

1254
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,540
 - Less flexible.

1255
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,380
 No, it doesn't.

1256
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,220
 (laughing)

1257
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,700
 - And is there like a league table of animals?

1258
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,380
 Like if I pose with a water bowl, am I?

1259
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,340
 (laughing)

1260
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,180
 - Oh yeah.

1261
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,700
 - Or a mink, or a koala must be?

1262
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,220
 - Do you remember when you did your first Edinburgh show,

1263
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,020
 and I wanted you to do a poster

1264
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,640
 where you were completely naked,

1265
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,140
 but with a water bowl over your privates,

1266
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,900
 and we were going to call it socks and gloves

1267
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,980
 and cock and bowl.

1268
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,540
 - Yeah, I do, I do.

1269
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,460
 (laughing)

1270
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,460
 - Why did you never go for that?

1271
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,540
 - Why did you not do that?

1272
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,260
 - Just ran out of time on the shoot, mate.

1273
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,780
 (laughing)

1274
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,100
 - That's such a shame, I had the vault.

1275
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,340
 (laughing)

1276
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,020
 - Can I ask James a question?

1277
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,860
 - Yeah.

1278
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,700
 - As the cat owner in the room.

1279
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,520
 - Yeah.

1280
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,360
 - Do you want a cat owner, no?

1281
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,200
 - Half done in the past.

1282
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,140
 - Okay, well as a current cat owner, James,

1283
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,020
 would you buy a matching outfit for yourself and your cat?

1284
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,620
 - No, my cat only wears what God gave her.

1285
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,460
 - Okay.

1286
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,580
 - And she insists on not being ironed every day

1287
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,260
 since she's so very different.

1288
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,260
 - No, I would never buy clothes for animals really.

1289
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,380
 - Then you're part of the nine in 10 in your age group

1290
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,700
 who would not buy a matching outfit for yourself

1291
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,620
 and your cat, whereas a third of 19 to 28 year olds

1292
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,620
 would do that.

1293
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,460
 - Really?

1294
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,580
 - Yeah, that's the Instagram generation, isn't it?

1295
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,420
 - Would they be able to get the clothes on the cat, though?

1296
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,260
 That's my question.

1297
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,140
 - I don't know, it depends on the clothes, doesn't it,

1298
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,220
 as well, if it's a shapeless sort of Bernouce

1299
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,340
 or a Moomoo or something, it might be quite easy.

1300
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,580
 (laughing)

1301
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,580
 - I don't know why the two items of clothing

1302
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,460
 came to my mind were a Bernouce or a Moomoo.

1303
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,300
 - What are they?

1304
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,460
 - What is a Bernouce?

1305
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,460
 - It's a sort of North African desert car business.

1306
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,700
 Lawrence of Arabia might have got around in a Bernouce.

1307
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,300
 - Have you ever seen that show, "Mr. and Mrs."

1308
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,340
 where you write it down and your partner's gonna have

1309
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,660
 to guess what you said?

1310
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,260
 One, two items of clothing as Andy.

1311
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,620
 - I'm gonna go for shirts and pats, I'm afraid not.

1312
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,980
 He went for a Bernouce.

1313
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,220
 (laughing)

1314
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,780
 - You must be kicking yourself.

1315
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,540
 (laughing)

1316
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,120
 (upbeat music)

1317
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:23,580
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1318
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,020
 and that is James.

1319
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,700
 - Okay, my fact this week is that America's

1320
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,820
 newest of the year, 1973, who also invented a contraption

1321
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,940
 that allowed him to sunbathe in sub-zero temperatures

1322
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,980
 was a man called Dick Bacon.

1323
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,260
 - The name's Bacon.

1324
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,660
 - Dick Bacon.

1325
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,980
 - What a guy.

1326
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,820
 - Oh, Dick Bacon is an absolute legend.

1327
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,000
 So I found this in an obituary of Dick Bacon.

1328
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,440
 - You always find out about these people too late, right?

1329
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,940
 - He spent his life on Lake Michigan sunbathing

1330
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,740
 and anyone who has been to Lake Michigan

1331
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,100
 or lives there knows that in the winter

1332
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,780
 it gets very, very cold.

1333
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,420
 But the newspaper said that he set up a series

1334
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,020
 of reflective shields to protect him from the wind

1335
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,180
 and inside the temperature would get

1336
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,820
 high enough for him to tan.

1337
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,180
 - Still gonna be pretty cold, though, isn't it?

1338
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,300
 And it was naked, wasn't it?

1339
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,940
 - He was actually usually bathed in a small swimsuit

1340
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,940
 but that was just to keep on the right side of the law

1341
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,180
 and he definitely preferred to be nude.

1342
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,660
 He began his nudism when he was 25.

1343
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,140
 He worked as a live model at the University of Wisconsin

1344
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,420
 but he didn't want tan lines.

1345
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,420
 He thought it was unfair on the people drawing him

1346
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,260
 that they had to draw in the tan lines.

1347
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,140
 So he thought, well, I'm just gonna not wear any clothes

1348
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,100
 anymore, that's amazing.

1349
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,140
 And he basically just went, okay, how do I make it

1350
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,020
 so that every single day I can be out there

1351
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:46,860
 all year round?

1352
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,020
 So he worked in a brewery.

1353
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,820
 He always took the second and third shifts in there.

1354
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,020
 So he always had the morning free.

1355
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,260
 So he was a morning...

1356
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,100
 - That's interesting.

1357
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,220
 - So just every day, go get the sun as it's going up.

1358
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,300
 He married someone and he had this line

1359
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,860
 that I just absolutely love.

1360
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,040
 He met this girl and she said, "What's your name?"

1361
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,740
 And he replied, "Bacon, wanna strip?"

1362
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,400
 And that works on two levels.

1363
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,260
 - Yeah, I think...

1364
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,700
 - Like a strip of bacon.

1365
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,220
 And strip hasn't taken your clothes off.

1366
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,060
 - I'm a nudist.

1367
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:13,900
 Let's go strip.

1368
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,380
 Wow, that's just a wonderful double entendre.

1369
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,220
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1370
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,060
 - It's very strong.

1371
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:17,900
 - That is good.

1372
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,240
 - In fact, it's better than fancy some porky.

1373
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,980
 (laughing)

1374
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,820
 - It's better than that.

1375
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,140
 - It is better than that.

1376
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,780
 He won nudist of the year in 73, like I said,

1377
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,300
 but he won that by accident.

1378
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,140
 (laughing)

1379
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,980
 - No, stop.

1380
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,820
 - Okay, he did.

1381
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,660
 - He did too far.

1382
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,480
 - He did.

1383
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,060
 - He just so happened to be in this place called Naked City

1384
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,660
 when the competition was taking place.

1385
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,780
 He didn't deliberately go there for the competition.

1386
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,280
 And he said after his win,

1387
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,620
 they interviewed him in the newspapers

1388
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,120
 and they said that he was aiming to reach his natural color.

1389
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,460
 Although the Daily Herald where I read this said

1390
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,540
 that he was already a deep red.

1391
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,380
 - Yeah.

1392
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,220
 (laughing)

1393
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,900
 - The idea of having a natural color is a bit weird,

1394
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,740
 isn't it?

1395
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,380
 Do we have a natural color?

1396
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,220
 - Yeah, good point.

1397
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,260
 - 'Cause you turn, it depends

1398
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,100
 whether you've been in the sun or not.

1399
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:02,940
 - Yeah, exactly.

1400
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,640
 - My natural color is incredibly pale,

1401
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,200
 but that's because I haven't been in the sun.

1402
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,240
 - Well, you're looking tan today, I would say.

1403
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,080
 - Well, I'm trying to sort that out.

1404
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,920
 - Yeah, yeah.

1405
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,360
 - I thought that's why I got this Bernouce with me.

1406
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,840
 (laughing)

1407
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,840
 He was arrested a lot, Mr. Bacon.

1408
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,680
 - He was, yeah.

1409
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,340
 - For nude bathing and lewd and lascivious behavior,

1410
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,960
 but he was a campaigner.

1411
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,200
 He was saying this isn't harming people.

1412
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,280
 This is a natural, healthy,

1413
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,800
 almost sporting way of living in harmony with the elements.

1414
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,320
 I completely backed that.

1415
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,680
 - And he was in very good shape.

1416
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,780
 In fact, I was recently on a nudist beach,

1417
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,100
 a partially nudist beach, not by choice.

1418
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,580
 - Partly nudist, that's just a beach.

1419
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,920
 (laughing)

1420
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,940
 You were on a partially nudist beach, not by choice.

1421
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,680
 The plot is thickening.

1422
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,980
 - I was on a beach where a lot of people were nudist,

1423
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,940
 including myself, but there were a lot of nudists.

1424
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,020
 And it's completely fine,

1425
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,980
 but they're not all in amazing shape,

1426
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,180
 whereas he was like a gladiator, wasn't he?

1427
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,020
 - Yeah, I guess he would be

1428
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,860
 if he won all the awards that he has.

1429
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,980
 - Well, he won Mr. Nude America.

1430
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,540
 He won Mr. Nude Apollo, Mr. Nude Galaxy.

1431
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,400
 - Are any of these awards big awards?

1432
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,240
 - The galaxy?

1433
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,600
 Yeah, I think it might be.

1434
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,440
 - Yeah.

1435
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,360
 - You know, if you put fact 50 sun cream on,

1436
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,240
 will it stop your skin aging?

1437
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,400
 - I guess so, probably.

1438
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,080
 - Or make it age more slowly?

1439
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,800
 Nothing can stop your skin aging, guys.

1440
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,160
 - Well, I would have thought that UV rays might age your skin

1441
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,600
 and so the lotion might stop that.

1442
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,920
 - Yeah, you're more leathery, right?

1443
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,920
 - They absolutely do age your skin, but only UVA waves.

1444
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,200
 So what they don't tell you on the sun creams

1445
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,920
 is that when they say the factor,

1446
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,340
 UV rays are split into UVA and UVB

1447
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,020
 and it's basically about the wavelengths.

1448
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,060
 So UVB have shorter wavelengths

1449
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,600
 and they're the ones that cause sunburn

1450
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,320
 and they're the most carcinogenic.

1451
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,200
 So when you've got factor X sun cream,

1452
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,160
 it's just blocking the UVB rays or sorry, reducing them,

1453
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,600
 but it doesn't refer to UVA

1454
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,500
 and they're the ones that cause skin aging.

1455
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,520
 They're the ones that go deeper

1456
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,000
 and make you wrinkly and crusty.

1457
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,900
 So you need to look at the star rating as well.

1458
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,600
 If you want to not go wrinking, crusty.

1459
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,200
 - I've never seen a star rating on my sun cream.

1460
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,400
 - They often don't have them.

1461
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,220
 - Do they not?

1462
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,560
 - If they don't have a star rating,

1463
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,280
 does that mean they don't protect against the UVA?

1464
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,520
 - I think I believe it does, yeah, careful.

1465
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,640
 - Okay, can I run a tanning practice past you guys?

1466
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,480
 - Yes, please.

1467
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,480
 - Have any of you heard of or you two done testicle tanning?

1468
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,280
 - Jesus Christ, was it last week or the week before

1469
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,400
 when you were talking about perineal tanning?

1470
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,640
 - Yeah, testicle tanning is completely different.

1471
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,460
 - Of course.

1472
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,100
 - This is actually, it's not sunlight.

1473
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,860
 You don't have to go down to the beach and bury yourself.

1474
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,960
 - I always, I do do that, but I always iron mine first.

1475
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,840
 (laughing)

1476
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,680
 It does take one of those 40 kilogram irons to get them flat.

1477
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,920
 (laughing)

1478
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,980
 - This is actually, it's not even a real tanning.

1479
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,720
 It's a very dubious medical thing.

1480
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,860
 It's just blasting red light at your knackers

1481
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,380
 and claiming that it'll improve your testosterone

1482
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,360
 and a load of male energy and hormones and stuff.

1483
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,560
 - Is that, and people are doing this,

1484
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,000
 are they, in their bucket loads?

1485
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,680
 - Not, thankfully, I don't think it's very popular,

1486
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,260
 but it is the kind of thing that a lot of dubious Americans

1487
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,120
 have basically glommed onto and started saying is a good idea.

1488
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:14,960
 And it's not done.

1489
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,920
 - Well, unless you want to save the poor life drawing class,

1490
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,720
 which apparently was Dick Bacon's motivation,

1491
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,780
 you can't draw two shades of skin color.

1492
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,560
 (laughing)

1493
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,480
 Well, this is very similar to perineum tanning.

1494
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,800
 - Which we did talk about a couple of weeks ago.

1495
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,220
 - Right under the podcast, very scientifically.

1496
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,420
 - Yeah, but I wasn't there.

1497
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,340
 And so I insist on revisiting it.

1498
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,700
 And there was something I found interesting about this

1499
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,540
 'cause it's mostly obviously just a TikTok nonsense thing

1500
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,780
 where there's like one person who says it's a really good

1501
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,780
 thing to expose your bum hole to the sun.

1502
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,900
 And after 30 seconds, you get the same benefits

1503
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,620
 that you get exposing your body for a day and it's nonsense.

1504
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:53,540
 And there is Josh Brolin, the actor, put a thing up saying--

1505
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,460
 - So he's Thanos and Avengers.

1506
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,700
 And yeah, no country for old men.

1507
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,620
 He's in that if you want to picture his face.

1508
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,520
 - Yes, and he put a thing up that--

1509
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,160
 - That is the part of who I want to picture,

1510
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,660
 I must have been in this fact.

1511
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,280
 (laughing)

1512
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,560
 - Thanos, more likely.

1513
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,800
 (laughing)

1514
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,400
 - He said, "Don't try this on your Thanos

1515
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,200
 because I did it and my pocket hole is crazily burnt."

1516
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,280
 I mean, he obviously didn't, he's taking the piss.

1517
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,440
 I assume he's not an insane person.

1518
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,440
 But what I quite like is that, you know,

1519
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,160
 conspiracy theories always come from a kernel of truth.

1520
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,600
 And the woman who started this said,

1521
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,540
 "It's an ancient Taoist practice

1522
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,860
 to bathe your bum hole in the sun."

1523
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:36,340
 And actually, it does come from this idea in Taoism.

1524
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,140
 So Taoism is like ancient Chinese philosophy, basically.

1525
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:43,420
 And the Hui Yin is the collection point

1526
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,580
 of all Yin energy in your body.

1527
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,860
 And that is your perineum.

1528
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,900
 So all of Yin, you know, you got Yin and Yang,

1529
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,340
 the two opposing forces that work together.

1530
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,540
 Yin is all gathered in your perineum.

1531
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,740
 And they do believe that it's good to bathe

1532
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,760
 in sunlight and moonlight for wellness.

1533
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,220
 And so, you know, there's a kernel of truth in this bullocks.

1534
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1535
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,480
 Brazil, home of great tanning culture.

1536
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,320
 - Yeah.

1537
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,480
 - Do you know what the fashionable bikini is

1538
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,280
 to wear in Brazil at the moment?

1539
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,000
 - Is it like a full body, like a bikini,

1540
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,480
 but it's very, very stiff.

1541
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,640
 So your arms go out like Christ the Redeemer.

1542
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,480
 - Oh, wow. - That's true.

1543
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,800
 - It's a stanched banoosophagus.

1544
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,440
 (both laughing)

1545
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,280
 - Is it?

1546
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,100
 - Well, okay.

1547
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:27,940
 Like Brazilian.

1548
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,780
 - Yeah.

1549
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,580
 - You would think, okay, very thongy.

1550
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,420
 - It's very thongy.

1551
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,500
 - Oh, is it that borat one?

1552
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,740
 Is it that big? - It's not the mankini.

1553
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,580
 - Not the mankini.

1554
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,420
 - What's it made of?

1555
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,540
 What fabric is it made of?

1556
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,380
 - Cashmere.

1557
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,220
 - No.

1558
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,700
 (both laughing)

1559
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,540
 - I love it.

1560
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,380
 - I love it.

1561
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,700
 (both laughing)

1562
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,540
 - I know.

1563
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,380
 Spider silk.

1564
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,340
 - Just one piece of spider silk up the crack.

1565
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,980
 (both laughing)

1566
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,060
 - Oh, you already feel that.

1567
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,460
 The aim of it is to give you

1568
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,440
 incredibly crisp turn lines.

1569
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,360
 - So something that blocks all of the--

1570
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,360
 - It blocks really effectively.

1571
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,320
 - So like a lead or a hazmat suit.

1572
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,160
 - I'm gonna tell you.

1573
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,980
 I'm gonna tell you.

1574
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,820
 - Yeah.

1575
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,660
 - It's electrical tape.

1576
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,560
 - Do you give yourself a Brazilian when you take it off?

1577
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,000
 - Well, what you need is this thing,

1578
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,240
 the Marquina De Fita, the little tape mark,

1579
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,480
 and you go to a salon,

1580
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,320
 they will put literally tape a bikini onto you,

1581
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,480
 and they'll give you a little bit of fabric

1582
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,480
 for your nips and stuff like that.

1583
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,000
 - Of course, 'cause I was thinking like,

1584
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,560
 lead is the same as the swimming costume.

1585
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,700
 They all block it, but what you need is for your body

1586
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,700
 not to be able to shift underneath it at all.

1587
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,540
 Is that right?

1588
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,260
 - Exactly, so it's just that one bit of skin

1589
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,300
 that is covered with the fabric.

1590
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,820
 - So you could super glue your swimming costume

1591
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,820
 to yourself as well.

1592
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,500
 - Well, look, there are all sorts of roads to the answer.

1593
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,480
 Yes, but this is--

1594
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,380
 - But this is the biggie?

1595
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,980
 - There are salons where you just go

1596
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,260
 and people go up to the roof.

1597
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,260
 You pay about eight quid,

1598
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,980
 which includes a breakfast buffet.

1599
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,820
 - What?

1600
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,140
 - I would do this.

1601
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:46,980
 - Eight quid?

1602
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,460
 - I know how cheap that is, travel lunch.

1603
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,300
 - You're not gonna be--

1604
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,540
 - And they don't do anything to your nips.

1605
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,860
 - You're not gonna be beach body ready

1606
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,160
 after a full English.

1607
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,000
 (laughing)

1608
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,200
 - Yeah, and then people lie there

1609
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,520
 and they spray you with water every now and again

1610
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,240
 and that's how you get those incredibly crisp lines.

1611
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,800
 - Hey, sugar nips.

1612
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,320
 - Thank you, yes, sweetie possum, yes, go on.

1613
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,480
 Do you know what sugar nips are?

1614
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,400
 I read this today and I'd never heard it before.

1615
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,720
 - No, I thought it was just something,

1616
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,760
 how you used it just then.

1617
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,160
 - Me too, right?

1618
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,900
 So sugar nips were like a little pair of scissors

1619
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,040
 you would use.

1620
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,480
 And if you had a block of sugar in your house

1621
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,680
 or sugar loaf, they would call it.

1622
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,940
 In fact, sugar loaf mountain just outside Rio,

1623
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,300
 but you would have a sugar loaf on your table

1624
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,860
 and you would use your sugar nips

1625
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,500
 to nip off a little bit of sugar.

1626
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,340
 - That's incredible.

1627
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,180
 - Wow.

1628
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,020
 - Yeah, I'd never heard that before.

1629
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,020
 - That is a kind, that's 'cause you guys know

1630
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,540
 I like a rare bit of croqueries, cutlery.

1631
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,660
 - I'm surprised and disappointed

1632
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,700
 that you weren't familiar with them

1633
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,140
 and in fact don't own a pair, Andy.

1634
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,100
 - No, and I'm actually now regretting it

1635
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,900
 'cause I could have bought you some for your birthday.

1636
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,100
 - I'm gonna hop straight on eBay after this

1637
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,460
 to go with the asparagus tongs and the butter spade.

1638
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,580
 - Probably when you Google sugar nips.

1639
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,580
 (laughing)

1640
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,420
 - I'll take my chances.

1641
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,760
 - I'll take my chances.

1642
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,960
 (laughing)

1643
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,540
 (upbeat music)

1644
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:02,560
 - Okay, that is it.

1645
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,960
 That is all of our facts.
