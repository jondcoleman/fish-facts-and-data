 Hello, welcome to another episode of No Succeeding as a Fish. My name is Alex Bell.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 No, a weekly episode. No, what is it? A weekly podcast coming to you.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 You're doing real good.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Shut up. I'm hosting a weekly podcast from the offices of QI.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 For the QI offices in Covent Garden, my name is Alex Bell, and I'm joined by James Hawking,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Andrew Hunter-Marie and Anna Chisinski, and I forgot what happened next.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 This is once again, we are going to drown the microphone to share our favourite facts in the last seven days.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 In a particular order, here we go, starting with you, James.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 That was the flawless, I can't believe it.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Well, I would say flawless.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 It's so nice, you've given us outtakes for a year.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 See, we all think down is a complete idiot, but now I see how difficult that job is.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 It's not easy.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 You found respect for the man.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Okay, well, my fact this week is that in Japan, you can buy left-handed chopsticks.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Amazing.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 It's not amazing, because chopsticks are just a stick.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 How can they be left-handed?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 You would think they're just a stick, but I went to a shop in Nashiki Market, which is in Kyoto,

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 and they had a whole shop full of chopsticks, and if they were just sticks, I don't think they'd be able to do that.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I think you've been had.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Did you spend a lot of extra money on them?

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 No, because I'm not left-handed, so they weren't really for me.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 But they also had right-handed ones, which I also didn't buy.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 So what do they look like?

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 They look like chopsticks, but they're in a box that says left-handed.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I think you were.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 But there is a very, very important difference, and that is that the not-just sticks are slightly molded.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 And I put them on my social media to see if people could explain what was going on.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And our good friend, Karyad Lloyd, asked her friend, who I don't know, called @goome_thefutureisme,

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 and @goome_thefutureisme on Instagram, said that they are learning chopsticks for children.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And the way they're molded is where you put your fingers, so you always put your fingers in the right place.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And obviously, with left-handed people, that would be slightly different than right-handed people.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And so these are training chopsticks.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Wow.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Can you get training chopsticks that attach to each other as well?

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Yes, you would like a hinge in a spring.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Absolutely.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 So they're more like tweezers.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 You can get those as well.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 But these are ones to not just show you how to pick things up, but show you how to hold them correctly.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 So it's a bit like, you know, when you're at primary school, and if you're not very good at handwriting,

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 they put a big plastic thing on your pencil so that you can hold it better.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I don't know that.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Oh, I have one of those.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Like, it was like a little rubber thing, but I was left-handed.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Oh, where are you?

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I was at disadvantage anyway.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Oh, OK.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I'm left-handed too, but didn't get one of those.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 So actually half of this podcast are left-handed, because Adam's right-handed, I know.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I am, yes.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 We are not representative of the general population.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And that's a good example of where a small sample size can be very misleading.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 So the left-handed chopsticks are not for adults.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 They're just for kids, left-handed kids when they're learning, and they've got a little groove in them.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 That's as I understand it.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 If you know any different, then do message me on Twitter @JamesHarkin or on Instagram.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 No such thing as James Harkin.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And the pictures are on there, so you can just comment on it.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Because the chopsticks are brought to Japan from China, of course, weren't they?

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And I've existed in China for thousands of years, but weren't really used.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 We don't think for the actual process of eating, like we use an iPhone fork,

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 for the first couple of thousand years, they were just basically for reaching into boiling pots of water and oil,

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 and retrieving the food that's in them.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So they were used in the cooking process, like a tong or something.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 And they just really have a spoon to eat off or eat with their hands.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 It has to have been an amazing moment, where someone was just eating,

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 cooking with their spatula or equivalent, and then just started eating with it.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 It stays on the washing out, doesn't it?

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Yeah, it does.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 What really happened is that around 500 AD, there was a massive population boom in China,

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 and food became really scarce, and the way their cutstick was by cutting it in really small pieces,

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 and that kind of makes the kind of eating with chopsticks a good way of doing it.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I thought it was to do with people chopping up their food small,

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 so that it takes less cooking fuel to prepare.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Because of the population boom, there was much less fuel to go around,

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 you know, the fewer trees to chop up as fire with the stuff.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Yeah, it was partly that.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 So it was partly that.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 There's a really good book, though, called Chopsticks by a guy called Edward Wang.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 So he looks into this, and actually they started eating with chopsticks

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 using them, like as we use knives and folks, in about 400 BC.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 But it became very commonplace in 400 AD, and it's partly because of the population boom,

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 but also because oil became readily available.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And so that's when they started stir-frying stuff.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And so that's when I guess Chinese stir-frying came in as we would know it.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And obviously to stir fry, you need those little bits of meat.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And so then you don't need a knife anymore.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 But the other thing as well is, like you say, you would eat with a knife.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Before that, you would kind of stab things and eat it, right?

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And that was in Europe in the Middle Ages as well.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 But the other thing is, Confucius thought that you shouldn't eat with a knife

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 because a knife is something you would use in war or in aggression.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 So he thinks it shouldn't be something you should have around the table.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 So anyone who followed Confucianism also thought that you shouldn't eat with knives.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 So did you know you can get Japanese left-handed knives as well?

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Yeah, because European knives are traditionally symmetrical because they're obviously just sharp.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 But some Japanese like, they catch your knives, they're caught asymmetrically.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 So the cutting edge is supposed to be closer to the body.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 So it's like at an angle.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 So you need the left-handed knife.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Well, that's interesting.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 So it points towards you, you mean the cutting edge?

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Yes, yeah, exactly.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 You lean the knife slightly in towards you when you cook.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 When you cut.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And if you're left-handed, you can't really do that.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 It's a total match, you lose all your fingers.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 So many left-handed things are just, you know, not really necessary.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And I say this as a left-handed person, like left-handed scissors and all of this stuff.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Really?

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I think they're a big crock of whoy.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Really?

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Yeah, I do.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Because I can't cut with scissors with my left hand.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I agree, I can't do that either, I've tried and I can't.

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 When you cut with right-handed, you're not supposed to.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Yeah, but how do you cut with scissors with your right hand,

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 if we can't cut with right-handed scissors with your left hand?

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 You have my fingers into the holes that they're not supposed to fit into and it's fine.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Yeah, we used to have a coming up university.

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 You know what I guess?

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 You just learnt it in a hard way.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 It hurts, it bleeds every time I cut.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 I do it.

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 They do make a big old fuss lefties.

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Obviously not you, Andy.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Thank you for representing the other side.

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But, you know, about how difficult life is.

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And it basically all boils down to a can opener, doesn't it?

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 That's what they just say.

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I don't think we should be annoying the left-handed community

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 because science has shown that they are better at fighting than right-handers.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Oh, what? Because it's surprising.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Yeah, well that's basically it.

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Yeah, also we've got the left-handed scissors.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Yeah, but we've got way more right-handed scissors.

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 We've got way more weapons than you have.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 If it's a battle of can opener and scissors, our armoury is way better.

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 It would be like fighting your own clone,

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 like it's all expertly matched, but in opposite way.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 As soon as we have a left-handed gun, you guys will be in three.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 There is a left-handed gun.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 You can get left-handed guns.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 They're just guns in opposite, so because you also have a dominant eye, as well often.

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And so for people who are in the army and stuff,

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 if you have precision shooters, precision weapon,

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 I don't know what the verb is for when you shoot a gun, gun people.

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Like, you need to be...

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I think we're going to be winning this war, it's like so.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Said that in the gun people.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But the general one, though, the precision gun people.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Yeah, but it's all over reverse,

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 so that you can put your left eye on the sights.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 You want to be careful saying things like the left-handed gun is just a gun in reverse.

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 I don't think that's it.

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Encourage lefties to use it that way.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And I should just finish off the fighting thing.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 The reason that we think, no one's really sure,

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 but basically 90% of people are right-handed.

165
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 And so throughout history, people who have been fighting

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 have been more likely to come across a right-handed person,

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 so we're basically training ourselves to fight right-handed people.

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 So when a left-handed person comes along, it's much more difficult.

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Wow.

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And there was a study of the careers of 10,000 boxes and martial arts competitors

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 found that those who are left-handed do butch better.

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Wow.

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 But then, around this table,

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 you guys are much more lovers than fighters, aren't you?

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Yeah, I'd say that.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Oh, you haven't been to my left-handed fight club after work.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 You never taught that.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 We're always very, very hungry afterwards,

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 because now I can open the cans.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 So I thought I had invented something in the researching of this fact,

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 and it turns out I haven't.

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 But I do think it's a very good invention.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 So you know how you get a bowl of noodles,

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 and there'll be some soup with the noodles.

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 So normally you eat the noodles,

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 and then you have the soup left over,

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 and you have to lift the bowl up after it,

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 if you don't have a spoon, for example.

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I thought, what about a chopstick straw?

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Okay, so it's a hollow chopstick.

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And once you've finished eating the noodles,

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 you just drink the soup through the stalk and it's just a straw.

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 It's two straws.

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 I'll take you out to a Chinese restaurant,

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 and you can eat with two straws,

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 and we'll see how well you do.

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Because I think you're going to go hungry.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 So this guy called Julian Lackner has invented it,

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 and he has, shamefully, he has not followed it up.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 What's so he's invented one pair?

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 I think I don't know whether he's built a pair,

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 or whether it's just at the concept stage.

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 It wasn't the runaway massive success that you would anticipate.

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 I just think it's a way of making chopsticks lighter.

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 They use less material.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 They use millions of trees, don't they?

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Every year, there's some terrifying stat that China uses

208
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 3.8 million trees, making 57 billion pairs of chopsticks.

209
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Wow, that's huge.

210
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 In China, they used to eat with silver chopsticks,

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 and it was because they thought that silver would turn black

212
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 if it touched poison food.

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 So you could tell if your food was poisoned.

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 But actually, silver often turns black

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 when it comes into contact with hydrogen sulfide.

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And that's something that you get a lot in,

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 foods like garlic and onions and eggs.

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 So pretty much every time they cook with garlic and onions.

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 It's poison.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 It's good for vampires, though,

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 well, unless they stab themselves with it.

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 As you know, it's not a good vampire's.

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 What? No, it is, because you'd know if there's any garlic.

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Yeah, but also silver bullets kill them

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 and silver chopsticks will probably do some damage.

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 You'd have to be a clumsy, clumsy vampire.

227
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 stab yourself in the heart with a chopstick while eating it.

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 I love clumsies, but I've never done that.

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Yeah, but they're always eating their darks,

230
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 so they're at disadvantage.

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Actually, chopsticks can be used as weapons,

232
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 and I learned how to do this at ninja training a few weeks ago.

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Is it for the eye?

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Well, yeah, I guess you would aim for whatever.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Anything's a weapon who's sticking the eye.

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Well, yeah, I guess so.

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 But so ninjas would have, like, these throwing stars,

238
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 but they would more likely have a throwing stick,

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 and it would be kind of a small metal stick.

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 But if you didn't have a small metal stick,

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 you could do it with a chopstick.

242
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And they taught us how to throw it

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 so that it kind of goes into a target like a dagger.

244
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And this was apparently, as we spoke in about a while ago,

245
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 not all ninja things are possibly true,

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 but there's apparently ways that ninjas threw chopsticks.

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And did you succeed in embedding it in, well done.

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Yeah, I can tell you the trick is to keep your wrist cocked the whole time.

249
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Put the chopstick in between your first and second fingers,

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 so it's kind of in the gap between them.

251
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Have your wrist cocked,

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 put it up in the air, your hand,

253
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 and then go in an arc downwards,

254
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 and then let go at about, kind of, I guess, 40 degrees.

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And it just got, but you have, actually,

256
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 what you're doing there, Anna, is you're kind of flicking at the end,

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 but you don't flick, you have to keep your wrist cocked the whole time.

258
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 So sorry, wrist cocked the whole time, got it?

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Yeah.

260
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Absolutely amazing.

261
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I feel like I hit the ground with that one.

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 It looks like you've just been taught how to do air quotes,

263
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 but you're really struggling to execute them.

264
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 It looks like you're all out for dinner and we're desperate for the bill.

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Well, that's really useful to know, thanks James.

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Although then you don't have anything to eat with afterwards.

267
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Quite right.

268
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I'm shame.

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 This is, I thought this was really interesting.

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Disney princesses are a good target group for working out the correct ratio

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 of left to right-handed people in the real world,

272
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 because there are 12 official Disney princesses and one of them is left-handed.

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 So that mirrors real life.

274
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Wow.

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Right, so, sorry, how is this useful ever?

276
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 It's not useful.

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 I just thought that was interesting.

278
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Like Muppets on the other hand didn't eat all left-handed,

279
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 because their operators are right-handed.

280
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 So their right-handed is up the Muppet in the head,

281
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 operating the head, and then the left-hand is operating the left-hand of the Muppet.

282
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Just as a point of order, which Disney princesses are left-handed?

283
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 It's Tiana.

284
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Who's that?

285
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 The one from the princess and the frog.

286
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 She's not one of the main ones, is she?

287
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 They really made a bit of a runner-up princess, the lefty.

288
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Which I think is the right choice.

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 In China, less than 1% of people are left-handed.

290
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Really?

291
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 What?

292
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 No.

293
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 According to Chinese people.

294
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Why?

295
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 No, it's because they're suppressed.

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 It must be.

297
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Yeah, so it's not biologically speaking.

298
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 But in China claims that less than 1% of its students are left-handed.

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 The global average, as you say, is 10 to 12%.

300
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 As you can tell by watching 12 Disney films in a row.

301
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And it's actually because people tend to have to switch their dominant hand in China.

302
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 A lot of people say because the characters can't be written left-handed.

303
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 But I was reading a blog by a woman who's lived in China for decades,

304
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 and she was saying that she'll go around and say, "I'm left-handed."

305
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And people will say, "There are no left-handed people in China, you know."

306
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And she'll say, "What are you talking about? Of course there are."

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 And she'll demonstrate that you can write Chinese characters with your left hand.

308
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 But people will look at her and say, "No, it's wrong. It's done with the left hand.

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 It can't be done."

310
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Wow.

311
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 That's amazing.

312
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Do they pretend they can't read what she's written?

313
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I don't think they go quite that far.

314
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 They just say, "It looks gross."

315
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Wow.

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Wow.

317
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 You know the musical composition chopsticks.

318
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 That was written in 1877 by a girl, 60-year-old girl called Euphemia Allen,

319
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 and her brother was called Mozart Allen.

320
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 No way.

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 No way.

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 So weird.

323
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And once again, the brother got the musical talent changed, didn't he?

324
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Well, I think she got the musical talent, but they hoped that the brother had.

325
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Because he was called, that parents called him Mozart, obviously hoping he would be some great musician.

326
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But actually, the daughter managed to write this composition, which is now probably one of the most played.

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 It's ubiquitous.

328
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 It's not necessarily great.

329
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 It's the baby shark of piano, really, isn't it?

330
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 No, don't you bring the baby shark.

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Is it called chopsticks because it's kind of like you could play it with chopsticks?

332
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 No.

333
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Well, kind of.

334
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 The reason is that when you play it, it's like two notes that are next to each other and you move outwards, don't you?

335
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 So it's like, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did. Like that. But you're not supposed to play it with your fingers. You're supposed to turn your hands sideways and then play it as if you're chopping something. And that's how you're supposed to play chopsticks. And that's why it's called chopsticks.

336
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 So we've all been playing it wrong.

337
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Yeah. So you turn your hands 90 degrees so that your thumbs are facing the air and you play it with your little fingers.

338
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 You karate your piano.

339
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Exactly. Yeah.

340
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Cool. Isn't that cool?

341
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 I want to hear some stupid chopstick records. Yes, please.

342
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Okay. So the most marbles moved with chopsticks in one minute is 43.

343
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And that was broken, not by someone from China or Japan, but by an Italian man called Silvio Saber.

344
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And then a few years after that record was made, a Japanese man called Mr. Cherry tried to break the record.

345
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 For most marbles moved in one minute with chopsticks. And he didn't, he exactly equaled it.

346
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Wow.

347
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 But he did get the record for the most baked beans eaten with chopsticks in one minute.

348
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Yeah.

349
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 20 roundabouts.

350
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Sorry. Actually, what was that? What was that record?

351
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 That was 71. That's more than one per second for a minute.

352
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And that's more than I can do.

353
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Yeah, but I think I guess only if, like, I'm sure there would be a way of building up like some kind of sluice

354
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 where you just turn the chopsticks into a shoot and you pour the baked beans down it.

355
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Sure. That's amazing.

356
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Like some sort of like propeller where it scooped them up when you just spin it around.

357
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Exactly.

358
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 I think you probably, the rules say that you have to pick them up in traditional chopstick fashion.

359
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Although there is, they would enjoy those baked beans more because there's been a study that finds that you would,

360
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 you enjoy food more if you eat it with chopsticks.

361
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 This is specifically with popcorn and specifically in one study of 68 participants, but give me out.

362
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Basically, the idea is because you can only eat one at a time or one thing at a time.

363
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 It's almost like, let's say you're eating something else like alpha betty spaghetti or something.

364
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 When you have the first spoonful, it's really tasty, right? It's like that's so good.

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 But then by the time you're halfway through it, you've kind of even forgotten that you're eating alpha betty spaghetti, aren't you?

366
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 You're just eating it then.

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Sure.

368
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 But if it's really hard to get that food to your mouth every time, then each time you're kind of building up to the mouthful.

369
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Yeah, I see that.

370
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I have that when I eat with chopsticks, basically.

371
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 If you're so cack-handed that you're just enormously relieved that you've managed to get that one bean into your mouth, it is more enjoyable.

372
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 How did the world record attempt go in the end?

373
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Wow, so it's kind of novel as well.

374
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Yeah, it's just an unusual...

375
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 That's exactly true.

376
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Because whenever anything seems new, people pay more attention to it.

377
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And when you're eating it more slowly, each mouthful appears more new than if you're shoveling it in.

378
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 If you look astonished every time, that's like bean goes in.

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Oh my god, what is this?

380
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 So I think I wrote about this experiment because there was another way they tried it.

381
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 And this was asking people to drink water, but to come up with their own fun ways of drinking water.

382
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 So, they... some people drank it normally.

383
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And then afterwards, they were all right on their enjoyment of the experience.

384
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 So some people drank it normally, and I guess just gave it five hours ago.

385
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 What were the other ways that they did it?

386
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Well, I only have written a couple down.

387
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 One was drinking it from a martini glass.

388
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Which is fun, I think.

389
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 You know, anything from a martini glass fun.

390
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Another person drank it out of a shipping envelope.

391
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And they have a whale on their side.

392
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 They love it. I can imagine you coming up to this study with a pair of chopsticks.

393
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And there was like, "Can't drink water with chopsticks."

394
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And you're like, "Aha!"

395
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 You weren't counting on my sluice.

396
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

397
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 My fact this week is that.

398
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Sorry, can I just...

399
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Down often does that okay with a little bit more vim?

400
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Just give it one more try.

401
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

402
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Too much, too much.

403
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 You can't please all the people of the time.

404
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Sorry, what was your fact?

405
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 My fact this week is that the fact machine is older than the telephone.

406
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Wow.

407
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Okay, the fax machine.

408
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 It's a fax about fax.

409
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 That's a fax about fax.

410
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 So the telephone was what, early 20th century?

411
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 It was not like that in century.

412
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Yeah, late 19th century.

413
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 So you're saying that the fax machine was from the 19th century?

414
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Well, the first patent was in 1843 for an electric printing telegraph.

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And it was actually another Scottish inventor called Alexander Bain.

416
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 So quite similar to Alexander Bain, one of the inventors of the telephone.

417
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And he was actually a clockmaker, and he invented this device.

418
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 It was also called a fax simling machine.

419
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 There were various different versions.

420
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And it involved synchronized pendulum.

421
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 So you can see where the clock is going to come in.

422
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 And the message line by line, conversed it to electrical signals, sent them down some wires,

423
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 and then reproduced it at the other end, using electromagnetically sensitive paper

424
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 that had this kind of chemical imbued in it.

425
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 The first version wasn't very good because there were all sorts of synchronization problems.

426
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 And then he improved it between 1843 and 1846.

427
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 But then he was beaten to it when he tried to repassent the improved version,

428
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 because a rival had gotten the way and demonstrated a much more accurate version.

429
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And it was just the synchronization of the pendulums that he could never get right,

430
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 because it was really difficult to get to swing.

431
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Because it's swinging left to right across the page of the exact time.

432
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 So it's almost like an inkjet printer kind of doing dots along a line.

433
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Wow, that's very tricky.

434
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And very cleverly.

435
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 All the paper that you need to be receiving the electrical current.

436
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 It needs to turn black whenever it receives a current.

437
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 So it needs to be soaked in potassium ferrocyanide.

438
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Was that kind of toxic?

439
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Sounds like it was cyanide.

440
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Like every time you get a fax, you basically died.

441
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 I mean, I thought that was probably why I didn't work.

442
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 No, I don't think it was, I don't think it was lethal either.

443
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 I think you should not eat too much of it.

444
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 So this?

445
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 But then he was the pioneer.

446
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 But then I think the first really usable one was in 1860, which is still so long ago.

447
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And it was an Italian called Casselli.

448
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And you would write your message on a piece of tin.

449
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And you would write a non-conductive ink.

450
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And then the sheet was scanned by a stylus.

451
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 And that was attached to telegraph wires going to the other place.

452
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And then whenever the stylus at the other end got to a bit of ink, the conduction would stop.

453
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And then at the receiving end, whenever the conduction stops, the stylus there would stop.

454
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And so you'd make a kind of perfect mirror image of it.

455
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Oh, okay.

456
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 So it's actually the same.

457
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It's a bit in reverse because it's the drawing that's non-conductive.

458
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Yeah.

459
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I think I've explained that right.

460
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 But it was demonstrated for Napoleon III.

461
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 I think that's amazing.

462
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 The Napoleon III had a fax machine.

463
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Unbelievable.

464
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Unbelievable.

465
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And he said this is incredible.

466
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 He got sent the signature of the composer Rossini from a hundred miles away by fax.

467
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Wow.

468
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 That is amazing.

469
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And it didn't catch on, did it?

470
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 The idea with the fax machine, I think, is that they weren't in the information age yet.

471
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So business just worked too slowly.

472
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 So I think was that one between Paris and Lyon and Paris and Marseille.

473
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 They set those ones up.

474
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And there just wasn't really any interest in it.

475
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 It was a gimmick.

476
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Yeah, it was a gimmick.

477
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 This is not what it captured on.

478
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 There's lots of public demonstrations on it and stuff and everyone was like, wow, no practical applications.

479
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 The Russians are, had one.

480
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Nicholas I.

481
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Wow.

482
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Between his palaces at Moscow and Petersburg, there was a fax connection.

483
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Wow.

484
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 It's so weird.

485
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And so I'm sure you guys came across this in your research.

486
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 You know, who's the biggest buyer of fax machines in the world?

487
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Is it career?

488
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 It's the NHS.

489
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 It's the NHS.

490
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 It's not the career, it's the NHS.

491
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Yeah.

492
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 And they have at least 8,000 machines across the NHS, just in Britain.

493
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And I asked a friend of mine, who's a doctor, just out of interest.

494
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 He works down on South Coast.

495
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And I said, do you use fax?

496
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 I said he sends at least one or two every day.

497
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Oh yeah, they use them all the time.

498
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 They're banned from doing it now.

499
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 So they're no longer the biggest buyer.

500
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 They're banned from buying anymore.

501
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 They haven't been banned from using them.

502
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 No, but as in they're not the biggest buyer anymore because the government's finally said,

503
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 you are not allowed to buy all the bloody fax machines.

504
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 It's ridiculous.

505
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 When I used to work as an accountant, we used to use faxes like,

506
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 like you say, not two times a day, maybe 10 times a day.

507
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And they're a really good way of getting kind of invices across.

508
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 It's useful for sending secure information, I believe.

509
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Yeah.

510
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And there is a secure email, but it's a bit of a pain.

511
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And yeah.

512
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 I feel like you can ring faxes for no reason at all.

513
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 And you just get a weird noise.

514
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 I just think that's a totally unnecessary use.

515
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Is that how you spend your evening?

516
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 No, I just, I've never used actually fax with a fax machine.

517
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 But I do routine the acts any ring people's fax and others.

518
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 You've never sent a fax.

519
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 No, I don't think I've ever sent a fax.

520
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 What?

521
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 But to be fair, I'm not a doctor.

522
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 That is insane.

523
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Well, sorry, I had to say, I had to do it for my work.

524
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 What, you just do it like asking your friends if you go to the shop.

525
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 So whatever.

526
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 I work a lot when I was younger.

527
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And also me, my friend used to send faxes to each other after school.

528
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 That's what I mean.

529
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 I don't think anyone's ever apart from you said faxes for a social reason.

530
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Wow, what did you say in your faxes?

531
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 So I remember she once sent me a fax of the newspaper article in her local area,

532
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 which on the headline was her dog getting married to another dog.

533
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 This is an incredible insight into your early life.

534
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 This is like an analogue version of Buzzfeed that you invented there.

535
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 It is a pretty huge moment in our childhood, actually.

536
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Wow.

537
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Are the dogs still together?

538
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Are they happy?

539
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 They had a lovely long life together, but I'm afraid sadly they have expired because it was 25 years ago.

540
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Which in dog ears?

541
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 This is our 175th wedding anniversary.

542
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Oh, I had a fact about wedding anniversary, which is through this fax research,

543
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 which is, this is not really fax related, but you can request anniversary greetings from the White House.

544
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 What?

545
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 If you are a US citizen and if you contact them several months ahead.

546
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 But Trump's not sending them, is they?

547
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 I can imagine his faxes in the massive capital, but it's not wetters.

548
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 He does faxes, he's saying no collusion.

549
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 It's kind of weird.

550
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I think you can request presidential greetings.

551
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And they sent, you know, poor drone in the White House has to send you presidential greetings.

552
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 But they made it clear, you can only request a limited number of greetings per day.

553
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Which I think is a very funny idea.

554
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Obviously, somebody at some point received about 100 different greetings on the same wedding anniversary.

555
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 I just love the idea of keeping Trump busy by setting them up.

556
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Sorry, Mr. President Barack Obama used to get through 20 a day.

557
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Well, with the Queen, she's got almost no political power.

558
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 She has to write cards to every 100 euro in the country.

559
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 It's something really cool you can do with fax paper if you've got any left over.

560
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 From the 90s.

561
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 From your friend's dog wedding.

562
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 So this is if you use a thermal fax machine.

563
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 And fax paper would be thermal paper.

564
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 You use those in the winter, don't you?

565
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 No, fax, so if you're using a thermal fax machine, then the paper turns black when it's exposed to heat.

566
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 So there's a specially chemically treated.

567
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And basically what a fax machine would do, how it would work is it would only heat up the parts that were meant to be written on.

568
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 So it's bits would turn black.

569
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 But what you can do is you can just get some fax paper.

570
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 All this also works on receipt paper because they still use that for that.

571
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And heat it up.

572
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 And it'll turn black.

573
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 I was expecting another part to that, like some useful life hack.

574
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Like, well, yeah, what's that for?

575
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Well, if you've only got a white crayon.

576
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 And you need to write something a message immediately.

577
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 You need black paper to write it up.

578
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 That's true.

579
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 So why don't you heat your thermal fax machines roll of paper?

580
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Oh, if you're going to a fancy dress as a zebra, you can heat up one roll of receipt paper.

581
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Don't heat up the other one.

582
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And just wrap them around you like a mummy.

583
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Perfect.

584
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Instant zebra costume.

585
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 It's a multi-purpose life hack.

586
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Sorry, hang on.

587
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Is that how the receipts work in old-tone machines?

588
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Is that they've selectively heated up the paper?

589
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Not in the really old ones, I don't think.

590
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 I think quite a lot of them are still in use.

591
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 That's amazing.

592
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 They're slightly waxy at the paper, I think.

593
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 And they're a bit more transparent.

594
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And if you do heat them up, yeah, they go.

595
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 So it's quite a way of redacting things as well.

596
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Because if you heat it up, then obviously eat all of the work.

597
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 But does it when you cool down?

598
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Does it not go back to normal?

599
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I don't think so, because I'll always, as soon as the receipt came out of the thing,

600
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 you'd have to be given a blank receipt.

601
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Quite like that.

602
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 It was momentarily written on the record and what you bought.

603
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 I'm talking to my taxman, I'm really sorry.

604
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 All these receipts said stuff when I got them.

605
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 I don't know what's happened to them all.

606
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 You'll have to trust me.

607
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Can I tell you my favourite ever fax machine fax?

608
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 I actually went to Georgia or Bank to find so.

609
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 So in 1966, the Russians landed the Luna 9 craft on the moon,

610
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 which was the first craft to successfully achieve a soft landing in land without crashing.

611
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And it was designed to take the first photographs on the moon.

612
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And it was basically a contraption that had a camera with a film in it.

613
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 So take the photos and then the machine would take the film out of the camera

614
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 and develop the photographs and then put the photographs into a little fax machine,

615
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 basically, and then transmit the photos back to Earth.

616
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 This is all on the moon.

617
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 All of the moon in a little craft, yeah.

618
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And the Russians were broadcasting it back to Earth.

619
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And the British were monitoring all of the landing and everything

620
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 and all of the signals from Georgia or Bank.

621
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And then they noticed that when it landed and all of this stuff happened,

622
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 we didn't know what was going on because the Russians didn't tell anyone anything.

623
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 That the signal had changed and they recognised it as being a standard signal

624
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 from something called radio fax, which was a standard way of transmitting photos

625
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 by a kind of fax machine, the kind of system around the world

626
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 that was used in journalism.

627
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 And so they very quickly realised that they could interpret the signal.

628
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 So they rang up the offices of the Daily Express in Manchester and said,

629
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 "Look, do you have a radio fax receiving a machine that we can borrow?"

630
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 And they said, "Yes."

631
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 So they stuck in a car and raced it over to Georgia or Bank

632
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 and managed to get these transmitted photos and print it out

633
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 and they got the first photos of the moon on the surface of the moon.

634
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And they then published them on the front cover of the Daily Express

635
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 before the Russians had even released them.

636
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 We actually hacked the first fax from the moon.

637
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 That is amazing.

638
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 But what was the greatest surprise?

639
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Bernard Lovell, after whom the Lovell telescope is now named,

640
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 was annoyed because the Russian photographs were calibrated

641
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 for a slightly different size of paper from what we had.

642
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So it's slightly distorted the photographs.

643
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And he was really annoyed because he thought that everyone

644
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 would think his telescope was a bit shit.

645
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Well, there are disadvantages to theft of property, aren't you?

646
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Okay, it is time for fax number three and that is Anna.

647
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 My fact this week is that a boatload of researchers are about

648
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 to deliberately get themselves stuck in the Arctic ice for a year.

649
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 And for fun and science.

650
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 For fun? I think it's for work.

651
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 It's fun and science, guys.

652
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Science is fun, isn't it?

653
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Yeah, the two are not mutually exclusive.

654
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 I reckon in this case they are.

655
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Like, you're spending a whole winter in the Arctic.

656
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 You're talking to someone who faxed their friends for fun in their childhood.

657
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Yeah, exactly.

658
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 No, man, these guys are going to have the best times.

659
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 They're going to eat one of those thermal fax machines.

660
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 So this is a project called the multi-disciplinary drifting observatory

661
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 for the study of Arctic climate, shortened to mosaic.

662
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And hundreds of researchers from 19 countries are involved.

663
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 It's the largest Arctic expedition in history.

664
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And it's all about data collection in the Arctic.

665
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 So just gathering as much as they can from the ocean, from the ice, from the atmosphere,

666
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 about the climate, the algae, all the chemistry of it

667
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 to basically work out how climate change is affecting the Arctic.

668
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And they're doing it by going on this big, well, they've just arrived, actually.

669
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 So there's this 400-foot-long ice-breaker ship called Polar Stern,

670
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 which left Norway a few weeks ago.

671
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And it is now about to freeze itself into this little,

672
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 a bit less than two-mile square bit of ice.

673
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And then it's just going to let that bit of ice carry it through the North Pole.

674
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 So amazing.

675
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 It is amazing.

676
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 I read that on Monday, the sun set were the boaters.

677
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 And so it's set and it's not going to return for 153 days.

678
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 That's a long night.

679
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Yeah.

680
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Okay, fine, so that bit's not that fun.

681
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And they can't, because obviously they're going to be locked in the ice.

682
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 So they can't really control where they go, can they?

683
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 No.

684
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 So I read that they have to be a bit careful because there's a risk

685
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 that the ice will drift them into the Russian economic zone.

686
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And if they go in there against their will,

687
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 they don't have permission to do carry out research there.

688
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 So they've had to select the bit they've locked themselves into quite carefully

689
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 where they think they'll stay in sort of international territory.

690
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 I bet they'll end up there and they'll be like,

691
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 "Oh, no, we can't do any research."

692
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 "We just have to sit and drink all the time."

693
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 It must have been fun selecting the flow

694
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 where they're going to embed themselves,

695
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 because they had 15 candidates.

696
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And they just had to narrow it down.

697
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 And they have to work out, as you say, you have to predict where you think it's going to go.

698
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 So they've picked this one that's the perfect depth.

699
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 So it needs to be deep enough that it can really lock you in place.

700
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And it needs to be deep enough that planes can land on it, hopefully, in winter,

701
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 which is what they're intending, how they're going to resupply themselves.

702
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 At the moment, it's 350 miles from the north pole.

703
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 And they, you know, need to work out the direction it's sort of travelling in.

704
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And they want to drift right past the pole, because obviously that's the big money.

705
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Wow.

706
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And they will be resupplied.

707
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 And they're having an article on Mashable that said they will resupply with provisions

708
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 and rotating scientists.

709
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 [laughter]

710
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 I see one of those in a cabab show.

711
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 [laughter]

712
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 But actually, their scientists from all around the world

713
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 and they're going to come and stay for a little bit of time and then go away again.

714
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 I think that's the idea.

715
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Yeah, I think most have signed up for two months.

716
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I think a couple of people are going to do the whole thing.

717
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Although that's pretty hardy.

718
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 If I need some vitamin D pills, you could say that these guys are going to go with the flow.

719
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Yeah.

720
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 I bet they're not saying that though.

721
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Oh, I bet it's painted on the side of the body.

722
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Of course it is.

723
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 I bet there's an embargo on saying that right.

724
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 It's two days here.

725
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 It's really cool.

726
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 They're divided into these different sections into what they call cities.

727
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 So if you go to their website, it's kind of like at a theme park.

728
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 You know, you've got the different zones.

729
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 So essentially, the ship will be stuck in the flow.

730
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And then they're going to spread out onto the ice all around it to set up their various cities.

731
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Like I city, which sounds like it's going to be a lot of it.

732
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 But I city is basically the patch of ice on which the ice researchers will work.

733
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 And that's they'll pick up bits of ice and study it.

734
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 They've got ocean city and that's where the oceanic researchers drill a hole in the ocean.

735
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 And then they pick up water.

736
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 No, they don't have any ice.

737
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 There's drillers of work in here.

738
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Every time I make a hole, it fills back in.

739
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 This is why I was fired from the project.

740
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 They drill a hole in the ice.

741
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 And then they retrieve the ocean water.

742
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And what they have to do in ocean city is set up a tent over the hole.

743
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 And that's because they need to keep that a bit warm.

744
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Because otherwise, if you pull the ocean water up to where you are, it immediately freezes.

745
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 And then you've just got ice again.

746
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 That's how you do winter fishing in Russia.

747
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Yeah, every winter, if you go to the Moscow River, you'll just see loads of little tents.

748
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 And basically, it's just like men in their little tent doing fishing with a bottle of vodka.

749
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And that's what they do.

750
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 These guys on the Arctic as well.

751
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 There are loads of problems that they have, obviously, because it's a very, very challenging environment.

752
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 So they're going to have guards who are wearing night vision goggles who are constantly looking out for polar bears.

753
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 And every research station on the ice has to have a two mile radius around it

754
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 with the perimeter fence, which is monitored for polar bear activity.

755
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 And they've got guns.

756
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 But before that, they obviously don't want to shoot polar bears.

757
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 It's not what they're about.

758
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 For opening fire, they will honk the horn of the ship to try to get off.

759
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 And then they will use a flare gun just up in the air to alarm it.

760
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 And then finally, they've got a pepper spray to try and deter it.

761
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 I think you have to have considerable friends of mine.

762
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 You have to wait until it has really close to you.

763
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 The next thing is you poke it and it's nose.

764
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 That doesn't work.

765
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 You bring out the throwing chopsticks.

766
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Have you tried reasoning with it?

767
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Yeah, it's cool.

768
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 They're also setting up tripwires for the polar bears themselves around.

769
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 So when a polar bear crosses one of the tripwires, it sends up a big loudfare.

770
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Sounds like home alone with polar bears.

771
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Yeah.

772
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 I found out about another experiment that's being done on the Arctic at the moment.

773
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 So scientists need to study how organic matter decays in the soil.

774
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And that varies by the soil temperature and moisture and acidity and all of this stuff.

775
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 So they have to sew bags of material, organic matter, to decay.

776
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 That's the test subject.

777
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 So lots of leaves and things like this go into the matter and then they bury that.

778
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And then a couple of scientists, they had spent weeks laboriously sewing

779
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 litter bags full of leaves and then sealing them up to be buried.

780
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 And then one of the scientists was having a cup of tea and she realised, oh my god,

781
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 we have bags full of leaves that can be buried under that.

782
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 And I made to an almost exact uniformity standard.

783
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 So at least 1,200 groups across the world are doing citizen science using tea bags now.

784
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 And there are 5,000 tea bags just buried under the Arctic.

785
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Really?

786
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 That's an advantage of global warming, isn't it?

787
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Well, it melts, you've got a nice cup of tea.

788
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 It can be very weak.

789
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 That's really cool.

790
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Can we talk about making a knife out of your own poo?

791
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Yeah.

792
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Yeah, we better.

793
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 We speak yours.

794
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 So, Wade Davis, the famous traveller and writer, he wrote about an inuit man who once sculpted his own frozen poo into a knife and used it to kill a dog.

795
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And people are kind of taking this as truth that it might have happened.

796
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 But this year, for the first time, scientists have properly tried it out by making knives out of their own excrement.

797
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 And they found that it wouldn't have worked.

798
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 It wouldn't have been able to cut into a piece of pig hide.

799
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 They said, like a crayon, it just left brown streaks on the meat.

800
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 No slices at all.

801
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 If I was working in that lab, that's the point of which I put in a complaint to you guys on this.

802
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 I kind of poo in the freezer.

803
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 And this is a proper experiment.

804
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 So, first of all, before they even had the poo, they adopted an Arctic diet which was high in protein to ensure that their poo would have the same consistency as the inuit people.

805
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 That's cool.

806
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 That's so clever.

807
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 I was interested because I read somewhere that people escaped from prison by making shifts out of prison poo, so it can't be true.

808
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 It's not true. It's urban myth.

809
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 Most prisoners don't have access to freezers, though, do they?

810
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 I don't know.

811
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 They're like in lower security prisons, maybe.

812
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 I don't know.

813
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 You have to ask the chef and they do ask questions when you approach them with a bag of your own feet.

814
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 You can say, "Would you mind putting this in the freezer?"

815
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 If it was very cold outside, you might be able to dangle the poo out of a window and wait for it to freeze overnight.

816
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Like the way you keep the milk fresh, if your fridge is on the blow.

817
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 I just think there are easier ways to make shifts.

818
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 There must be.

819
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 Yeah, you're in a place full of metal.

820
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 There are like bars everywhere.

821
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 Yeah, you're right.

822
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 So, I've got, I thought of a question about the poo knife experiment.

823
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Oh, how did they manufacture it into a knife?

824
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 How did they mould it?

825
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Was that in the ejection?

826
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 You have to sort of clench and release at the right moments.

827
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 It was going to shake exactly right.

828
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 What a skill that would be.

829
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 What an edd and bristle.

830
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 I will now be pooing this sculpture of Michelangelo's David.

831
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 Is that the next balloon sculpture magician trick?

832
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 I imagine that they just cut it into shape.

833
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 Did they make a standard symmetrical European knife or a left hand exactly?

834
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 Wow, and it doesn't work.

835
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 It doesn't work.

836
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 It just leaves it real streaks on the meat.

837
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Another really cool art to experiment that's happening is to deal with climate change.

838
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 And so, that's a problem with the Arctic, which is heating up faster than the rest of the world.

839
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 So, it's really bad.

840
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Ice is all melting and there have been sort of three main proposals.

841
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 People are thinking about for us to geoengineer it so that this problem is solved.

842
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 One of them is just re-freeze it.

843
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 They're thinking.

844
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Try and re-freeze the ice.

845
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Just re-freeze it like a big poo.

846
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 So, the plan is to put 10 million windmills there.

847
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 And they will power these water pumps.

848
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 And what the water pumps do is they suck up the seawater from underneath the ice.

849
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 And then they spray it out on top of the ice during the winter and then it freezes.

850
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 And so that restocks it with ice.

851
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 How about a doctor evil plan?

852
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 10 million windmills.

853
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 Where the bonkers?

854
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 I mean, presumably the windmills have to use less energy than they pump out.

855
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 Well, they're getting free energy from the wind, I guess.

856
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Yeah.

857
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Okay, sorry.

858
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Yeah.

859
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 No, that's how they work.

860
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 That's how windmills work.

861
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 So, you don't plug them in.

862
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 That's why my windmill has been so expensive to run.

863
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Another idea that they had is you basically get a submarine.

864
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 And this is an idea, sorry, by a 29-year-old architect called Faris Kota Hatohaha.

865
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 And he says, are you laughing at me?

866
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 No, it's not laughing at his name, that's his name.

867
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 Anyway, his name isn't important in the story.

868
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 He is going to get this submersible vessel.

869
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 And what you would do is you would get a load of water from the sea in it.

870
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 And then you would somehow suck all of the salt out of the seawater, which then makes it freeze.

871
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 So you suck out the salt, it freezes because it's cold down there.

872
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 And then it floats to the surface and you're making icebergs.

873
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 That's really good.

874
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 Isn't that clever?

875
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 How are you sucking the salt out, sorry?

876
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 I said.

877
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 I don't know if you heard.

878
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 I said nothing.

879
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 I don't think I can be more clear than that.

880
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 It's an almost foolproof plan.

881
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 How are you going to fix the Irish border?

882
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 I'm so sorry.

883
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 I clearly wasn't listening.

884
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 And this ship that's getting frozen in is an icebreaker, isn't it?

885
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Yeah.

886
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 And we should just say how amazing icebreakers are.

887
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 I mean, they're very, very powerful things.

888
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 And then what shape would you get there would be at the front?

889
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 Triangular.

890
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Yeah, pointy.

891
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 Pointy?

892
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 Yeah, that's what I meant.

893
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Like a poo knife.

894
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Right, like a poo knife.

895
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 They're not pointy.

896
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 They're shaped like the backs of spoons at the front.

897
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Really weird.

898
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 So when they hit the ice, they ride up onto it.

899
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 And then the massive weight of the vessel just crushes it down.

900
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Wow.

901
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Yeah.

902
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 So Russia's biggest icebreaker is called 50 years of victory.

903
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And it's powered by a great name.

904
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Always humble, aren't they?

905
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 We would cause us 40 years of hurt.

906
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Yeah.

907
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 And it's powered by not one but two nuclear reactors.

908
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 So it's extremely impressive.

909
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 And the reason it's nuclear is because otherwise it would

910
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 expand more than 100 tons of diesel every day.

911
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 So, I mean, it would just have no range.

912
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 It wouldn't be able to get me away.

913
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Yeah.

914
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 And it needs to be in cold waters then because I was reading out how the nuclear engines,

915
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 the cooling system, depends upon the ice level.

916
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Okay.

917
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 So you couldn't sail into warm waters because it would overheat.

918
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Right, right, right.

919
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 So it's literally built.

920
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 It needs the ice as much as the way the ice doesn't need it.

921
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

922
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 I like that.

923
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 And it's hopeless in open water as well.

924
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 They roll from side to side all the time.

925
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 Because of this spoon shaped bow.

926
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 So some are being built now which are reversey per se as they can go forwards and backwards.

927
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 That's so clever.

928
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 So they've got a pointy back end.

929
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 And then a spoon shaped front end.

930
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 And if they're ever sailing in open water, they just sail backwards using their pointy bow

931
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 because that gets through the water very nicely.

932
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 Great.

933
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 But if you're up, do they have two steering wheels?

934
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 I imagine.

935
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 You've got a nuclear power.

936
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

937
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 I imagine that.

938
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 It's just looking like you're turning around.

939
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 All the way back.

940
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 I said, look over there shoulder the whole way.

941
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 Yeah.

942
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 Terrible quick neck.

943
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 Yeah.

944
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact.

945
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 And that is Andy.

946
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 My fact is that Leo Tolstoy, one of the greatest writers of history,

947
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 frequently wore two hats in case his head got cold.

948
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 No.

949
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 What a guy.

950
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 This is from someone called Mariana Hunt, who sent me this fact.

951
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 So thank you to you, Mariana.

952
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 And it's just that Tolstoy was very sensitive to head cold.

953
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 So he wore multiple hats.

954
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 He literally wore multiple hats.

955
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 Cold in Russia.

956
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 We've already established that.

957
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 It's cold in Russia.

958
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 And the hats were nuclear powered.

959
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 So amazing.

960
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 Did he have like a reversey person hat that he was walking backwards?

961
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Were they two of the same type of hat or was it like a top hat and then a tiny...

962
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Pull out.

963
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 Top of that or...

964
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 I am not sure the history relates.

965
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Tregically.

966
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 I don't know if it was like a fuzz followed by a fedora or...

967
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 Yeah, so I don't know.

968
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 Because he could have just bought a thicker hat in Russia.

969
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 You know, you often get these big bearskin things.

970
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 Yeah, famously with the flaps.

971
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 With the flaps.

972
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 With the flaps, of course.

973
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 Yeah.

974
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 But he didn't.

975
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Not that smart.

976
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Turns out.

977
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 No.

978
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 No, thickly Tolstoy we call him.

979
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 We call him Leo Tolstoy.

980
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 But his name was Lev Holiev.

981
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 And the reason that we do that is because Lev means lion in Russian.

982
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 And when he brought out his book in France, they translated his name as Leon Tolstoy.

983
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 Really?

984
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 Because that means lion.

985
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 Yeah.

986
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 And he kind of gave his blessing to that.

987
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 And when he gave his blessing, it meant that everyone else could kind of go in that direction.

988
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 And so when it came into England, it was anglicised to Leo, which also means lion.

989
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 Right.

990
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 Do we know if everyone does that?

991
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 Like, in Kenya, are they calling him Simba Tolstoy?

992
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 That would be amazing, wouldn't it?

993
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 I can't remember if that's what he leave a lion.

994
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 There's one of...

995
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 One of the ones in Italy.

996
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 There's a sheep lion, isn't it?

997
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 Yeah.

998
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 That's so funny.

999
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 I was looking at the...

1000
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 So apparently the Russian word for peace is mute.

1001
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 Yeah.

1002
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 So that can also mean like world or society.

1003
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 It can mean like a place where people...

1004
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Like a community.

1005
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 Right, yeah.

1006
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 But there was an argument about how you could translate the title of War and Peace to War and the World.

1007
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 Which I prefer as a kind of sex in the city vibe.

1008
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 Well, one of its provisional titles, it went through a couple of titles before he settled on War and the World.

1009
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 War of the World, isn't it?

1010
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 Yeah.

1011
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 It was pretty much the first of the year 1805.

1012
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 Okay.

1013
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 And then, briefly, all's well that ends well.

1014
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 No way.

1015
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 Well, I think it must have been the Russian for that, but...

1016
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 He hated Shakespeare as well.

1017
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 He didn't think he was a very good writer.

1018
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 It's that so, yeah.

1019
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 Yeah.

1020
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 He and Shaw talked about Shakespeare, didn't they, about how they hated him.

1021
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 Wow.

1022
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 He thought that Shakespeare was unfair to servants and poor people

1023
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 and they were frequently made the objects of ridicule in this place.

1024
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 Yeah.

1025
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 Yeah, he was big on the rights of servants and serfs.

1026
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 He was kind of obsessed with that, especially in his later life, wasn't he?

1027
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 And he sort of shifted his whole family to this different kind of barren land

1028
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 to try and make his own farming, using his own farming ideas and principles.

1029
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Which, if you've ever read Anna Karenina, are basically all written out in the character of Levin.

1030
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 Who is essentially, I think Levin is who told story wishes he was in Anna Karenina.

1031
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 He's a kind of wheat obsessive, isn't he?

1032
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 He is, yes.

1033
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 He's the opposite of someone who's gluten intolerant.

1034
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 Yes, exactly.

1035
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 He's exactly.

1036
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 He's gluten enthusiasts.

1037
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 He doesn't just love sandwiches, guys.

1038
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 There was a whole socialist philosophy behind this.

1039
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 Sandwiches for everybody.

1040
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 He loves eggs as well.

1041
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 There's an app you can download, which is his wife's cookbook.

1042
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 It's now available as an iOS app, and we have...

1043
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 And so we know all about the different things, because his wife was amazing.

1044
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 She's kind of the great woman behind the great man kind of thing.

1045
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 He had terrible hand-riding, so she copied out seven drafts of war and peace.

1046
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 The four 1400 pages by hand, often like after he'd gone to bed and finished, she would stay up and down by candle.

1047
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 And he had terrible hand-riding, and sometimes he needed to use magnifying glass.

1048
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 But look, we have to stay on the eggs for a minute, because this is really rather than so.

1049
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 He was born in 1828, and he had this huge mental crisis around his 50th birthday,

1050
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 which I think was after war and peace in our corona.

1051
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 And he gave up smoking, gave up drinking, gave up meat, and became a massive vegetarian.

1052
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 So there was no tofu or corn, obviously.

1053
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 So eggs it was.

1054
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 And he had a rotating menu of 12 egg dishes, which he ordered to be cooked for him, including...

1055
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 He probably had been fun to have been around throughout that time, can he?

1056
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 I think after his big life change, he was a major born.

1057
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 So eggs with brussels sprouts and beans.

1058
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 So what are we sitting next to him for, I think?

1059
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 That is an amazing meal.

1060
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Don't order that. The first date is all I've said.

1061
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 One of them was just omelet in soup.

1062
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 And he became a serious buzzkill.

1063
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 He would cobble his own shoes, and it got so bad that his wife, after 25 years of this kind of shit from Tolstoy,

1064
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 his wife was given a gift of a joke recipe book of all the mad dishes he'd received.

1065
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 I think that's the thing, is the egg.

1066
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 She had a terrible time, notwithstanding the constant farting based on the disgusting egg base vegetarian diet.

1067
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 I've got really mixed feelings about Tolstoy, because he's such a brilliant writer, but my god he was awful to his wife.

1068
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 So Sonia, even if they met, she was one of the daughters of a family that he was friends with,

1069
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 and she was 18 when they met, and he sort of fell in love with her or fell in lust with her.

1070
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 And he proposed very soon afterwards, and amazingly he proposed.

1071
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 And the scene of his proposal is repeated in Anna Karenina, and it's always a scene I've thought that's so unrealistic.

1072
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 So there's this scene where spoilers, 11 proposals to Kitty, but he proposes by just proposing with the first letter of every word that he means to say.

1073
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 But it's not just like will you marry me, it's incredibly long sentences.

1074
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 And I remember reading this scene and thinking, that's absolutely ridiculous.

1075
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 And she can work it out. She can work it out. This is exactly how Tolstoy proposed to Sonia.

1076
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 So it was in, it was more complicated, but it would be like WYMM, for will you marry me?

1077
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 Exactly, but in his instance, they had a whole conversation.

1078
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 And this was Tolstoy and Sonia, and he spelled out the letter of the pieces of chalk.

1079
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 And it was sentences like, in your family, there is a false view of me and your sister Liza.

1080
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 You and your sister Tanya must defend me, spelled out in initials.

1081
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 I think that could work in some cases, like if I was to go, OMG, and you were BS, and that works, doesn't it?

1082
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 Is that how you proposed? That was the response I got.

1083
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 But yeah, sorry, I'll tell you proposed. And before they got married, he said there shouldn't be any sequence between us at all.

1084
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 I'm a massive diary writer. He was a huge diary writer. You must read all my diaries. I must read all of yours.

1085
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 She said okay, and he forced her to read all of his diaries, which involved just his constant recounting of his affairs with surf ladies.

1086
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 Yeah.

1087
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 Just lots of shagging around.

1088
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 And he'd fathered a child by a woman who still lived on his estate.

1089
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 Yeah.

1090
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 And she was still there, you know, and so Sonia read this and obviously felt very threatened by it because, you know, he'd had a job with her.

1091
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 And she was constantly worried that they were going to take up again where he'd left off.

1092
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 Yeah. And he made a readers it very weird.

1093
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 I know. In fact, he then made a transcribe. One of the first things he made a transcribe was a short story based on his relationship with this surf woman.

1094
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 Which is one of the few stories he didn't finish, which we suspect is because she drew the line at some point.

1095
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 And he's just saying, and then my wife turned up.

1096
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 What a boy.

1097
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 He sounds like a river dick.

1098
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 Yeah, I think what happened, correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think his early life where he was doing all these naughty things,

1099
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 then he had this kind of middle-life crisis, didn't he?

1100
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 And then that's when he started giving everything away.

1101
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 Yeah.

1102
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 And obviously neither of those parts of his life were particularly happy times for his wife.

1103
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 He did go from one extreme to the other.

1104
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 But it was when he, in the 1890s, he re-translated the New Testament.

1105
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 So he got a copy of the Bible in presumably in Greek or something like that.

1106
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 And then they had the Russian Orthodox version, which everyone else read, and he translated his own version.

1107
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 And then he realized that actually the way I should be living is vegetarianism, giving everything away, living as a surf, all that kind of thing.

1108
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 But he was tortured his whole life.

1109
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 Like if you do read bits of his diaries, which I kind of have over the years, it was like Adolescent constantly.

1110
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 So everyone thinks Tolstoy had this phase where he was shagging around and writing all these great novels,

1111
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 and then this phase of ascetic religiousness.

1112
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 And actually, he was up and down all the time.

1113
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 His diary is full of him messing up, letting himself down, scolding himself, saying, "All right, tomorrow I will do this, this and that."

1114
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 And it's like real kind of self-loathing, but self-involved.

1115
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 And it would be stupid stuff he'd get to ignore with himself about.

1116
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 Like one entry in his diary said, "Receive my gymnastics teacher over familiarly."

1117
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 You know, "Hate myself for that."

1118
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 Or "May the bad exit from the college in his drawing room."

1119
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 And that's very interesting.

1120
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 It does sound like a lot of stuff, but I think I angst over all this time. He was so angsty.

1121
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 He's so angsty.

1122
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 He's so angsty.

1123
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 So someone else who did that, someone else who noted their moral failures or what they thought were their moral failures obsessively,

1124
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 was Isaac Newton, which we've discussed.

1125
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 He said, "You know, I got this wrong or I was peevish or I think threatened to kill my parents.

1126
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 Parents have burned their house down."

1127
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 It was one thing.

1128
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 Up to that point, I was going to be like, "It sounds like such a nice idea, but I think that's probably a thing for that."

1129
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 Also, the fact that he translated his own version of the Bible, which is like Thomas Jefferson,

1130
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 which we talked about a few weeks ago.

1131
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 So these, that's sort of great people of history tend to think they can have another crack at the Bible.

1132
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 Yeah.

1133
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:09,000
 One of his things that he tried in his early teenage diaries was he kept a note of his attempts to only go to the brothel twice a month.

1134
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 Oh.

1135
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 I know, so he really was trying.

1136
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 Yeah, he was.

1137
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 He was like the gym.

1138
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 He's got his membership, he never uses it.

1139
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 It was a waste of money.

1140
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 Got it on Christmas Day.

1141
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 I want to quit the brothel.

1142
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 After a while, you haven't been to the brothel.

1143
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 You can't really go back, because they've noticed that you haven't been...

1144
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 When he was 16, he recorded that he sort of scourged himself and whipped himself,

1145
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 because he wanted to toughen up to physical pain.

1146
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 And then immediately the next day, he remembered that life is short.

1147
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 So he lay in bed for three days, enjoying reading and eating honey cakes.

1148
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 Oh.

1149
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 Honey cakes are nice.

1150
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 Are we all toy store it, tall store it in some way?

1151
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 He wrote the Shawshank Redemption, or he wrote the original...

1152
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 Sorry, I am feeling it for Dan here.

1153
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 So the Shawshank Redemption in the film is based on Stephen King's novella "Read to Hayworth" and the Shawshank Redemption.

1154
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 But that, in terms, is based on a short story by a tall store.

1155
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
 He calls he's the truth, but waits about a man whose sentence for murder, he didn't commit.

1156
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 Really?

1157
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 Yeah, and it's all about redemption for forgiveness.

1158
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 But he wanted Tom Hanks for the part, didn't he?

1159
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 Yeah, exactly.

1160
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 As a young man, Tolstoy lost so much money gambling that he had to sell off his family home, right?

1161
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 And this was a huge shame in all of this.

1162
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 But the buyer dismantled the family home and removed it from the site it was.

1163
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 So there were just two huge wings of the house on either side, which he had not sold off.

1164
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 It was just a gaping hole in between them.

1165
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 Oh, yeah.

1166
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 Oh, that's amazing.

1167
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 Well, all the useful rooms in the middle bit.

1168
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 20-on-sweep bathrooms and no bedrooms.

1169
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 Okay, that is all of our facts.

1170
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 What comes next?

1171
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 Thanks so much for listening.

1172
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 Thank you so much for listening.

1173
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
 If you'd like to...

1174
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 If you'd like to, so listen to subscribe to our podcast.

1175
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 If you'd like to get in touch with this...

1176
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 Alex, this is so concerning, because you're supposed to listen to our podcast every week to check it all sounds okay.

1177
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 And then upload it and it sounds like you've never heard it before.

1178
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 Sorry.

1179
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000

 James.

1184

 You can email our podcast at qi.com.

1189
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 Okay, thank you so much for listening.

1190
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 No, no, no, no.

1191
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 I can get in contact with us all at no such thing.

1192
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 Okay, look.

1193
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 Or you can get in contact with all of us at no such thing.

1194
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 I want Twitter at no such thing.

1195
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
 Sorry, what was the other thing?

1196
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 Just so to say.

1197
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 Okay, thanks so much for listening.

1198
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 And if you want to listen to any of our old episodes, you can go to no such thing as a fish.com.

1199
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 And you can also go to the website if you want to or dates and the book release.

1200
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 Yeah, and you can go to our website.

1201
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 No such thing as a fish.com for tour dates of the book tour.

1202
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 And also, no, it's just a book tour, isn't it?

1203
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 For the American tour?

1204
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 The book of the year.

1205
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 Isn't that all sold out?

1206
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
 I know.

1207
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 There's still some tickets for New York.

1208
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 If you're from New York, come along.

1209
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 Yeah.

1210
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 Alex doesn't care about any of this because he's not going to be here.

1211
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 But please go to no such thing as a fish.com.

1212
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 You can get tickets for our US tour.

1213
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
 If you're in the US, still some tickets left.

1214
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 You can go to our book of the year 2019 tour.

1215
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
 Or pre-order the book as well if you go there.

1216
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 Yeah, Alex, you've designed that website.

1217
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 You should have real dug up this game.

1218
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 Thank you, sorry, goodbye.
