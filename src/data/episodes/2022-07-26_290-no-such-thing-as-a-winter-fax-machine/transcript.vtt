 Hello, welcome to another episode of No Succeeding as a Fish. My name is Alex Bell.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 No, a weekly episode. No, what is it? A weekly podcast coming to you.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 You're doing real good.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Shut up. I'm hosting a weekly podcast from the offices of QI.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 For the QI offices in Covent Garden, my name is Alex Bell, and I'm joined by James Hawking,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Andrew Hunter-Marie and Anna Chisinski, and I forgot what happened next.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 This is once again, we are going to drown the microphone to share our favourite facts in the last seven days.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 In a particular order, here we go, starting with you, James.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 That was the flawless, I can't believe it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Well, I would say flawless.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 It's so nice, you've given us outtakes for a year.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 See, we all think down is a complete idiot, but now I see how difficult that job is.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 It's not easy.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 You found respect for the man.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Okay, well, my fact this week is that in Japan, you can buy left-handed chopsticks.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Amazing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 It's not amazing, because chopsticks are just a stick.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 How can they be left-handed?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 You would think they're just a stick, but I went to a shop in Nashiki Market, which is in Kyoto,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 and they had a whole shop full of chopsticks, and if they were just sticks, I don't think they'd be able to do that.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 I think you've been had.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Did you spend a lot of extra money on them?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 No, because I'm not left-handed, so they weren't really for me.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 But they also had right-handed ones, which I also didn't buy.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 So what do they look like?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 They look like chopsticks, but they're in a box that says left-handed.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 I think you were.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 But there is a very, very important difference, and that is that the not-just sticks are slightly molded.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 And I put them on my social media to see if people could explain what was going on.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And our good friend, Karyad Lloyd, asked her friend, who I don't know, called @goome_thefutureisme,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 and @goome_thefutureisme on Instagram, said that they are learning chopsticks for children.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 And the way they're molded is where you put your fingers, so you always put your fingers in the right place.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 And obviously, with left-handed people, that would be slightly different than right-handed people.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 And so these are training chopsticks.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Wow.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Can you get training chopsticks that attach to each other as well?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Yes, you would like a hinge in a spring.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Absolutely.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So they're more like tweezers.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 You can get those as well.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 But these are ones to not just show you how to pick things up, but show you how to hold them correctly.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 So it's a bit like, you know, when you're at primary school, and if you're not very good at handwriting,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 they put a big plastic thing on your pencil so that you can hold it better.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 I don't know that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Oh, I have one of those.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Like, it was like a little rubber thing, but I was left-handed.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Oh, where are you?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 I was at disadvantage anyway.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Oh, OK.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 I'm left-handed too, but didn't get one of those.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 So actually half of this podcast are left-handed, because Adam's right-handed, I know.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 I am, yes.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 We are not representative of the general population.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 And that's a good example of where a small sample size can be very misleading.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 So the left-handed chopsticks are not for adults.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 They're just for kids, left-handed kids when they're learning, and they've got a little groove in them.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 That's as I understand it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 If you know any different, then do message me on Twitter @JamesHarkin or on Instagram.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 No such thing as James Harkin.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 And the pictures are on there, so you can just comment on it.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Because the chopsticks are brought to Japan from China, of course, weren't they?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And I've existed in China for thousands of years, but weren't really used.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 We don't think for the actual process of eating, like we use an iPhone fork,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 for the first couple of thousand years, they were just basically for reaching into boiling pots of water and oil,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 and retrieving the food that's in them.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 So they were used in the cooking process, like a tong or something.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 And they just really have a spoon to eat off or eat with their hands.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 It has to have been an amazing moment, where someone was just eating,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 cooking with their spatula or equivalent, and then just started eating with it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 It stays on the washing out, doesn't it?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Yeah, it does.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 What really happened is that around 500 AD, there was a massive population boom in China,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 and food became really scarce, and the way their cutstick was by cutting it in really small pieces,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 and that kind of makes the kind of eating with chopsticks a good way of doing it.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 I thought it was to do with people chopping up their food small,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 so that it takes less cooking fuel to prepare.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Because of the population boom, there was much less fuel to go around,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 you know, the fewer trees to chop up as fire with the stuff.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Yeah, it was partly that.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 So it was partly that.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 There's a really good book, though, called Chopsticks by a guy called Edward Wang.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 So he looks into this, and actually they started eating with chopsticks

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 using them, like as we use knives and folks, in about 400 BC.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 But it became very commonplace in 400 AD, and it's partly because of the population boom,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 but also because oil became readily available.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 And so that's when they started stir-frying stuff.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And so that's when I guess Chinese stir-frying came in as we would know it.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 And obviously to stir fry, you need those little bits of meat.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 And so then you don't need a knife anymore.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 But the other thing as well is, like you say, you would eat with a knife.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Before that, you would kind of stab things and eat it, right?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 And that was in Europe in the Middle Ages as well.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 But the other thing is, Confucius thought that you shouldn't eat with a knife

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 because a knife is something you would use in war or in aggression.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 So he thinks it shouldn't be something you should have around the table.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 So anyone who followed Confucianism also thought that you shouldn't eat with knives.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 So did you know you can get Japanese left-handed knives as well?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Yeah, because European knives are traditionally symmetrical because they're obviously just sharp.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 But some Japanese like, they catch your knives, they're caught asymmetrically.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 So the cutting edge is supposed to be closer to the body.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 So it's like at an angle.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 So you need the left-handed knife.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Well, that's interesting.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 So it points towards you, you mean the cutting edge?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Yes, yeah, exactly.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 You lean the knife slightly in towards you when you cook.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 When you cut.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 And if you're left-handed, you can't really do that.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 It's a total match, you lose all your fingers.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 So many left-handed things are just, you know, not really necessary.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 And I say this as a left-handed person, like left-handed scissors and all of this stuff.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Really?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 I think they're a big crock of whoy.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Really?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Yeah, I do.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Because I can't cut with scissors with my left hand.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 I agree, I can't do that either, I've tried and I can't.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 When you cut with right-handed, you're not supposed to.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Yeah, but how do you cut with scissors with your right hand,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 if we can't cut with right-handed scissors with your left hand?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 You have my fingers into the holes that they're not supposed to fit into and it's fine.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Yeah, we used to have a coming up university.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 You know what I guess?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 You just learnt it in a hard way.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 It hurts, it bleeds every time I cut.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 I do it.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 They do make a big old fuss lefties.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Obviously not you, Andy.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Thank you for representing the other side.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 But, you know, about how difficult life is.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 And it basically all boils down to a can opener, doesn't it?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 That's what they just say.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 I don't think we should be annoying the left-handed community

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 because science has shown that they are better at fighting than right-handers.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Oh, what? Because it's surprising.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Yeah, well that's basically it.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Yeah, also we've got the left-handed scissors.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Yeah, but we've got way more right-handed scissors.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 We've got way more weapons than you have.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 If it's a battle of can opener and scissors, our armoury is way better.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 It would be like fighting your own clone,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 like it's all expertly matched, but in opposite way.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 As soon as we have a left-handed gun, you guys will be in three.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 There is a left-handed gun.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 You can get left-handed guns.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 They're just guns in opposite, so because you also have a dominant eye, as well often.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 And so for people who are in the army and stuff,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 if you have precision shooters, precision weapon,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 I don't know what the verb is for when you shoot a gun, gun people.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Like, you need to be...

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 I think we're going to be winning this war, it's like so.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Said that in the gun people.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 But the general one, though, the precision gun people.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Yeah, but it's all over reverse,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 so that you can put your left eye on the sights.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 You want to be careful saying things like the left-handed gun is just a gun in reverse.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 I don't think that's it.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Encourage lefties to use it that way.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 And I should just finish off the fighting thing.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 The reason that we think, no one's really sure,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 but basically 90% of people are right-handed.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 And so throughout history, people who have been fighting

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 have been more likely to come across a right-handed person,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 so we're basically training ourselves to fight right-handed people.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 So when a left-handed person comes along, it's much more difficult.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Wow.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 And there was a study of the careers of 10,000 boxes and martial arts competitors

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 found that those who are left-handed do butch better.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Wow.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 But then, around this table,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 you guys are much more lovers than fighters, aren't you?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 Yeah, I'd say that.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Oh, you haven't been to my left-handed fight club after work.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 You never taught that.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 We're always very, very hungry afterwards,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 because now I can open the cans.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 So I thought I had invented something in the researching of this fact,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 and it turns out I haven't.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 But I do think it's a very good invention.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 So you know how you get a bowl of noodles,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 and there'll be some soup with the noodles.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 So normally you eat the noodles,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 and then you have the soup left over,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 and you have to lift the bowl up after it,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 if you don't have a spoon, for example.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 I thought, what about a chopstick straw?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Okay, so it's a hollow chopstick.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 And once you've finished eating the noodles,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 you just drink the soup through the stalk and it's just a straw.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 It's two straws.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 I'll take you out to a Chinese restaurant,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 and you can eat with two straws,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 and we'll see how well you do.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Because I think you're going to go hungry.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 So this guy called Julian Lackner has invented it,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 and he has, shamefully, he has not followed it up.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 What's so he's invented one pair?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 I think I don't know whether he's built a pair,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 or whether it's just at the concept stage.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 It wasn't the runaway massive success that you would anticipate.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 I just think it's a way of making chopsticks lighter.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 They use less material.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 They use millions of trees, don't they?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Every year, there's some terrifying stat that China uses

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 3.8 million trees, making 57 billion pairs of chopsticks.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Wow, that's huge.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 In China, they used to eat with silver chopsticks,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 and it was because they thought that silver would turn black

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 if it touched poison food.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 So you could tell if your food was poisoned.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 But actually, silver often turns black

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 when it comes into contact with hydrogen sulfide.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 And that's something that you get a lot in,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 foods like garlic and onions and eggs.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 So pretty much every time they cook with garlic and onions.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 It's poison.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 It's good for vampires, though,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 well, unless they stab themselves with it.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 As you know, it's not a good vampire's.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 What? No, it is, because you'd know if there's any garlic.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Yeah, but also silver bullets kill them

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 and silver chopsticks will probably do some damage.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 You'd have to be a clumsy, clumsy vampire.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 stab yourself in the heart with a chopstick while eating it.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 I love clumsies, but I've never done that.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Yeah, but they're always eating their darks,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 so they're at disadvantage.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 Actually, chopsticks can be used as weapons,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 and I learned how to do this at ninja training a few weeks ago.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Is it for the eye?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Well, yeah, I guess you would aim for whatever.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Anything's a weapon who's sticking the eye.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Well, yeah, I guess so.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 But so ninjas would have, like, these throwing stars,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 but they would more likely have a throwing stick,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 and it would be kind of a small metal stick.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 But if you didn't have a small metal stick,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 you could do it with a chopstick.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 And they taught us how to throw it

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 so that it kind of goes into a target like a dagger.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 And this was apparently, as we spoke in about a while ago,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 not all ninja things are possibly true,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 but there's apparently ways that ninjas threw chopsticks.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 And did you succeed in embedding it in, well done.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Yeah, I can tell you the trick is to keep your wrist cocked the whole time.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Put the chopstick in between your first and second fingers,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 so it's kind of in the gap between them.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Have your wrist cocked,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 put it up in the air, your hand,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 and then go in an arc downwards,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 and then let go at about, kind of, I guess, 40 degrees.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 And it just got, but you have, actually,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 what you're doing there, Anna, is you're kind of flicking at the end,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 but you don't flick, you have to keep your wrist cocked the whole time.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 So sorry, wrist cocked the whole time, got it?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Yeah.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Absolutely amazing.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 I feel like I hit the ground with that one.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 It looks like you've just been taught how to do air quotes,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 but you're really struggling to execute them.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 It looks like you're all out for dinner and we're desperate for the bill.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Well, that's really useful to know, thanks James.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Although then you don't have anything to eat with afterwards.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Quite right.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 I'm shame.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 This is, I thought this was really interesting.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Disney princesses are a good target group for working out the correct ratio

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 of left to right-handed people in the real world,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 because there are 12 official Disney princesses and one of them is left-handed.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 So that mirrors real life.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Wow.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Right, so, sorry, how is this useful ever?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 It's not useful.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 I just thought that was interesting.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Like Muppets on the other hand didn't eat all left-handed,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 because their operators are right-handed.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 So their right-handed is up the Muppet in the head,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 operating the head, and then the left-hand is operating the left-hand of the Muppet.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Just as a point of order, which Disney princesses are left-handed?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 It's Tiana.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Who's that?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 The one from the princess and the frog.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 She's not one of the main ones, is she?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 They really made a bit of a runner-up princess, the lefty.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Which I think is the right choice.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 In China, less than 1% of people are left-handed.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Really?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 What?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 No.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 According to Chinese people.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Why?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 No, it's because they're suppressed.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 It must be.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Yeah, so it's not biologically speaking.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 But in China claims that less than 1% of its students are left-handed.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 The global average, as you say, is 10 to 12%.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 As you can tell by watching 12 Disney films in a row.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 And it's actually because people tend to have to switch their dominant hand in China.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 A lot of people say because the characters can't be written left-handed.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 But I was reading a blog by a woman who's lived in China for decades,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 and she was saying that she'll go around and say, "I'm left-handed."

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 And people will say, "There are no left-handed people in China, you know."

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 And she'll say, "What are you talking about? Of course there are."

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 And she'll demonstrate that you can write Chinese characters with your left hand.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 But people will look at her and say, "No, it's wrong. It's done with the left hand.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 It can't be done."

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 Wow.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 That's amazing.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Do they pretend they can't read what she's written?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 I don't think they go quite that far.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 They just say, "It looks gross."

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Wow.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Wow.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 You know the musical composition chopsticks.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 That was written in 1877 by a girl, 60-year-old girl called Euphemia Allen,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 and her brother was called Mozart Allen.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 No way.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 No way.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 So weird.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And once again, the brother got the musical talent changed, didn't he?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Well, I think she got the musical talent, but they hoped that the brother had.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Because he was called, that parents called him Mozart, obviously hoping he would be some great musician.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 But actually, the daughter managed to write this composition, which is now probably one of the most played.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 It's ubiquitous.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 It's not necessarily great.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 It's the baby shark of piano, really, isn't it?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 No, don't you bring the baby shark.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Is it called chopsticks because it's kind of like you could play it with chopsticks?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 No.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Well, kind of.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 The reason is that when you play it, it's like two notes that are next to each other and you move outwards, don't you?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 So it's like, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did. Like that. But you're not supposed to play it with your fingers. You're supposed to turn your hands sideways and then play it as if you're chopping something. And that's how you're supposed to play chopsticks. And that's why it's called chopsticks.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 So we've all been playing it wrong.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Yeah. So you turn your hands 90 degrees so that your thumbs are facing the air and you play it with your little fingers.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 You karate your piano.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Exactly. Yeah.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Cool. Isn't that cool?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 I want to hear some stupid chopstick records. Yes, please.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Okay. So the most marbles moved with chopsticks in one minute is 43.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And that was broken, not by someone from China or Japan, but by an Italian man called Silvio Saber.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And then a few years after that record was made, a Japanese man called Mr. Cherry tried to break the record.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 For most marbles moved in one minute with chopsticks. And he didn't, he exactly equaled it.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Wow.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 But he did get the record for the most baked beans eaten with chopsticks in one minute.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Yeah.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 20 roundabouts.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 Sorry. Actually, what was that? What was that record?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 That was 71. That's more than one per second for a minute.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 And that's more than I can do.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Yeah, but I think I guess only if, like, I'm sure there would be a way of building up like some kind of sluice

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 where you just turn the chopsticks into a shoot and you pour the baked beans down it.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 Sure. That's amazing.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 Like some sort of like propeller where it scooped them up when you just spin it around.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Exactly.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 I think you probably, the rules say that you have to pick them up in traditional chopstick fashion.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Although there is, they would enjoy those baked beans more because there's been a study that finds that you would,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 you enjoy food more if you eat it with chopsticks.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 This is specifically with popcorn and specifically in one study of 68 participants, but give me out.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Basically, the idea is because you can only eat one at a time or one thing at a time.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 It's almost like, let's say you're eating something else like alpha betty spaghetti or something.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 When you have the first spoonful, it's really tasty, right? It's like that's so good.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 But then by the time you're halfway through it, you've kind of even forgotten that you're eating alpha betty spaghetti, aren't you?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 You're just eating it then.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Sure.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 But if it's really hard to get that food to your mouth every time, then each time you're kind of building up to the mouthful.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Yeah, I see that.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 I have that when I eat with chopsticks, basically.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 If you're so cack-handed that you're just enormously relieved that you've managed to get that one bean into your mouth, it is more enjoyable.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 How did the world record attempt go in the end?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Wow, so it's kind of novel as well.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 Yeah, it's just an unusual...

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 That's exactly true.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Because whenever anything seems new, people pay more attention to it.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 And when you're eating it more slowly, each mouthful appears more new than if you're shoveling it in.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 If you look astonished every time, that's like bean goes in.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Oh my god, what is this?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 So I think I wrote about this experiment because there was another way they tried it.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 And this was asking people to drink water, but to come up with their own fun ways of drinking water.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 So, they... some people drank it normally.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 And then afterwards, they were all right on their enjoyment of the experience.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 So some people drank it normally, and I guess just gave it five hours ago.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 What were the other ways that they did it?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Well, I only have written a couple down.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 One was drinking it from a martini glass.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Which is fun, I think.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 You know, anything from a martini glass fun.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Another person drank it out of a shipping envelope.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 And they have a whale on their side.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 They love it. I can imagine you coming up to this study with a pair of chopsticks.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 And there was like, "Can't drink water with chopsticks."

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 And you're like, "Aha!"

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 You weren't counting on my sluice.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 My fact this week is that.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 Sorry, can I just...

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 Down often does that okay with a little bit more vim?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Just give it one more try.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 Too much, too much.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 You can't please all the people of the time.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Sorry, what was your fact?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 My fact this week is that the fact machine is older than the telephone.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Wow.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Okay, the fax machine.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 It's a fax about fax.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 That's a fax about fax.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 So the telephone was what, early 20th century?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 It was not like that in century.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Yeah, late 19th century.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 So you're saying that the fax machine was from the 19th century?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Well, the first patent was in 1843 for an electric printing telegraph.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 And it was actually another Scottish inventor called Alexander Bain.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 So quite similar to Alexander Bain, one of the inventors of the telephone.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 And he was actually a clockmaker, and he invented this device.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 It was also called a fax simling machine.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 There were various different versions.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 And it involved synchronized pendulum.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 So you can see where the clock is going to come in.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 And the message line by line, conversed it to electrical signals, sent them down some wires,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 and then reproduced it at the other end, using electromagnetically sensitive paper

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 that had this kind of chemical imbued in it.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 The first version wasn't very good because there were all sorts of synchronization problems.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 And then he improved it between 1843 and 1846.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 But then he was beaten to it when he tried to repassent the improved version,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 because a rival had gotten the way and demonstrated a much more accurate version.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 And it was just the synchronization of the pendulums that he could never get right,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 because it was really difficult to get to swing.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Because it's swinging left to right across the page of the exact time.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 So it's almost like an inkjet printer kind of doing dots along a line.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Wow, that's very tricky.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 And very cleverly.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 All the paper that you need to be receiving the electrical current.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 It needs to turn black whenever it receives a current.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 So it needs to be soaked in potassium ferrocyanide.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Was that kind of toxic?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Sounds like it was cyanide.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Like every time you get a fax, you basically died.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 I mean, I thought that was probably why I didn't work.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 No, I don't think it was, I don't think it was lethal either.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 I think you should not eat too much of it.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 So this?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 But then he was the pioneer.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 But then I think the first really usable one was in 1860, which is still so long ago.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 And it was an Italian called Casselli.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 And you would write your message on a piece of tin.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 And you would write a non-conductive ink.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 And then the sheet was scanned by a stylus.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 And that was attached to telegraph wires going to the other place.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 And then whenever the stylus at the other end got to a bit of ink, the conduction would stop.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 And then at the receiving end, whenever the conduction stops, the stylus there would stop.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 And so you'd make a kind of perfect mirror image of it.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 Oh, okay.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 So it's actually the same.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 It's a bit in reverse because it's the drawing that's non-conductive.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Yeah.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 I think I've explained that right.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 But it was demonstrated for Napoleon III.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 I think that's amazing.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 The Napoleon III had a fax machine.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Unbelievable.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 Unbelievable.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 And he said this is incredible.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 He got sent the signature of the composer Rossini from a hundred miles away by fax.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Wow.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 That is amazing.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 And it didn't catch on, did it?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 The idea with the fax machine, I think, is that they weren't in the information age yet.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 So business just worked too slowly.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 So I think was that one between Paris and Lyon and Paris and Marseille.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 They set those ones up.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 And there just wasn't really any interest in it.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 It was a gimmick.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 Yeah, it was a gimmick.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 This is not what it captured on.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 There's lots of public demonstrations on it and stuff and everyone was like, wow, no practical applications.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 The Russians are, had one.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Nicholas I.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Wow.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Between his palaces at Moscow and Petersburg, there was a fax connection.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Wow.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 It's so weird.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 And so I'm sure you guys came across this in your research.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 You know, who's the biggest buyer of fax machines in the world?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 Is it career?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 It's the NHS.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 It's the NHS.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 It's not the career, it's the NHS.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Yeah.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 And they have at least 8,000 machines across the NHS, just in Britain.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 And I asked a friend of mine, who's a doctor, just out of interest.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 He works down on South Coast.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 And I said, do you use fax?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 I said he sends at least one or two every day.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Oh yeah, they use them all the time.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 They're banned from doing it now.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 So they're no longer the biggest buyer.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 They're banned from buying anymore.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 They haven't been banned from using them.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 No, but as in they're not the biggest buyer anymore because the government's finally said,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 you are not allowed to buy all the bloody fax machines.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 It's ridiculous.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 When I used to work as an accountant, we used to use faxes like,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 like you say, not two times a day, maybe 10 times a day.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 And they're a really good way of getting kind of invices across.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 It's useful for sending secure information, I believe.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Yeah.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 And there is a secure email, but it's a bit of a pain.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 And yeah.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 I feel like you can ring faxes for no reason at all.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 And you just get a weird noise.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 I just think that's a totally unnecessary use.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Is that how you spend your evening?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 No, I just, I've never used actually fax with a fax machine.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 But I do routine the acts any ring people's fax and others.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 You've never sent a fax.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 No, I don't think I've ever sent a fax.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 What?

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 But to be fair, I'm not a doctor.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 That is insane.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 Well, sorry, I had to say, I had to do it for my work.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 What, you just do it like asking your friends if you go to the shop.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 So whatever.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 I work a lot when I was younger.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 And also me, my friend used to send faxes to each other after school.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 That's what I mean.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 I don't think anyone's ever apart from you said faxes for a social reason.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 Wow, what did you say in your faxes?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 So I remember she once sent me a fax of the newspaper article in her local area,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 which on the headline was her dog getting married to another dog.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 This is an incredible insight into your early life.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 This is like an analogue version of Buzzfeed that you invented there.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 It is a pretty huge moment in our childhood, actually.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 Wow.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 Are the dogs still together?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Are they happy?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 They had a lovely long life together, but I'm afraid sadly they have expired because it was 25 years ago.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Which in dog ears?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 This is our 175th wedding anniversary.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 Oh, I had a fact about wedding anniversary, which is through this fax research,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 which is, this is not really fax related, but you can request anniversary greetings from the White House.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 What?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 If you are a US citizen and if you contact them several months ahead.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 But Trump's not sending them, is they?

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 I can imagine his faxes in the massive capital, but it's not wetters.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 He does faxes, he's saying no collusion.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 It's kind of weird.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 I think you can request presidential greetings.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 And they sent, you know, poor drone in the White House has to send you presidential greetings.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 But they made it clear, you can only request a limited number of greetings per day.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 Which I think is a very funny idea.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Obviously, somebody at some point received about 100 different greetings on the same wedding anniversary.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 I just love the idea of keeping Trump busy by setting them up.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 Sorry, Mr. President Barack Obama used to get through 20 a day.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Well, with the Queen, she's got almost no political power.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 She has to write cards to every 100 euro in the country.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 It's something really cool you can do with fax paper if you've got any left over.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 From the 90s.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 From your friend's dog wedding.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 So this is if you use a thermal fax machine.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 And fax paper would be thermal paper.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 You use those in the winter, don't you?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 No, fax, so if you're using a thermal fax machine, then the paper turns black when it's exposed to heat.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 So there's a specially chemically treated.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 And basically what a fax machine would do, how it would work is it would only heat up the parts that were meant to be written on.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 So it's bits would turn black.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 But what you can do is you can just get some fax paper.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 All this also works on receipt paper because they still use that for that.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 And heat it up.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 And it'll turn black.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 I was expecting another part to that, like some useful life hack.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 Like, well, yeah, what's that for?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Well, if you've only got a white crayon.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 And you need to write something a message immediately.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 You need black paper to write it up.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 That's true.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 So why don't you heat your thermal fax machines roll of paper?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 Oh, if you're going to a fancy dress as a zebra, you can heat up one roll of receipt paper.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Don't heat up the other one.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 And just wrap them around you like a mummy.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Perfect.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Instant zebra costume.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 It's a multi-purpose life hack.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 Sorry, hang on.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 Is that how the receipts work in old-tone machines?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 Is that they've selectively heated up the paper?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Not in the really old ones, I don't think.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 I think quite a lot of them are still in use.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 That's amazing.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 They're slightly waxy at the paper, I think.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 And they're a bit more transparent.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 And if you do heat them up, yeah, they go.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 So it's quite a way of redacting things as well.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Because if you heat it up, then obviously eat all of the work.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 But does it when you cool down?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Does it not go back to normal?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 I don't think so, because I'll always, as soon as the receipt came out of the thing,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 you'd have to be given a blank receipt.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Quite like that.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 It was momentarily written on the record and what you bought.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 I'm talking to my taxman, I'm really sorry.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 All these receipts said stuff when I got them.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 I don't know what's happened to them all.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 You'll have to trust me.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 Can I tell you my favourite ever fax machine fax?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 I actually went to Georgia or Bank to find so.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 So in 1966, the Russians landed the Luna 9 craft on the moon,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 which was the first craft to successfully achieve a soft landing in land without crashing.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 And it was designed to take the first photographs on the moon.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 And it was basically a contraption that had a camera with a film in it.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 So take the photos and then the machine would take the film out of the camera

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 and develop the photographs and then put the photographs into a little fax machine,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 basically, and then transmit the photos back to Earth.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 This is all on the moon.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 All of the moon in a little craft, yeah.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 And the Russians were broadcasting it back to Earth.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 And the British were monitoring all of the landing and everything

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 and all of the signals from Georgia or Bank.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 And then they noticed that when it landed and all of this stuff happened,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 we didn't know what was going on because the Russians didn't tell anyone anything.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 That the signal had changed and they recognised it as being a standard signal

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 from something called radio fax, which was a standard way of transmitting photos

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 by a kind of fax machine, the kind of system around the world

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 that was used in journalism.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 And so they very quickly realised that they could interpret the signal.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 So they rang up the offices of the Daily Express in Manchester and said,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 "Look, do you have a radio fax receiving a machine that we can borrow?"

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 And they said, "Yes."

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 So they stuck in a car and raced it over to Georgia or Bank

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 and managed to get these transmitted photos and print it out

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 and they got the first photos of the moon on the surface of the moon.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 And they then published them on the front cover of the Daily Express

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 before the Russians had even released them.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 We actually hacked the first fax from the moon.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 That is amazing.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 But what was the greatest surprise?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 Bernard Lovell, after whom the Lovell telescope is now named,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 was annoyed because the Russian photographs were calibrated

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 for a slightly different size of paper from what we had.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 So it's slightly distorted the photographs.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 And he was really annoyed because he thought that everyone

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 would think his telescope was a bit shit.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 Well, there are disadvantages to theft of property, aren't you?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 Okay, it is time for fax number three and that is Anna.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 My fact this week is that a boatload of researchers are about

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 to deliberately get themselves stuck in the Arctic ice for a year.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 And for fun and science.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 For fun? I think it's for work.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 It's fun and science, guys.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 Science is fun, isn't it?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Yeah, the two are not mutually exclusive.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 I reckon in this case they are.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Like, you're spending a whole winter in the Arctic.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 You're talking to someone who faxed their friends for fun in their childhood.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 No, man, these guys are going to have the best times.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 They're going to eat one of those thermal fax machines.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 So this is a project called the multi-disciplinary drifting observatory

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 for the study of Arctic climate, shortened to mosaic.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 And hundreds of researchers from 19 countries are involved.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 It's the largest Arctic expedition in history.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 And it's all about data collection in the Arctic.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 So just gathering as much as they can from the ocean, from the ice, from the atmosphere,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 about the climate, the algae, all the chemistry of it

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 to basically work out how climate change is affecting the Arctic.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 And they're doing it by going on this big, well, they've just arrived, actually.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 So there's this 400-foot-long ice-breaker ship called Polar Stern,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 which left Norway a few weeks ago.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 And it is now about to freeze itself into this little,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 a bit less than two-mile square bit of ice.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 And then it's just going to let that bit of ice carry it through the North Pole.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 So amazing.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 It is amazing.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 I read that on Monday, the sun set were the boaters.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 And so it's set and it's not going to return for 153 days.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 That's a long night.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Yeah.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 Okay, fine, so that bit's not that fun.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 And they can't, because obviously they're going to be locked in the ice.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 So they can't really control where they go, can they?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 No.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 So I read that they have to be a bit careful because there's a risk

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 that the ice will drift them into the Russian economic zone.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 And if they go in there against their will,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 they don't have permission to do carry out research there.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 So they've had to select the bit they've locked themselves into quite carefully

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 where they think they'll stay in sort of international territory.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 I bet they'll end up there and they'll be like,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 "Oh, no, we can't do any research."

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 "We just have to sit and drink all the time."

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 It must have been fun selecting the flow

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 where they're going to embed themselves,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 because they had 15 candidates.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 And they just had to narrow it down.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 And they have to work out, as you say, you have to predict where you think it's going to go.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 So they've picked this one that's the perfect depth.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 So it needs to be deep enough that it can really lock you in place.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 And it needs to be deep enough that planes can land on it, hopefully, in winter,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 which is what they're intending, how they're going to resupply themselves.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 At the moment, it's 350 miles from the north pole.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 And they, you know, need to work out the direction it's sort of travelling in.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 And they want to drift right past the pole, because obviously that's the big money.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 Wow.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 And they will be resupplied.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 And they're having an article on Mashable that said they will resupply with provisions

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 and rotating scientists.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 [laughter]

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 I see one of those in a cabab show.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 [laughter]

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 But actually, their scientists from all around the world

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 and they're going to come and stay for a little bit of time and then go away again.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 I think that's the idea.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Yeah, I think most have signed up for two months.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 I think a couple of people are going to do the whole thing.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 Although that's pretty hardy.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 If I need some vitamin D pills, you could say that these guys are going to go with the flow.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 Yeah.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 I bet they're not saying that though.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Oh, I bet it's painted on the side of the body.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 Of course it is.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 I bet there's an embargo on saying that right.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 It's two days here.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 It's really cool.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 They're divided into these different sections into what they call cities.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 So if you go to their website, it's kind of like at a theme park.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 You know, you've got the different zones.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 So essentially, the ship will be stuck in the flow.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 And then they're going to spread out onto the ice all around it to set up their various cities.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Like I city, which sounds like it's going to be a lot of it.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 But I city is basically the patch of ice on which the ice researchers will work.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 And that's they'll pick up bits of ice and study it.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 They've got ocean city and that's where the oceanic researchers drill a hole in the ocean.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 And then they pick up water.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 No, they don't have any ice.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 There's drillers of work in here.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Every time I make a hole, it fills back in.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 This is why I was fired from the project.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 They drill a hole in the ice.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 And then they retrieve the ocean water.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 And what they have to do in ocean city is set up a tent over the hole.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 And that's because they need to keep that a bit warm.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 Because otherwise, if you pull the ocean water up to where you are, it immediately freezes.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 And then you've just got ice again.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 That's how you do winter fishing in Russia.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 Yeah, every winter, if you go to the Moscow River, you'll just see loads of little tents.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 And basically, it's just like men in their little tent doing fishing with a bottle of vodka.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 And that's what they do.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 These guys on the Arctic as well.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 There are loads of problems that they have, obviously, because it's a very, very challenging environment.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 So they're going to have guards who are wearing night vision goggles who are constantly looking out for polar bears.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 And every research station on the ice has to have a two mile radius around it

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 with the perimeter fence, which is monitored for polar bear activity.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 And they've got guns.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 But before that, they obviously don't want to shoot polar bears.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 It's not what they're about.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 For opening fire, they will honk the horn of the ship to try to get off.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 And then they will use a flare gun just up in the air to alarm it.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 And then finally, they've got a pepper spray to try and deter it.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 I think you have to have considerable friends of mine.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 You have to wait until it has really close to you.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 The next thing is you poke it and it's nose.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 That doesn't work.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 You bring out the throwing chopsticks.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 Have you tried reasoning with it?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Yeah, it's cool.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 They're also setting up tripwires for the polar bears themselves around.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 So when a polar bear crosses one of the tripwires, it sends up a big loudfare.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Sounds like home alone with polar bears.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Yeah.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 I found out about another experiment that's being done on the Arctic at the moment.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 So scientists need to study how organic matter decays in the soil.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 And that varies by the soil temperature and moisture and acidity and all of this stuff.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 So they have to sew bags of material, organic matter, to decay.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 That's the test subject.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 So lots of leaves and things like this go into the matter and then they bury that.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 And then a couple of scientists, they had spent weeks laboriously sewing

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 litter bags full of leaves and then sealing them up to be buried.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 And then one of the scientists was having a cup of tea and she realised, oh my god,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 we have bags full of leaves that can be buried under that.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 And I made to an almost exact uniformity standard.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 So at least 1,200 groups across the world are doing citizen science using tea bags now.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 And there are 5,000 tea bags just buried under the Arctic.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Really?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 That's an advantage of global warming, isn't it?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 Well, it melts, you've got a nice cup of tea.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 It can be very weak.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 That's really cool.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Can we talk about making a knife out of your own poo?

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 Yeah.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 Yeah, we better.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 We speak yours.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 So, Wade Davis, the famous traveller and writer, he wrote about an inuit man who once sculpted his own frozen poo into a knife and used it to kill a dog.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 And people are kind of taking this as truth that it might have happened.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 But this year, for the first time, scientists have properly tried it out by making knives out of their own excrement.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 And they found that it wouldn't have worked.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 It wouldn't have been able to cut into a piece of pig hide.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 They said, like a crayon, it just left brown streaks on the meat.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 No slices at all.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 If I was working in that lab, that's the point of which I put in a complaint to you guys on this.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 I kind of poo in the freezer.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 And this is a proper experiment.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 So, first of all, before they even had the poo, they adopted an Arctic diet which was high in protein to ensure that their poo would have the same consistency as the inuit people.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 That's cool.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 That's so clever.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 I was interested because I read somewhere that people escaped from prison by making shifts out of prison poo, so it can't be true.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 It's not true. It's urban myth.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 Most prisoners don't have access to freezers, though, do they?

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 I don't know.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 They're like in lower security prisons, maybe.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 I don't know.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 You have to ask the chef and they do ask questions when you approach them with a bag of your own feet.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 You can say, "Would you mind putting this in the freezer?"

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 If it was very cold outside, you might be able to dangle the poo out of a window and wait for it to freeze overnight.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 Like the way you keep the milk fresh, if your fridge is on the blow.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 I just think there are easier ways to make shifts.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 There must be.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 Yeah, you're in a place full of metal.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 There are like bars everywhere.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 Yeah, you're right.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 So, I've got, I thought of a question about the poo knife experiment.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 Oh, how did they manufacture it into a knife?

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 How did they mould it?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 Was that in the ejection?

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 You have to sort of clench and release at the right moments.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 It was going to shake exactly right.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 What a skill that would be.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 What an edd and bristle.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 I will now be pooing this sculpture of Michelangelo's David.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 Is that the next balloon sculpture magician trick?

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 I imagine that they just cut it into shape.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 Did they make a standard symmetrical European knife or a left hand exactly?

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Wow, and it doesn't work.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 It doesn't work.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 It just leaves it real streaks on the meat.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Another really cool art to experiment that's happening is to deal with climate change.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 And so, that's a problem with the Arctic, which is heating up faster than the rest of the world.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 So, it's really bad.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 Ice is all melting and there have been sort of three main proposals.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 People are thinking about for us to geoengineer it so that this problem is solved.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 One of them is just re-freeze it.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 They're thinking.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 Try and re-freeze the ice.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Just re-freeze it like a big poo.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 So, the plan is to put 10 million windmills there.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 And they will power these water pumps.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 And what the water pumps do is they suck up the seawater from underneath the ice.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 And then they spray it out on top of the ice during the winter and then it freezes.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 And so that restocks it with ice.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 How about a doctor evil plan?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 10 million windmills.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Where the bonkers?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 I mean, presumably the windmills have to use less energy than they pump out.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 Well, they're getting free energy from the wind, I guess.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 Yeah.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 Okay, sorry.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 Yeah.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 No, that's how they work.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 That's how windmills work.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 So, you don't plug them in.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 That's why my windmill has been so expensive to run.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 Another idea that they had is you basically get a submarine.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 And this is an idea, sorry, by a 29-year-old architect called Faris Kota Hatohaha.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 And he says, are you laughing at me?

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 No, it's not laughing at his name, that's his name.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 Anyway, his name isn't important in the story.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 He is going to get this submersible vessel.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 And what you would do is you would get a load of water from the sea in it.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 And then you would somehow suck all of the salt out of the seawater, which then makes it freeze.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 So you suck out the salt, it freezes because it's cold down there.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 And then it floats to the surface and you're making icebergs.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 That's really good.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 Isn't that clever?

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 How are you sucking the salt out, sorry?

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 I said.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 I don't know if you heard.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 I said nothing.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 I don't think I can be more clear than that.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 It's an almost foolproof plan.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 How are you going to fix the Irish border?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 I'm so sorry.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 I clearly wasn't listening.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 And this ship that's getting frozen in is an icebreaker, isn't it?

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 Yeah.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 And we should just say how amazing icebreakers are.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 I mean, they're very, very powerful things.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 And then what shape would you get there would be at the front?

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 Triangular.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 Yeah, pointy.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 Pointy?

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 Yeah, that's what I meant.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 Like a poo knife.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 Right, like a poo knife.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 They're not pointy.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 They're shaped like the backs of spoons at the front.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Really weird.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 So when they hit the ice, they ride up onto it.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 And then the massive weight of the vessel just crushes it down.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Wow.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 Yeah.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 So Russia's biggest icebreaker is called 50 years of victory.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 And it's powered by a great name.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 Always humble, aren't they?

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 We would cause us 40 years of hurt.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Yeah.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 And it's powered by not one but two nuclear reactors.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 So it's extremely impressive.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 And the reason it's nuclear is because otherwise it would

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 expand more than 100 tons of diesel every day.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 So, I mean, it would just have no range.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 It wouldn't be able to get me away.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 Yeah.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 And it needs to be in cold waters then because I was reading out how the nuclear engines,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 the cooling system, depends upon the ice level.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 Okay.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 So you couldn't sail into warm waters because it would overheat.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 Right, right, right.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 So it's literally built.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 It needs the ice as much as the way the ice doesn't need it.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 I like that.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 And it's hopeless in open water as well.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 They roll from side to side all the time.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 Because of this spoon shaped bow.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 So some are being built now which are reversey per se as they can go forwards and backwards.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 That's so clever.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 So they've got a pointy back end.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 And then a spoon shaped front end.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 And if they're ever sailing in open water, they just sail backwards using their pointy bow

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 because that gets through the water very nicely.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 Great.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 But if you're up, do they have two steering wheels?

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 I imagine.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 You've got a nuclear power.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 I imagine that.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 It's just looking like you're turning around.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 All the way back.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 I said, look over there shoulder the whole way.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Yeah.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 Terrible quick neck.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 Yeah.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 And that is Andy.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 My fact is that Leo Tolstoy, one of the greatest writers of history,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 frequently wore two hats in case his head got cold.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 No.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 What a guy.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 This is from someone called Mariana Hunt, who sent me this fact.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 So thank you to you, Mariana.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 And it's just that Tolstoy was very sensitive to head cold.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 So he wore multiple hats.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 He literally wore multiple hats.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 Cold in Russia.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 We've already established that.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 It's cold in Russia.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 And the hats were nuclear powered.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 So amazing.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 Did he have like a reversey person hat that he was walking backwards?

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 Were they two of the same type of hat or was it like a top hat and then a tiny...

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Pull out.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 Top of that or...

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 I am not sure the history relates.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 Tregically.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 I don't know if it was like a fuzz followed by a fedora or...

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 Yeah, so I don't know.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 Because he could have just bought a thicker hat in Russia.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 You know, you often get these big bearskin things.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 Yeah, famously with the flaps.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 With the flaps.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 With the flaps, of course.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 Yeah.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 But he didn't.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 Not that smart.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 Turns out.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 No.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 No, thickly Tolstoy we call him.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 We call him Leo Tolstoy.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 But his name was Lev Holiev.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 And the reason that we do that is because Lev means lion in Russian.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 And when he brought out his book in France, they translated his name as Leon Tolstoy.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 Really?

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Because that means lion.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 Yeah.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 And he kind of gave his blessing to that.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 And when he gave his blessing, it meant that everyone else could kind of go in that direction.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 And so when it came into England, it was anglicised to Leo, which also means lion.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 Right.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 Do we know if everyone does that?

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 Like, in Kenya, are they calling him Simba Tolstoy?

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 That would be amazing, wouldn't it?

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 I can't remember if that's what he leave a lion.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 There's one of...

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 One of the ones in Italy.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 There's a sheep lion, isn't it?

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 Yeah.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 That's so funny.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 I was looking at the...

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 So apparently the Russian word for peace is mute.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 Yeah.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 So that can also mean like world or society.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 It can mean like a place where people...

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 Like a community.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 Right, yeah.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 But there was an argument about how you could translate the title of War and Peace to War and the World.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Which I prefer as a kind of sex in the city vibe.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 Well, one of its provisional titles, it went through a couple of titles before he settled on War and the World.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 War of the World, isn't it?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Yeah.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 It was pretty much the first of the year 1805.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 Okay.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 And then, briefly, all's well that ends well.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 No way.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 Well, I think it must have been the Russian for that, but...

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 He hated Shakespeare as well.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 He didn't think he was a very good writer.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 It's that so, yeah.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 Yeah.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 He and Shaw talked about Shakespeare, didn't they, about how they hated him.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 Wow.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 He thought that Shakespeare was unfair to servants and poor people

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 and they were frequently made the objects of ridicule in this place.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Yeah.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 Yeah, he was big on the rights of servants and serfs.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 He was kind of obsessed with that, especially in his later life, wasn't he?

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 And he sort of shifted his whole family to this different kind of barren land

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 to try and make his own farming, using his own farming ideas and principles.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 Which, if you've ever read Anna Karenina, are basically all written out in the character of Levin.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 Who is essentially, I think Levin is who told story wishes he was in Anna Karenina.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 He's a kind of wheat obsessive, isn't he?

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 He is, yes.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 He's the opposite of someone who's gluten intolerant.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 Yes, exactly.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 He's exactly.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 He's gluten enthusiasts.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 He doesn't just love sandwiches, guys.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 There was a whole socialist philosophy behind this.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 Sandwiches for everybody.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 He loves eggs as well.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 There's an app you can download, which is his wife's cookbook.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 It's now available as an iOS app, and we have...

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 And so we know all about the different things, because his wife was amazing.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 She's kind of the great woman behind the great man kind of thing.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 He had terrible hand-riding, so she copied out seven drafts of war and peace.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 The four 1400 pages by hand, often like after he'd gone to bed and finished, she would stay up and down by candle.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 And he had terrible hand-riding, and sometimes he needed to use magnifying glass.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 But look, we have to stay on the eggs for a minute, because this is really rather than so.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 He was born in 1828, and he had this huge mental crisis around his 50th birthday,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 which I think was after war and peace in our corona.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 And he gave up smoking, gave up drinking, gave up meat, and became a massive vegetarian.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 So there was no tofu or corn, obviously.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 So eggs it was.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 And he had a rotating menu of 12 egg dishes, which he ordered to be cooked for him, including...

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 He probably had been fun to have been around throughout that time, can he?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 I think after his big life change, he was a major born.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 So eggs with brussels sprouts and beans.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 So what are we sitting next to him for, I think?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 That is an amazing meal.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 Don't order that. The first date is all I've said.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 One of them was just omelet in soup.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 And he became a serious buzzkill.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 He would cobble his own shoes, and it got so bad that his wife, after 25 years of this kind of shit from Tolstoy,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 his wife was given a gift of a joke recipe book of all the mad dishes he'd received.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 I think that's the thing, is the egg.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 She had a terrible time, notwithstanding the constant farting based on the disgusting egg base vegetarian diet.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 I've got really mixed feelings about Tolstoy, because he's such a brilliant writer, but my god he was awful to his wife.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 So Sonia, even if they met, she was one of the daughters of a family that he was friends with,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 and she was 18 when they met, and he sort of fell in love with her or fell in lust with her.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 And he proposed very soon afterwards, and amazingly he proposed.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 And the scene of his proposal is repeated in Anna Karenina, and it's always a scene I've thought that's so unrealistic.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 So there's this scene where spoilers, 11 proposals to Kitty, but he proposes by just proposing with the first letter of every word that he means to say.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 But it's not just like will you marry me, it's incredibly long sentences.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 And I remember reading this scene and thinking, that's absolutely ridiculous.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 And she can work it out. She can work it out. This is exactly how Tolstoy proposed to Sonia.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 So it was in, it was more complicated, but it would be like WYMM, for will you marry me?

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 Exactly, but in his instance, they had a whole conversation.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 And this was Tolstoy and Sonia, and he spelled out the letter of the pieces of chalk.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 And it was sentences like, in your family, there is a false view of me and your sister Liza.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 You and your sister Tanya must defend me, spelled out in initials.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 I think that could work in some cases, like if I was to go, OMG, and you were BS, and that works, doesn't it?

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 Is that how you proposed? That was the response I got.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 But yeah, sorry, I'll tell you proposed. And before they got married, he said there shouldn't be any sequence between us at all.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 I'm a massive diary writer. He was a huge diary writer. You must read all my diaries. I must read all of yours.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 She said okay, and he forced her to read all of his diaries, which involved just his constant recounting of his affairs with surf ladies.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 Yeah.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 Just lots of shagging around.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 And he'd fathered a child by a woman who still lived on his estate.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 Yeah.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 And she was still there, you know, and so Sonia read this and obviously felt very threatened by it because, you know, he'd had a job with her.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 And she was constantly worried that they were going to take up again where he'd left off.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 Yeah. And he made a readers it very weird.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 I know. In fact, he then made a transcribe. One of the first things he made a transcribe was a short story based on his relationship with this surf woman.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 Which is one of the few stories he didn't finish, which we suspect is because she drew the line at some point.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 And he's just saying, and then my wife turned up.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 What a boy.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 He sounds like a river dick.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 Yeah, I think what happened, correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think his early life where he was doing all these naughty things,

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 then he had this kind of middle-life crisis, didn't he?

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 And then that's when he started giving everything away.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 Yeah.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 And obviously neither of those parts of his life were particularly happy times for his wife.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 He did go from one extreme to the other.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 But it was when he, in the 1890s, he re-translated the New Testament.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 So he got a copy of the Bible in presumably in Greek or something like that.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 And then they had the Russian Orthodox version, which everyone else read, and he translated his own version.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 And then he realized that actually the way I should be living is vegetarianism, giving everything away, living as a surf, all that kind of thing.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 But he was tortured his whole life.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 Like if you do read bits of his diaries, which I kind of have over the years, it was like Adolescent constantly.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 So everyone thinks Tolstoy had this phase where he was shagging around and writing all these great novels,

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 and then this phase of ascetic religiousness.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 And actually, he was up and down all the time.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 His diary is full of him messing up, letting himself down, scolding himself, saying, "All right, tomorrow I will do this, this and that."

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 And it's like real kind of self-loathing, but self-involved.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 And it would be stupid stuff he'd get to ignore with himself about.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 Like one entry in his diary said, "Receive my gymnastics teacher over familiarly."

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 You know, "Hate myself for that."

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 Or "May the bad exit from the college in his drawing room."

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 And that's very interesting.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 It does sound like a lot of stuff, but I think I angst over all this time. He was so angsty.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
 He's so angsty.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 He's so angsty.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 So someone else who did that, someone else who noted their moral failures or what they thought were their moral failures obsessively,

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 was Isaac Newton, which we've discussed.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 He said, "You know, I got this wrong or I was peevish or I think threatened to kill my parents.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 Parents have burned their house down."

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 It was one thing.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 Up to that point, I was going to be like, "It sounds like such a nice idea, but I think that's probably a thing for that."

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 Also, the fact that he translated his own version of the Bible, which is like Thomas Jefferson,

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 which we talked about a few weeks ago.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 So these, that's sort of great people of history tend to think they can have another crack at the Bible.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 Yeah.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 One of his things that he tried in his early teenage diaries was he kept a note of his attempts to only go to the brothel twice a month.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 Oh.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 I know, so he really was trying.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 Yeah, he was.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 He was like the gym.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 He's got his membership, he never uses it.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 It was a waste of money.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 Got it on Christmas Day.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 I want to quit the brothel.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 After a while, you haven't been to the brothel.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 You can't really go back, because they've noticed that you haven't been...

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 When he was 16, he recorded that he sort of scourged himself and whipped himself,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 because he wanted to toughen up to physical pain.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 And then immediately the next day, he remembered that life is short.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 So he lay in bed for three days, enjoying reading and eating honey cakes.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 Oh.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 Honey cakes are nice.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 Are we all toy store it, tall store it in some way?

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000
 He wrote the Shawshank Redemption, or he wrote the original...

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 Sorry, I am feeling it for Dan here.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 So the Shawshank Redemption in the film is based on Stephen King's novella "Read to Hayworth" and the Shawshank Redemption.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 But that, in terms, is based on a short story by a tall store.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 He calls he's the truth, but waits about a man whose sentence for murder, he didn't commit.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 Really?

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 Yeah, and it's all about redemption for forgiveness.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 But he wanted Tom Hanks for the part, didn't he?

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 As a young man, Tolstoy lost so much money gambling that he had to sell off his family home, right?

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 And this was a huge shame in all of this.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 But the buyer dismantled the family home and removed it from the site it was.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 So there were just two huge wings of the house on either side, which he had not sold off.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 It was just a gaping hole in between them.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 Oh, that's amazing.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 Well, all the useful rooms in the middle bit.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 20-on-sweep bathrooms and no bedrooms.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 Okay, that is all of our facts.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000
