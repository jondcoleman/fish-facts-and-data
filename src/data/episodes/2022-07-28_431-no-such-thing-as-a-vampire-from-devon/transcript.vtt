WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
 Hi everybody Andy here just before we start this week's show wanted to let you know we have a very special guest on

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.400
 This week Anna is away very sadly. She's on her holidays. But the great news is that in her place

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.120
 We have the absolutely magnificent Rachel Paris now

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.400
 I'm sure you may have heard of Rachel if you haven't frankly wherever you're being guys. She's a

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.800
 Comedian she's a musician. She's an actor an improviser. She does it all

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.160
 She has been on so many brilliant shows and she is a musical comedian as well

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.240
 She tours the country with a grand piano performing

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.000
 Magnificently funny solo shows. She's basically the heir to Tom Lear and Tim Minchin put together and on top of it all

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.280
 She has just published her first book. It's called Advice from Strangers

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.000
 And it's a kind of comedy book slash memoir slash feminist manifesto

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.120
 All centered around the time that she traveled around the country asking her audiences to give her pieces of advice

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.680
 It's funny. It's serious. It's hilarious. It's uplifting and we're so glad that she could come on the show because as you're about to hear

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.040
 She was absolutely great. So that's it without further ado on with the show

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:29.160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.640
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray James Harkin

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.400
 And it's our very special guest Rachel Paris and once again

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.320
 We have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.520
 We go starting with fact number one and that is Rachel

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.360
 My fact is that list the composer played the piano so hard in his concerts that he regularly broke piano strings and

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.600
 Superfans would nick those strings and make bracelets out of them

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.080
 I've so I don't play the piano

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.840
 But it feels like that's quite a hard thing to do to break a string

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.160
 It's a break of a guitar string, right? Yeah, but piano string. It's rare

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.480
 He's not the only person to ever do that, but I think that I think that it happened to him all the time

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.240
 That was like his thing is I'm gonna break this. Why was he so angry? I don't know. Maybe he just had like really heavy hands or something

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.160
 There were there were comments that he had massive hands

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.640
 Which allowed for him to stretch a lot of piano players say that that's not actually a thing

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.160
 There was certain there were certain patterns that he would play that a big hand doesn't necessarily

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.720
 We actually have plaster casts of his hands, so we know exactly how big they are. Yeah, do you mean in your home?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.600
 They're here tonight

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.360
 We find that his fingers were slender and long, but they weren't like massively long light

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.760
 I think right man enough had really big hands man enough had 12 inches and his hands I

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.800
 Measured mine mines nine inch span because I've got pretty good small hands

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.040
 But a big stretch on but yeah, when you measure 12 inches out on a rule, that's insane

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.440
 So right man enough was known for having like absurdly big hands and you can only play right man enough pieces

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.720
 If you've got those you can fake it a bit

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.000
 But you have to do some very clever maneuvering if Rachmaninoff was alive today

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.560
 Yeah, and if he if he did that mine, you know when you mime a phone

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.320
 Your thumb in your little finger. Yeah, he would it's the top of his head with his thumb knock his hat off

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.360
 He could only mime a car phone from the 80s

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.640
 So this whole thing of him banging on the piano

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.100
 He was a passionate amazing player and that was kind of a thing. He was like a rock and roll list

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.280
 Like rock and roll wasn't a list but fortunately if he did smash up a piano

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.280
 He always had two pianos on stage with them

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.080
 That's such a cool idea and I'm not sure if it was necessarily because he knew he was gonna smash up a piano

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.560
 It's because he was such a showman that he wanted to give both sides of his face basically to the audience

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.720
 So he didn't have a roadie bringing on the piano when he broke his like dragging it along. I think he would drag it out

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.720
 Really? Yeah, it's like I read an account of a gig where he

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.640
 He he dragged the second piano out and I think if you were an audience member there was a second piano

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.680
 You would be slightly disappointed if it didn't come into play. Yeah, you think he hadn't given it his all

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.680
 It's like a Checos piano, isn't it?

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.120
 And he had these like beautiful flowing locks of hair which made him very popular as he really had the whole like Elvis

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.880
 You know someone coined the term listomania

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.880
 Yeah, that people were absolutely obsessed with him the way they are sort of today about pop stars

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.580
 But he actually had the talent to earn it. But yeah, people would ask for locks of his hair

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.080
 Yes, and they would collect his cigarette butts

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.300
 They would wear them in the chains on their necklaces with his initials

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:57.520
 There is it like it's a it did happen and apparently everyone hated it because she was carrying another stinky old cigar end basically

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.760
 They were like Susan

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:13.760
 I was reading listomania does sounds like it was a bit of a just like beatlemania

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.360
 You know where it was just screaming girls and stuff like that

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.400
 But apparently the original term the mania was used in terms medically

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.640
 It was it wasn't just that people were just getting too excited

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.040
 They genuinely thought that this might be leading to medical conditions

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.520
 So if list came into town, they'd be like, you know, we got to get doctors ready. We got I'm making that up

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.280
 To effect. So that's what the mania meant. It was right people actually got ill. Yeah, exactly

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.560
 I was thinking that his performance is a bit like you too, Andy and Rachel you do ostentatious, right?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.120
 Which is an improvised Jane Austen play and his concerts were quite a bit like that

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.140
 I was reading it's a while since I've seen you two live by

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.160
 Paulie received

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.640
 Well, he would like get what a member of his audience to give him a little sort of motif a little theme

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.400
 And they might just go do-do-do-do-do or something maybe not like the Nokia theme

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.800
 And then he would spend the rest of the concert just like doing the amazing bits

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:21.840
 He had a very interesting life, so he was he was a prodigy as a child and he was your hot house by his

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.840
 No

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.360
 These was like doodling around to they were but it was kind of interesting just on that

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:37.160
 We'll go back to that but like because mass market pianos are just coming and also the French Revolution had just happened

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.520
 So you had pianos were only played by posh people and they were really really expensive and you could only get them if you

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.520
 Super posh but then

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.920
 Suddenly just around the time of Mozart and then list after him

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.640
 Suddenly you could get cheap pianos and that meant that children could play it children could practice it

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.760
 And so you had these children coming up who were as good as the you know posh

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.160
 You know and also all the previous pianos were cheap if slightly spattered with the blood of aristocrats

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.240
 Some somewhere

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.920
 But so you get so his dad took him around his dad worked him like a dog for years

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:21.320
 You know years his father died when Franz was 15 and he he took pupils as a 15 year old prodigy

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.360
 And then had this incredible performing career until I think his late 30s maybe and then step back

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:33.200
 Yeah, because he had a lover a countess love hello who who encouraged him to compose

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.200
 She said look this before me is all well and good

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.480
 he's making a lot of money, but and he just kind of stepped back he moved to Weimar and

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.200
 Just started composing who was the lover do you know? Yes? She was called countess

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:53.240
 No, sorry. She was a princess. He was married to a countess and traded up to Princess Caroline von sein Wittgenstein

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.080
 Anyway, she left her own marriage for him

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.480
 And there was this whole thing about whether they could annul the marriage so they could be her marriage

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.320
 So they could be married and the Pope agreed to it and then he changed his mind

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.400
 It was a big old thing

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.800
 But yes, so he took a really crap job as a couple meister at the court of Weimar and he had to wear

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.440
 Archaic clothes to perform. Oh, well cuz he was a rock star and then he went

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.480
 Suddenly it's like a music beef eater or something

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:22.160
 I did think of ostentatious a bit and that you're basically dressing and stuff that was the hide-of-fashion 200 years ago

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.240
 And the pay was so bad. It only paid for his cigars

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:34.120
 But we don't know how quality his cigars were to be fair. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, he could have sold the one eBay afterwards

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.560
 Yeah, and Caroline de sein Wittgenstein

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:45.560
 She was a Catholic princess wasn't she and she got him into Catholicism and then he went on to try and become the Pope's

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.440
 personal

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:55.280
 He wanted to be the official composer to the Pope

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.400
 But he was turned down and the alleged story of why he was turned down is that apparently he was playing in the

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.760
 Cloisters one day and all the nuns in the nunnery ran to him and started kissing him and

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:13.600
 And the Pope decided well if he's like that if he's gonna have that effect on women

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.400
 We're not gonna have him as the official how hot was this guy

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:24.720
 Was I think he was he was six foot two. We've established. He had big old hands

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.040
 Yeah, and he had a lot of mistresses in his life

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.120
 He did he did in later life take holy orders, but minor holy orders. He didn't become a full priest

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.040
 I think maybe because it would have involved of our celibacy and he was just he wasn't quite ready

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.040
 He just did it as a hobby

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:50.240
 Well, here's a weird thing in 2018 in Spain's got talent

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.080
 He didn't

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Showed up

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:07.920
 He did not show up itself

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:14.320
 However, he kind of did in a way because one of the competitors of that year was a guy called Michael Andreas

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.520
 Who's supposedly the great-great-grandson of lists really?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:25.400
 Supposedly and he said to be the son of not only list but of one of his prodigies lists prodigies

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:31.200
 Who was called Sophie mentor and Sophie mentor was supposedly the best his favorite and she did have a kid

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.960
 But by all the accounts she had it with someone else, but this guy's claiming that he is the great descended from both lines

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.200
 Yeah descended from both lines

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:44.660
 So he's even picked like a mother that you can't trace it back to so supposedly we have a descendant who's incredible by the way

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.560
 I've seen him play. He was a prodigy as well. He was a child prodigy

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.960
 He was winning competitions since he was five years old

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:56.920
 Rachel because you're a classical pianist. I am I think I was a prodigy

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:06.600
 Piano competitions when I was small and I was teaching when I was 15. Really. Yeah. Wow. We teaching what I'm saying

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.600
 Is you don't have to be a prodigy to teach at 15?

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.080
 Were you teaching smaller children or were you teaching? Yeah smaller children. So I was like grade eight and I was teaching grade one

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.600
 That's really impressive. That's a guy that you're smoking at the moment. I like that

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:31.760
 I do think if you've got the willingness to practice and basic like strong musical aptitude and if you start young then you're gonna be a child prodigy

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:43.240
 Moving down like fuck wasn't that shit hot, but like, you know, that's so interesting. Do you hear how words get there?

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:51.360
 Do you guys know Lang Lang? Yeah, one of the big concerto players piano players of recent years and he's a global name

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.360
 He only got into playing piano. He was a child prodigy by the way. Oh, yeah

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:11.200
 I want to see Rachel and Britain's got talent. A little kid comes up. Like this again. Go on. Child prodigy, it just means has a piano and the time

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:20.520
 He was inspired hearing Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody in number two by Tom from Tom and Jerry

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:26.520
 And that's how he got into playing the piano. Oh, I totally grew up watching that. I can really understand that. Yeah

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:33.520
 I was called the cat concerto and it was Tom was playing piano Jerry's on the inside gets woken up and they start having a fight

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:39.520
 It's an amazing piece. Supposedly a lot of piano players began their love watching this one cartoon of Tom and Jerry

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:46.520
 And then when you get older the the piece. Yeah, it's the Hungarian Rhapsody, which is already a phenomenal piece incredibly difficult to play

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:52.520
 I can play the first few pages and then it gets to the really hard bit and I'm like no, but in the cartoon which I had on VHS

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.520
 So I've watched it over and over and over again. They mess with it

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.520
 They pull it around and they go into like the can can and they go into little jazz bit in the middle of it

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:07.520
 And then return to the piece. So when I got older and I started playing it, I had I had be like, oh, oh the can can doesn't happen here

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:14.520
 This bit doesn't turn into jazz. So confusing. I've got one other connection that Liszt made in his life

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:19.520
 So we said before Liszt had big old hands, right? Yeah. Yeah. There's someone else he met who also had big hands

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:26.520
 George Elliot. George Elliot. George Elliot. We have a running fact on this podcast that George Elliot had great big hands

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.520
 She had one big head. She could play right now, but only the right hand

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:38.520
 Did she have different size hands? Yeah, but we don't. Supposedly, she was a dairy maid in younger life and she turned the butter

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.520
 I milked the cows. I milked the cows and this gave one absolutely honking hulk fist

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:50.520
 Wow. And if you look at pictures of her, they never show her right hand. They didn't have enough paint. Didn't have enough paint

00:13:50.520 --> 00:14:00.520
 But basically old big hands herself. George Elliot. Big hand herself. Sorry. In 1854 she visited Liszt with her lover George Lewis

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.520
 They were fleeing scandal because he'd left his wife to be with female George Elliot and they made friends

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.520
 They had coffee together. Imagine the conversations they would have had. Wow. High five

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:17.520
 [Laughter]

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:28.520
 Okay, my fact this week is that the downhill skiing at the Nagano Olympics in 1998 was postponed due to snow

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.520
 [Laughter]

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.520
 Too much. Too much. Too much snow

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:42.520
 If you go on Encyclopedia Britannica about the Nagano Olympics, it says the most memorable aspect of the Nagano Games was arguably the weather

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:48.520
 Oh, wow. It said it brought heavy snow and periods of freezing rain. There was even an earthquake

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:54.520
 An earthquake? Yes, that's incredible. Where is Nagano? It's in Japan

00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:00.520
 Oh, well that's prone to earthquakes, isn't it? You want to pick somewhere right in the middle of a tectonic plate if you don't want to

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.520
 Yeah, it wasn't like a massive one, but everyone felt it who was there at the time

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.520
 If you were halfway through a ski jump, you'd be the only person who didn't feel it

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.520
 And you'd land and everyone else would have fallen over a door

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:19.520
 Maybe the earth moves to your advantage by about 50 meters until you've broken the world record

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.520
 [Laughter]

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:32.520
 But yeah, the LA Times said at the time, they said, "We are seeing firsthand the fundamental problem of the Winter Olympics they are held during the winter"

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.520
 [Laughter]

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:40.520
 It's like the ski resorts often have not enough snow, don't they? Or they say, "Oh, the snow hasn't happened" or "It's fallen"

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.520
 Do you ever get the wrong kind of snow? I feel like that's a...

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.520
 Yeah, I've been dragged into the world of snow by my husband

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.520
 Oh, you walked through that wardrobe, didn't you?

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.520
 That's it, yeah, what a nightmare

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.520
 My husband's a huge skier in snowboarder

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.520
 I am not never skied before meeting him and I get dragged to ski resorts now

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.520
 and I keep trying to learn to ski really painfully

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.520
 But also, yeah, the cancellations for snow happen at ski resorts all the time

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.520
 They're like, "Yeah, the slope's closed because of snow"

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.520
 Yeah, I think that skiing is something that you should be a child prodigy at, right?

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.520
 Because it's easier to learn when you're a child and you don't have the fear

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.520
 I learn when I was in my 30s and I say, "Learned"

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.520
 It sounds like we're at a similar standard

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.520
 It's the worst thing

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.520
 I feel like for me at the moment, skiing is simply trying to stop

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.520
 It's all it is, I'm going to deep plow all the way down

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.520
 Why aren't I stopping?

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.520
 Deep plow, what's that?

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.520
 When you put your skis in a V-shape

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.520
 I see

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.520
 Whenever I've gone skiing, I've mastered the going fast and the spinning

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.520
 and the, you know, not the spinning, sort of the sharp turns

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.520
 Spinning, spinning as well

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.520
 I've mastered the roly-poly down the hill as well

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.520
 But I've never mastered the sideways stop

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.520
 So no matter how cool I've looked, I've always had to go into the big V-plow

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.520
 Hangerly

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.520
 Like Spider-Man trying to hold the train from falling off the track

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.520
 That's a pretty cool way of describing what you're doing

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.520
 I'm sure it looks that good when you're doing it

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.520
 That's going down, doing his pizza

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.520
 He's got Spider-Man, Spider-Man

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.520
 With great power!

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.520
 Oh, do you think Spider-Man's ever been skiing?

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.520
 Sorry, never mind

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.520
 But would he enjoy it?

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.520
 Spiders don't like the cold, do they?

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.520
 He's not a real spider

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.520
 He's not a real man

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.520
 He's neither, he's a freak

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.520
 He's just a boy

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.520
 I'm the only one who's never been skiing

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.520
 I'm surprised you've never been skiing

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.520
 Why?

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.520
 Not because you seem like someone who would have been skiing

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.520
 Because you're posh

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.520
 I think that's why we're all dancing around

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.520
 I think if people were to meet me and you

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.520
 They'd think I haven't been skiing and you have been skiing

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.520
 I see

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.520
 But it just goes to show that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.520
 People would look at me and say he must be just eating pies and drinking blue wicked

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.520
 Too much to be skiing

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.520
 People look at me and see like polo and croquet

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.520
 I'm afraid so

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.520
 Oh dear

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.520
 You guys all know this and it's all really common

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.520
 So ski jumpers, they have to get a little friction on the bottom of the skis as possible

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.520
 Because I guess you get loads of ski

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.520
 But they got fast

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.520
 Yeah, and the plasticky on the bottom

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.520
 And they drip hot wax onto it

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.520
 And then they iron their skis sometimes

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.520
 To get the wax distributed

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.520
 Yeah, and all the ski makers are really secretive

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.520
 Like competitive ski teams are really secretive about the ingredients of their wax

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.520
 Oh really?

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.520
 Yeah, because they give the bottles boring looking labels or code names and all this

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.520
 But the wax wears off as you're going down

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.520
 So that's a problem

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.520
 And in 2007 a pair of chemists who were called Peter Styring and Alex Ruth

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.520
 They developed, I love this, skis which wax themselves

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.520
 Self waxing ski

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.520
 So you pour the liquid wax into a little reservoir

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.520
 Which is between your boot and the ski

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.520
 Self waxing, you're doing a lot of the work, the skis aren't doing it

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.520
 Exactly, yeah, but then it's there

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.520
 So you've got it like an air, so you've got a bubble beneath it

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.520
 And then you're not allowed to have any means of power down there

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.520
 But the wax feeds into this little tube

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.520
 Which runs all the way along the ski surface

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.520
 And as you go into a turn, you put pressure down, don't you?

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.520
 And it sort of pops a bit of the wax along the bottom of the ski

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.520
 That's clever

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.520
 I don't know if it was allowed or banned or anything like that

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.520
 It feels super off the books

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.520
 It does, doesn't it?

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.520
 The coldness of the Winter Olympics, it is a problem

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.520
 It's like a big problem for a lot of the events

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.520
 One of the early day things that happened in 1924 games

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.520
 Is that the guys who were having to use the stopwatches

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.520
 In order to monitor how fast you were crossing the line

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.520
 Their hands just got too cold and so they were just getting it wrong

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.520
 All the time

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.520
 So there was actually a gold medalist who won

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.520
 Who was called Charles Dutrell, who was an American

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.520
 Who won his event despite being utterly perplexed

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.520
 By the fact that he'd managed it

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.520
 Because he'd never ever trained for this event before

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.520
 He came in thinking, "I'm going to come last of everyone"

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.520
 And he ended up winning it

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.520
 He didn't even train for the event, he sort of just showed up and did it

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.520
 Are you telling us that the stopwatch didn't work?

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.520
 Exactly, the stopwatch ran a bit too long

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.520
 Oh sorry, a bit too quick

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.520
 The guys' hands were freezing and it was a big problem

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.520
 So, yeah

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.520
 Did you hear about Remy Lindholm in the Beijing Olympics quite recently?

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.520
 No

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.520
 He did the 50K cross country ski

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.520
 Well, it was 50K, but it got short into 30K because the weather was so bad

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.520
 And at the very end, he needed a heat pack to treat his frostbitten penis

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.520
 Apparently, he should have kept it in his trousers

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.520
 He forgot one of his poles

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:51.520
 And the thing is, this is the second time that that happened to him in less than a year

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.520
 Does he have an unusually frostbite prone penis, I wonder

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.520
 It feels like he must do it, there must be something there

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.520
 Maybe he's not wearing a crucial thermal pant layer or something

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.520
 None of his mates have told him

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.520
 Yeah, the thermal pants are available

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.520
 He's still going on one thin pair of M&S briefs

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.520
 The article I read didn't presuppose what was going on

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.520
 Yeah, I think that now it's happened a second time

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.520
 I think we are allowed to ask the question

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.520
 Maybe you're prone to it once it's happened once

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.520
 Oh yeah

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.520
 The tip never really recovers

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.520
 Bloody hell

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.520
 It's just a guess, you know, I'm not an expert

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.520
 Yeah

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.520
 Anyway, that was the thing that happened

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.520
 Poor guy

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:33.520
 I found another quite funny cancellation of a sports event

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.520
 In 2016, the Premier League match between Manu and Bournemouth

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.520
 Sorry, I said Manu, that's Manchester United

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.520
 For people who don't know

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.520
 And that's football

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.520
 American football

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.520
 No, I knew you wouldn't know

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.520
 You don't look like a football fan

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.520
 Too busy teeing up for another trucker

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520
 What?

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.520
 That's polo 10

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.520
 Well, half of it was

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.520
 So they had to cancel the match at the very last minute

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.520
 When a suspicious item was found in the gents' loo at Old Trafford

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.520
 But the suspicious item had been put there

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.520
 By the security firm that was monitoring for suspicious items

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.520
 So they'd done it as a trial test thing

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.520
 This is what a suspicious item looks like

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.520
 Yeah, like, can you see, if you can find it, what's the drill, what will you do

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.520
 But they accidentally left it there

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.520
 And the match got cancelled

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.520
 Wow, so funny, I wonder what it looked like

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.520
 Probably had wires coming out

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.520
 Exactly, they had a big sort of black cartoon ball

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.520
 With a fuse coming out

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.520
 And bomb written in white on the side

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:46.520
 Have you guys heard of the, this is an amazing thing, it was proposed

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.520
 In 2002, it was a British firm called Snowdonia Gateway Limited

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.520
 They wanted to build a revolving ski slope

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.520
 Okay?

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.520
 Okay

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.520
 So what it would be, it would be 13 stories high

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.520
 And it would be kind of like a record player, but on an angle

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.520
 Okay, if you can imagine that

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.520
 And you would start down the slope

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.520
 As the slope revolved and moved upwards

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.520
 Okay, now the incline was going to be 300 meters long

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.520
 But the plan was, if you skied slowly enough

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.520
 And if it got up to its full revolving speed

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520
 Permanent skiing

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.520
 Wow

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.520
 But the speed that I skied

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.520
 Which is really, really slope like

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.520
 I'm going to be going backwards around that

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.520
 You'd fall off the top

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.520
 Yeah, and they would generate permanent fresh snow with snow guns

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.520
 It's really clever

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.520
 That's extraordinary

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.520
 So it never happened, sadly, as far as I can tell

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.520
 Is it because it's completely impossible to build?

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.520
 Weirdly, no

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.520
 I think it was just too ambitious an example of the thing

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.520
 So these days, I think there is at least one rotating disc slope ski simulator

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.520
 In Europe

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.520
 I think it's someone like the Netherlands

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.520
 But it's quite small, it's not 13 stories high

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.520
 And allowing you to like a sort of ski giant mountain thing

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.520
 That's so cool

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.520
 It just sounds so much fun

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.520
 Wow, it sounds incredible

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.520
 I can see the problem that if you were at a certain speed

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.520
 You would just be stuck

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.520
 Like you would have to be rescued, right?

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.520
 Well, they can turn it, they can slow it

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.520
 Yeah, at the end of the day

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.520
 Like they're not going to stop it for every middle speed skier, right?

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.520
 No, they have to get down eventually

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.520
 It might be like the waltzes that you just have a one go

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.520
 And then you have to come off and other people go on

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.520
 Imagine the poor guy, poor guy, right?

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.520
 It's my frostbitten penis twice

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.520
 He's going to have one more ski in a very nice time

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.520
 Oh, no!

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.520
 I'm never coming off!

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:33.520
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.520
 That is Andy

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.520
 My effect is that the 18th century health writer

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.520
 William Buchan told his readers

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.520
 That anyone suffering from persistent deafness

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.520
 Might benefit from pouring their own urine

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.520
 Into their ears each night

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.520
 That's really good

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.520
 I'm just looking at my notes

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.520
 Because I paraphrased what you said to us

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.520
 And I've written

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.520
 In 1772, William Buchan told people to piss in their own ears

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.520
 Wow

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.520
 He pretty much did

00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.520
 Pretty much, right?

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.520
 Can I just say, it does seem possible

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.520
 That the first person who heard this advice

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.520
 Simply misheard

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.520
 Oh, yeah?

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.520
 No, they are deaf

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.520
 Did they say, you know, "I know a guy in touring"

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.520
 Or "Do you want some tea? I'm pouring"

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.520
 Are they reliable sources, right?

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.520
 Well, William Buchan was this writer

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.520
 He wrote this book called "Domestic Medicine"

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.520
 Which was basically the Beal and Endle

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.520
 Of health advice in the 18th century

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.520
 He was a proper doctor

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.520
 And I think it was actually pretty good

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.520
 As in he wasn't a quack

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520
 He was really trying

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.520
 And it had chapters on absolutely everything under the sun

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.520
 One of the chapters is on deafness

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.520
 And he writes, "A gentleman on whose veracity I can depend

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.520
 Told me that after using many things to no purpose

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.520
 For an obstinate deafness, he was at last advised

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.520
 To put a few drops of his own urine warm into his ears

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.520
 Every night and morning

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.520
 From which he received great benefit"

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.520
 Okay

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.520
 He does say you could also use a salt solution

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.520
 Would it work?

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.520
 Would it work?

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.520
 Like, let's say you've got wax in your ears

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.520
 Would it moisten them, perhaps?

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.520
 I might do

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.520
 You'd need phenomenal aim

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.520
 That's the problem

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.520
 That's the...

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520
 It's a few drops

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.520
 That's a good detail that I didn't know

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.520
 When I tried it earlier this morning

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.520
 That would have been very helpful

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.520
 But he also had advice in the book for putting onions

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.520
 Onion juice in your ear

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.520
 In order to help with deafness

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.520
 So is it just a sort of like any liquid that has some kind of

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.520
 I don't know, acidic property or something?

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.520
 This is the thought slightly is that

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.520
 Earache will eventually go

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.520
 And the thought is that maybe what it was

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.520
 Was a sort of pseudo thing

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.520
 Where it was just making it feel a bit bearable

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.520
 And then you mistake in the fact that it

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.520
 That it happens because people still parents

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.520
 There's blogs all over on those mum blogs

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.520
 We'll be missing a little bit

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.520
 No, using onions

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.520
 Using onions

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.520
 No, it's a community, Andy

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.520
 That book, by the way, "Domestic Medicine"

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.520
 There is an argument that it might not have been

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.520
 Written by William Buchan

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.520
 And might have been written by friend of the show

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.520
 Willie Smelly

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.520
 Willie Smelly

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.520
 Who's Willie Smelly?

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.520
 The original gynecologist

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.520
 The original midwife

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.520
 Midwife

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.520
 Not that Willie Smelly

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.520
 The other Willie Smelly

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.520
 The encyclopedia

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.520
 The encyclopedia

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520
 The first editor

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.520
 Yeah, so there are two famous Willie Smellys

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.520
 From the 19th century

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.520
 And 19th century, one of them

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.520
 And this one, according to Smelly's son

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.520
 Who's called Ker Smelly

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.520
 He said that Willie Smelly

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.520
 Might have entirely rewritten his original draft

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.520
 So Buchan handed in his draft

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.520
 And then Smelly sort of put all of his own bits in

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.520
 So it could be that his was normal

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.520
 And then Smelly added the urea stuff

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.520
 I wouldn't want Willie Smelly's urine in my ears

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.520
 Also, the interesting thing about this book

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.520
 Is that it was sort of a sort of equivalent

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.520
 To what I'm trying to say would be a magician

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.520
 Releasing all of the trade secrets

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.520
 Of how to do tricks

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.520
 Because doctors at the time

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.520
 Didn't want patients to know this kind of thing

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.520
 They actually looked down on this book

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.520
 Saying you shouldn't be giving this information

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.520
 Out to the patients

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.520
 Of what we do

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.520
 And so he kind of put it all in

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.520
 Might you put like just one bit of advice in there

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.520
 That was wrong

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.520
 To try and trick people into

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.520
 Or a bit like those

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.520
 Like internet spoiler things

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.520
 It's like, step one is this

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.520
 But for more, contact your doctor

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.520
 He wrote a lot of medical advice

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.520
 William Buchan

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.520
 He wrote this book called Advice to Mothers

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.520
 Which again, quite democratising

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.520
 Of becoming a parent

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.520
 Oh god, I'm strapping in for this

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.520
 He wrote, well

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.520
 He wrote to mothers that, and I'm quoting here

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.520
 In all cases of dwarfishness or deformity

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.520
 99 out of 100 are owing to the folly, misconduct

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.520
 Or neglect of mothers

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.520
 Wow

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.520
 Which was, I'm sure, science at the time

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.520
 But...

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.520
 It's just nice

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.520
 For mothers to feel more guilt

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.520
 There isn't enough going around

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.520
 Yeah, I think mothers didn't feel bad

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.520
 Until he really advanced the form

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.520
 So, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.520
 He was an amazing guy

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.520
 Like, he started young

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.520
 He was a child prodigy, actually

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.520
 He was going around pissing at other children's ears

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.520
 Like, we're joking about this

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.520
 But I do feel like, as it goes on

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.520
 This is proving my point

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.520
 It's just like, anyone who excels at anything

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.520
 Probably excels as a child

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.520
 Yeah, it's true, yeah

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.520
 No, he supposedly was the amateur doctor

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.520
 To the village when he was still at school

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.520
 So he was so...

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.520
 So annoying

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.520
 Oh, it's not like...

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.520
 You'd be so annoyed by him

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.520
 Wouldn't you be the baby doctor?

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.520
 Not if he was helping you

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.520
 No, you would be annoyed

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.520
 Really?

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.520
 Especially if he's helping you

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.520
 What doctors have to put up with

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.520
 Particularly baby doctors

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.520
 It sounds horrific

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.520
 Imagine a 12-year-old boy coming to you

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.520
 When you're pregnant going, "Oh, it's your fault!"

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:41.520
 You haven't been behaving right

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.520
 You know, one of the things that Buckin suggested

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.520
 That when you...

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.520
 If you'd burnt yourself

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.520
 The cure was to hold it back near a fire

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.520
 What?

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.520
 Yeah

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.520
 I did read that

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.520
 Hold it quite near the fire

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.520
 There was a few other things

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.520
 Like you should put salt on it

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.520
 Salt?

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.520
 Yeah

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.520
 It's like the old saying goes

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.520
 Rub salt in the wound

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.520
 And everyone's a winner

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.520
 It does sound like he was like a child doctor

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.520
 But he didn't go on to learn any more

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.520
 Just left the knowledge he had at 12

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.520
 One of the earliest records

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.520
 For treating hearing loss

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.520
 Is from the Ebers Papyrus

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.520
 Which is an old ancient Egyptian papyrus

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.520
 And that's specifically for wax buildup

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.520
 And they suggest that you put olive oil

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.520
 Red lead, ant eggs, bat wings

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.520
 Or goat urine into your ears

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.520
 So they do go for the urine quite early

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.520
 And also, olive oil, use that now

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.520
 Olive oil for blood tears

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.520
 Yeah

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.520
 Do you hang the bat wings out like a...

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.520
 They're literally flapping out your ears

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.520
 Rachel, you've just written a book of advice

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.520
 Effectively, based on old advice from strangers

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.520
 Correct

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.520
 Is there any honkingly bad advice that you received?

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.520
 Because I saw some of the gigs where you collected advice

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.520
 Yeah, correct

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.520
 Well, some of it I just really didn't agree with

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.520
 Some of it was very individual

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.520
 Like acquire as many guinea pigs as possible

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.520
 And that openness is bound to follow

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.520
 Which I really profound as a previous owner of a guinea pig

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.520
 I don't think that's true

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.520
 I don't think they improve in large numbers

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.520
 Yes

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.520
 Well, you didn't try

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.520
 No, that's true

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.520
 You only have one

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.520
 You didn't pass through the threshold, which is nine

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.520
 In Peru, they eat guinea pigs, don't they?

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.520
 So if it was a Peruvian person

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.520
 It might be just a way of, you know, stocking up before lockdown

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.520
 Yeah

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.520
 Give a man a guinea pig and a leap for a day

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.520
 Give a man two guinea pigs

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.520
 As long as what is male and once female

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.520
 And they're both of the right age

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.520
 They're sort of, yeah

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.520
 And they fancy each other

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.520
 And this consent

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.520
 Yeah

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.520
 And he'll eat for the rest of his life

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.520
 I also, I enjoyed and really disagree with the advice

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:56.520
 Given smile whenever possible

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.520
 Which I think is a very old school idea of like

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.520
 Just whack a smile on no matter what you're feeling

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.520
 And it made me think of all those songs of like

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.520
 Smile when your heart is breaking

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.520
 Smile when your heart is breaking

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.520
 Put on a happy smile, you know

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.520
 Like all the wartime songs about smiling through the war

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.520
 Smiling through loss

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.520
 Smiling through tragedy

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.520
 Smiling through heartbreak

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.520
 Which was very of the 20th century

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.520
 It was very keep calm and carry on

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.520
 Bottle it in

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.520
 Yeah, exactly

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.520
 Don't let your smile ruin my day

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.520
 Bottle it up

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.520
 Pour a few drops into your ears

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.520
 Each night and morning

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.520
 So yes, I did not agree with that advice

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.520
 But it's quite common advice it's still given

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.520
 Do you know the first agony art was?

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.520
 No

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.520
 So far as we know?

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.520
 No, I don't know

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.520
 Clarina

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.520
 Plenty of the elder

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:54.520
 No, okay, so I would say this is, James is closer in time

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.520
 Possibly the 1600s

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.520
 It's probably really in the break

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.520
 In 1691 there was a guy called John Dunton

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.520
 And he had an experience where he was having an affair

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.520
 He needed some advice anonymously

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.520
 But there was nowhere to ask

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.520
 And so rather than thinking I'll just leave that

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.520
 He thought, "Wow, what if there was a place I could ask?"

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.520
 And so he invented an entire magazine

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.520
 The Athenian Gazette, which its job was basically

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.520
 To just answer questions

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.520
 So members of the public would just send in their questions

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.520
 And everyone on staff would write answers to

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.520
 And that is sort of like the modern version of the agony art

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.520
 There's probably examples of things like the Oracle of Delphi

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.520
 And all that sort of like the original agony art

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.520
 So this Athenian Gazette

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.520
 Or Athenian Mercury, it was also called

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.520
 It was supposedly this group of a dozen of the best astrologers

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.520
 And mathematicians and philosophers in the whole of London

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.520
 And scholars and all this

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.520
 Actually, it was just him and his brother-in-law

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.520
 And two other blokes

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.520
 And they were complete amateurs

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.520
 And they didn't know anything

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.520
 But people loved writing in the questions

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.520
 So the questions included

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.520
 What is the cause of suction?

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.520
 This is about love and relationships

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:14.520
 Why do Scotchman hate swine's flesh?

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.520
 Good questions

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.520
 I really like this one

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:22.520
 If I'm thinking of committing any great and enormous crime and sin as adultery

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.520
 But do not personally and actually commit it

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.520
 Am I guilty of the crime and sin?

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.520
 That's a great question

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.520
 Wow, I mean, that's given to agony aunts today

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.520
 Yeah, that's true

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.520
 Here's a couple more

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.520
 Why does love generally turn to coldness and neglect after marriage?

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:44.520
 I don't write it, Polly, if you're listening, I'm just reading it

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.520
 It was a bit QI-ish actually

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.520
 So one of them was

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.520
 Why should the putting of a man's hand in cold water

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.520
 Occasion a sudden emission of urine?

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.520
 Yeah, we have done that

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.520
 Yeah, and they said

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.520
 And I have done that again in life

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.520
 And they said it's not true

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.520
 They pointed out it's a vulgar error

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.520
 What?

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.520
 Sorry

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.520
 It was a coincidence then

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.520
 That you pissed yourself

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.520
 We did that to our baby last week

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.520
 Wait, wait

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.520
 So he had a fever

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.520
 We were in hospital doing some checks

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.520
 And they said to check for a urine infection

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.520
 We really need a urine sample

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.520
 And obviously it's a baby

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.520
 You can't just make him wait

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.520
 And he was a bit dehydrated from the fever

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.520
 So he was weaning not very often

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.520
 So they gave us a test tube with a funnel

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.520
 And they said you've just got to sit here

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.520
 And wait for him to wait

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.520
 And be ready to leap into action

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.520
 So bless him

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.520
 I was just for like a good hour and a half

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.520
 He was just sitting there

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.520
 With like my husband holding him up

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.520
 Me like staring at his winky

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.520
 Waiting, waiting to leap for the way

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.520
 And we were, it got to like an hour

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.520
 And we were like, oh my god

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.520
 I don't think we should blame parents

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.520
 But she does have a complex

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.520
 Me just staring at it

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.520
 Shaking a little tube

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.520
 And at the end we were like

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.520
 What about that thing of like

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.520
 If you put your hand or your foot in water

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.520
 Then it will make you wee

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.520
 So we tried it

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.520
 So we got one of those cardboard

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.520
 Bucket things that they had in the hospital

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.520
 And we filled it with warm water

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.520
 And we put his feet in it

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.520
 And it didn't work initially

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.520
 But about two minutes after he'd stopped

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.520
 Having his feet in water

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.520
 And what he did then wee

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.520
 But again, it's probably a coincidence

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.520
 We don't know

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.520
 That's science

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.520
 Maybe it's taking your feet out of warm water

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.520
 That makes you do that

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.520
 But people don't normally go to sleep

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.520
 In a swimming pool

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.520
 So we don't know

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.520
 We don't know

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.520
 One other interesting notable name

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520
 From this period

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.520
 Who was into agony arting

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.520
 Slash uncleing

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.520
 Was Daniel Defoe

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.520
 Oh

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.520
 Author of Robinson Crusoe

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.520
 And yeah

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.520
 He would reply to members of the public

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.520
 And interestingly

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.520
 You know

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.520
 A lot of these replies were sometimes really crude

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.520
 So in one reply to someone

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.520
 He actually called someone

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.520
 Even though he sort of blanked out the full spelling of it

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.520
 But he called someone a whore

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.520
 You know, he basically disagreed with what she was trying to ask

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.520
 In terms of illicit sexual stuff

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.520
 And he said you were a whore

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.520
 I mean, it was really quite crude back then

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.520
 Terrible

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.520
 Just going back to deafness

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.520
 I got very into this woman

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.520
 Called Jaipreet Verdi

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.520
 Has written a book about

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.520
 Historical cures for deafness

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.520
 And it's also about

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.520
 The concept of deafness needing a cure

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.520
 It's very interesting

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.520
 But she talks about ear trumpets

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.520
 You know, like, remember in "Allo Allo"

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.520
 It's like the ear trumpet

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.520
 The sort of comedy item that is the ear trumpet

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.520
 But in Victorian times

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.520
 They would be customized

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.520
 So a lady say in morning

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.520
 That the example they've got in a museum

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.520
 It's been painted black

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.520
 And trimmed with lace

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.520
 That's cool

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.520
 That's her outfit

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.520
 And at first historians thought

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.520
 You know, this was a sign of like

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.520
 She had to hide it, you know, to be discreet

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.520
 Because it was an embarrassing thing to have

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.520
 But actually this author is making the point that

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.520
 How cool, it's really sort of owning

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.520
 Your deafness

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.520
 And it's customizing

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.520
 What you need

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.520
 It's sort of the equivalent of like, you know

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.520
 Pimping out your walking stick

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.520
 Or signing a cast, in a way

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.520
 Surely it's pimping up, isn't it?

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.520
 Not pimping out

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.520
 Pimping out your walking stick

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.520
 You sort of put it in the street with a little sign

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.520
 And Daniel Defoe calls it a whore

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:29.520
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.520
 And that is my fact

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.520
 My fact this week is that a tourist guide in Whitby

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.520
 Got so tired of being asked where Dracula was buried

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.520
 That he commissioned a headstone

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.520
 Just so that he could point at it

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.520
 Instead of explaining that Dracula wasn't real

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.520
 So this is apparently, it's a big problem in Whitby

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.520
 Whitby is one of the great scenes of Dracula

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.520
 When Dracula makes his way over to England

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.520
 And it is where Bram Stoker spent a few months

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.520
 Where he went looking around

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.520
 And he incorporated a lot of the landscapes

00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.520
 A lot of the churches

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.520
 Even some of the names from the gravestones

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.520
 Into the story

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.520
 And the issue is that when visitors come

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.520
 A lot of them don't actually realize that Dracula doesn't exist

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.520
 So one particular guy, Harry Collett

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.520
 Who's a tour guide

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.520
 And he does tours around Whitby about Dracula

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.520
 So sick of being asked this question

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.520
 He did get one commissioned a headstone

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.520
 Which he can just point to as they're on the track

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.520
 And say, look, that's where he's buried

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.520
 Do you think maybe he should give up his job as a tour guide

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.520
 If he's sick of people asking him questions about Dracula?

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.520
 Yeah, well I guess that is a very good point

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.520
 Hang on, what does the headstone say?

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.520
 Does it say Dracula's here?

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.520
 Or does it say Dracula's not real?

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.520
 No, it says Dracula

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.520
 And then I guess the dates of Dracula on it

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.520
 That's a great idea for your headstone, isn't it?

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.520
 When eventually you die, it's like

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.520
 Here lies James Harkin

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.520
 Of course he wasn't real

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.520
 I thought he was just trying to...

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.520
 Because the church has put a sign on its door

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.520
 Saying Dracula's a fictional character

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.520
 So I thought he might be doing that

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.520
 Because actually, if someone tries to dig up Dracula

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.520
 They'll find, ooh, there's nobody there

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.520
 It's only gonna add fuel to the fire

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.520
 That's true

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.520
 Yeah, this church, the St. Mary's Church

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.520
 This is the church that appears in the book

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.520
 They constantly have people coming to the church

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.520
 Who are Dracula fans, asking about Dracula

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.520
 Apparently the pews are just quite often filled with Goths

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.520
 Who are sitting there just enjoying the scene

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.520
 Well it's Gothsville

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.520
 Yeah, it is Gothsville

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.520
 Whitby is, they have a twice annual

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.520
 In fact, they have four Goth festivals a year, right?

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.520
 So they've got the Whitby Goth weekend

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.520
 Which has been going since the 90s

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.520
 And then, in 2019, a rival event was set up

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.520
 Called Tomorrow's Ghosts

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:33.520
 There was a spooky schism in the Whitby Goth weekend event

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.520
 The founder had set it up

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.520
 And there was a parting of ways with a venue

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.520
 And so now there's a rival festival this year

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.520
 Called Tomorrow's Ghosts

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.520
 And I read their website about this year's autumn festival

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.520
 It says this

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.520
 Our headline is for 2022

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.520
 Our Fields of the Nephilim

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.520
 Who take the Friday night headline slot

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.520
 And really need little introduction

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.520
 Topping the bill on Saturday night are the loveless

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.520
 Who need some introduction

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.520
 They actually put that

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.520
 That's really good

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.520
 It's got a cool, quite gothic-y heritage

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.520
 This whole area anyway

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.520
 Yeah, not just Dracula

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.520
 I mean, St. Hilda was Whitby, wasn't she?

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.520
 St. Hilda was Abbess of Whitby

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.520
 Did she, like, drive the snakes out of Whitby or something?

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.520
 That's a story

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.520
 That's the story

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.520
 Well, she turned them to stone

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.520
 Is that not...

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.520
 That's driving them out in a way

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.520
 It's hard to drive them out

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.520
 They're less likely to bite you if they're made of stone

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.520
 Is that what the Ammonite stones are all about?

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.520
 That's what they call them

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.520
 The Snake Stones of Whitby

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.520
 And they're Ammonites

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.520
 But some people would carve little heads on

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.520
 So, Ammonite is like a little fossil

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.520
 That looks a bit like a snake, right?

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.520
 Yeah

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.520
 Especially if you draw her face on it

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.520
 Yeah, exactly

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.520
 Yeah

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.520
 Yeah, and she was...

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.520
 She started a monastery

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.520
 Which is on the spot where this place

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.520
 She would talk about St. Mary's

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.520
 St. Mary's, right?

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.520
 Yeah

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:59.520
 And, yeah, she resolved the date of Easter

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.520
 Yeah, she was part of the team

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.520
 Who did that?

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.520
 Okay

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.520
 There was the Synod of Whitby in 664 AD

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.520
 Where they all got together in Whitby

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.520
 And decided when we should have Easter

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.520
 Because some people were doing it in the Celtic time

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.520
 And some people were doing it in the Roman time

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.520
 Yeah

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.520
 And we thought, let's move down to the Roman time

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.520
 So, she...

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.520
 That was 664

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.520
 She was probably still alive in 666 AD

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.520
 She was, actually

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.520
 She was like a teacher as well

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.520
 She taught Kathmon

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.520
 Who was the first English poet that we know the name of

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.520
 She was his teacher

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.520
 The question, though, that we're all asking

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.520
 Was she a child prodigy, James?

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.520
 I know not

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.520
 I went to St. Hilda's College

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.520
 Did you?

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.520
 Yes

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.520
 And then they have a little Ammonite on their shield

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.520
 Did they?

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.520
 Wow

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.520
 That's cool

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.520
 I think that's called...

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.520
 That species is called Hildoceras

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:53.520
 Really?

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.520
 It was named in honour of her

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.520
 It was found in that area

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.520
 Yeah, nice

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.520
 There's a really cool set of stairs in Whitby

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.520
 Oh, yeah

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.520
 Ooh

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.520
 Yeah

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.520
 They sound pretty spooky

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.520
 As you head up to St. Mary's Church

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.520
 It's 199 steps to get to the top

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.520
 That's intracular, isn't it?

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.520
 Yes

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.520
 That's bench and intracular

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.520
 Yeah, yeah

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.520
 As you're going up them, there's little rest points

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.520
 Little...

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.520
 Ooh, benches

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.520
 Benches

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.520
 So, you sit on this bench

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.520
 And you think you're sitting on a regular bench

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.520
 But, actually, it's not a regular bench

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.520
 It's not...

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.520
 No, it's not a possessed bench either

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.520
 It wasn't built by yetis

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.520
 It was because the graveyard with St. Mary's Church

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.520
 Was at the top

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.520
 Yeah

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.520
 You had all the pool-bearers who were coming to carry up

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.520
 All of the dead bodies to get to the church

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.520
 And it's a very tiring business

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.520
 So, what's now used as seats, these planks of wood

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.520
 Were actually pit stops to put the dead bodies on

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.520
 So that they could get rest

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.520
 Yeah, it is spooky

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.520
 It is spooky

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.520
 The dead men's...

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.520
 Benches

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.520
 Benches

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.520
 Another thing about Whitby

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.520
 Is if you go to Saltwick Nab, which is just south of Whitby

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.520
 You'll see where the cliffs are

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:03.520
 There's huge chunks taken out of the cliffs

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.520
 And that's because they tried to get alum

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.520
 Which is a thing you get in shale, it's a type of rock

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:12.520
 And it's really useful because you could bind colours to cloth

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.520
 By using it

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.520
 But it didn't work on its own

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.520
 You needed ammonia as well

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.520
 And the way they got their ammonia was from stale urine

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.520
 Ah, urine again

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.520
 Urine again, we come back to urine

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.520
 And so, in Whitby, they used to have barrels

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.520
 Where you would go and wean to the barrel

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.520
 And then they would take the wee to the alum mines

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.520
 And then they would colour their cloths

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.520
 And did they have a little trough of warm water

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.520
 That you could stand in

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.520
 If you were struggling to get yourself going

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.520
 Yeah

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.520
 What point does urine go stale?

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.520
 I've never thought about that

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:46.520
 Well, I would say if you don't drink it straight from the sauce

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.520
 You could put it in a cup first

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.520
 If you drink it straight from the sauce

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.520
 The point is, and I think we've mentioned this in a quite recent podcast

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.520
 Is ammonia isn't naturally in urine

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.520
 And ammonia is made by bacteria

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.520
 Urine is generally more or less sterile

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.520
 So you get your urine, the bacteria comes from the air

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.520
 Goes into the urine, makes ammonia

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.520
 And that's when it becomes stale

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.520
 So it takes a couple of hours

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:14.520
 Have you ever forgotten to flush a toilet and then gone on holiday?

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.520
 Wow

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.520
 And then come back

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.520
 That's when it stale

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.520
 Oh my god

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.520
 But Dan, if you're bottling it correctly with sterilised bottles

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.520
 It lasts years

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.520
 She's got to visit Andy's urine distillery

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.520
 Keep it out of the sunlight

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.520
 Wacker label on it

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.520
 It's bringing them on the plane

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.520
 It's from my ears actually

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.520
 You have to bring so many under 100ml bottles though

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.520
 That's the really annoying thing

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.520
 Anyway, this urine, they couldn't get enough in Whitby

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.520
 So they ended up putting barrels in Newcastle and London

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.520
 To get enough urine

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.520
 That's a long way away

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.520
 A lot of piss, isn't it? Yeah, from a long distance

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.520
 Well, there's a lot of people in London

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.520
 So that was one reason why they went there

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.520
 And they always tried to get the urine from poor people

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.520
 So they put barrels in the poor areas

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.520
 And they would want poor people's piss

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.520
 Why?

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.520
 Because it was illiterative

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.520
 No, why do you think it was?

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:10.520
 Something about poor people's diet or consumption of alcohol

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.520
 Because he's got it

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.520
 He's only got it, got it

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.520
 Did they wanted it to be more?

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.520
 No, they thought that the poor people wouldn't be able to afford alcohol

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.520
 And so they didn't want alcohol in the urine

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.520
 Because they thought it wouldn't set the colours properly

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.520
 Do you know where Dracula was from?

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.520
 He was from Transylvania

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.520
 Well, exactly

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:32.520
 But there is a minority theory that he was from Devon

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.520
 Is this theory put forward by Devon?

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.520
 There's a writer called Andy Struthers

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.520
 Who claims that Bram Stoker was inspired by a load of different things

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:47.520
 But he claims there was especially an Exeter writer called Sabine Beringould

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.520
 Who'd written a book about werewolves, which Bram Stoker read

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.520
 And a vampire story called Marjorie of Queather

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:57.520
 And was therefore claiming that Dracula was effectively from Devon

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.520
 Which I think would make him less spooky

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.520
 I'm gonna drink your blood

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.520
 Do you mind?

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.520
 All right, my lover

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:11.520
 Yeah, but his descendant, Bram Stoker's descendant said there's a mix of sources

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.520
 Actually, you can't just say

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.520
 Well, one of the sources was about Drackel, wasn't it?

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.520
 Vlad the Impaler, who was from Transylvania

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.520
 Was he a Wallachian or something like that?

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.520
 And he supposedly read about this guy while he was in Whitby

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.520
 So he went down to what was the coffee house end

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.520
 And the public library there

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.520
 He found the book there and that's what gave the inspirations

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.520
 As you say, there's a lot of different accounts

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.520
 He was already working on a novel, but it was about a character he called Count Wampire

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.520
 Sounds like a Count Wampire

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:46.520
 I thought that was the original... Wampire was the original Germanic

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.520
 Still sounds stupid though

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.520
 Okay, cool, sorry

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.520
 I am a Wampire

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:54.520
 Or rather, I am a Wampire

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:58.520
 I've been to Dracula's Castle

00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.520
 How do you?

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.520
 Actually, yeah, in fact, I've been to both of them

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.520
 There's one which is real and one of them which is fake

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.520
 The one which is fake is called Bran Castle

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.520
 And that looks really gothic

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.520
 It looks amazing

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.520
 It looks like it could be his castle, but it really isn't

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.520
 And there's another one which was his actual castle

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.520
 It's about a hundred miles away

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.520
 And that is just a... you know, it's a semi-detached house

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.520
 I thought it was like Vlad the Impaler's

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.520
 Yeah, but it's just like ruins really

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:26.520
 And they have a few stakes with dolls on them

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.520
 They do

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.520
 But in the Bran Castle, it's way better

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.520
 Because they've got a proper, you know, gift shop

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.520
 Bran Castle, they've really made big on the publicity, haven't they?

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:41.520
 So last year, Bran Castle got a bit of publicity

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:44.520
 Because they offered free doses of the COVID-19 jabs

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.520
 What?!

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.520
 Yeah, with doctors wearing fang stickers

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.520
 And they put it in your neck

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.520
 No, they didn't put it in your neck

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:57.520
 Interesting fact, I was in Bran on the day of the Brexit referendum

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.520
 Oh!

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.520
 You're gonna have a spooky loss of trade

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:11.520
 Okay, that's it

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.520
 That's all of our facts

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.520
