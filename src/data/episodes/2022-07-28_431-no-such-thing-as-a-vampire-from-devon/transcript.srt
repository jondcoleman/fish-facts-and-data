00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 Hi everybody Andy here just before we start this week's show wanted to let you know we have a very special guest on

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,400
 This week Anna is away very sadly. She's on her holidays. But the great news is that in her place

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,120
 We have the absolutely magnificent Rachel Paris now

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,400
 I'm sure you may have heard of Rachel if you haven't frankly wherever you're being guys. She's a

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,800
 Comedian she's a musician. She's an actor an improviser. She does it all

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,160
 She has been on so many brilliant shows and she is a musical comedian as well

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,240
 She tours the country with a grand piano performing

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:40,000
 Magnificently funny solo shows. She's basically the heir to Tom Lear and Tim Minchin put together and on top of it all

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,280
 She has just published her first book. It's called Advice from Strangers

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,000
 And it's a kind of comedy book slash memoir slash feminist manifesto

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,120
 All centered around the time that she traveled around the country asking her audiences to give her pieces of advice

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:02,680
 It's funny. It's serious. It's hilarious. It's uplifting and we're so glad that she could come on the show because as you're about to hear

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,040
 She was absolutely great. So that's it without further ado on with the show

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:29,160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden

15
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,640
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray James Harkin

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,400
 And it's our very special guest Rachel Paris and once again

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,320
 We have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,520
 We go starting with fact number one and that is Rachel

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,360
 My fact is that list the composer played the piano so hard in his concerts that he regularly broke piano strings and

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,600
 Superfans would nick those strings and make bracelets out of them

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,080
 I've so I don't play the piano

22
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,840
 But it feels like that's quite a hard thing to do to break a string

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,160
 It's a break of a guitar string, right? Yeah, but piano string. It's rare

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,480
 He's not the only person to ever do that, but I think that I think that it happened to him all the time

25
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,240
 That was like his thing is I'm gonna break this. Why was he so angry? I don't know. Maybe he just had like really heavy hands or something

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,160
 There were there were comments that he had massive hands

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,640
 Which allowed for him to stretch a lot of piano players say that that's not actually a thing

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,160
 There was certain there were certain patterns that he would play that a big hand doesn't necessarily

29
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,720
 We actually have plaster casts of his hands, so we know exactly how big they are. Yeah, do you mean in your home?

30
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,600
 They're here tonight

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,360
 We find that his fingers were slender and long, but they weren't like massively long light

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,760
 I think right man enough had really big hands man enough had 12 inches and his hands I

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,800
 Measured mine mines nine inch span because I've got pretty good small hands

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,040
 But a big stretch on but yeah, when you measure 12 inches out on a rule, that's insane

35
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,440
 So right man enough was known for having like absurdly big hands and you can only play right man enough pieces

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,720
 If you've got those you can fake it a bit

37
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,000
 But you have to do some very clever maneuvering if Rachmaninoff was alive today

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,560
 Yeah, and if he if he did that mine, you know when you mime a phone

39
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,320
 Your thumb in your little finger. Yeah, he would it's the top of his head with his thumb knock his hat off

40
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,360
 He could only mime a car phone from the 80s

41
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,640
 So this whole thing of him banging on the piano

42
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,100
 He was a passionate amazing player and that was kind of a thing. He was like a rock and roll list

43
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,280
 Like rock and roll wasn't a list but fortunately if he did smash up a piano

44
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
 He always had two pianos on stage with them

45
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,080
 That's such a cool idea and I'm not sure if it was necessarily because he knew he was gonna smash up a piano

46
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,560
 It's because he was such a showman that he wanted to give both sides of his face basically to the audience

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,720
 So he didn't have a roadie bringing on the piano when he broke his like dragging it along. I think he would drag it out

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 Really? Yeah, it's like I read an account of a gig where he

49
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,640
 He he dragged the second piano out and I think if you were an audience member there was a second piano

50
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,680
 You would be slightly disappointed if it didn't come into play. Yeah, you think he hadn't given it his all

51
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
 It's like a Checos piano, isn't it?

52
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,120
 And he had these like beautiful flowing locks of hair which made him very popular as he really had the whole like Elvis

53
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,880
 You know someone coined the term listomania

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,880
 Yeah, that people were absolutely obsessed with him the way they are sort of today about pop stars

55
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,580
 But he actually had the talent to earn it. But yeah, people would ask for locks of his hair

56
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,080
 Yes, and they would collect his cigarette butts

57
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,300
 They would wear them in the chains on their necklaces with his initials

58
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:57,520
 There is it like it's a it did happen and apparently everyone hated it because she was carrying another stinky old cigar end basically

59
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
 They were like Susan

60
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:13,760
 I was reading listomania does sounds like it was a bit of a just like beatlemania

61
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,360
 You know where it was just screaming girls and stuff like that

62
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,400
 But apparently the original term the mania was used in terms medically

63
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,640
 It was it wasn't just that people were just getting too excited

64
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,040
 They genuinely thought that this might be leading to medical conditions

65
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,520
 So if list came into town, they'd be like, you know, we got to get doctors ready. We got I'm making that up

66
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,280
 To effect. So that's what the mania meant. It was right people actually got ill. Yeah, exactly

67
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,560
 I was thinking that his performance is a bit like you too, Andy and Rachel you do ostentatious, right?

68
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,120
 Which is an improvised Jane Austen play and his concerts were quite a bit like that

69
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,140
 I was reading it's a while since I've seen you two live by

70
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,160
 Paulie received

71
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,640
 Well, he would like get what a member of his audience to give him a little sort of motif a little theme

72
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,400
 And they might just go do-do-do-do-do or something maybe not like the Nokia theme

73
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,800
 And then he would spend the rest of the concert just like doing the amazing bits

74
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:21,840
 He had a very interesting life, so he was he was a prodigy as a child and he was your hot house by his

75
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
 No

76
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,360
 These was like doodling around to they were but it was kind of interesting just on that

77
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:37,160
 We'll go back to that but like because mass market pianos are just coming and also the French Revolution had just happened

78
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,520
 So you had pianos were only played by posh people and they were really really expensive and you could only get them if you

79
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
 Super posh but then

80
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,920
 Suddenly just around the time of Mozart and then list after him

81
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,640
 Suddenly you could get cheap pianos and that meant that children could play it children could practice it

82
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,760
 And so you had these children coming up who were as good as the you know posh

83
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,160
 You know and also all the previous pianos were cheap if slightly spattered with the blood of aristocrats

84
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,240
 Some somewhere

85
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,920
 But so you get so his dad took him around his dad worked him like a dog for years

86
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:21,320
 You know years his father died when Franz was 15 and he he took pupils as a 15 year old prodigy

87
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,360
 And then had this incredible performing career until I think his late 30s maybe and then step back

88
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,200
 Yeah, because he had a lover a countess love hello who who encouraged him to compose

89
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
 She said look this before me is all well and good

90
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,480
 he's making a lot of money, but and he just kind of stepped back he moved to Weimar and

91
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,200
 Just started composing who was the lover do you know? Yes? She was called countess

92
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:53,240
 No, sorry. She was a princess. He was married to a countess and traded up to Princess Caroline von sein Wittgenstein

93
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,080
 Anyway, she left her own marriage for him

94
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,480
 And there was this whole thing about whether they could annul the marriage so they could be her marriage

95
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,320
 So they could be married and the Pope agreed to it and then he changed his mind

96
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,400
 It was a big old thing

97
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,800
 But yes, so he took a really crap job as a couple meister at the court of Weimar and he had to wear

98
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,440
 Archaic clothes to perform. Oh, well cuz he was a rock star and then he went

99
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,480
 Suddenly it's like a music beef eater or something

100
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,160
 I did think of ostentatious a bit and that you're basically dressing and stuff that was the hide-of-fashion 200 years ago

101
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,240
 And the pay was so bad. It only paid for his cigars

102
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:34,120
 But we don't know how quality his cigars were to be fair. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, he could have sold the one eBay afterwards

103
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,560
 Yeah, and Caroline de sein Wittgenstein

104
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,560
 She was a Catholic princess wasn't she and she got him into Catholicism and then he went on to try and become the Pope's

105
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,440
 personal

106
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:55,280
 He wanted to be the official composer to the Pope

107
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,400
 But he was turned down and the alleged story of why he was turned down is that apparently he was playing in the

108
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,760
 Cloisters one day and all the nuns in the nunnery ran to him and started kissing him and

109
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:13,600
 And the Pope decided well if he's like that if he's gonna have that effect on women

110
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,400
 We're not gonna have him as the official how hot was this guy

111
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:24,720
 Was I think he was he was six foot two. We've established. He had big old hands

112
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,040
 Yeah, and he had a lot of mistresses in his life

113
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,120
 He did he did in later life take holy orders, but minor holy orders. He didn't become a full priest

114
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,040
 I think maybe because it would have involved of our celibacy and he was just he wasn't quite ready

115
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
 He just did it as a hobby

116
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:50,240
 Well, here's a weird thing in 2018 in Spain's got talent

117
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,080
 He didn't

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Showed up

119
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,920
 He did not show up itself

120
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,320
 However, he kind of did in a way because one of the competitors of that year was a guy called Michael Andreas

121
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,520
 Who's supposedly the great-great-grandson of lists really?

122
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,400
 Supposedly and he said to be the son of not only list but of one of his prodigies lists prodigies

123
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,200
 Who was called Sophie mentor and Sophie mentor was supposedly the best his favorite and she did have a kid

124
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,960
 But by all the accounts she had it with someone else, but this guy's claiming that he is the great descended from both lines

125
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,200
 Yeah descended from both lines

126
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,660
 So he's even picked like a mother that you can't trace it back to so supposedly we have a descendant who's incredible by the way

127
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,560
 I've seen him play. He was a prodigy as well. He was a child prodigy

128
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,960
 He was winning competitions since he was five years old

129
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:56,920
 Rachel because you're a classical pianist. I am I think I was a prodigy

130
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:06,600
 Piano competitions when I was small and I was teaching when I was 15. Really. Yeah. Wow. We teaching what I'm saying

131
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
 Is you don't have to be a prodigy to teach at 15?

132
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,080
 Were you teaching smaller children or were you teaching? Yeah smaller children. So I was like grade eight and I was teaching grade one

133
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,600
 That's really impressive. That's a guy that you're smoking at the moment. I like that

134
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:31,760
 I do think if you've got the willingness to practice and basic like strong musical aptitude and if you start young then you're gonna be a child prodigy

135
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:43,240
 Moving down like fuck wasn't that shit hot, but like, you know, that's so interesting. Do you hear how words get there?

136
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:51,360
 Do you guys know Lang Lang? Yeah, one of the big concerto players piano players of recent years and he's a global name

137
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,360
 He only got into playing piano. He was a child prodigy by the way. Oh, yeah

138
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:11,200
 I want to see Rachel and Britain's got talent. A little kid comes up. Like this again. Go on. Child prodigy, it just means has a piano and the time

139
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:20,520
 He was inspired hearing Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody in number two by Tom from Tom and Jerry

140
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:26,520
 And that's how he got into playing the piano. Oh, I totally grew up watching that. I can really understand that. Yeah

141
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:33,520
 I was called the cat concerto and it was Tom was playing piano Jerry's on the inside gets woken up and they start having a fight

142
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,520
 It's an amazing piece. Supposedly a lot of piano players began their love watching this one cartoon of Tom and Jerry

143
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:46,520
 And then when you get older the the piece. Yeah, it's the Hungarian Rhapsody, which is already a phenomenal piece incredibly difficult to play

144
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,520
 I can play the first few pages and then it gets to the really hard bit and I'm like no, but in the cartoon which I had on VHS

145
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,520
 So I've watched it over and over and over again. They mess with it

146
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,520
 They pull it around and they go into like the can can and they go into little jazz bit in the middle of it

147
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:07,520
 And then return to the piece. So when I got older and I started playing it, I had I had be like, oh, oh the can can doesn't happen here

148
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:14,520
 This bit doesn't turn into jazz. So confusing. I've got one other connection that Liszt made in his life

149
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,520
 So we said before Liszt had big old hands, right? Yeah. Yeah. There's someone else he met who also had big hands

150
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,520
 George Elliot. George Elliot. George Elliot. We have a running fact on this podcast that George Elliot had great big hands

151
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,520
 She had one big head. She could play right now, but only the right hand

152
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:38,520
 Did she have different size hands? Yeah, but we don't. Supposedly, she was a dairy maid in younger life and she turned the butter

153
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,520
 I milked the cows. I milked the cows and this gave one absolutely honking hulk fist

154
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:50,520
 Wow. And if you look at pictures of her, they never show her right hand. They didn't have enough paint. Didn't have enough paint

155
00:13:50,520 --> 00:14:00,520
 But basically old big hands herself. George Elliot. Big hand herself. Sorry. In 1854 she visited Liszt with her lover George Lewis

156
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,520
 They were fleeing scandal because he'd left his wife to be with female George Elliot and they made friends

157
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,520
 They had coffee together. Imagine the conversations they would have had. Wow. High five

158
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:17,520
 [Laughter]

159
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James

160
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:28,520
 Okay, my fact this week is that the downhill skiing at the Nagano Olympics in 1998 was postponed due to snow

161
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,520
 [Laughter]

162
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,520
 Too much. Too much. Too much snow

163
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:42,520
 If you go on Encyclopedia Britannica about the Nagano Olympics, it says the most memorable aspect of the Nagano Games was arguably the weather

164
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,520
 Oh, wow. It said it brought heavy snow and periods of freezing rain. There was even an earthquake

165
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,520
 An earthquake? Yes, that's incredible. Where is Nagano? It's in Japan

166
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,520
 Oh, well that's prone to earthquakes, isn't it? You want to pick somewhere right in the middle of a tectonic plate if you don't want to

167
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,520
 Yeah, it wasn't like a massive one, but everyone felt it who was there at the time

168
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,520
 If you were halfway through a ski jump, you'd be the only person who didn't feel it

169
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,520
 And you'd land and everyone else would have fallen over a door

170
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:19,520
 Maybe the earth moves to your advantage by about 50 meters until you've broken the world record

171
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,520
 [Laughter]

172
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:32,520
 But yeah, the LA Times said at the time, they said, "We are seeing firsthand the fundamental problem of the Winter Olympics they are held during the winter"

173
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
 [Laughter]

174
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:40,520
 It's like the ski resorts often have not enough snow, don't they? Or they say, "Oh, the snow hasn't happened" or "It's fallen"

175
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,520
 Do you ever get the wrong kind of snow? I feel like that's a...

176
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,520
 Yeah, I've been dragged into the world of snow by my husband

177
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,520
 Oh, you walked through that wardrobe, didn't you?

178
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,520
 That's it, yeah, what a nightmare

179
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,520
 My husband's a huge skier in snowboarder

180
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,520
 I am not never skied before meeting him and I get dragged to ski resorts now

181
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,520
 and I keep trying to learn to ski really painfully

182
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,520
 But also, yeah, the cancellations for snow happen at ski resorts all the time

183
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,520
 They're like, "Yeah, the slope's closed because of snow"

184
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,520
 Yeah, I think that skiing is something that you should be a child prodigy at, right?

185
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,520
 Because it's easier to learn when you're a child and you don't have the fear

186
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,520
 I learn when I was in my 30s and I say, "Learned"

187
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,520
 It sounds like we're at a similar standard

188
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
 It's the worst thing

189
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,520
 I feel like for me at the moment, skiing is simply trying to stop

190
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,520
 It's all it is, I'm going to deep plow all the way down

191
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
 Why aren't I stopping?

192
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
 Deep plow, what's that?

193
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,520
 When you put your skis in a V-shape

194
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
 I see

195
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,520
 Whenever I've gone skiing, I've mastered the going fast and the spinning

196
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,520
 and the, you know, not the spinning, sort of the sharp turns

197
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,520
 Spinning, spinning as well

198
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,520
 I've mastered the roly-poly down the hill as well

199
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,520
 But I've never mastered the sideways stop

200
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,520
 So no matter how cool I've looked, I've always had to go into the big V-plow

201
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
 Hangerly

202
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,520
 Like Spider-Man trying to hold the train from falling off the track

203
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,520
 That's a pretty cool way of describing what you're doing

204
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,520
 I'm sure it looks that good when you're doing it

205
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,520
 That's going down, doing his pizza

206
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,520
 He's got Spider-Man, Spider-Man

207
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
 With great power!

208
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,520
 Oh, do you think Spider-Man's ever been skiing?

209
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
 Sorry, never mind

210
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
 But would he enjoy it?

211
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
 Spiders don't like the cold, do they?

212
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
 He's not a real spider

213
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
 He's not a real man

214
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
 He's neither, he's a freak

215
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
 He's just a boy

216
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
 I'm the only one who's never been skiing

217
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
 I'm surprised you've never been skiing

218
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
 Why?

219
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,520
 Not because you seem like someone who would have been skiing

220
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
 Because you're posh

221
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
 I think that's why we're all dancing around

222
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
 I think if people were to meet me and you

223
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
 They'd think I haven't been skiing and you have been skiing

224
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
 I see

225
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,520
 But it just goes to show that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover

226
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,520
 People would look at me and say he must be just eating pies and drinking blue wicked

227
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
 Too much to be skiing

228
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,520
 People look at me and see like polo and croquet

229
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
 I'm afraid so

230
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
 Oh dear

231
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
 You guys all know this and it's all really common

232
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,520
 So ski jumpers, they have to get a little friction on the bottom of the skis as possible

233
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
 Because I guess you get loads of ski

234
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
 But they got fast

235
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
 Yeah, and the plasticky on the bottom

236
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
 And they drip hot wax onto it

237
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
 And then they iron their skis sometimes

238
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
 To get the wax distributed

239
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,520
 Yeah, and all the ski makers are really secretive

240
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,520
 Like competitive ski teams are really secretive about the ingredients of their wax

241
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
 Oh really?

242
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,520
 Yeah, because they give the bottles boring looking labels or code names and all this

243
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
 But the wax wears off as you're going down

244
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
 So that's a problem

245
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,520
 And in 2007 a pair of chemists who were called Peter Styring and Alex Ruth

246
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,520
 They developed, I love this, skis which wax themselves

247
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
 Self waxing ski

248
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,520
 So you pour the liquid wax into a little reservoir

249
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
 Which is between your boot and the ski

250
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,520
 Self waxing, you're doing a lot of the work, the skis aren't doing it

251
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
 Exactly, yeah, but then it's there

252
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,520
 So you've got it like an air, so you've got a bubble beneath it

253
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,520
 And then you're not allowed to have any means of power down there

254
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,520
 But the wax feeds into this little tube

255
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
 Which runs all the way along the ski surface

256
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,520
 And as you go into a turn, you put pressure down, don't you?

257
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,520
 And it sort of pops a bit of the wax along the bottom of the ski

258
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
 That's clever

259
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
 I don't know if it was allowed or banned or anything like that

260
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
 It feels super off the books

261
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
 It does, doesn't it?

262
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,520
 The coldness of the Winter Olympics, it is a problem

263
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,520
 It's like a big problem for a lot of the events

264
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,520
 One of the early day things that happened in 1924 games

265
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,520
 Is that the guys who were having to use the stopwatches

266
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,520
 In order to monitor how fast you were crossing the line

267
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,520
 Their hands just got too cold and so they were just getting it wrong

268
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
 All the time

269
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
 So there was actually a gold medalist who won

270
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,520
 Who was called Charles Dutrell, who was an American

271
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,520
 Who won his event despite being utterly perplexed

272
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
 By the fact that he'd managed it

273
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,520
 Because he'd never ever trained for this event before

274
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,520
 He came in thinking, "I'm going to come last of everyone"

275
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
 And he ended up winning it

276
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
 He didn't even train for the event, he sort of just showed up and did it

277
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
 Are you telling us that the stopwatch didn't work?

278
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
 Exactly, the stopwatch ran a bit too long

279
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
 Oh sorry, a bit too quick

280
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
 The guys' hands were freezing and it was a big problem

281
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
 So, yeah

282
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,520
 Did you hear about Remy Lindholm in the Beijing Olympics quite recently?

283
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
 No

284
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
 He did the 50K cross country ski

285
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,520
 Well, it was 50K, but it got short into 30K because the weather was so bad

286
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,520
 And at the very end, he needed a heat pack to treat his frostbitten penis

287
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,520
 Apparently, he should have kept it in his trousers

288
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,520
 He forgot one of his poles

289
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:51,520
 And the thing is, this is the second time that that happened to him in less than a year

290
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,520
 Does he have an unusually frostbite prone penis, I wonder

291
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,520
 It feels like he must do it, there must be something there

292
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,520
 Maybe he's not wearing a crucial thermal pant layer or something

293
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
 None of his mates have told him

294
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
 Yeah, the thermal pants are available

295
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,520
 He's still going on one thin pair of M&S briefs

296
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,520
 The article I read didn't presuppose what was going on

297
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,520
 Yeah, I think that now it's happened a second time

298
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
 I think we are allowed to ask the question

299
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
 Maybe you're prone to it once it's happened once

300
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
 Oh yeah

301
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,520
 The tip never really recovers

302
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
 Bloody hell

303
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,520
 It's just a guess, you know, I'm not an expert

304
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
 Yeah

305
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
 Anyway, that was the thing that happened

306
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
 Poor guy

307
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,520
 I found another quite funny cancellation of a sports event

308
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,520
 In 2016, the Premier League match between Manu and Bournemouth

309
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,520
 Sorry, I said Manu, that's Manchester United

310
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
 For people who don't know

311
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,520
 And that's football

312
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,520
 American football

313
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,520
 No, I knew you wouldn't know

314
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,520
 You don't look like a football fan

315
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,520
 Too busy teeing up for another trucker

316
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
 What?

317
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
 That's polo 10

318
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
 Well, half of it was

319
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,520
 So they had to cancel the match at the very last minute

320
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,520
 When a suspicious item was found in the gents' loo at Old Trafford

321
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,520
 But the suspicious item had been put there

322
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,520
 By the security firm that was monitoring for suspicious items

323
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,520
 So they'd done it as a trial test thing

324
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
 This is what a suspicious item looks like

325
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,520
 Yeah, like, can you see, if you can find it, what's the drill, what will you do

326
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
 But they accidentally left it there

327
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
 And the match got cancelled

328
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
 Wow, so funny, I wonder what it looked like

329
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
 Probably had wires coming out

330
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,520
 Exactly, they had a big sort of black cartoon ball

331
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
 With a fuse coming out

332
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
 And bomb written in white on the side

333
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,520
 Have you guys heard of the, this is an amazing thing, it was proposed

334
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,520
 In 2002, it was a British firm called Snowdonia Gateway Limited

335
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
 They wanted to build a revolving ski slope

336
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
 Okay?

337
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
 Okay

338
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,520
 So what it would be, it would be 13 stories high

339
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,520
 And it would be kind of like a record player, but on an angle

340
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
 Okay, if you can imagine that

341
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
 And you would start down the slope

342
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,520
 As the slope revolved and moved upwards

343
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,520
 Okay, now the incline was going to be 300 meters long

344
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,520
 But the plan was, if you skied slowly enough

345
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
 And if it got up to its full revolving speed

346
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
 Permanent skiing

347
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
 Wow

348
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
 But the speed that I skied

349
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,520
 Which is really, really slope like

350
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
 I'm going to be going backwards around that

351
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
 You'd fall off the top

352
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,520
 Yeah, and they would generate permanent fresh snow with snow guns

353
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
 It's really clever

354
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
 That's extraordinary

355
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
 So it never happened, sadly, as far as I can tell

356
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
 Is it because it's completely impossible to build?

357
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
 Weirdly, no

358
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,520
 I think it was just too ambitious an example of the thing

359
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,520
 So these days, I think there is at least one rotating disc slope ski simulator

360
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
 In Europe

361
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
 I think it's someone like the Netherlands

362
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,520
 But it's quite small, it's not 13 stories high

363
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,520
 And allowing you to like a sort of ski giant mountain thing

364
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
 That's so cool

365
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
 It just sounds so much fun

366
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
 Wow, it sounds incredible

367
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,520
 I can see the problem that if you were at a certain speed

368
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
 You would just be stuck

369
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
 Like you would have to be rescued, right?

370
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
 Well, they can turn it, they can slow it

371
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
 Yeah, at the end of the day

372
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,520
 Like they're not going to stop it for every middle speed skier, right?

373
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
 No, they have to get down eventually

374
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,520
 It might be like the waltzes that you just have a one go

375
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
 And then you have to come off and other people go on

376
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
 Imagine the poor guy, poor guy, right?

377
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
 It's my frostbitten penis twice

378
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
 He's going to have one more ski in a very nice time

379
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
 Oh, no!

380
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
 I'm never coming off!

381
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:33,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

382
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
 That is Andy

383
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,520
 My effect is that the 18th century health writer

384
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
 William Buchan told his readers

385
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
 That anyone suffering from persistent deafness

386
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
 Might benefit from pouring their own urine

387
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
 Into their ears each night

388
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,520
 That's really good

389
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
 I'm just looking at my notes

390
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
 Because I paraphrased what you said to us

391
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
 And I've written

392
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,520
 In 1772, William Buchan told people to piss in their own ears

393
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
 Wow

394
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
 He pretty much did

395
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
 Pretty much, right?

396
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
 Can I just say, it does seem possible

397
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
 That the first person who heard this advice

398
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
 Simply misheard

399
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
 Oh, yeah?

400
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
 No, they are deaf

401
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,520
 Did they say, you know, "I know a guy in touring"

402
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,520
 Or "Do you want some tea? I'm pouring"

403
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,520
 Are they reliable sources, right?

404
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,520
 Well, William Buchan was this writer

405
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
 He wrote this book called "Domestic Medicine"

406
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
 Which was basically the Beal and Endle

407
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
 Of health advice in the 18th century

408
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
 He was a proper doctor

409
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
 And I think it was actually pretty good

410
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
 As in he wasn't a quack

411
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
 He was really trying

412
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
 And it had chapters on absolutely everything under the sun

413
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
 One of the chapters is on deafness

414
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,520
 And he writes, "A gentleman on whose veracity I can depend

415
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,520
 Told me that after using many things to no purpose

416
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,520
 For an obstinate deafness, he was at last advised

417
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,520
 To put a few drops of his own urine warm into his ears

418
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
 Every night and morning

419
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
 From which he received great benefit"

420
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
 Okay

421
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
 He does say you could also use a salt solution

422
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
 Would it work?

423
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
 Would it work?

424
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
 Like, let's say you've got wax in your ears

425
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
 Would it moisten them, perhaps?

426
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
 I might do

427
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
 You'd need phenomenal aim

428
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
 That's the problem

429
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
 That's the...

430
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
 It's a few drops

431
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
 That's a good detail that I didn't know

432
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
 When I tried it earlier this morning

433
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
 That would have been very helpful

434
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,520
 But he also had advice in the book for putting onions

435
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
 Onion juice in your ear

436
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
 In order to help with deafness

437
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,520
 So is it just a sort of like any liquid that has some kind of

438
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,520
 I don't know, acidic property or something?

439
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
 This is the thought slightly is that

440
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
 Earache will eventually go

441
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,520
 And the thought is that maybe what it was

442
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
 Was a sort of pseudo thing

443
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,520
 Where it was just making it feel a bit bearable

444
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,520
 And then you mistake in the fact that it

445
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
 That it happens because people still parents

446
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
 There's blogs all over on those mum blogs

447
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
 We'll be missing a little bit

448
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
 No, using onions

449
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,520
 Using onions

450
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
 No, it's a community, Andy

451
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,520
 That book, by the way, "Domestic Medicine"

452
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,520
 There is an argument that it might not have been

453
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
 Written by William Buchan

454
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,520
 And might have been written by friend of the show

455
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
 Willie Smelly

456
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
 Willie Smelly

457
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
 Who's Willie Smelly?

458
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
 The original gynecologist

459
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,520
 The original midwife

460
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
 Midwife

461
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
 Not that Willie Smelly

462
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
 The other Willie Smelly

463
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
 The encyclopedia

464
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
 The encyclopedia

465
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
 The first editor

466
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,520
 Yeah, so there are two famous Willie Smellys

467
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,520
 From the 19th century

468
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,520
 And 19th century, one of them

469
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,520
 And this one, according to Smelly's son

470
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,520
 Who's called Ker Smelly

471
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,520
 He said that Willie Smelly

472
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,520
 Might have entirely rewritten his original draft

473
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
 So Buchan handed in his draft

474
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,520
 And then Smelly sort of put all of his own bits in

475
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
 So it could be that his was normal

476
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
 And then Smelly added the urea stuff

477
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,520
 I wouldn't want Willie Smelly's urine in my ears

478
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,520
 Also, the interesting thing about this book

479
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,520
 Is that it was sort of a sort of equivalent

480
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
 To what I'm trying to say would be a magician

481
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,520
 Releasing all of the trade secrets

482
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
 Of how to do tricks

483
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
 Because doctors at the time

484
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
 Didn't want patients to know this kind of thing

485
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
 They actually looked down on this book

486
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,520
 Saying you shouldn't be giving this information

487
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
 Out to the patients

488
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
 Of what we do

489
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
 And so he kind of put it all in

490
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
 Might you put like just one bit of advice in there

491
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
 That was wrong

492
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
 To try and trick people into

493
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
 Or a bit like those

494
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
 Like internet spoiler things

495
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,520
 It's like, step one is this

496
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,520
 But for more, contact your doctor

497
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,520
 He wrote a lot of medical advice

498
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
 William Buchan

499
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,520
 He wrote this book called Advice to Mothers

500
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,520
 Which again, quite democratising

501
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
 Of becoming a parent

502
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
 Oh god, I'm strapping in for this

503
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
 He wrote, well

504
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,520
 He wrote to mothers that, and I'm quoting here

505
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
 In all cases of dwarfishness or deformity

506
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,520
 99 out of 100 are owing to the folly, misconduct

507
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
 Or neglect of mothers

508
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
 Wow

509
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,520
 Which was, I'm sure, science at the time

510
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
 But...

511
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
 It's just nice

512
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,520
 For mothers to feel more guilt

513
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,520
 There isn't enough going around

514
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
 Yeah, I think mothers didn't feel bad

515
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
 Until he really advanced the form

516
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
 So, yeah, yeah, yeah

517
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
 He was an amazing guy

518
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
 Like, he started young

519
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,520
 He was a child prodigy, actually

520
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,520
 He was going around pissing at other children's ears

521
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
 Like, we're joking about this

522
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
 But I do feel like, as it goes on

523
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
 This is proving my point

524
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,520
 It's just like, anyone who excels at anything

525
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
 Probably excels as a child

526
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
 Yeah, it's true, yeah

527
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
 No, he supposedly was the amateur doctor

528
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,520
 To the village when he was still at school

529
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
 So he was so...

530
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
 So annoying

531
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
 Oh, it's not like...

532
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
 You'd be so annoyed by him

533
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
 Wouldn't you be the baby doctor?

534
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
 Not if he was helping you

535
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
 No, you would be annoyed

536
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
 Really?

537
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
 Especially if he's helping you

538
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,520
 What doctors have to put up with

539
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
 Particularly baby doctors

540
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
 It sounds horrific

541
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,520
 Imagine a 12-year-old boy coming to you

542
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,520
 When you're pregnant going, "Oh, it's your fault!"

543
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,520
 You haven't been behaving right

544
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,520
 You know, one of the things that Buckin suggested

545
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
 That when you...

546
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
 If you'd burnt yourself

547
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
 The cure was to hold it back near a fire

548
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
 What?

549
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
 Yeah

550
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,520
 I did read that

551
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
 Hold it quite near the fire

552
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
 There was a few other things

553
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,520
 Like you should put salt on it

554
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
 Salt?

555
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
 Yeah

556
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,520
 It's like the old saying goes

557
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
 Rub salt in the wound

558
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
 And everyone's a winner

559
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,520
 It does sound like he was like a child doctor

560
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,520
 But he didn't go on to learn any more

561
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,520
 Just left the knowledge he had at 12

562
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,520
 One of the earliest records

563
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
 For treating hearing loss

564
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
 Is from the Ebers Papyrus

565
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,520
 Which is an old ancient Egyptian papyrus

566
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,520
 And that's specifically for wax buildup

567
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,520
 And they suggest that you put olive oil

568
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,520
 Red lead, ant eggs, bat wings

569
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,520
 Or goat urine into your ears

570
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,520
 So they do go for the urine quite early

571
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
 And also, olive oil, use that now

572
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
 Olive oil for blood tears

573
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
 Yeah

574
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,520
 Do you hang the bat wings out like a...

575
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,520
 They're literally flapping out your ears

576
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,520
 Rachel, you've just written a book of advice

577
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,520
 Effectively, based on old advice from strangers

578
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
 Correct

579
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,520
 Is there any honkingly bad advice that you received?

580
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,520
 Because I saw some of the gigs where you collected advice

581
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
 Yeah, correct

582
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
 Well, some of it I just really didn't agree with

583
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
 Some of it was very individual

584
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,520
 Like acquire as many guinea pigs as possible

585
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
 And that openness is bound to follow

586
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
 Which I really profound as a previous owner of a guinea pig

587
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
 I don't think that's true

588
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,520
 I don't think they improve in large numbers

589
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
 Yes

590
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
 Well, you didn't try

591
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
 No, that's true

592
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
 You only have one

593
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
 You didn't pass through the threshold, which is nine

594
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
 In Peru, they eat guinea pigs, don't they?

595
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
 So if it was a Peruvian person

596
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,520
 It might be just a way of, you know, stocking up before lockdown

597
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
 Yeah

598
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,520
 Give a man a guinea pig and a leap for a day

599
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
 Give a man two guinea pigs

600
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,520
 As long as what is male and once female

601
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
 And they're both of the right age

602
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
 They're sort of, yeah

603
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
 And they fancy each other

604
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
 And this consent

605
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
 Yeah

606
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
 And he'll eat for the rest of his life

607
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,520
 I also, I enjoyed and really disagree with the advice

608
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,520
 Given smile whenever possible

609
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,520
 Which I think is a very old school idea of like

610
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,520
 Just whack a smile on no matter what you're feeling

611
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,520
 And it made me think of all those songs of like

612
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
 Smile when your heart is breaking

613
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,520
 Smile when your heart is breaking

614
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,520
 Put on a happy smile, you know

615
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,520
 Like all the wartime songs about smiling through the war

616
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
 Smiling through loss

617
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
 Smiling through tragedy

618
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
 Smiling through heartbreak

619
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,520
 Which was very of the 20th century

620
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
 It was very keep calm and carry on

621
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
 Bottle it in

622
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,520
 Yeah, exactly

623
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,520
 Don't let your smile ruin my day

624
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
 Bottle it up

625
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
 Pour a few drops into your ears

626
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,520
 Each night and morning

627
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,520
 So yes, I did not agree with that advice

628
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,520
 But it's quite common advice it's still given

629
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
 Do you know the first agony art was?

630
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
 No

631
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
 So far as we know?

632
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
 No, I don't know

633
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
 Clarina

634
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
 Plenty of the elder

635
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,520
 No, okay, so I would say this is, James is closer in time

636
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,520
 Possibly the 1600s

637
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,520
 It's probably really in the break

638
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,520
 In 1691 there was a guy called John Dunton

639
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,520
 And he had an experience where he was having an affair

640
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,520
 He needed some advice anonymously

641
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,520
 But there was nowhere to ask

642
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
 And so rather than thinking I'll just leave that

643
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
 He thought, "Wow, what if there was a place I could ask?"

644
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,520
 And so he invented an entire magazine

645
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,520
 The Athenian Gazette, which its job was basically

646
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
 To just answer questions

647
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,520
 So members of the public would just send in their questions

648
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
 And everyone on staff would write answers to

649
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,520
 And that is sort of like the modern version of the agony art

650
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,520
 There's probably examples of things like the Oracle of Delphi

651
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,520
 And all that sort of like the original agony art

652
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,520
 So this Athenian Gazette

653
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
 Or Athenian Mercury, it was also called

654
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,520
 It was supposedly this group of a dozen of the best astrologers

655
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,520
 And mathematicians and philosophers in the whole of London

656
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,520
 And scholars and all this

657
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
 Actually, it was just him and his brother-in-law

658
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
 And two other blokes

659
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
 And they were complete amateurs

660
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
 And they didn't know anything

661
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,520
 But people loved writing in the questions

662
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,520
 So the questions included

663
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,520
 What is the cause of suction?

664
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,520
 This is about love and relationships

665
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:14,520
 Why do Scotchman hate swine's flesh?

666
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
 Good questions

667
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
 I really like this one

668
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,520
 If I'm thinking of committing any great and enormous crime and sin as adultery

669
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
 But do not personally and actually commit it

670
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,520
 Am I guilty of the crime and sin?

671
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,520
 That's a great question

672
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,520
 Wow, I mean, that's given to agony aunts today

673
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
 Yeah, that's true

674
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
 Here's a couple more

675
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,520
 Why does love generally turn to coldness and neglect after marriage?

676
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,520
 I don't write it, Polly, if you're listening, I'm just reading it

677
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,520
 It was a bit QI-ish actually

678
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
 So one of them was

679
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
 Why should the putting of a man's hand in cold water

680
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
 Occasion a sudden emission of urine?

681
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,520
 Yeah, we have done that

682
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
 Yeah, and they said

683
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
 And I have done that again in life

684
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
 And they said it's not true

685
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
 They pointed out it's a vulgar error

686
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
 What?

687
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
 Sorry

688
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,520
 It was a coincidence then

689
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
 That you pissed yourself

690
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,520
 We did that to our baby last week

691
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,520
 Wait, wait

692
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
 So he had a fever

693
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,520
 We were in hospital doing some checks

694
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,520
 And they said to check for a urine infection

695
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
 We really need a urine sample

696
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
 And obviously it's a baby

697
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
 You can't just make him wait

698
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
 And he was a bit dehydrated from the fever

699
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
 So he was weaning not very often

700
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,520
 So they gave us a test tube with a funnel

701
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
 And they said you've just got to sit here

702
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,520
 And wait for him to wait

703
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
 And be ready to leap into action

704
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
 So bless him

705
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,520
 I was just for like a good hour and a half

706
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,520
 He was just sitting there

707
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,520
 With like my husband holding him up

708
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,520
 Me like staring at his winky

709
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,520
 Waiting, waiting to leap for the way

710
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,520
 And we were, it got to like an hour

711
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
 And we were like, oh my god

712
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
 I don't think we should blame parents

713
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,520
 But she does have a complex

714
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,520
 Me just staring at it

715
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
 Shaking a little tube

716
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
 And at the end we were like

717
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
 What about that thing of like

718
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,520
 If you put your hand or your foot in water

719
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
 Then it will make you wee

720
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
 So we tried it

721
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,520
 So we got one of those cardboard

722
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,520
 Bucket things that they had in the hospital

723
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,520
 And we filled it with warm water

724
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
 And we put his feet in it

725
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,520
 And it didn't work initially

726
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
 But about two minutes after he'd stopped

727
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,520
 Having his feet in water

728
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
 And what he did then wee

729
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,520
 But again, it's probably a coincidence

730
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
 We don't know

731
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,520
 That's science

732
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
 Maybe it's taking your feet out of warm water

733
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
 That makes you do that

734
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
 But people don't normally go to sleep

735
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,520
 In a swimming pool

736
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
 So we don't know

737
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
 We don't know

738
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,520
 One other interesting notable name

739
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
 From this period

740
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
 Who was into agony arting

741
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
 Slash uncleing

742
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
 Was Daniel Defoe

743
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
 Oh

744
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
 Author of Robinson Crusoe

745
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
 And yeah

746
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,520
 He would reply to members of the public

747
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
 And interestingly

748
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,520
 You know

749
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
 A lot of these replies were sometimes really crude

750
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
 So in one reply to someone

751
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
 He actually called someone

752
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,520
 Even though he sort of blanked out the full spelling of it

753
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
 But he called someone a whore

754
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,520
 You know, he basically disagreed with what she was trying to ask

755
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,520
 In terms of illicit sexual stuff

756
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
 And he said you were a whore

757
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
 I mean, it was really quite crude back then

758
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
 Terrible

759
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
 Just going back to deafness

760
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
 I got very into this woman

761
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,520
 Called Jaipreet Verdi

762
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
 Has written a book about

763
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,520
 Historical cures for deafness

764
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
 And it's also about

765
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,520
 The concept of deafness needing a cure

766
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
 It's very interesting

767
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
 But she talks about ear trumpets

768
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,520
 You know, like, remember in "Allo Allo"

769
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
 It's like the ear trumpet

770
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,520
 The sort of comedy item that is the ear trumpet

771
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
 But in Victorian times

772
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,520
 They would be customized

773
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,520
 So a lady say in morning

774
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
 That the example they've got in a museum

775
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
 It's been painted black

776
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
 And trimmed with lace

777
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
 That's cool

778
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
 That's her outfit

779
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
 And at first historians thought

780
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
 You know, this was a sign of like

781
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
 She had to hide it, you know, to be discreet

782
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
 Because it was an embarrassing thing to have

783
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,520
 But actually this author is making the point that

784
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
 How cool, it's really sort of owning

785
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
 Your deafness

786
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
 And it's customizing

787
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
 What you need

788
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,520
 It's sort of the equivalent of like, you know

789
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
 Pimping out your walking stick

790
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
 Or signing a cast, in a way

791
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,520
 Surely it's pimping up, isn't it?

792
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
 Not pimping out

793
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
 Pimping out your walking stick

794
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,520
 You sort of put it in the street with a little sign

795
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,520
 And Daniel Defoe calls it a whore

796
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:29,520
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

797
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
 And that is my fact

798
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
 My fact this week is that a tourist guide in Whitby

799
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,520
 Got so tired of being asked where Dracula was buried

800
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
 That he commissioned a headstone

801
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
 Just so that he could point at it

802
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,520
 Instead of explaining that Dracula wasn't real

803
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,520
 So this is apparently, it's a big problem in Whitby

804
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,520
 Whitby is one of the great scenes of Dracula

805
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,520
 When Dracula makes his way over to England

806
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,520
 And it is where Bram Stoker spent a few months

807
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
 Where he went looking around

808
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,520
 And he incorporated a lot of the landscapes

809
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,520
 A lot of the churches

810
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
 Even some of the names from the gravestones

811
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
 Into the story

812
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,520
 And the issue is that when visitors come

813
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,520
 A lot of them don't actually realize that Dracula doesn't exist

814
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
 So one particular guy, Harry Collett

815
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
 Who's a tour guide

816
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,520
 And he does tours around Whitby about Dracula

817
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
 So sick of being asked this question

818
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
 He did get one commissioned a headstone

819
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,520
 Which he can just point to as they're on the track

820
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
 And say, look, that's where he's buried

821
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,520
 Do you think maybe he should give up his job as a tour guide

822
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
 If he's sick of people asking him questions about Dracula?

823
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,520
 Yeah, well I guess that is a very good point

824
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
 Hang on, what does the headstone say?

825
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
 Does it say Dracula's here?

826
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
 Or does it say Dracula's not real?

827
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,520
 No, it says Dracula

828
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
 And then I guess the dates of Dracula on it

829
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,520
 That's a great idea for your headstone, isn't it?

830
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
 When eventually you die, it's like

831
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,520
 Here lies James Harkin

832
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
 Of course he wasn't real

833
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
 I thought he was just trying to...

834
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,520
 Because the church has put a sign on its door

835
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
 Saying Dracula's a fictional character

836
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
 So I thought he might be doing that

837
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,520
 Because actually, if someone tries to dig up Dracula

838
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,520
 They'll find, ooh, there's nobody there

839
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
 It's only gonna add fuel to the fire

840
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
 That's true

841
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
 Yeah, this church, the St. Mary's Church

842
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
 This is the church that appears in the book

843
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,520
 They constantly have people coming to the church

844
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,520
 Who are Dracula fans, asking about Dracula

845
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,520
 Apparently the pews are just quite often filled with Goths

846
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,520
 Who are sitting there just enjoying the scene

847
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
 Well it's Gothsville

848
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
 Yeah, it is Gothsville

849
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
 Whitby is, they have a twice annual

850
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
 In fact, they have four Goth festivals a year, right?

851
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,520
 So they've got the Whitby Goth weekend

852
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
 Which has been going since the 90s

853
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,520
 And then, in 2019, a rival event was set up

854
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
 Called Tomorrow's Ghosts

855
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,520
 There was a spooky schism in the Whitby Goth weekend event

856
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
 The founder had set it up

857
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,520
 And there was a parting of ways with a venue

858
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,520
 And so now there's a rival festival this year

859
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
 Called Tomorrow's Ghosts

860
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,520
 And I read their website about this year's autumn festival

861
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
 It says this

862
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
 Our headline is for 2022

863
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,520
 Our Fields of the Nephilim

864
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
 Who take the Friday night headline slot

865
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,520
 And really need little introduction

866
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,520
 Topping the bill on Saturday night are the loveless

867
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,520
 Who need some introduction

868
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
 They actually put that

869
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,520
 That's really good

870
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,520
 It's got a cool, quite gothic-y heritage

871
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
 This whole area anyway

872
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,520
 Yeah, not just Dracula

873
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,520
 I mean, St. Hilda was Whitby, wasn't she?

874
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
 St. Hilda was Abbess of Whitby

875
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,520
 Did she, like, drive the snakes out of Whitby or something?

876
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
 That's a story

877
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
 That's the story

878
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
 Well, she turned them to stone

879
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
 Is that not...

880
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
 That's driving them out in a way

881
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,520
 It's hard to drive them out

882
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,520
 They're less likely to bite you if they're made of stone

883
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,520
 Is that what the Ammonite stones are all about?

884
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
 That's what they call them

885
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
 The Snake Stones of Whitby

886
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
 And they're Ammonites

887
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,520
 But some people would carve little heads on

888
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,520
 So, Ammonite is like a little fossil

889
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,520
 That looks a bit like a snake, right?

890
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
 Yeah

891
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
 Especially if you draw her face on it

892
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
 Yeah, exactly

893
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
 Yeah

894
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
 Yeah, and she was...

895
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
 She started a monastery

896
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,520
 Which is on the spot where this place

897
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
 She would talk about St. Mary's

898
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
 St. Mary's, right?

899
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,520
 Yeah

900
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,520
 And, yeah, she resolved the date of Easter

901
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,520
 Yeah, she was part of the team

902
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
 Who did that?

903
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
 Okay

904
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,520
 There was the Synod of Whitby in 664 AD

905
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,520
 Where they all got together in Whitby

906
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,520
 And decided when we should have Easter

907
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,520
 Because some people were doing it in the Celtic time

908
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,520
 And some people were doing it in the Roman time

909
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,520
 Yeah

910
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
 And we thought, let's move down to the Roman time

911
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
 So, she...

912
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,520
 That was 664

913
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,520
 She was probably still alive in 666 AD

914
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,520
 She was, actually

915
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

916
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,520
 She was like a teacher as well

917
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
 She taught Kathmon

918
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,520
 Who was the first English poet that we know the name of

919
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
 She was his teacher

920
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,520
 The question, though, that we're all asking

921
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,520
 Was she a child prodigy, James?

922
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,520
 I know not

923
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,520
 I went to St. Hilda's College

924
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,520
 Did you?

925
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
 Yes

926
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
 And then they have a little Ammonite on their shield

927
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
 Did they?

928
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
 Wow

929
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,520
 That's cool

930
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
 I think that's called...

931
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
 That species is called Hildoceras

932
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
 Really?

933
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,520
 It was named in honour of her

934
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,520
 It was found in that area

935
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,520
 Yeah, nice

936
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,520
 There's a really cool set of stairs in Whitby

937
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
 Oh, yeah

938
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
 Ooh

939
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,520
 Yeah

940
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
 They sound pretty spooky

941
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,520
 As you head up to St. Mary's Church

942
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,520
 It's 199 steps to get to the top

943
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,520
 That's intracular, isn't it?

944
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
 Yes

945
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
 That's bench and intracular

946
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
 Yeah, yeah

947
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,520
 As you're going up them, there's little rest points

948
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,520
 Little...

949
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,520
 Ooh, benches

950
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,520
 Benches

951
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,520
 So, you sit on this bench

952
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,520
 And you think you're sitting on a regular bench

953
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,520
 But, actually, it's not a regular bench

954
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,520
 It's not...

955
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
 No, it's not a possessed bench either

956
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,520
 It wasn't built by yetis

957
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,520
 It was because the graveyard with St. Mary's Church

958
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,520
 Was at the top

959
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,520
 Yeah

960
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,520
 You had all the pool-bearers who were coming to carry up

961
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,520
 All of the dead bodies to get to the church

962
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,520
 And it's a very tiring business

963
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,520
 So, what's now used as seats, these planks of wood

964
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,520
 Were actually pit stops to put the dead bodies on

965
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,520
 So that they could get rest

966
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,520
 Yeah, it is spooky

967
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,520
 It is spooky

968
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,520
 The dead men's...

969
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,520
 Benches

970
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,520
 Benches

971
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
 Another thing about Whitby

972
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,520
 Is if you go to Saltwick Nab, which is just south of Whitby

973
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,520
 You'll see where the cliffs are

974
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,520
 There's huge chunks taken out of the cliffs

975
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,520
 And that's because they tried to get alum

976
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,520
 Which is a thing you get in shale, it's a type of rock

977
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,520
 And it's really useful because you could bind colours to cloth

978
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,520
 By using it

979
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,520
 But it didn't work on its own

980
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,520
 You needed ammonia as well

981
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,520
 And the way they got their ammonia was from stale urine

982
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
 Ah, urine again

983
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,520
 Urine again, we come back to urine

984
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,520
 And so, in Whitby, they used to have barrels

985
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,520
 Where you would go and wean to the barrel

986
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,520
 And then they would take the wee to the alum mines

987
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,520
 And then they would colour their cloths

988
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,520
 And did they have a little trough of warm water

989
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
 That you could stand in

990
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,520
 If you were struggling to get yourself going

991
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,520
 Yeah

992
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
 What point does urine go stale?

993
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,520
 I've never thought about that

994
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,520
 Well, I would say if you don't drink it straight from the sauce

995
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,520
 You could put it in a cup first

996
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,520
 If you drink it straight from the sauce

997
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,520
 The point is, and I think we've mentioned this in a quite recent podcast

998
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,520
 Is ammonia isn't naturally in urine

999
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,520
 And ammonia is made by bacteria

1000
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,520
 Urine is generally more or less sterile

1001
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,520
 So you get your urine, the bacteria comes from the air

1002
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,520
 Goes into the urine, makes ammonia

1003
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
 And that's when it becomes stale

1004
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,520
 So it takes a couple of hours

1005
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,520
 Have you ever forgotten to flush a toilet and then gone on holiday?

1006
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,520
 Wow

1007
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,520
 And then come back

1008
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,520
 That's when it stale

1009
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,520
 Oh my god

1010
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,520
 But Dan, if you're bottling it correctly with sterilised bottles

1011
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,520
 It lasts years

1012
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,520
 She's got to visit Andy's urine distillery

1013
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
 Keep it out of the sunlight

1014
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
 Wacker label on it

1015
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,520
 It's bringing them on the plane

1016
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
 It's from my ears actually

1017
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,520
 You have to bring so many under 100ml bottles though

1018
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,520
 That's the really annoying thing

1019
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,520
 Anyway, this urine, they couldn't get enough in Whitby

1020
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,520
 So they ended up putting barrels in Newcastle and London

1021
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,520
 To get enough urine

1022
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
 That's a long way away

1023
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,520
 A lot of piss, isn't it? Yeah, from a long distance

1024
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,520
 Well, there's a lot of people in London

1025
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
 So that was one reason why they went there

1026
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,520
 And they always tried to get the urine from poor people

1027
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,520
 So they put barrels in the poor areas

1028
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,520
 And they would want poor people's piss

1029
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,520
 Why?

1030
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,520
 Because it was illiterative

1031
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,520
 No, why do you think it was?

1032
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,520
 Something about poor people's diet or consumption of alcohol

1033
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,520
 Because he's got it

1034
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,520
 He's only got it, got it

1035
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,520
 Did they wanted it to be more?

1036
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,520
 No, they thought that the poor people wouldn't be able to afford alcohol

1037
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,520
 And so they didn't want alcohol in the urine

1038
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,520
 Because they thought it wouldn't set the colours properly

1039
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,520
 Do you know where Dracula was from?

1040
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
 He was from Transylvania

1041
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,520
 Well, exactly

1042
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,520
 But there is a minority theory that he was from Devon

1043
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,520
 Is this theory put forward by Devon?

1044
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,520
 There's a writer called Andy Struthers

1045
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,520
 Who claims that Bram Stoker was inspired by a load of different things

1046
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,520
 But he claims there was especially an Exeter writer called Sabine Beringould

1047
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,520
 Who'd written a book about werewolves, which Bram Stoker read

1048
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,520
 And a vampire story called Marjorie of Queather

1049
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,520
 And was therefore claiming that Dracula was effectively from Devon

1050
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,520
 Which I think would make him less spooky

1051
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,520
 I'm gonna drink your blood

1052
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,520
 Do you mind?

1053
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,520
 All right, my lover

1054
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,520
 Yeah, but his descendant, Bram Stoker's descendant said there's a mix of sources

1055
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,520
 Actually, you can't just say

1056
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,520
 Well, one of the sources was about Drackel, wasn't it?

1057
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,520
 Vlad the Impaler, who was from Transylvania

1058
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,520
 Was he a Wallachian or something like that?

1059
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,520
 And he supposedly read about this guy while he was in Whitby

1060
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,520
 So he went down to what was the coffee house end

1061
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,520
 And the public library there

1062
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,520
 He found the book there and that's what gave the inspirations

1063
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,520
 As you say, there's a lot of different accounts

1064
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,520
 He was already working on a novel, but it was about a character he called Count Wampire

1065
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,520
 Sounds like a Count Wampire

1066
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,520
 I thought that was the original... Wampire was the original Germanic

1067
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,520
 Still sounds stupid though

1068
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,520
 Okay, cool, sorry

1069
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,520
 I am a Wampire

1070
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,520
 Or rather, I am a Wampire

1071
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,520
 I've been to Dracula's Castle

1072
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,520
 How do you?

1073
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,520
 Actually, yeah, in fact, I've been to both of them

1074
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,520
 There's one which is real and one of them which is fake

1075
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,520
 The one which is fake is called Bran Castle

1076
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,520
 And that looks really gothic

1077
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,520
 It looks amazing

1078
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,520
 It looks like it could be his castle, but it really isn't

1079
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,520
 And there's another one which was his actual castle

1080
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,520
 It's about a hundred miles away

1081
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,520
 And that is just a... you know, it's a semi-detached house

1082
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,520
 I thought it was like Vlad the Impaler's

1083
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,520
 Yeah, but it's just like ruins really

1084
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,520
 And they have a few stakes with dolls on them

1085
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,520
 They do

1086
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,520
 But in the Bran Castle, it's way better

1087
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,520
 Because they've got a proper, you know, gift shop

1088
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,520
 Bran Castle, they've really made big on the publicity, haven't they?

1089
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,520
 So last year, Bran Castle got a bit of publicity

1090
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,520
 Because they offered free doses of the COVID-19 jabs

1091
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,520
 What?!

1092
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,520
 Yeah, with doctors wearing fang stickers

1093
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,520
 And they put it in your neck

1094
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,520
 No, they didn't put it in your neck

1095
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:57,520
 Interesting fact, I was in Bran on the day of the Brexit referendum

1096
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,520
 Oh!

1097
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,520
 You're gonna have a spooky loss of trade

1098
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:11,520
 Okay, that's it

1099
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,520
