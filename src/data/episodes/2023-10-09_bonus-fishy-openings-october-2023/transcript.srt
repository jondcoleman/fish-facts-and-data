00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Hello to you club fishers out there. Hope you enjoy all of your benefits that you get. All of those adverts that you don't have to listen to, isn't it great?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Don't forget to go to our Discord if you would like to speak to like-minded fish fans. You can find that by going to NoticesThingsFish.com/FishCord.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 But this is nothing to do with that, this is your bonus content for the week of whatever week it is now, sometime in October. And it is something that I have quite dubiously called fishy openings.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Now we have just done an amazing summer of live shows in the Soho Theatre and at the start of each show we come out, we chat to the audience, we do a little bit of facts.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 We did that 11 times and what I've done is I've smooshed it all together into what I hope you really enjoy.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 It's a load of silliness that no one who listens to the podcast will get. Usually it will be safe for the people in the room but we thought what a waste.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Why not let the good folk in the club fish village hear it as well. So hope you enjoy it. Apologies for the title. But anyway, on with fishy openings.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 [Opening music]

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Nine years ago, a podcast started and now, nine years later, it's still happening.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Are you ready to see, not all, but three out of the four people who started that podcast live on stage downstairs at the Soho Theatre?

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 [Cheering]

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Woo! Alright. Oh wow. Hi everybody. Who's ready for bed? [Cheering]

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 9.45, what the fuck are we doing? Thank you all for coming to our live show. How many people here have seen us live before?

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Four. Okay. How many people here know the show? [Cheering]

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Nice. Who here has no idea what it is? [Cheering]

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Oh. Oh, gosh, that's a lot. That was a lot more than. Wait, let's do that again. Who here doesn't know us? [Cheering]

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Okay, fuck done. Alright. If you don't know the show, basically we're a fact show.

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Not sort of like boring facts. We're sort of more, imagine if I was like, the boring facts. That's what we trade in.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 No, the kind of weird quirky things that you think, ooh, that's a bit exciting. The fact that's just like, it's so kind of quirky that it just is suddenly a bit sexy.

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 That's how I find it. No, okay, that's me. Alright. I just think sometimes you hear a fact and it gives you a little goosebumps and you go, ooh, when you hear it, right?

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Okay, James, please take over.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 What, do you want one of those facts?

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Yes, please.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Okay, I'll give you a fact. Well, you're Australian.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Yeah.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 So this is a fact about the war and during the war, and this is in the towards the start of the 20th century, British troops were given hand grenades that were the same shape as cricket balls because they knew that they'd be able to throw them better.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 The Americans were given grenades the same size as baseballs and Australia were given grenades shaped like boomerangs.

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Really?

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 No.

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 That is true.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 But luckily not the ones that come back because that was...

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Yeah.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Wow, that's very cool.

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It's actually a fact.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Andy, have you got a fact for our fact filled evening?

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 No.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 You don't?

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Well, I mean, I once lost a cricket ball throwing competition to a seven year old child, so I'm just glad that I wasn't, for a number of reasons that I wasn't involved in the First World War at all.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Like loads.

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Shall I give you one more?

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So this is one that doesn't really work spoken, but if you could read it here, it's brilliant.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Hang on a sec.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Yeah, that is good.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 It is that the word vegan, the first use of the word vegan referred to an alien that lived on a planet that orbited the star Vega.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Isn't that amazing?

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 That is very cool.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 For 30 years, if you said you were a vegan, everyone thought you were an alien.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 That's brilliant.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 That, remember, I had a fact. It's one of my favorite facts I've ever did on fish, which also required the writing to sort of help you out.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 But we discovered that the Whoopi Cushion was invented by a Roman emperor, and he was called Elagabalus, but that was not his birth name.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And that's what I read that made me go unbelievable.

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 The Whoopi Cushion was invented by a Roman emperor called Basianus.

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Now, obviously it's Basianus, I have what you wanted.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 You look on paper, it's Basianus.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Do you know those puppet fidget toys?

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Yeah.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 They were invented by someone who'd had a dream about a field of breasts.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 No.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Blimey.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Wow.

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Sounds like whack-a-mole, but with boobs.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Pretty much, yeah.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Wow.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I've got one.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 OK, yeah.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 This was sent in, actually.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 We get a lot of facts sent in to our email, just, you know, people wanting to tell us.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So this was sent in by Matthew Coates.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So thank you, Matthew.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 This is about two brothers.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 There are two brothers called the Gretzky brothers, Wayne and Brent.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Between them, they hold the record for the most points scored

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 in the American National Hockey League by a set of brothers, right?

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Between them, they have scored 2,861 points.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Of those, Wayne scored 2,857.

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And Brent has scored four.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 During COVID lockdown, a group of scientists in France

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 who presumably had to form some kind of bubble

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 created the world's longest lasting bubble.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 OK, so you guys who haven't heard us before,

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 see if you can guess how long the bubble lasted for.

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 There was one person over there. How long do you think?

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 A day.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 A day?

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Pretty far.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Over there?

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 A month.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 A month?

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Bubble lasting a month.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 You're expecting pretty good facts.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Well, it was 465 days.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Really?

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Really.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 How many months?

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I don't know.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 That's incredible.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Yeah, amazing.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Was it made of different soap?

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 See, the thing about this show is we will go into more details

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 about the facts that we have written down,

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 but the ones that came out of my head...

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Not necessarily.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I think they came up with a new kind of polymer

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 that they could use to make bubbles that just lasted way longer.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 So cool.

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And they kept it in, like, a box.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Right.

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 In a vacuum.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 They kept it in a vacuum so that nothing could...

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Pretty cool.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I remembered a very pleasing fact during our...

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 So we've just done a show.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 We just finished.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 We've had a break.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And I was just looking through our archive.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 We've got this big fish archive that we checked

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 so that we don't repeat facts and shows.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And remembered this old fact,

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 which is Dolly Parton has a theme park in America.

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I don't know if you've heard of it.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 It's called Dollywood.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Right, Dollywood.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 OK, this is the most pleasing thing.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 What do you reckon the opening hours are of Dollywood?

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Everyone?

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 10 to 6.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 10 to 6.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 What the fuck, Dolly?

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Can I give you another fact which is about theme parks?

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Yeah, yeah.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 OK, so there are some orb-weaving spiders.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 And you might know this about spiders.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Sometimes when they're mating, the male will get eaten.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Now, the orb-weaving spider, the male,

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 will sometimes jump away as quickly as he can

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 to get away from the female so he doesn't get eaten.

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I worked out that if humans managed to jump away

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 with the same acceleration and velocity

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 and proportioned it up,

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 we would be able to have sex right here

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 and be in Thorpe Park in one minute.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Let's go!

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 What a finale to the show tonight.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 You're not big enough for this ride, are you?

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 So, last week we had a fact about hobby horses,

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 and there's a fact which I never had a chance to say in that show,

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 which is in the 18th century,

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 the word "hobby horse" was a nickname for a penis,

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 for sex, and for a prostitute.

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So you could hobby horse a hobby horse with your hobby horse.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 That's a superb fact.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Do you know, Mike, one of my favourite facts that you've told me,

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 which we've never done on the show, is to do with horses as well,

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 which is you said that the...

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 You know when you get Heinz tomato ketchup these days,

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 and it's the squeezy bottle, so it just comes through the squeeze.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 OK. Do you remember telling me this? Oh, yeah, yeah.

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 You said the guy who was inspired to invent that

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 was...he got the inspiration when he was standing in a field one day

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 in a farm, and he saw poo coming out of a horse's anus,

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 and he thought, "Imaginative bottles are going to release it."

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 In that...

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 That is true.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And tragically, he tried to mark it like squeezy horse shit.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Yeah.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Dan, I'm really sorry to do this. Yeah.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I'm really sorry to everyone to do this.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 It will improve the show vastly as we go forward.

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 I need to go for a wee. Oh, yeah, OK.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Can I get our guest in there? Yeah, yeah, sure.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Is James in a different hat?

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 He's got a Mrs. Doubtfire, this whole thing.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 The guest didn't turn up. A bit of a situation.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Don't worry, we're in control.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 So, I guess tonight is Mrs. Doubtfire.

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Can I just quickly check as well?

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Is my wife, did you make it in?

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Oh, a few. OK.

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Two people said, "Yes, interesting."

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Very interesting.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Again, another Mrs. Doubtfire situation has kind of developed.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 They were bound to meet eventually.

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 OK, so while James is going for a wee,

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 let's bring out our guest so you can meet her.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 We're very excited. She's an old buddy of me and Andy's.

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 We've been trying to get her onto the show for years.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 She hasn't been saying, "No, I've just forgot to press send on the tweet."

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And so, mentally, I've been trying to get her on the show for years.

189
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 And we asked her and she said, "Yes, please welcome to the stage

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 "our buddy, Lusanders, everybody!"

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Please welcome to the stage Rachel Parris, everybody!

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Sophie Duker, everyone!

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 It is Hannah Fry.

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 We are joined by Nerd Royalty.

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage Susie Dent.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Susie Dent!

197
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Nerd Royalty.

198
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 You are Nerd Royalty. Absolutely.

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 I'm shaking a bit, weirdly.

200
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 I think there's a difference between a nerd, a swat and a geek.

201
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Don't ask me, but I think there is a difference.

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Also, what do you think you are?

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 I like to call myself a geek, but I think I'm a nerd.

204
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Oh, really fact-checking.

205
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 At school, I was a twat. What's that?

206
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 The etymology of twat.

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Well, OK, there are two versions.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 One is it comes from an old English word, "thwitan",

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 meaning to cut off, meaning that a woman's genitals

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 are the cut-off version of a man, which is no good.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Or, you know, you have a twit and/or a twitchal for an alleyway.

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 I don't have to explain any more than that.

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 But they think it might come from that.

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 A twit and/or a twitchal.

215
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Wow. Yeah. Anyway...

216
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 If only when you were at school you had that combat.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 I mean, I had that on my fingertips.

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Do you want to hear a fact about numbers?

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah. OK, so the Burmese word for "one" is "tit",

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 and the word for "eight" is "shit".

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So if you ever need to tell a Burmese person

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 the number for directory inquiries,

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 it's "tit, tit, shit, tit, tit, shit".

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 That's amazing.

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Nice. Have you got one, Andy?

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 There was one that we got sent in, but it was also a bit rude.

227
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 So I don't want to give the impression that they're all rude,

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 but my one is also rude.

229
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And it was sent in by someone with an amazing name.

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 I don't even know how to say it. That one.

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Winone.

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Do you think so? Winona.

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 No, no, that's the interesting thing. OK.

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 This isn't even the fact. Winone.

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 This is just the bit before the fact.

236
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Winone, Winone, Winone, Winone.

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Winone. I think it might be a title.

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Feeling hot, hot, hot.

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 O-E-N-O-N-E.

240
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 It's one, one, but anagrams of the words one and one, like, one, one.

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 O-E-N-O-N-E. O-E-N-O-N-E.

242
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Winone. Yeah, yeah.

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Does anyone know how that name's pronounced?

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 One, one.

245
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 I don't think it's that. Anyway. OK.

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Her fact is that Alan Partridge is currently donating his semen

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 to save a rare pony from extinction.

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Ah!

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And what it turns out is that there is a rare pony

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 who has been named Alan Partridge.

251
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Aha!

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And that's the noise he makes as he makes the donation.

253
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Yeah, so that's just a great fact from a listener.

254
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Can I do one that's not quite so heartwarming?

255
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

256
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 This is something I read this week.

257
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 It is that if you heat a male bee up to 42 degrees for six hours,

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 it will ejaculate itself to death.

259
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Oh! What?

260
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 So don't do that.

261
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Wow.

262
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 That's the fact... In nine years of doing a show,

263
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 that's the fact I've known least how to respond to.

264
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Yeah!

265
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I'm just thinking, like, of a bee version of a Bond film.

266
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 No, Mr. Bond.

267
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 I expect you to. Around four o'clock this afternoon.

268
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 You'll notice an empty seat here.

269
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 If you're a regular listener to the show,

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Anna Tyshinsky is usually the fourth member of Fish,

271
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 but she's been away.

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And so it's been a mixture of new people and old classics,

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 some of the people who've been with us for ages.

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And tonight, we have someone who is with us on episode three

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 of No Such Thing as a Fish.

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Yeah, they're an old classic.

277
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 They are an old withered classic.

278
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Are you still going to come on?

279
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 OK, he's still agreeing to come on.

280
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 No, we're very excited to finally get to sit on stage with him.

281
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 He is podcast royalty.

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 He is the host of a show called You Are Dead To Me.

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 He is, of course, Greg Jenner!

284
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Everybody!

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

286
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Old Greg.

287
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Old withered Greg.

288
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 If only it weren't true, it is true.

289
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Honestly, I spent 100 quid on moisturiser today.

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 I absolutely am owning it, the withered.

291
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 I hate doing what I'm about to do, but I'm doing it anyway.

292
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 You just told me a great fact before we came on stage.

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Your favourite fact, which is about Tom Hanks.

294
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Do you mind repeating it?

295
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 So, I'm half French.

296
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 My auntie Jacqueline lives in Paris,

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 and whenever she mentions a Tom Hanks movie,

298
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 she does it in her French accent,

299
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 which means that she tells me about the latest Tom Hanks movie.

300
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Tom Hanks? I love Tom Hanks so much.

301
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 It's such a good headline for him.

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 He released a film that was a real stinker, you know, Tom Hanks.

303
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 But they wouldn't know, because it wouldn't work,

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 because they were in France, which is how you say his name.

305
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Roll a theme tune.

306
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Do you want to...? I'll give you a fact.

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 So, this is one that I wanted to do for the show,

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 but it got turned down by these guys.

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 The fact is that Relivrio, which is a drug for ALS,

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 which was part-funded thanks to the Ice Bucket Challenge,

311
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 should always be taken with room temperature water.

312
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 LAUGHTER

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I wish we hadn't rejected it now.

314
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 That went way better than I thought it was going to be.

315
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Is it too late to swap tonight?

316
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Can I read out an email that we got recently?

317
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Yeah, sure. I sort of do the fish inbox, and it's great fun.

318
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And it's just to show, like, we have fans who really love the show,

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 and thank you all for coming, and so on.

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 So here's a nice message from a guy called Alex.

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 "Can't recall guest author.

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 "Good morning. Been listening to the podcast on and off

323
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 "probably for the last six years.

324
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 "I love it. I recall how you had a guest author on...

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 "I would say in the last six months

326
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 "who wrote a book on conspiracy theories.

327
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 "I've been racking my brain and can't recall who it was and the book.

328
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 "Any help would be appreciated. Keep up the good work."

329
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 It's Dan's book.

330
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 You had a guest on?

331
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Well, I can't promote my fucking book on my own show.

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 - Wow. - You're a really good guest.

333
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Do you remember the... Yeah, do you remember?

334
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Yeah, well, you keep having me back. I'm really grateful.

335
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Nine years.

336
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 So here's a fact I learned this week.

337
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 In the 1800s, a dictionary was sometimes called a dick.

338
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 So if you were the kind of person who used long words

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 that you didn't really understand, someone might say to you,

340
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 "Have you swallowed a dick?"

341
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 - No. - Just useful if you ever go back in time.

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Yeah. OK, so, listen, we ought to do a show.

343
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 So I think what we'll do is we'll bring our guest out for tonight.

344
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 So Anna's away, and so every show since she's been away,

345
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 we've been having a new guest, which is really exciting,

346
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 and we're very excited to have our guest here tonight.

347
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 She's a very good friend of us, the three of us.

348
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 We've known her for ages.

349
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 In fact, I was looking up a stat because we can tell stats

350
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 through the place that hosts our podcast,

351
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 and the number one most listened-to episode that we've ever done

352
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 had our guest on from tonight, who is joining us tonight.

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Yeah, yeah. Do you know who wasn't on that episode?

354
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Yeah, this fucker.

355
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Anyway, she is one of the funniest people around.

356
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Please welcome to the stage one of the greatest fish guests

357
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 we've ever had, Carrie-Ad Lloyd, everybody!

358
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 It's Jamie Morton, everybody!

359
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Sally Phillips!

360
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Ella Alshamahi, everyone!

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 It is Richard Osmar!

362
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Hello, everyone.

363
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Obviously, a lot of you haven't heard of Richard.

364
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 He's, yeah, pointless and...

365
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Yeah, well, thank you.

366
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 It's a pleasure to be here for two main reasons.

367
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Firstly, I'm a huge fan of the podcast, as you well know.

368
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Secondly, what a lovely opportunity for me to officially announce

369
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 I'm doing strictly this year.

370
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 I'm not really... Come on.

371
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Come on, everybody.

372
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Wow.

373
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 You'd be amazing.

374
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Listen, I don't have time to do all the training

375
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 and have the affair. I couldn't do it.

376
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 LAUGHTER

377
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 All right, we're going to record a podcast and then, yeah,

378
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 and then we'll finish and Andy can go to bed.

379
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 It's so slow. It's good, it's good.

380
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 I'm just so impressed by all you guys.

381
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I just want to say thank you so much for coming to a show

382
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 which starts at 9.45pm, because, like,

383
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 I think you're all fucking vampires.

384
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I have no idea how you've done it.

385
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 I'm so impressed.

386
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 All right, let's do it. Let's start the show.

387
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 So, let's roll theme tune.

388
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 MUSIC

389
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 ..

390
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 ..

391
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,580
 (upbeat music)

392
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,160
 (upbeat music)
