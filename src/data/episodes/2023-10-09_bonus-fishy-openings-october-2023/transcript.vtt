00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Hello to you club fishers out there. Hope you enjoy all of your benefits that you get. All of those adverts that you don't have to listen to, isn't it great?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Don't forget to go to our Discord if you would like to speak to like-minded fish fans. You can find that by going to NoticesThingsFish.com/FishCord.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 But this is nothing to do with that, this is your bonus content for the week of whatever week it is now, sometime in October. And it is something that I have quite dubiously called fishy openings.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Now we have just done an amazing summer of live shows in the Soho Theatre and at the start of each show we come out, we chat to the audience, we do a little bit of facts.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 We did that 11 times and what I've done is I've smooshed it all together into what I hope you really enjoy.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 It's a load of silliness that no one who listens to the podcast will get. Usually it will be safe for the people in the room but we thought what a waste.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Why not let the good folk in the club fish village hear it as well. So hope you enjoy it. Apologies for the title. But anyway, on with fishy openings.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 [Opening music]

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Nine years ago, a podcast started and now, nine years later, it's still happening.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Are you ready to see, not all, but three out of the four people who started that podcast live on stage downstairs at the Soho Theatre?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 [Cheering]

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Woo! Alright. Oh wow. Hi everybody. Who's ready for bed? [Cheering]

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 9.45, what the fuck are we doing? Thank you all for coming to our live show. How many people here have seen us live before?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Four. Okay. How many people here know the show? [Cheering]

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Nice. Who here has no idea what it is? [Cheering]

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Oh. Oh, gosh, that's a lot. That was a lot more than. Wait, let's do that again. Who here doesn't know us? [Cheering]

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Okay, fuck done. Alright. If you don't know the show, basically we're a fact show.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Not sort of like boring facts. We're sort of more, imagine if I was like, the boring facts. That's what we trade in.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 No, the kind of weird quirky things that you think, ooh, that's a bit exciting. The fact that's just like, it's so kind of quirky that it just is suddenly a bit sexy.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 That's how I find it. No, okay, that's me. Alright. I just think sometimes you hear a fact and it gives you a little goosebumps and you go, ooh, when you hear it, right?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Okay, James, please take over.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 What, do you want one of those facts?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Yes, please.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Okay, I'll give you a fact. Well, you're Australian.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Yeah.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 So this is a fact about the war and during the war, and this is in the towards the start of the 20th century, British troops were given hand grenades that were the same shape as cricket balls because they knew that they'd be able to throw them better.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 The Americans were given grenades the same size as baseballs and Australia were given grenades shaped like boomerangs.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Really?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 No.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 That is true.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 But luckily not the ones that come back because that was...

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Yeah.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Wow, that's very cool.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 It's actually a fact.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Andy, have you got a fact for our fact filled evening?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 No.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 You don't?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Well, I mean, I once lost a cricket ball throwing competition to a seven year old child, so I'm just glad that I wasn't, for a number of reasons that I wasn't involved in the First World War at all.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Like loads.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Shall I give you one more?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 So this is one that doesn't really work spoken, but if you could read it here, it's brilliant.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Hang on a sec.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Yeah, that is good.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 It is that the word vegan, the first use of the word vegan referred to an alien that lived on a planet that orbited the star Vega.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Isn't that amazing?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 That is very cool.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 For 30 years, if you said you were a vegan, everyone thought you were an alien.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 That's brilliant.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 That, remember, I had a fact. It's one of my favorite facts I've ever did on fish, which also required the writing to sort of help you out.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 But we discovered that the Whoopi Cushion was invented by a Roman emperor, and he was called Elagabalus, but that was not his birth name.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And that's what I read that made me go unbelievable.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 The Whoopi Cushion was invented by a Roman emperor called Basianus.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Now, obviously it's Basianus, I have what you wanted.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 You look on paper, it's Basianus.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Do you know those puppet fidget toys?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Yeah.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 They were invented by someone who'd had a dream about a field of breasts.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 No.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Blimey.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Wow.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Sounds like whack-a-mole, but with boobs.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Pretty much, yeah.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Wow.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 I've got one.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 OK, yeah.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 This was sent in, actually.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 We get a lot of facts sent in to our email, just, you know, people wanting to tell us.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 So this was sent in by Matthew Coates.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 So thank you, Matthew.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 This is about two brothers.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 There are two brothers called the Gretzky brothers, Wayne and Brent.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Between them, they hold the record for the most points scored

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 in the American National Hockey League by a set of brothers, right?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Between them, they have scored 2,861 points.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Of those, Wayne scored 2,857.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 And Brent has scored four.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 During COVID lockdown, a group of scientists in France

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 who presumably had to form some kind of bubble

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 created the world's longest lasting bubble.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 OK, so you guys who haven't heard us before,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 see if you can guess how long the bubble lasted for.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 There was one person over there. How long do you think?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 A day.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 A day?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Pretty far.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Over there?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 A month.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 A month?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Bubble lasting a month.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 You're expecting pretty good facts.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Well, it was 465 days.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Really?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Really.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 How many months?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 I don't know.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 That's incredible.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Yeah, amazing.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Was it made of different soap?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 See, the thing about this show is we will go into more details

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 about the facts that we have written down,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 but the ones that came out of my head...

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Not necessarily.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 I think they came up with a new kind of polymer

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 that they could use to make bubbles that just lasted way longer.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 So cool.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 And they kept it in, like, a box.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 Right.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 In a vacuum.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 They kept it in a vacuum so that nothing could...

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Pretty cool.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 I remembered a very pleasing fact during our...

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 So we've just done a show.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 We just finished.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 We've had a break.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And I was just looking through our archive.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 We've got this big fish archive that we checked

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 so that we don't repeat facts and shows.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 And remembered this old fact,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 which is Dolly Parton has a theme park in America.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 I don't know if you've heard of it.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 It's called Dollywood.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Right, Dollywood.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 OK, this is the most pleasing thing.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 What do you reckon the opening hours are of Dollywood?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 Everyone?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 10 to 6.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 10 to 6.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 What the fuck, Dolly?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Can I give you another fact which is about theme parks?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 OK, so there are some orb-weaving spiders.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 And you might know this about spiders.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Sometimes when they're mating, the male will get eaten.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Now, the orb-weaving spider, the male,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 will sometimes jump away as quickly as he can

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 to get away from the female so he doesn't get eaten.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 I worked out that if humans managed to jump away

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 with the same acceleration and velocity

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 and proportioned it up,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 we would be able to have sex right here

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 and be in Thorpe Park in one minute.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Let's go!

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 What a finale to the show tonight.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 You're not big enough for this ride, are you?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 So, last week we had a fact about hobby horses,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 and there's a fact which I never had a chance to say in that show,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 which is in the 18th century,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 the word "hobby horse" was a nickname for a penis,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 for sex, and for a prostitute.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 So you could hobby horse a hobby horse with your hobby horse.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 That's a superb fact.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Do you know, Mike, one of my favourite facts that you've told me,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 which we've never done on the show, is to do with horses as well,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 which is you said that the...

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 You know when you get Heinz tomato ketchup these days,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 and it's the squeezy bottle, so it just comes through the squeeze.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 OK. Do you remember telling me this? Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 You said the guy who was inspired to invent that

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 was...he got the inspiration when he was standing in a field one day

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 in a farm, and he saw poo coming out of a horse's anus,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 and he thought, "Imaginative bottles are going to release it."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 In that...

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 That is true.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 And tragically, he tried to mark it like squeezy horse shit.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Yeah.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Dan, I'm really sorry to do this. Yeah.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 I'm really sorry to everyone to do this.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 It will improve the show vastly as we go forward.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 I need to go for a wee. Oh, yeah, OK.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Can I get our guest in there? Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Is James in a different hat?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 He's got a Mrs. Doubtfire, this whole thing.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 The guest didn't turn up. A bit of a situation.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Don't worry, we're in control.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 So, I guess tonight is Mrs. Doubtfire.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 Can I just quickly check as well?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Is my wife, did you make it in?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Oh, a few. OK.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Two people said, "Yes, interesting."

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Very interesting.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Again, another Mrs. Doubtfire situation has kind of developed.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 They were bound to meet eventually.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 OK, so while James is going for a wee,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 let's bring out our guest so you can meet her.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 We're very excited. She's an old buddy of me and Andy's.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 We've been trying to get her onto the show for years.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 She hasn't been saying, "No, I've just forgot to press send on the tweet."

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And so, mentally, I've been trying to get her on the show for years.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 And we asked her and she said, "Yes, please welcome to the stage

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 "our buddy, Lusanders, everybody!"

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Please welcome to the stage Rachel Parris, everybody!

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Sophie Duker, everyone!

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 It is Hannah Fry.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 We are joined by Nerd Royalty.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage Susie Dent.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Susie Dent!

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Nerd Royalty.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 You are Nerd Royalty. Absolutely.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 I'm shaking a bit, weirdly.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 I think there's a difference between a nerd, a swat and a geek.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Don't ask me, but I think there is a difference.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 Also, what do you think you are?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 I like to call myself a geek, but I think I'm a nerd.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Oh, really fact-checking.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 At school, I was a twat. What's that?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 The etymology of twat.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Well, OK, there are two versions.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 One is it comes from an old English word, "thwitan",

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 meaning to cut off, meaning that a woman's genitals

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 are the cut-off version of a man, which is no good.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Or, you know, you have a twit and/or a twitchal for an alleyway.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 I don't have to explain any more than that.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 But they think it might come from that.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 A twit and/or a twitchal.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Wow. Yeah. Anyway...

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 If only when you were at school you had that combat.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 I mean, I had that on my fingertips.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Do you want to hear a fact about numbers?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Oh, yeah, yeah. OK, so the Burmese word for "one" is "tit",

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 and the word for "eight" is "shit".

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 So if you ever need to tell a Burmese person

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 the number for directory inquiries,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 it's "tit, tit, shit, tit, tit, shit".

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 That's amazing.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Nice. Have you got one, Andy?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 There was one that we got sent in, but it was also a bit rude.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 So I don't want to give the impression that they're all rude,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 but my one is also rude.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 And it was sent in by someone with an amazing name.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 I don't even know how to say it. That one.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Winone.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Do you think so? Winona.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 No, no, that's the interesting thing. OK.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 This isn't even the fact. Winone.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 This is just the bit before the fact.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Winone, Winone, Winone, Winone.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Winone. I think it might be a title.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Feeling hot, hot, hot.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 O-E-N-O-N-E.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 It's one, one, but anagrams of the words one and one, like, one, one.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 O-E-N-O-N-E. O-E-N-O-N-E.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Winone. Yeah, yeah.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Does anyone know how that name's pronounced?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 One, one.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 I don't think it's that. Anyway. OK.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Her fact is that Alan Partridge is currently donating his semen

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 to save a rare pony from extinction.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 Ah!

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 And what it turns out is that there is a rare pony

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 who has been named Alan Partridge.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Aha!

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 And that's the noise he makes as he makes the donation.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Yeah, so that's just a great fact from a listener.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 Can I do one that's not quite so heartwarming?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 This is something I read this week.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 It is that if you heat a male bee up to 42 degrees for six hours,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 it will ejaculate itself to death.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Oh! What?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 So don't do that.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Wow.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 That's the fact... In nine years of doing a show,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 that's the fact I've known least how to respond to.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 Yeah!

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 I'm just thinking, like, of a bee version of a Bond film.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 No, Mr. Bond.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 I expect you to. Around four o'clock this afternoon.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 You'll notice an empty seat here.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 If you're a regular listener to the show,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Anna Tyshinsky is usually the fourth member of Fish,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 but she's been away.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 And so it's been a mixture of new people and old classics,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 some of the people who've been with us for ages.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 And tonight, we have someone who is with us on episode three

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Yeah, they're an old classic.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 They are an old withered classic.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Are you still going to come on?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 OK, he's still agreeing to come on.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 No, we're very excited to finally get to sit on stage with him.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 He is podcast royalty.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 He is the host of a show called You Are Dead To Me.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 He is, of course, Greg Jenner!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Everybody!

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Old Greg.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Old withered Greg.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 If only it weren't true, it is true.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Honestly, I spent 100 quid on moisturiser today.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 I absolutely am owning it, the withered.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 I hate doing what I'm about to do, but I'm doing it anyway.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 You just told me a great fact before we came on stage.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Your favourite fact, which is about Tom Hanks.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Do you mind repeating it?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 So, I'm half French.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 My auntie Jacqueline lives in Paris,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 and whenever she mentions a Tom Hanks movie,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 she does it in her French accent,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 which means that she tells me about the latest Tom Hanks movie.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Tom Hanks? I love Tom Hanks so much.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 It's such a good headline for him.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 He released a film that was a real stinker, you know, Tom Hanks.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 But they wouldn't know, because it wouldn't work,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 because they were in France, which is how you say his name.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Roll a theme tune.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Do you want to...? I'll give you a fact.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 So, this is one that I wanted to do for the show,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 but it got turned down by these guys.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 The fact is that Relivrio, which is a drug for ALS,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 which was part-funded thanks to the Ice Bucket Challenge,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 should always be taken with room temperature water.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 LAUGHTER

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 I wish we hadn't rejected it now.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 That went way better than I thought it was going to be.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Is it too late to swap tonight?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Can I read out an email that we got recently?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Yeah, sure. I sort of do the fish inbox, and it's great fun.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And it's just to show, like, we have fans who really love the show,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 and thank you all for coming, and so on.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 So here's a nice message from a guy called Alex.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 "Can't recall guest author.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 "Good morning. Been listening to the podcast on and off

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 "probably for the last six years.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 "I love it. I recall how you had a guest author on...

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 "I would say in the last six months

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 "who wrote a book on conspiracy theories.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 "I've been racking my brain and can't recall who it was and the book.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 "Any help would be appreciated. Keep up the good work."

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 It's Dan's book.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 You had a guest on?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Well, I can't promote my fucking book on my own show.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 - Wow. - You're a really good guest.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Do you remember the... Yeah, do you remember?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Yeah, well, you keep having me back. I'm really grateful.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 Nine years.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 So here's a fact I learned this week.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 In the 1800s, a dictionary was sometimes called a dick.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 So if you were the kind of person who used long words

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 that you didn't really understand, someone might say to you,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 "Have you swallowed a dick?"

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 - No. - Just useful if you ever go back in time.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Yeah. OK, so, listen, we ought to do a show.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 So I think what we'll do is we'll bring our guest out for tonight.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 So Anna's away, and so every show since she's been away,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 we've been having a new guest, which is really exciting,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 and we're very excited to have our guest here tonight.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 She's a very good friend of us, the three of us.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 We've known her for ages.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 In fact, I was looking up a stat because we can tell stats

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 through the place that hosts our podcast,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 and the number one most listened-to episode that we've ever done

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 had our guest on from tonight, who is joining us tonight.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Yeah, yeah. Do you know who wasn't on that episode?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Yeah, this fucker.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Anyway, she is one of the funniest people around.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Please welcome to the stage one of the greatest fish guests

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 we've ever had, Carrie-Ad Lloyd, everybody!

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 It's Jamie Morton, everybody!

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 Sally Phillips!

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Ella Alshamahi, everyone!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 It is Richard Osmar!

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Hello, everyone.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Obviously, a lot of you haven't heard of Richard.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 He's, yeah, pointless and...

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Yeah, well, thank you.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 It's a pleasure to be here for two main reasons.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Firstly, I'm a huge fan of the podcast, as you well know.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Secondly, what a lovely opportunity for me to officially announce

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 I'm doing strictly this year.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 I'm not really... Come on.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Come on, everybody.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Wow.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 You'd be amazing.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 Listen, I don't have time to do all the training

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 and have the affair. I couldn't do it.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 LAUGHTER

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 All right, we're going to record a podcast and then, yeah,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 and then we'll finish and Andy can go to bed.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 It's so slow. It's good, it's good.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 I'm just so impressed by all you guys.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 I just want to say thank you so much for coming to a show

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 which starts at 9.45pm, because, like,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 I think you're all fucking vampires.
