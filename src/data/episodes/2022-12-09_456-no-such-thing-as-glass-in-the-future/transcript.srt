00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,520
 Hi everybody, just a quick announcement before we start this week's show and that is that

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,320
 we have a special guest on. He's been on once before and he was so good that we decided

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,440
 we absolutely had to have him back. It's Jamie Morton from My Dad Wrote a Porno. He is the

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,080
 star. He is the one whose dad actually wrote a porno and we're having him on partly because

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,400
 he's a brilliant guest and also because it's a very sad time in podcast land because the

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,280
 final episodes of My Dad Wrote a Porno have just gone out all apart from the very, very

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,200
 last one which is coming out on the 12th of December and it features an exclusive interview

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,760
 with for the first time ever Rocky Flintstone himself, the Banksy of Erotica as they call

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,080
 him. Missed opportunity to call him the Wanksy of Erotica but never mind. Jamie was absolutely

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,360
 brilliant. This was such a fun episode to record. He is so funny. We think you're going

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,200
 to love it and so do check out the final My Dad Wrote a Porno episodes and all the other

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:19,720
 ones too. All right, on with the show.

14
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,040
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,840
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,400
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and special guest is Jamie Morton. And once again,

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,100
 we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven

18
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,880
 days and in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Jamie.

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:54,000
 Okay, so my fact this week is this week. I'm not on the show. My fact is Barry Fitzgerald

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,520
 is the only actor in Oscar history to be nominated twice for the same role in the same film.

21
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,600
 Oh, was the film an early version of Mrs. Doubtfire? Best actor and best actress. Yeah,

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:17,480
 exactly. No, no. He had one role. It was Father Fitzgibbon in 1944's Going My Way, which did

23
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,320
 win Best Picture, actually. Yeah, he was he was nominated for both Best Leading Actor

24
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,840
 and Best Supporting Actor. Yeah, yeah, which is insane. It doesn't say much for the rest

25
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,840
 of the cast, does it? Exactly. But he won for Best Supporting Actor. So he could have

26
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,000
 conceived of the one for both. Yes, but it went to Bing Crosby, who was the lead in the

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,440
 film in it. Or Co-lead. Hang on to it. One best film, it won Best Actor for Bing Crosby.

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,320
 Yes. But then Fitzgerald lost Best Actor, but he won Best Supporting Actor. Yes, correct.

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,280
 That is amazing. I know. What a sweep. Yeah. Do you have to pay entry fees for the Oscar

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,680
 Oscars? That is a great question, James. Andy. Yeah. Yeah, you do. I imagine you do. You

31
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,780
 have to nominate yourself. Yeah, yeah. You have probably an administration fee, like

32
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,080
 20 quid or something. 20 quid. Probably. But this movie sort of set a lot of records.

33
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,040
 For example, it's the first film to ever have two actors win the Academy Award for Best

34
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,360
 Actor and Best Supporting Actor. It was the first movie to get the Academy Award for Directing

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,920
 and Writing, which was by a guy called Leo McKerry, who wrote and directed it. Oh, so

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,640
 he won two. He won two at that one. It was the first film to win Beck's picture at the

37
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,840
 Academy Awards and the Golden Globes. It was the first picture to win Best Picture and

38
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,440
 Best Song. It has all these records as the first movie. No one's seen it. I never heard

39
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,480
 of it. Exactly. It seems such a waste. I suppose 1944 we had other things to worry about. Didn't

40
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,400
 they hit Europe? Well, it's interesting you should say that because during the war, all

41
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,520
 Oscar statues were made of plaster instead of gold or gold plated bronze, which is what

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,280
 they're actually made of. So he got a a plaster Oscar and he was a massive golf fan was old

43
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,160
 Barry Fitzgerald. And he was practicing his golf swing one day and he decapitated his

44
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,120
 Oscar. That's a great picture of him with like the head and the body. I was reading a bit

45
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,720
 more about this guy, Barry Fitzgerald. Yeah, yeah. Oh, interesting man. Yeah. He was childhood

46
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:19,200
 playmates with the siblings of okay, fine. James Joyce. Okay, not James. No, they thought

47
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,760
 he was weird. He was older and they said that he had a beard and glasses and was always

48
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,400
 reading books and so didn't play with him. His name Barry Fitzgerald. It's not his real

49
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,920
 name is it? And usually you do that because you arrive into the world of the arts and

50
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,560
 someone has your name and so you have to register your name right and you change it. But for

51
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,400
 him it was because he was trying to hide from the fact that he was sort of doubling on his

52
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,880
 work when he was meant to be working in the civil service. So they wouldn't, his name

53
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,200
 would be on the bill and they wouldn't know it was him. The worst thing was he worked

54
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,480
 in the unemployment department. So they had all of that. Yeah, they had all of the lists

55
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,400
 of who was supposed to be working and who wasn't supposed to be working. So all of his mates

56
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,000
 would have known that he was. He's a movie star. Oh, this is hard to hide because when

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,160
 he started, he was doing plays. He worked in the Abbey Theatre with Sharon Yates as

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,800
 well. So more. Oh, what a milieu. I know. He was once almost kidnapped before the opening

59
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,800
 night of a play he was in. By his boss who said you should be working. It was quite a controversial

60
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,080
 play and Ireland was very recently out of a civil war. You know, it was a febrile time

61
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,800
 and the play had a lot of controversial stuff in it and the Irish Times reported this. It

62
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,400
 was in 1926. Several gun boys turned up at Fitzgerald's mum's house. I don't want a

63
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,240
 gun boy. A young gunman. I mean, we've got a gun man. That's the thing. Yeah. I think

64
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,120
 people who carry guns around between places, maybe like gun runners or young people, maybe

65
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,240
 might be. Well, anyway, the gun boys were there at the door and they met his mum and

66
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,520
 they said, right, we're here to take him. Just keep him safe until the opening night

67
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,840
 is gone. So he won't be able to appear on stage in this play. Right. And she said, well,

68
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,360
 he doesn't live here. This is his mum. And I'm not telling you where he is. And so they

69
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,240
 had to go away and then he did the play. Wow. Yeah. What polite gun boys. Just because

70
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,480
 the gun boys still live at home doesn't mean that everybody's sleeping. They were 12. They're

71
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,640
 almost like knocking his barry. Okay, to come out and play, please. Have any of you ever

72
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,320
 held an Oscar in real life? Oh my God. I reckon there's an addict out coming out. You haven't

73
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:38,480
 lived boys. And I'll tell you something. I've held two. Same time. Same time. Oh my God.

74
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,040
 I went, I was name drop hideous, name drop, but I was at Emma Thompson's house for doing

75
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:48,840
 that. She's not that hideous. No, the name drop. She's lovely. She fed me and everything.

76
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,240
 No, but in her downstairs loo, her two Oscars right there. An interesting fact about Emma

77
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,160
 Thompson, you might know this, that she's the only person in history to have won Oscars

78
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,760
 for writing and acting. Still to this day. What? Yeah. Were they both for, I mean, was

79
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,200
 the writing one censored sensibility? Correct. And the acting one. I thought Jane Austen wrote

80
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,780
 that. Well, agreed. It was a controversial year. It's like when Kenneth Branagh won the

81
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,720
 Oscar for Macbeth or whatever he thought. Best adapted screenplay literally just used

82
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,920
 the words. He didn't actually win for that. I was going to come onto that. You mentioned

83
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,560
 Kenneth Branagh. You know, they used to be married. What? I did not know that. They

84
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,600
 used to be married and he just won an Oscar for writing Belfast at the last Oscars. And

85
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,240
 if he were to win an acting Oscar, him and Emma Thompson would be the only people in

86
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,000
 history to have acting and writing. And he's been nominated for two acting Oscars. So it's

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,600
 not beyond the realms of possibility. We sort of parent trap them back together, right?

88
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,280
 Well, maybe not. I think she's very happily married to Greg Wise, but you know.

89
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,520
 Jeremy, did you take a selfie of yourself in Emma Thompson's toilet? And what he was

90
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,400
 holding to Oscars? I mean, what were you taking a selfie with? Well, I didn't, but my friend

91
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,440
 did. And then weirdly later on in the evening, somehow, I think we were taking pictures and

92
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,280
 like we were like saying, oh, that had dropped me the more ever. And Gaia, Am's daughter,

93
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:23,240
 took his phone and found, honestly, about 50 selfies. She was like, oh, my God, that's

94
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,000
 so embarrassing. But I didn't because, you know, too classy. Yeah, wait till you get

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,160
 your own. Well, I'll be waiting a while. But I'm not sure that Barry Fitzgerald should

96
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,160
 have got the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Well, for example, there's a little a little

97
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,800
 goof in this, which is that so he plays a Catholic priest in this film, but Barry himself

98
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,160
 was Protestant. So he wasn't kind of fully aware of how priests act. And in the film,

99
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,560
 I haven't seen the film myself, but I didn't deserve the award. They want you. Well, apparently

100
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,720
 when he does the crossing of himself, you know, he does it the wrong way, which feels

101
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,400
 like as an actor, you would look into the basics and post. Oh, my God, that's possible.

102
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,000
 He doesn't do it the wrong way upside down, though. He does it right to left away. He

103
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,560
 should be doing it left to right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you meant to do the left to

104
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,320
 right. You do top to bottom. I go top to bottom, left to right. That's correct. Yeah. So yeah,

105
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,520
 take it back. Take it back. Curiously isn't everything in the arts, Dan. It's an interpretation.

106
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,120
 Do you think maybe he was making a comment on Catholicism as in, you know, like the devil

107
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,520
 probably would do it that way. Yes, yes, really good call. Oh my God, it's even deeper than

108
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,600
 I realized it was. Do you know that it's, this is a bit of a reach, guys, but I found

109
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,640
 this and I thought I'd share it. Male actors who have won or been nominated for an Oscar

110
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:46,040
 are statistically more likely to get divorced than their osculous acting peers. Interesting

111
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,400
 because because they've just got women throwing themselves at them. Well, because there's

112
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,960
 a thing called the negative consequences of positive status shifts. So basically when

113
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:01,240
 you get a bit arrogant because you've just been nominated or won an Oscar, men tend to

114
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,680
 leave their wives. Interesting. I could do so much better. And then there was, I remember

115
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,440
 years ago reading a book where Dustin Hoffman, struggling actor for years and getting bit

116
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,680
 rolls and stuff suddenly gets cast in the graduates. Yeah. And this line being that

117
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,960
 when he got the call, he tells his wife and they just stared at each other and there's

118
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,400
 an unspoken thing that's happening there, which is this is the end of our marriage.

119
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,720
 Bloody hell. Yeah, because he's now going to be, he's going to be globally famous and

120
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,920
 obviously he's going to go off and obviously that's obviously in the room to them too. It

121
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,240
 was obvious to them too in that moment that that was the end of their marriage.

122
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,040
 Gosh. To be fair, this does remind me a little bit of the time. I don't know if you, Dan

123
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,400
 and James, remember the time we won our first, uh, Chortle Awards. Yeah, I do remember that.

124
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,520
 We all split up when our partners didn't leave immediately. Speaking of Oscars. I keep my

125
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,040
 charsal wad in the bathroom, actually, um, which has led to a lot of weird stains on

126
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,760
 it, but. I keep one of my wards in the bathroom as well. We won a Webby Award. One of my wards?

127
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:05,160
 One of many. They don't all fit in the cabinet. That's the problem. So mine is next to a,

128
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,920
 um, a review that I got in the Sunday times, which called my dad wrote in porno the quote

129
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:18,040
 worst cultural event of the decade. So it's ying and yang in my bathroom. It was in the

130
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:25,040
 Christmas edition of the Sunday times, 2019. It was like a roundup of the decade and some

131
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,240
 absolutely poisonous little, little, little, little toad of a journalist. I won't name

132
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,600
 him. He knows who he is. Um, he finds a way to worm us into any bad review he ever gives.

133
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
 This was terrible, but not as bad as my dad wrote in a porno. So he'll be thrilled that

134
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,800
 we're ending. Um, yes, I thought it's important to kind of have them both to realize that

135
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,680
 neither really matter, do they? Oh, that's very good. That's like, um, Reddy Kipling,

136
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,680
 isn't it? If the tribe from the disaster, and you know, you treat them both the same.

137
00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:01,880
 It's exactly like that. I'm often called. Um, if you go on IMDB, they have lots of sort

138
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,600
 of tagging that you can do and people just go and do it. It's not like an official thing,

139
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,360
 but, um, there's loads of different tags and each movie might have 20 different tags. Uh,

140
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,760
 someone went through them to see if there's any correlation between these tags and whether

141
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,040
 you can win an Oscar or not. Uh, and the apparently there are some keywords that have never been

142
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,440
 even nominated for an Oscar. So zombie food fight and breast implant. There has never

143
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,520
 been a movie with any of those three things that has ever been nominated for an Oscar.

144
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,280
 I don't think that's true. It's the tagging. So it could be that's because I'm pretty sure

145
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:46,480
 that hook has a fantastic food fight. Absolutely not. But it must be something like production

146
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,380
 design or song or something. You're saying that my screenplay, my double D undead custard

147
00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:04,780
 brawl is not probably not Oscar worthy. Just quickly ask in my double D undead custard

148
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:13,100
 brawl brawl. Sorry. Um, is it the simply the breasts that are undead? It is. It's about

149
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:19,040
 a woman who goes in for a routine operation, a breast enlargement and she gets given the

150
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,720
 breasts of a dead person. Ah, yes. Yeah. And it's, and they come to life and they can put

151
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,360
 still attached to her and she's alive. Wow. That's weird. You rarely have a zombie attached

152
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,640
 to a human who's alive. We don't have a woman on this podcast where we normally do. But

153
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,800
 um, is that how breasts implants work? They just take the breasts off another person and

154
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,760
 stick them onto you. Is that right? I believe, I believe so. I did need to do the screenplay

155
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,780
 is still in the research phase. Russell Crowe has an Oscar. Doesn't he? Russell Crowe has

156
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,660
 one for gladiator. Yeah, he's got a few. He's got a best actor. No, he's the only one

157
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,300
 wants. But you know where he keeps his, um, Oscar, he doesn't keep them in his bathroom

158
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:03,460
 like, Oh, okay. I haven't been to his house and taken self. Oscar. Okay. Um, what's the

159
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,500
 most Russell Crowe place to keep an Oscar? Like his barn or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

160
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,360
 So close. In his chariot, I bet he has the chariot from gladiator. He's got, um, in a

161
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,800
 haystack. He's like, it's a needle in a haystack and he keeps it in his haystack. It's like

162
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,960
 it's a sort of metaphor. It's like your thing. Yeah. Has he got colosseum? Did he take that

163
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:29,440
 home as a prop? He has a chicken coop and he keeps it in his chicken coop at his ranch

164
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:37,040
 and he claims that it helps his hens to lay bigger eggs. Wow. All the cock crows sadly

165
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:44,140
 leave the chickens. That's the problem. Yeah. Yeah. Rosamund Pike buries her rewards in

166
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:50,900
 the garden. What? Yeah. So weird. She's so bloody goth, Rosamund Pike. She's all classy

167
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,780
 and la, la, la. Actually, there's a heart of darkness. She like leaves a little bit

168
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,180
 of the top of them to kind of glint in the sun. That's nice. Yeah. I know. It's, it's

169
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,140
 kind of interesting, isn't it? And what awards her she won? She's won like a Golden Globe.

170
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:07,720
 She hasn't got a chortle. She hasn't got a chortle. Well, you can't sacrilege to bury

171
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:23,640
 a chortle in the garden. They'll come and dig it up and take it off you. Okay, it is

172
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,560
 time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this week is that one of the attractions

173
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:35,340
 at Disneyland in 1956 was the bathroom of tomorrow, which included amongst other exciting

174
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:43,700
 exhibits an array of interactive faucets and a dramatic story of valves. Not valves. Yeah.

175
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,900
 What a narrative. What a narrative. Ripping. Any Oscars in this bathroom? Oh, God, this

176
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,340
 should be right. Except the, well, there's not, but the whole thing is kind of one big

177
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:58,240
 Oscar because it's gold the entire thing. Yeah. The idea was in the fifties, they thought

178
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,800
 in the future, everyone will have a gold bathroom. I think so. Basically. Exactly. Only Donald

179
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,480
 Trump has managed to make that dream a reality. Yeah. So this was part of an area of Disneyland

180
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,440
 that was opened along with the original Disneyland in America called Tomorrowland and Tomorrowland

181
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,320
 was going to have lots of exhibits where they could showcase how the world was going to

182
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:25,540
 look in the futuristic future of 1986. And it included things like this bathroom of tomorrow,

183
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,220
 whereby air conditioning was going to be in there. There were dumbbells so that you could

184
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,020
 do exercise while you're having a bath that were on the side of the bath, you know, all

185
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,340
 these sorts of like little innovations, but the whole premise of it, it was done by a

186
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,420
 company called the crane company. They were selling it now. So the bathroom of tomorrow

187
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:46,100
 was actually today. And yeah. And so this was one of many of these little exhibitions

188
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,920
 that were put on that were slightly sponsored by corporations who wanted to showcase their

189
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,920
 related stuff within this area of Disney. Yeah. Very cool. It was designed by Henry

190
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,240
 Dreyfuss, who was a designer. Dreyfuss also designed the classic black telephone, you

191
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,920
 know, this one that you basically see everywhere. He also invented most of the Hoover models

192
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,120
 of vacuum cleaners, the upright ones. And he was also the chair of the meeting of the

193
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,080
 International Organization of Standards Committee in Berlin when they kind of came up with

194
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,740
 all the different signs that there would be around the world. You know, like if you got

195
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,340
 to an airport, the sign for a taxi rank is the same everywhere. Yeah, I love that kind

196
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:29,500
 of stuff. I love those shadowy organizations that, you know, secretly, secretly dealing

197
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:36,980
 with signs. And I did, I went on a mad research bender last year for QI about plug, plug sockets

198
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,660
 and standardization of plug sockets. Yeah. Yeah. And are we going to hear fear about

199
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:47,520
 it now? I think for everyone's benefit. That would be the worst cultural events of the

200
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,680
 2020s if we did that. I had such an amazing time doing the research. I looked back and

201
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:58,160
 I've written about 20 paragraphs of just dross. So, yeah. This bathroom does have some good

202
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,960
 things in it. It had a sink, which you can adjust the height of. You just sort of pull

203
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,760
 it up or down. That's clever. Yeah. Accessible. Accessible. And, and if, you know, for kids,

204
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,060
 they can pull it right down and, you know, it's there. And it was hydraulic powered.

205
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,360
 And I think that's, that's cool. It's a good idea. Yeah. I mean, it totally a huge pain

206
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,440
 in the bum to install. But, you know, once it's in, it's in. Exactly. You know, yeah.

207
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,200
 Never think about it again. Yeah. And is it still there? No, it shut down after a couple

208
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,080
 of years. Yeah. It surprisingly was not as exciting for kids as they, as they probably

209
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,320
 thought it was. Well, this isn't just for kids, Dan. It's also for adults. Absolutely true.

210
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:39,320
 Yeah. I have worked for Disney parks and resorts for, have you? Like more than 15 years. I direct

211
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,100
 a lot of stuff. Are you in the mouse suit? No, you're not. There is no mouse suit, James.

212
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:49,260
 Oh, sorry. Mickey. Yeah. So I have been to the parks a lot. Wait, wait, wait, but there

213
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,660
 is a suit, right? No, he's saying it's just Mickey. It's just new. It's just a new rodent

214
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,820
 man running around, genetically modified mouse man. Mickey mouse. That's cool. Yeah, it's

215
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,540
 cool. So I have been there a lot, actually. And have you then got access? We've spoken

216
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,100
 in the past on the podcast about all these like crazy corridors that you can go. Yeah.

217
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,160
 The tunnels underneath what Disney has done all that. I've been in those tunnels. They

218
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,080
 are called, what are they called? They're called the Utilidores. All of these tunnels.

219
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,580
 And you know, they're actually not a basement. People think they're the basement, but because

220
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:26,120
 it's built in Florida, and it's essentially on a swamp, you can't have basements in Florida.

221
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,520
 Okay. So it's all. So everything else is on the first floor? Exactly. Magic Kingdoms

222
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,760
 on the first floor. What? Yeah. That's so funny. And if you walk up to Magic Kingdom,

223
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,900
 it's on a very, very subtle slope. So you're actually climbing up a full flight of stairs

224
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,660
 as you approach Magic Kingdom. That's incredible. That's incredible. Yeah. Wow. But those tunnels

225
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:52,860
 are mad. And there's everything in there. There's like coffee shops. There's like dry cleaners.

226
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,900
 Yeah, it's amazing for the staff, exclusive staff. Yeah. And it's good to kind of get

227
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:03,300
 people through the park so that like no character or cast member from one part of the park will

228
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,040
 ever be seen in a different part of the park. They'll just go through the tunnels. I imagine

229
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,960
 like a race of troglodytes who live under there and have never come to the first floor.

230
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,760
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that. I don't think it would be a great movie. Yeah. Disney

231
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:28,120
 will never make now. From the maker of Double D undead custom brawl comes. This does quickly

232
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,880
 on Tomorrowland before he goes to Broad Disney. It does sound absolutely bananas because

233
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,180
 all of it was sponsored by one company or another. And there were so the house of the future

234
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:42,780
 itself was actually sponsored by Monsanto, who later became extremely controversial as

235
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,620
 one of the makers of Agent Orange. Oh, really? Yeah. So Disney kind of dropped that sponsorship

236
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,860
 once. Yeah. Sort of, you know, came out. But all of these different firms. So American

237
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,660
 Dairy Association, American Motors, National Lead Paint, who sound great. Wow. Very much

238
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,200
 of an era, aren't they? Very mid 20th century. The Dutch Boy Color Gallery was sponsored

239
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,880
 by Dutch Boy Paint. Wow. Wow. Can't find much more information about it. Friends with

240
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,760
 the gun buys. Yeah. Amazing. And when they opened it, they didn't cut a ribbon, did they?

241
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,560
 They just turned some taps on instead of yeah. Yeah. Because it was the house of the future.

242
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,400
 Just to show that it's the future. Yeah. What's more of the past than cutting a ribbon? Yeah.

243
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,300
 I was told by someone that I worked with over there that this is an it is insane, this fact.

244
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,860
 Okay. And I'm not sure if I believe it, but he told me and I and he's very any work. So

245
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,460
 yeah, quite senior where though, is he one of the trouble adults? Has he gone nuts? He's

246
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:49,740
 not seen sun in 10 years. Let's just call him Mr Mickey M. No, the boss. No, 4% of all

247
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,060
 the photographs taken in the United States are taken at either Disneyland or Disney World.

248
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:01,200
 4%. 4%. It's not insane. It's quite a big country, isn't it? Yeah. States of America.

249
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,600
 4% is that's amazing. Mad, right? Yeah. It doesn't. You're right to be skeptical. Yeah.

250
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,240
 I was like, is that true? But wow, amazing. And you know, they also isn't just theme parks.

251
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,320
 They have cruise ships. Right. Have you been on a Disney cruise? I have. Oh my God. Okay.

252
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,520
 I've got so many questions to ask you. Right. Okay. This is amazing. Wow. I've never seen

253
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,340
 you so animated. Yeah. Not since we started talking about plugs that time. Okay. I was

254
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:31,300
 reading an article called Disney cruise secrets. Right. And I have to say it was the most disappointing

255
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,940
 article I've ever read. Okay. Let me just, I'm just going to tell you a few of the secrets,

256
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,220
 right? The Disney cruise secrets. Okay. Okay. Secret number one, Disney cruise state rooms

257
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:48,540
 are not ready until one 30 p.m. Secret. Secret. How's that a secret? I know it's only a secret

258
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:56,880
 when someone rocks up at 1230 and they say, yes, it's ready. Secret number five, you

259
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:08,680
 can bring bottled water on board. Secret number 14, Disney will provide you with soap. Oh,

260
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,720
 the soap's so good on the cruises. It's some of the best soap you've ever had in your entire

261
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,060
 life. I may have taken it with me. It's really good. Okay. So that is a secret. Yeah. Yeah.

262
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,820
 So can you confirm about the rooms are not being ready until one 30 p.m. I actually can't

263
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:30,820
 confirm that because here's the thing with those ships is that you have to get off them

264
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,740
 really early because they have a, they're, they're changed over the same day. So everyone's

265
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,080
 going to be off the ship by like nine or something. So how long are you on it for? Is it a few

266
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:46,700
 days? You can do two nights. You can do four nights. Dan, you can do a week. I'm now a

267
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:52,580
 travel agent. But so yeah, I guess the turnaround is that they, yeah, so until one 30, that

268
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,500
 gives them time to clean all the, all the stator rooms. That must be a chaotic four and a half

269
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,980
 hours on board. Just finding out what's left in all the rooms. I mean, that happens in

270
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:09,020
 every hotel in the world. It must be absolutely. But what's fascinating about the Disney cruise

271
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:13,680
 line is that they're the only cruise line on the planet that has fireworks at sea. Okay.

272
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,160
 So, yeah. So they have a big deck party normally on the penultimate night and they have fireworks

273
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:26,720
 that set off from the ship. And what's fascinating about these fireworks is that they are made

274
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,920
 from a biodegradable material so that when they hit the water, they become fish food.

275
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:39,620
 Oh, that's cool. Isn't that cool? That is really cool. Is it, do you need special dispensation

276
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,960
 for fireworks at sea? I think they would be able to. Yeah. Because it might be seen as

277
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,260
 a signal. It might look like flares, right? An SOS. Yeah. Wow. They're going very whimsical

278
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,640
 with that. They're very extravagant flares. Wow. They're sinking, but they also want to

279
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:01,860
 let them goofy is having a great time. I was once on one of these ships and they have these

280
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,720
 rides on board the ship. It's like a slide that goes off the edge. Oh, you know, this

281
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,740
 one is like kind of you stand on like a trap door and it opens and you go down a shoot

282
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:19,480
 and stuff. I got all the way up to the top, stood on the trap door and I was too heavy.

283
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,680
 But instead of saying, I'm sorry, sir, you're too heavy, they said, I'm so sorry, buddy.

284
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:34,660
 You're just too full of magic today. Too full of magic. I mean, I could see what they were

285
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:39,300
 going for, but it was even more annoying. I was like, just call me a fat bastard to be

286
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:46,980
 honest. That's so funny. So I had to walk all the way down in front of all the children

287
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,820
 and their parents. You said to each one, too full of magic. I was like, I forgot something

288
00:25:52,820 --> 00:26:00,280
 in my room. Sorry, couldn't get into 130. It was a low point on what was otherwise a

289
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:13,560
 beautiful trip. Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is that 5%

290
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:20,960
 of the world's electricity is spent turning big rocks into small rocks. Mad. That is mad.

291
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:28,220
 5%. That is crazy for something that sounds unbelievably dull. I know, but this is this

292
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,900
 is big. This is a big business. So what exactly is it? Because I'm I mean, I tried to research

293
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,260
 this topic. I failed. I'm not going to lie. I will be a passenger for this podcast. Andy

294
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,580
 educate me. I found this in an interview. I was reading an interview with a guy called

295
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,500
 John Stanton who specializes in crushing big rocks into small rocks. That's his line of

296
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,900
 work. He's a big rock crusher. And basically, when you're mining, you might get some big

297
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,160
 rocks out of the ground. But the ore is inside those and you can't just you can't just deal

298
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,480
 with the big rock you've got. You need to turn it into a small rock. Yeah, you need a

299
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,560
 rock crushing machine. And there are lots of great lots of great models available on the

300
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,920
 market. Yeah, can I ask when you say he's a big rock crusher? Is he a big as in like

301
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,040
 big in the industry rock crusher? Or is it specifically he's a big rock? I think it's

302
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,100
 all for those works on the two levels. I don't know how big he is as a man as well. It could

303
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,940
 work on three levels. I don't know. I don't know much magic. It doesn't. I saw that piece

304
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:30,260
 in the times. He's got as much magic as me. Wow. It's called comminution, isn't it? Turning

305
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:34,580
 big rocks into little rocks. Oh man. And then you screen them and then you might grind them

306
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:40,140
 smaller again. Yeah, crushing grinding. Do you know what's better wet grinding or dry grinding?

307
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,760
 Oh my God. Because they're both done. I do know. I've got an Instagram. No. I would feel

308
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:53,280
 like, what do you say better? Yeah. Grinding mills can be operated both dry and wet according

309
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,840
 to the encyclopedia Britannica. Let's go wet. Yeah. And wet grinding is predominant. Yeah.

310
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,120
 Wow. So what is wet grinding you just add? Give me a break. Literally read it directly

311
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,580
 from the encyclopedia Britannica. You add water to the crushing. Yeah. I just wonder why it

312
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:16,100
 helps. I guess it's lubricates. Yeah, lubrication. And it helps with like the dust probably. Absolutely.

313
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:21,660
 But when you cut into flagstones and things, it helps have a bit of water to kind of. That's

314
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,700
 true. How do you come from? I'm sorry guys have arrived. What can I say? Yeah. But most

315
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,340
 of them are like massive nutcrackers basically. They're all top loaded because then the pressure

316
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,700
 from the rocks above acts on the rocks that you're trying to crush down and so they're

317
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,040
 being forced into two different directions. Right. And you just feed the rock in and the

318
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,600
 rock cracks and because the metal surfaces are harder than the rock, that's, you know,

319
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,760
 that's the process. And then eventually when it's small enough, it's a dust and you can

320
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,960
 get the lithium out or the gold. So hang on. So you're using big rocks as your tool to

321
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,120
 crush the former big rock into smaller rock. It's helping. It's a partner. It's actually

322
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:02,640
 a thing called auto genus milling. It's literally just the rocks that you're crushing are all

323
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,220
 crushing each other. That's so cool. That's incredible. I love that. I was reading about

324
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:13,700
 the history of crushing rocks. Think too small. And one of us had to. I just want to give

325
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,660
 a shout out to the website machinerypartner.com. Okay. Because I'm quoting directly here. It

326
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:24,380
 was event in 1881 when Phyllitus W Gates got a US patent for his device, which was that

327
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,660
 was the sort of rock crusher. That was the basic model. Phyllitus. Not a name you hear

328
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:37,480
 often these days, is it? Yeah, Phil Gates. In 1883, Mr Blake challenged Mr Gates to crush

329
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,720
 nine cubic yards of stone in a contest to see which crusher would finish the job faster.

330
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,280
 The Gates crusher completed the task 40 minutes sooner. I was looking into humans who can

331
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,320
 crush rocks. Oh, that's good thing. Because I thought before we had machines, we must have

332
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,360
 needed humans. Yeah. Yeah. And then I thought, you know, can anyone do it with their bare

333
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:04,380
 hands? And I actually found the first non-Roman emperor, Maximus Thrax, who was supposedly

334
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:10,980
 a rock crusher. The first non-Roman emperor? Yeah. As in he wasn't born in the Roman Empire.

335
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:17,060
 Yeah, but he was. Sorry, but he was Emperor of Rome. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And he's a person

336
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,700
 who was very tall, but because he was quite a lot taller than most people, the exaggerations

337
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,020
 have been written down and it's hard to know where he was. So supposedly, and this was a

338
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:35,000
 Roman emperor, he was eight feet, six inches tall. No. Yeah. Apparently, his, his thumb

339
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,800
 was so large that he wore his wife's bracelet as a ring on it. That's how he's gonna hitch

340
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:48,640
 hike in that guy. And so during public events, he used to impress people by picking up rocks

341
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,960
 and crushing them with his bare hands and pulling wagons on his own. Yeah. Feels a bit

342
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,840
 demeaning for the Emperor of Rome to be having to do like, "Hey!" He had a very short tenure.

343
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,140
 It was three years as Emperor because he was overthrown because of his disastrous idea

344
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,280
 on war, just by some people, some other people. Yeah, just that's very impressive that they

345
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,520
 managed to overthrow. I mean, it's not just him fighting against everyone. He's not like,

346
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:23,440
 "Let's do a thumb war. Anyone can beat me in a thumb war. I will hand over." Oh God, yeah.

347
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,480
 But he's telling the gladiators whether or not they've survived or not. There's no mistake

348
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,280
 in doing that. It's like a foam hand in a basketball match. So this was a really interesting

349
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:42,640
 topic for me. Yeah. So I have decided to go a little off-piste and discuss The Rock. Did

350
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,440
 you know that The Rock's nickname as a kid was Jewy? I bet you didn't. No. Jewy. Jewy.

351
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:54,320
 Was it covered in dew? Yes, exactly. And that's the reason why. Do you know that he has a

352
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,640
 degree in criminology? I bet none of you knew that. He's an ordinary minister, guys. He's

353
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,040
 an ordinary... Okay, that's more understandable. That makes sense. On Jewy, is it like Huey,

354
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,960
 Jewy and Louis kind of thing? Do we know why? Or is it the Jewy decibel system? He's spent

355
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,200
 all his time in the library as a kid. I'm going to be honest, these are bullet points.

356
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,920
 I haven't really delve deep into it. Do you guys know what the smallest rock is? Here

357
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,000
 we go. Back to business. Back to proper rocks, boys. Well, okay. Well, what is a rock? You

358
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,560
 know, is a speck of dust a rock? No. Oh, it's not. Is a pebble a rock? Yes, I think it is.

359
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:35,440
 Okay. Is it grit? Is it smaller than grit? You guys are never going to get it. Talc seems

360
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:46,800
 pretty small. Yeah. Yeah. It's clay. Clay. Clay. Oh my God. Clay. Clay. Clay. I'm so

361
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:53,880
 excited. I'm going to have to really sell this coffee. Okay. No, this is really interesting.

362
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:00,080
 Genuinely, this sounds so boring. I appreciate that. You don't need to keep saying that.

363
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,680
 Everything in this segment follows that trend. So, which is smaller, sand or clay? We now

364
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:11,160
 know it's clay. It's clay. But you might not have thought that, right? No, no, clay. Like

365
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,840
 sand feels so fine. Like, you know, the very fine Caribbean sand, it feels so fine. Okay.

366
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,720
 So clay particles are unbelievably tiny. What is clay? Small rocks. It's a sort of little

367
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,480
 silica. I think it's a silicate. Okay. But yeah, you never feel it as like sand. It doesn't

368
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,560
 fall through your fingers. Yeah. Exactly. Right. But I think you've got clay soils and

369
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,960
 stuff like that and there it is in granular form. So particles of clay can be less than

370
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:42,400
 0.002 millimeters across. I think that's two microns possibly. It's unbelievably small.

371
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,000
 So the largest particle of clay you can get is not even a thousandth as big as the smallest

372
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,640
 particle of sand in the world. That's incredible. That's the scale of difference we're talking

373
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,440
 about. I take it all back. And this is the really weird thing. Clay particles can be

374
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,480
 so small. I'm quoting directly from a site I read here. Clay particles can be so small

375
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,440
 that it could take hundreds of years for them to settle from the top to the bottom of a

376
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,280
 bottle of water. What? Because it just takes everything gets in their way. Everything, you

377
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,520
 know, the tiny molecule of anything just disrupts the clay from its path. And this is why clay

378
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,480
 soil is so sticky is because there are so many spaces in between these tiny, tiny particles.

379
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,320
 The water fits in between the particles. So it just holds huge amounts of water. That's

380
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,560
 why clay soil is so heavy. Has someone actually done that experiment? No. We've had a plastic

381
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,160
 a hundred years ago. Yeah. Well, that's if they started then they would have, they would

382
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,920
 have watched it hit the bottom. I'm afraid I don't think anyone's done that experiment

383
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,040
 properly, but it just needs sort of. Yeah. And also we're actually banning plastic. Yeah.

384
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,600
 We don't want to encourage that. Do we? Sorry. I found a mystery rock. Oh, it's a mystery

385
00:34:51,600 --> 00:35:00,640
 rock that grows baby rocks. And it it's very bizarre. So and it's only found so far as

386
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,360
 we know in one place in the world, or at least so far as the article claims. And this is

387
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:12,880
 in Romania. And it's in a town called Costesti. And these are called trovant rocks. T R O

388
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,600
 V A N T. If you saw the rock one day, and it's raining overnight or whatever, and you come

389
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,440
 back the next day, suddenly the rock has grown. It's got like a bulbous new bit of rock that's

390
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:29,840
 on top of it. And they basically secret cement and hardened. So what happens is during rain,

391
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,800
 during a heavy shower, they absorb the rain minerals, and then they come into contact

392
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,960
 with chemicals that are inside the rock, which then create a pressure reaction, which pushes

393
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,960
 out this kind of concrete. And sometimes they become so bulbous that they loosen and they

394
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,360
 fall off. And that's the baby rock that's created next to the rock. Other times they

395
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,320
 just stick like giant pimples coming out of them. We could utilize it to build things

396
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,480
 like build a bridge. You put one of these rocks and then you fire a hose at it and then

397
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,440
 shake it. Yes, exactly. Yeah, I think it's true. And some are some are tiny. They can

398
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,360
 be really, really tiny or 15 feet high, these rocks. So when the bulbous bits are secreted,

399
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:14,040
 they're like giant rocks. Yeah, two Roman emperors. Yeah, like what? And you just get

400
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,800
 it in this one spot in the world so far as we know. Wow. So interesting. Yeah. But did

401
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:28,200
 you know that the rock has a tattoo that took 60 hours to do? So what is it off? Yes.

402
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:39,040
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is James. Okay, my fact this

403
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,960
 week is that one of the biggest TV events of 1966 involved someone reading extracts from

404
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,560
 a book written by a relative known as Rocky Flintstone. What? This is an outrage. This

405
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:58,720
 is insane, James. This is an accusation of plagiarism. Isn't it? Against my father. This

406
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,760
 is astonishing. I have never heard this. So I was just reading the old newspaper archives

407
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,920
 and I searched for Rocky Flintstone because I thought maybe there was someone with that

408
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,000
 actual name who lived in the past. And I couldn't find anyone like that. But there was a big

409
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,760
 spike of mentions in 1966. And that was then the final episode of the Flintstones Ed. And

410
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,480
 you can still watch this today online. It's an episode where Fred finds an old diary of

411
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,720
 his grandfather, Rocky Flintstone. His name was Rock Bottom Flintstone, but he was nicknamed

412
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,520
 Rocky. That's an even better name for my dad. And it was about a running with some Stone

413
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,280
 Age Nazis and a romantic escape with a character called Mataharok, like who's based on Matahari

414
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,880
 this man. So there's a little bit of romance in there as well. Do you know what? That makes

415
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:53,360
 some sort of sense because my dad, my dad recently tried to trademark Rocky Flintstone

416
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,060
 because he's an idiot. And he thinks that's going to be able to be done. And he got a letter

417
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:04,320
 back from Warner Brothers basically saying, absolutely not. No circumstances. And actually

418
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,900
 you're lucky that we're not suing you for using it up until this point. But you know what?

419
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,000
 The parallels here go a bit further than just the name being the same. So my dad wrote a

420
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,440
 porno is ending now after six seasons because we're being sued by the Flintstone. And the

421
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,480
 final episode of my dad wrote a porno is going to feature for the first time, Rocky

422
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,600
 Flintstone himself. That is the first ever appearance of Rocky Flintstone. Someone's

423
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:32,440
 read the press release. So Flintstones, this episode where Rocky Flintstone appears for

424
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:41,200
 the first time is the final episode of season six. Yeah, so it's the exact same scenario

425
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,360
 as you. That's so what this is. So did you have any idea that your dad, I mean, has your

426
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,840
 dad seen the episode of the Flintstones? No. Did you sort of see it and then forget all

427
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,440
 about it and then years later? No, because he would have been, I think it's just an

428
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,280
 awesome name and the coincidence. Yeah, well, he was he named himself the Rocky after a

429
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,760
 dog in Brazil, which we don't need to go to. But the Flintstone bit was because he really

430
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,760
 relates to, you know, in the title sequence, yeah, when he gets locked out the house, he

431
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,560
 gets like back to the talk. Yes. Yeah, that's very much like my parents. So I think that

432
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,360
 that's where he was inspired from. But that is mad that is actually a character and the

433
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,960
 grandfather of Fred, you said. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So one generation difference,

434
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,440
 but closer. And I watched a bit of the episode in it. It's going from Fred reading out loud

435
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,320
 to his wife and Barney, his friends. So it's a similar thing. Extracts of the diary out

436
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,280
 loud while they then cut to the scenes itself. I think there's something of Alice in Wilma

437
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,720
 as well. Is it there? What do you not say? Yeah. Redhead. Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure

438
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:49,720
 how I feel about this. That makes me think my whole career has been a lie. But obviously

439
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,720
 the Flintstones was massive and the 60s was absolutely enormous. And so the end of the

440
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,920
 Flintstones was watched by, I don't know how many people I couldn't, they didn't have the

441
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,120
 actual figures, but it was like 30% of the TV watching. Wow. Yeah. And it was the end

442
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,400
 of the original series because obviously it's gone on and on and so on. But we're going

443
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,200
 to talk about the Flintstones movies later on. Don't you worry. I bloody hope so. Iconic

444
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:16,600
 bits of cinema. But the Flintstones, the cartoon, I didn't realise, was also originally aimed

445
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,920
 at adults just as much as children. Yeah. All cast late in late evening. Primetime show,

446
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,760
 8.30pm. Yeah. And I really liked the fact it was originally called the Flagstones. And

447
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,120
 then the Gladstones. Yeah. And then the Flintstones, they finally hit on that as a, because those

448
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,160
 two both sounds so weird. Yeah. A comedy called the Flagstones. Have you seen the pilot of

449
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:40,600
 the Flagstones? No. No. I actually watched it. All 90 seconds of it. 90 seconds. And

450
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,400
 it was, it was good. It's amazing that it got picked up. Are you saying it is good or

451
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,040
 is it? It is good. It is good. But it doesn't have the magic of the Flintstones. Was it the

452
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,240
 same characters as well? Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah. But it was made in 1959 but never aired

453
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,120
 until 1994 when it was discovered. Okay. Right. We should watch it. It's interesting

454
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:07,080
 to see. 1994 is the year that the Flintstones movie came out. No. Yeah. So anyway, in the

455
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,600
 original series, one of the things that to appeal to adults as well that they did, I'm

456
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:17,000
 pushing on, is they would have celebrity guests that would come on or they would parody celebrities

457
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,760
 of the day in order to give some comic, as you would say, for the adult sort of recognition.

458
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,600
 So quick quiz, because they loved a pun. They absolutely loved a pun. Okay. Cary Grant is

459
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:35,880
 a character. What has he been renamed? Clay Grant. Oh, that's good. Cary Granite. Yes.

460
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,760
 1-0. Tony Curtis, who voiced himself is on. What is he called? Boney Curtis because they

461
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,760
 were in there. That's good. Yeah. No. Close. You're in the right area of the name. Stony

462
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:57,680
 Curtis. Yeah. Keep going. They're one of these. Yeah. There's Rock Hudson. Amazingly. Yeah.

463
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:05,040
 It's Rock Hudson stone. Oh my God. And Halle Berry in the movie, the Flintstones. I don't

464
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,520
 know if you're keen to talk about that. She was actually directly named after a famous

465
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,320
 female celebrity. Halle Beryl. No. So, no. So you've got to step away from Halle's name

466
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:23,000
 all together. Shelly Berry. No. No. What? Hallite Berry. No. Her name is nothing to do with

467
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,120
 it. Right. It's another famous actress. The character's name. Yeah. The character's name

468
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,000
 is actress. Yeah. Named after another famous actress. Shelly's The Rock. No. So there's

469
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,280
 no pun. It's just outright her name. Sharon Stone. Yeah. There we go. And she's called

470
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,320
 Sharon Stone in the movie. Halle Berry is called Sharon Stone in the movie. But that's enough

471
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:47,300
 on the movie. Let's get back to the TV series. Well, just lots of, I really find it interesting

472
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,920
 that the sort of adult elements of it, because I did not, I never watched the Flintstones

473
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:57,080
 really. Really? Yeah. Just not referring to me with it. I guess so. But it's, they, they,

474
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:03,000
 they were sponsored by cigarettes in the original days, which Winston Andy, how many times did

475
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,840
 I have to tell you? Jesus. Anyway, they were sponsored by this film, Winston Cigarettes.

476
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,000
 Was that when it was going out to children? It feels like that was when it was being shot.

477
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,640
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even then it was good. Well, yeah, because advertising was just different

478
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,240
 back then. They were advertising to adults. They weren't, they weren't kids smoking. Have

479
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,880
 you seen that as well? I actually watched that. Yeah. It isn't the smoking that got me. It's

480
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:30,400
 the outrageous misogyny of those two men. Oh, really? It is insane. Like Barley and Fred

481
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,200
 are just like watching their wives do loads of chores and housework. And then they're

482
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,440
 like, let's go around the back and they sneak off and they just like, oh, like reclining and

483
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,080
 just smoking and just chatting and watching their wives work. Right. They are cavemen,

484
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:51,380
 but it is literally. There's a theory that the Flintstones are from the future, which

485
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:56,880
 I quite like. That's the Jetsons. Well, they do meet the Jetsons at one stage, don't they?

486
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,680
 So that's part of the theory. Okay. One theory is because they have four fingers. Obviously,

487
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,760
 we have five fingers in this time. So perhaps the little finger has sort of vestigially disappeared

488
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,320
 because you don't need it anymore because, you know, what do you use your little finger

489
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:18,840
 for? You're right. And we never had four fingers. So that has to be an evolution. Yeah. They,

490
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,560
 the animals in the Flintstones can speak. Obviously, these days, animals can't speak

491
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,680
 and never in the past, as far as we know, have animals been able to speak. Yes. So perhaps

492
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,840
 in the future, they will be able to speak. Humans coexisting with dinosaurs never happened

493
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:41,300
 in the past. So Jurassic Park. Is it a sequel to Jurassic Park? The theory is that it's

494
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:46,080
 a post-apocalyptic future where all current technology has collapsed. They're trying

495
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:53,000
 to replicate it using the mutant dinosaurs. My theory is that they listened to this podcast

496
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,720
 and rocks became so popular because of the last section that we just did away with all

497
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,960
 of the technology and people lived in a rock-based society. Yeah, I'd live there. I'd move. Wow.

498
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:10,120
 Did you guys see the Flintstones kids just say no holiday special? I missed that one.

499
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:16,520
 This was something that went out in 1988 and it was a public service say no to drugs Flintstones

500
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:21,880
 episode. Brilliant. Oh man. Can I tell you the plot? Yes, please. So the Flintstones kids,

501
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,720
 it's like young Flintstones. It's just bam, bam and pebbles. No, it's not. It's actually

502
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:36,040
 the main generation we know, but they're trying to win tickets to a Michael Jackson

503
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:42,520
 concert who in this is called Michael Jackstone. Thank you. Exactly. And Wilma is tempted to

504
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:49,680
 join up with a gang of older kids whose leader, Stony, smokes, crack marijuana. Unfortunately.

505
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,760
 You're right. They should have gone with it. And then we'll talk to her parents and they

506
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,080
 tell her that a real friend wouldn't offer you drugs. And Stony is arrested for drug usage

507
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,080
 and ends with a version of Michael Jackstone's song beat it. And the episode also features

508
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:10,120
 Nancy Reagan as herself. Does she have a funny name? I think she might have been doing a

509
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:17,560
 kind of extra like hi everybody, you know, rather than Nancy Reagan. Yeah, that is a

510
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:22,280
 really hot. That's probably why she never made it onto the Flintstones. Can we talk a little

511
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,680
 bit about the movie? Oh, go on. Okay. Well, this is kind of tangential. It's not really

512
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,840
 about the movies, even though it is the B 52s. Oh, yes, the band. Yes. Love Jack of

513
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:41,080
 love Jack Fane. Yeah. What a tune. They recorded versions of meet the Flintstones and the bedrock

514
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:47,240
 twitch, which I'm sure you've got that record. Did you? The B 52s are they did change their

515
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:54,600
 name? They changed their name to the BC 52. And they even appeared on the top 40 chart

516
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:02,480
 as the BC 52. That's great. Everyone got on board. I really want to see both the Flintstones

517
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:09,080
 film and the Flintstones film sequel, Viva Rock Vegas. Yeah. So you've seen both. Of course.

518
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,880
 Yeah. I just mentioned to my wife that we were recording this. I've seen that. How they

519
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,720
 buried tries to have sex with John Goodman in the film. And it's quite, it's quite a

520
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:22,720
 sort of saucy plot where John Goodman is Fred Flintstone because he's incredibly eminent

521
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,880
 as an actor now and seeing him in 1994 playing Fred Flintstone is very funny. But he looked

522
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:33,480
 so like Fred Flintstone. It's amazing to have to say yes. Is it not a good film? It's, it's

523
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,200
 quite like his cult film. It was commercially successful. But afterwards, the entire cast

524
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:44,480
 refused to return for the sequel, which is why prequel Viva Rock Vegas was recast entirely.

525
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,800
 Nobody the same. Yeah. Because the first of its own movie is Elizabeth Taylor's last

526
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,520
 ever film, which is really terrible. The casting is amazing. What a way to go out. It's got

527
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,720
 Rick Moranis. It's got Elizabeth Taylor. They clearly thought they had something. One thing

528
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,280
 I read was that Rick Moranis basically quit acting after this movie because they realized

529
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:12,680
 that they were using him. He peaked. I personally, I think I'd read that he had, he had family

530
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,920
 issues, which meant he had to step back from acting. But the thing claims that he was just

531
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:24,120
 like, I can't be put in any more movies like this. Rick Moranis, like a Moranis, like a,

532
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:31,200
 it's like Scree that you get on top of a mountain. Very nice. Because Rock Moranis was

533
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:44,280
 right there. He needs the puns you need explaining for. That's his puns. Glass was banished from

534
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,000
 the entire set of the Flintstones. What was it? He guesses why. No glass in the future.

535
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:55,120
 In the future, there's no glass. That's correct. Was it that though? Because I know that in,

536
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,280
 is it in Downton Abbey, you're not allowed to wear Calvin Klein underwear. Because even

537
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,440
 though it's not on show, they think maybe your sackcloth or whatever it is they wear

538
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,480
 in it might ride up and they might see it. So your sackcloth? Do you think it's set like

539
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,600
 in the 14th century with peasants and things? It's not, it's not. But you can see, you can

540
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:19,120
 see there are lots of, it's an Abbey. I thought it was about monks. There are lots of probably

541
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,480
 quite sheer and slinky gowns and outfits and maybe if you're wearing modern. You can't

542
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,600
 wear modern underwear basically, even though it's not going to be on show. Is it similar?

543
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,360
 It's not that. No. Glass ban from set. I think Jamie, you're the only one who hasn't

544
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,680
 slung it again. James has got quite a good one. Darren's no glass in the future. There's

545
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,280
 a wide range of plausibility. I forgot again that we talk about the Flintstones. The Flintstones

546
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,520
 movie. They're worried that, because there was so much rock on set. No shoes. No one's

547
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,360
 wearing shoes. Oh, no one's wearing shoes. The entire cast are filming barefoot. That's

548
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:52,440
 clever. And so, really, kind of any glass on set. Yeah. Well done, Daphne. That is good.

549
00:49:52,440 --> 00:50:00,040
 There was the actor in the original series, Miss Jean Vanda Ply, or PIL, PYL is her surname,

550
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:06,080
 and she was the voice of Wilma. And she gave an interview in 1995 where she explained that

551
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:11,080
 they were basically for the amazing amount of money that this made, because it was syndicated

552
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,200
 around the world. I mean, there was just so much money being made. She only received $250

553
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,240
 an episode. And then she did a contract that said the residual payments from syndication.

554
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:26,600
 She did a one-off payment of $15,000. And that was it that she got. And she was a great

555
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,000
 voice. She did a lot of voices in the Jetsons as well. And she did, I think, as well as

556
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,160
 doing Wilma. She did pebbles in that show. She was Rosie in the Jetsons. Rosie. She was

557
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:41,400
 the maid. Yeah, Rosie. Yeah, it's so incredible. Oh, that's awful. Yeah. And so, yeah, she said,

558
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,480
 "If I got residuals, I wouldn't be living in Sam Clement. I'd own Sam Clement." Yeah.

559
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:54,280
 So, well, she should have a better agent, frankly. Exactly. Don't be glad yourself.

560
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:01,600
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd

569
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,840
 the final episodes, one including Jamie's dad, Rocky Flintstone, for the first time ever.

570
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:50,640
 No one's ever heard his voice before. Well, you have to. I know your dad, but yeah. And

571
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,120
 it's a good voice, so I'm very excited to hear it. But on behalf of the podcasting world,

572
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:59,960
 we're very sad to see you guys go. So we're now... We're delighted. Well, I mean, financially...

573
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:06,160
 About lifters, all right. Fine. Fish live on forever, don't we? Anyway, we're gonna miss

574
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,200
 you guys. But we hope to see you coming back for reunions. Anyway, that's it. That's all of our

575
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,120
 facts. We'll be back again next week with another episode. We'll see you then. Goodbye.

576
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:31,600
 Oh, my God, I just broke it.

577
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,080
 What's that?

578
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,360
 I didn't see there was one behind it. Oh, my God.

579
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:47,520
 Oh, no. You know when, like, people win awards, and I wish I could break it in a hair and give

580
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:59,600
 it to the other nominees. I'm really sorry. I was practicing my golf swing earlier.

581
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:09,600
 You.

582
