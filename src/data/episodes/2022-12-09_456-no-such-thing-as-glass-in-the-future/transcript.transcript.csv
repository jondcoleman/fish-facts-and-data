00:00:02,00:00:06,"Hi everybody, just a quick announcement before we start this week's show and that is that"
00:00:06,00:00:12,we have a special guest on. He's been on once before and he was so good that we decided
00:00:12,00:00:18,we absolutely had to have him back. It's Jamie Morton from My Dad Wrote a Porno. He is the
00:00:18,00:00:24,star. He is the one whose dad actually wrote a porno and we're having him on partly because
00:00:24,00:00:28,he's a brilliant guest and also because it's a very sad time in podcast land because the
00:00:28,00:00:34,"final episodes of My Dad Wrote a Porno have just gone out all apart from the very, very"
00:00:34,00:00:39,last one which is coming out on the 12th of December and it features an exclusive interview
00:00:39,00:00:45,"with for the first time ever Rocky Flintstone himself, the Banksy of Erotica as they call"
00:00:45,00:00:51,him. Missed opportunity to call him the Wanksy of Erotica but never mind. Jamie was absolutely
00:00:51,00:00:55,brilliant. This was such a fun episode to record. He is so funny. We think you're going
00:00:55,00:00:59,to love it and so do check out the final My Dad Wrote a Porno episodes and all the other
00:00:59,00:01:19,"ones too. All right, on with the show."
00:01:19,00:01:25,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:25,00:01:29,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here
00:01:29,00:01:35,"with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and special guest is Jamie Morton. And once again,"
00:01:35,00:01:39,we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven
00:01:39,00:01:45,"days and in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Jamie."
00:01:45,00:01:54,"Okay, so my fact this week is this week. I'm not on the show. My fact is Barry Fitzgerald"
00:01:54,00:02:02,is the only actor in Oscar history to be nominated twice for the same role in the same film.
00:02:02,00:02:08,"Oh, was the film an early version of Mrs. Doubtfire? Best actor and best actress. Yeah,"
00:02:08,00:02:17,"exactly. No, no. He had one role. It was Father Fitzgibbon in 1944's Going My Way, which did"
00:02:17,00:02:22,"win Best Picture, actually. Yeah, he was he was nominated for both Best Leading Actor"
00:02:22,00:02:26,"and Best Supporting Actor. Yeah, yeah, which is insane. It doesn't say much for the rest"
00:02:26,00:02:32,"of the cast, does it? Exactly. But he won for Best Supporting Actor. So he could have"
00:02:32,00:02:37,"conceived of the one for both. Yes, but it went to Bing Crosby, who was the lead in the"
00:02:37,00:02:43,"film in it. Or Co-lead. Hang on to it. One best film, it won Best Actor for Bing Crosby."
00:02:43,00:02:48,"Yes. But then Fitzgerald lost Best Actor, but he won Best Supporting Actor. Yes, correct."
00:02:48,00:02:52,That is amazing. I know. What a sweep. Yeah. Do you have to pay entry fees for the Oscar
00:02:52,00:02:58,"Oscars? That is a great question, James. Andy. Yeah. Yeah, you do. I imagine you do. You"
00:02:58,00:03:02,"have to nominate yourself. Yeah, yeah. You have probably an administration fee, like"
00:03:02,00:03:09,20 quid or something. 20 quid. Probably. But this movie sort of set a lot of records.
00:03:09,00:03:13,"For example, it's the first film to ever have two actors win the Academy Award for Best"
00:03:13,00:03:18,Actor and Best Supporting Actor. It was the first movie to get the Academy Award for Directing
00:03:18,00:03:21,"and Writing, which was by a guy called Leo McKerry, who wrote and directed it. Oh, so"
00:03:21,00:03:26,he won two. He won two at that one. It was the first film to win Beck's picture at the
00:03:26,00:03:29,Academy Awards and the Golden Globes. It was the first picture to win Best Picture and
00:03:29,00:03:34,Best Song. It has all these records as the first movie. No one's seen it. I never heard
00:03:34,00:03:39,of it. Exactly. It seems such a waste. I suppose 1944 we had other things to worry about. Didn't
00:03:39,00:03:44,"they hit Europe? Well, it's interesting you should say that because during the war, all"
00:03:44,00:03:49,"Oscar statues were made of plaster instead of gold or gold plated bronze, which is what"
00:03:49,00:03:56,they're actually made of. So he got a a plaster Oscar and he was a massive golf fan was old
00:03:56,00:04:01,Barry Fitzgerald. And he was practicing his golf swing one day and he decapitated his
00:04:01,00:04:07,Oscar. That's a great picture of him with like the head and the body. I was reading a bit
00:04:07,00:04:11,"more about this guy, Barry Fitzgerald. Yeah, yeah. Oh, interesting man. Yeah. He was childhood"
00:04:11,00:04:19,"playmates with the siblings of okay, fine. James Joyce. Okay, not James. No, they thought"
00:04:19,00:04:25,he was weird. He was older and they said that he had a beard and glasses and was always
00:04:25,00:04:31,reading books and so didn't play with him. His name Barry Fitzgerald. It's not his real
00:04:31,00:04:36,name is it? And usually you do that because you arrive into the world of the arts and
00:04:36,00:04:40,someone has your name and so you have to register your name right and you change it. But for
00:04:40,00:04:44,him it was because he was trying to hide from the fact that he was sort of doubling on his
00:04:44,00:04:47,"work when he was meant to be working in the civil service. So they wouldn't, his name"
00:04:47,00:04:51,would be on the bill and they wouldn't know it was him. The worst thing was he worked
00:04:51,00:04:55,"in the unemployment department. So they had all of that. Yeah, they had all of the lists"
00:04:55,00:04:59,of who was supposed to be working and who wasn't supposed to be working. So all of his mates
00:04:59,00:05:05,"would have known that he was. He's a movie star. Oh, this is hard to hide because when"
00:05:05,00:05:11,"he started, he was doing plays. He worked in the Abbey Theatre with Sharon Yates as"
00:05:11,00:05:18,"well. So more. Oh, what a milieu. I know. He was once almost kidnapped before the opening"
00:05:18,00:05:25,night of a play he was in. By his boss who said you should be working. It was quite a controversial
00:05:25,00:05:30,"play and Ireland was very recently out of a civil war. You know, it was a febrile time"
00:05:30,00:05:34,and the play had a lot of controversial stuff in it and the Irish Times reported this. It
00:05:34,00:05:40,was in 1926. Several gun boys turned up at Fitzgerald's mum's house. I don't want a
00:05:40,00:05:47,"gun boy. A young gunman. I mean, we've got a gun man. That's the thing. Yeah. I think"
00:05:47,00:05:52,"people who carry guns around between places, maybe like gun runners or young people, maybe"
00:05:52,00:05:57,"might be. Well, anyway, the gun boys were there at the door and they met his mum and"
00:05:57,00:06:00,"they said, right, we're here to take him. Just keep him safe until the opening night"
00:06:00,00:06:04,"is gone. So he won't be able to appear on stage in this play. Right. And she said, well,"
00:06:04,00:06:09,he doesn't live here. This is his mum. And I'm not telling you where he is. And so they
00:06:09,00:06:14,had to go away and then he did the play. Wow. Yeah. What polite gun boys. Just because
00:06:14,00:06:19,the gun boys still live at home doesn't mean that everybody's sleeping. They were 12. They're
00:06:19,00:06:25,"almost like knocking his barry. Okay, to come out and play, please. Have any of you ever"
00:06:25,00:06:30,held an Oscar in real life? Oh my God. I reckon there's an addict out coming out. You haven't
00:06:30,00:06:38,lived boys. And I'll tell you something. I've held two. Same time. Same time. Oh my God.
00:06:38,00:06:42,"I went, I was name drop hideous, name drop, but I was at Emma Thompson's house for doing"
00:06:42,00:06:48,"that. She's not that hideous. No, the name drop. She's lovely. She fed me and everything."
00:06:48,00:06:55,"No, but in her downstairs loo, her two Oscars right there. An interesting fact about Emma"
00:06:55,00:07:00,"Thompson, you might know this, that she's the only person in history to have won Oscars"
00:07:00,00:07:07,"for writing and acting. Still to this day. What? Yeah. Were they both for, I mean, was"
00:07:07,00:07:11,the writing one censored sensibility? Correct. And the acting one. I thought Jane Austen wrote
00:07:11,00:07:15,"that. Well, agreed. It was a controversial year. It's like when Kenneth Branagh won the"
00:07:15,00:07:20,Oscar for Macbeth or whatever he thought. Best adapted screenplay literally just used
00:07:20,00:07:23,the words. He didn't actually win for that. I was going to come onto that. You mentioned
00:07:23,00:07:28,"Kenneth Branagh. You know, they used to be married. What? I did not know that. They"
00:07:28,00:07:35,used to be married and he just won an Oscar for writing Belfast at the last Oscars. And
00:07:35,00:07:40,"if he were to win an acting Oscar, him and Emma Thompson would be the only people in"
00:07:40,00:07:45,history to have acting and writing. And he's been nominated for two acting Oscars. So it's
00:07:45,00:07:50,"not beyond the realms of possibility. We sort of parent trap them back together, right?"
00:07:50,00:07:55,"Well, maybe not. I think she's very happily married to Greg Wise, but you know."
00:07:55,00:07:59,"Jeremy, did you take a selfie of yourself in Emma Thompson's toilet? And what he was"
00:07:59,00:08:04,"holding to Oscars? I mean, what were you taking a selfie with? Well, I didn't, but my friend"
00:08:04,00:08:09,"did. And then weirdly later on in the evening, somehow, I think we were taking pictures and"
00:08:09,00:08:14,"like we were like saying, oh, that had dropped me the more ever. And Gaia, Am's daughter,"
00:08:14,00:08:23,"took his phone and found, honestly, about 50 selfies. She was like, oh, my God, that's"
00:08:23,00:08:28,"so embarrassing. But I didn't because, you know, too classy. Yeah, wait till you get"
00:08:28,00:08:33,"your own. Well, I'll be waiting a while. But I'm not sure that Barry Fitzgerald should"
00:08:33,00:08:38,"have got the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Well, for example, there's a little a little"
00:08:38,00:08:43,"goof in this, which is that so he plays a Catholic priest in this film, but Barry himself"
00:08:43,00:08:48,"was Protestant. So he wasn't kind of fully aware of how priests act. And in the film,"
00:08:48,00:08:52,"I haven't seen the film myself, but I didn't deserve the award. They want you. Well, apparently"
00:08:52,00:08:56,"when he does the crossing of himself, you know, he does it the wrong way, which feels"
00:08:56,00:09:01,"like as an actor, you would look into the basics and post. Oh, my God, that's possible."
00:09:01,00:09:05,"He doesn't do it the wrong way upside down, though. He does it right to left away. He"
00:09:05,00:09:08,"should be doing it left to right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you meant to do the left to"
00:09:08,00:09:14,"right. You do top to bottom. I go top to bottom, left to right. That's correct. Yeah. So yeah,"
00:09:14,00:09:19,"take it back. Take it back. Curiously isn't everything in the arts, Dan. It's an interpretation."
00:09:19,00:09:24,"Do you think maybe he was making a comment on Catholicism as in, you know, like the devil"
00:09:24,00:09:27,"probably would do it that way. Yes, yes, really good call. Oh my God, it's even deeper than"
00:09:27,00:09:32,"I realized it was. Do you know that it's, this is a bit of a reach, guys, but I found"
00:09:32,00:09:38,this and I thought I'd share it. Male actors who have won or been nominated for an Oscar
00:09:38,00:09:46,are statistically more likely to get divorced than their osculous acting peers. Interesting
00:09:46,00:09:50,"because because they've just got women throwing themselves at them. Well, because there's"
00:09:50,00:09:54,a thing called the negative consequences of positive status shifts. So basically when
00:09:54,00:10:01,"you get a bit arrogant because you've just been nominated or won an Oscar, men tend to"
00:10:01,00:10:06,"leave their wives. Interesting. I could do so much better. And then there was, I remember"
00:10:06,00:10:10,"years ago reading a book where Dustin Hoffman, struggling actor for years and getting bit"
00:10:10,00:10:15,rolls and stuff suddenly gets cast in the graduates. Yeah. And this line being that
00:10:15,00:10:18,"when he got the call, he tells his wife and they just stared at each other and there's"
00:10:18,00:10:22,"an unspoken thing that's happening there, which is this is the end of our marriage."
00:10:22,00:10:26,"Bloody hell. Yeah, because he's now going to be, he's going to be globally famous and"
00:10:26,00:10:30,obviously he's going to go off and obviously that's obviously in the room to them too. It
00:10:30,00:10:34,was obvious to them too in that moment that that was the end of their marriage.
00:10:34,00:10:38,"Gosh. To be fair, this does remind me a little bit of the time. I don't know if you, Dan"
00:10:38,00:10:42,"and James, remember the time we won our first, uh, Chortle Awards. Yeah, I do remember that."
00:10:42,00:10:47,We all split up when our partners didn't leave immediately. Speaking of Oscars. I keep my
00:10:47,00:10:52,"charsal wad in the bathroom, actually, um, which has led to a lot of weird stains on"
00:10:52,00:10:57,"it, but. I keep one of my wards in the bathroom as well. We won a Webby Award. One of my wards?"
00:10:57,00:11:05,"One of many. They don't all fit in the cabinet. That's the problem. So mine is next to a,"
00:11:05,00:11:10,"um, a review that I got in the Sunday times, which called my dad wrote in porno the quote"
00:11:10,00:11:18,worst cultural event of the decade. So it's ying and yang in my bathroom. It was in the
00:11:18,00:11:25,"Christmas edition of the Sunday times, 2019. It was like a roundup of the decade and some"
00:11:25,00:11:31,"absolutely poisonous little, little, little, little toad of a journalist. I won't name"
00:11:31,00:11:37,"him. He knows who he is. Um, he finds a way to worm us into any bad review he ever gives."
00:11:37,00:11:40,"This was terrible, but not as bad as my dad wrote in a porno. So he'll be thrilled that"
00:11:40,00:11:44,"we're ending. Um, yes, I thought it's important to kind of have them both to realize that"
00:11:44,00:11:48,"neither really matter, do they? Oh, that's very good. That's like, um, Reddy Kipling,"
00:11:48,00:11:52,"isn't it? If the tribe from the disaster, and you know, you treat them both the same."
00:11:52,00:12:01,"It's exactly like that. I'm often called. Um, if you go on IMDB, they have lots of sort"
00:12:01,00:12:05,"of tagging that you can do and people just go and do it. It's not like an official thing,"
00:12:05,00:12:11,"but, um, there's loads of different tags and each movie might have 20 different tags. Uh,"
00:12:11,00:12:15,someone went through them to see if there's any correlation between these tags and whether
00:12:15,00:12:21,"you can win an Oscar or not. Uh, and the apparently there are some keywords that have never been"
00:12:21,00:12:26,even nominated for an Oscar. So zombie food fight and breast implant. There has never
00:12:26,00:12:31,been a movie with any of those three things that has ever been nominated for an Oscar.
00:12:31,00:12:37,I don't think that's true. It's the tagging. So it could be that's because I'm pretty sure
00:12:37,00:12:46,that hook has a fantastic food fight. Absolutely not. But it must be something like production
00:12:46,00:12:53,"design or song or something. You're saying that my screenplay, my double D undead custard"
00:12:53,00:13:04,brawl is not probably not Oscar worthy. Just quickly ask in my double D undead custard
00:13:04,00:13:13,"brawl brawl. Sorry. Um, is it the simply the breasts that are undead? It is. It's about"
00:13:13,00:13:19,"a woman who goes in for a routine operation, a breast enlargement and she gets given the"
00:13:19,00:13:24,"breasts of a dead person. Ah, yes. Yeah. And it's, and they come to life and they can put"
00:13:24,00:13:28,still attached to her and she's alive. Wow. That's weird. You rarely have a zombie attached
00:13:28,00:13:32,to a human who's alive. We don't have a woman on this podcast where we normally do. But
00:13:32,00:13:36,"um, is that how breasts implants work? They just take the breasts off another person and"
00:13:36,00:13:42,"stick them onto you. Is that right? I believe, I believe so. I did need to do the screenplay"
00:13:42,00:13:48,is still in the research phase. Russell Crowe has an Oscar. Doesn't he? Russell Crowe has
00:13:48,00:13:52,"one for gladiator. Yeah, he's got a few. He's got a best actor. No, he's the only one"
00:13:52,00:13:56,"wants. But you know where he keeps his, um, Oscar, he doesn't keep them in his bathroom"
00:13:56,00:14:03,"like, Oh, okay. I haven't been to his house and taken self. Oscar. Okay. Um, what's the"
00:14:03,00:14:08,most Russell Crowe place to keep an Oscar? Like his barn or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:14:08,00:14:15,"So close. In his chariot, I bet he has the chariot from gladiator. He's got, um, in a"
00:14:15,00:14:18,"haystack. He's like, it's a needle in a haystack and he keeps it in his haystack. It's like"
00:14:18,00:14:21,it's a sort of metaphor. It's like your thing. Yeah. Has he got colosseum? Did he take that
00:14:21,00:14:29,home as a prop? He has a chicken coop and he keeps it in his chicken coop at his ranch
00:14:29,00:14:37,and he claims that it helps his hens to lay bigger eggs. Wow. All the cock crows sadly
00:14:37,00:14:44,leave the chickens. That's the problem. Yeah. Yeah. Rosamund Pike buries her rewards in
00:14:44,00:14:50,"the garden. What? Yeah. So weird. She's so bloody goth, Rosamund Pike. She's all classy"
00:14:50,00:14:54,"and la, la, la. Actually, there's a heart of darkness. She like leaves a little bit"
00:14:54,00:14:59,"of the top of them to kind of glint in the sun. That's nice. Yeah. I know. It's, it's"
00:14:59,00:15:02,"kind of interesting, isn't it? And what awards her she won? She's won like a Golden Globe."
00:15:02,00:15:07,"She hasn't got a chortle. She hasn't got a chortle. Well, you can't sacrilege to bury"
00:15:07,00:15:23,"a chortle in the garden. They'll come and dig it up and take it off you. Okay, it is"
00:15:23,00:15:28,time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this week is that one of the attractions
00:15:28,00:15:35,"at Disneyland in 1956 was the bathroom of tomorrow, which included amongst other exciting"
00:15:35,00:15:43,exhibits an array of interactive faucets and a dramatic story of valves. Not valves. Yeah.
00:15:43,00:15:48,"What a narrative. What a narrative. Ripping. Any Oscars in this bathroom? Oh, God, this"
00:15:48,00:15:52,"should be right. Except the, well, there's not, but the whole thing is kind of one big"
00:15:52,00:15:58,"Oscar because it's gold the entire thing. Yeah. The idea was in the fifties, they thought"
00:15:58,00:16:02,"in the future, everyone will have a gold bathroom. I think so. Basically. Exactly. Only Donald"
00:16:02,00:16:08,Trump has managed to make that dream a reality. Yeah. So this was part of an area of Disneyland
00:16:08,00:16:14,that was opened along with the original Disneyland in America called Tomorrowland and Tomorrowland
00:16:14,00:16:18,was going to have lots of exhibits where they could showcase how the world was going to
00:16:18,00:16:25,"look in the futuristic future of 1986. And it included things like this bathroom of tomorrow,"
00:16:25,00:16:29,whereby air conditioning was going to be in there. There were dumbbells so that you could
00:16:29,00:16:33,"do exercise while you're having a bath that were on the side of the bath, you know, all"
00:16:33,00:16:36,"these sorts of like little innovations, but the whole premise of it, it was done by a"
00:16:36,00:16:40,company called the crane company. They were selling it now. So the bathroom of tomorrow
00:16:40,00:16:46,was actually today. And yeah. And so this was one of many of these little exhibitions
00:16:46,00:16:49,that were put on that were slightly sponsored by corporations who wanted to showcase their
00:16:49,00:16:54,related stuff within this area of Disney. Yeah. Very cool. It was designed by Henry
00:16:54,00:17:01,"Dreyfuss, who was a designer. Dreyfuss also designed the classic black telephone, you"
00:17:01,00:17:06,"know, this one that you basically see everywhere. He also invented most of the Hoover models"
00:17:06,00:17:11,"of vacuum cleaners, the upright ones. And he was also the chair of the meeting of the"
00:17:11,00:17:16,International Organization of Standards Committee in Berlin when they kind of came up with
00:17:16,00:17:19,"all the different signs that there would be around the world. You know, like if you got"
00:17:19,00:17:24,"to an airport, the sign for a taxi rank is the same everywhere. Yeah, I love that kind"
00:17:24,00:17:29,"of stuff. I love those shadowy organizations that, you know, secretly, secretly dealing"
00:17:29,00:17:36,"with signs. And I did, I went on a mad research bender last year for QI about plug, plug sockets"
00:17:36,00:17:41,and standardization of plug sockets. Yeah. Yeah. And are we going to hear fear about
00:17:41,00:17:47,it now? I think for everyone's benefit. That would be the worst cultural events of the
00:17:47,00:17:51,2020s if we did that. I had such an amazing time doing the research. I looked back and
00:17:51,00:17:58,"I've written about 20 paragraphs of just dross. So, yeah. This bathroom does have some good"
00:17:58,00:18:01,"things in it. It had a sink, which you can adjust the height of. You just sort of pull"
00:18:01,00:18:06,"it up or down. That's clever. Yeah. Accessible. Accessible. And, and if, you know, for kids,"
00:18:06,00:18:10,"they can pull it right down and, you know, it's there. And it was hydraulic powered."
00:18:10,00:18:13,"And I think that's, that's cool. It's a good idea. Yeah. I mean, it totally a huge pain"
00:18:13,00:18:17,"in the bum to install. But, you know, once it's in, it's in. Exactly. You know, yeah."
00:18:17,00:18:21,"Never think about it again. Yeah. And is it still there? No, it shut down after a couple"
00:18:21,00:18:27,"of years. Yeah. It surprisingly was not as exciting for kids as they, as they probably"
00:18:27,00:18:31,"thought it was. Well, this isn't just for kids, Dan. It's also for adults. Absolutely true."
00:18:31,00:18:39,"Yeah. I have worked for Disney parks and resorts for, have you? Like more than 15 years. I direct"
00:18:39,00:18:43,"a lot of stuff. Are you in the mouse suit? No, you're not. There is no mouse suit, James."
00:18:43,00:18:49,"Oh, sorry. Mickey. Yeah. So I have been to the parks a lot. Wait, wait, wait, but there"
00:18:49,00:18:54,"is a suit, right? No, he's saying it's just Mickey. It's just new. It's just a new rodent"
00:18:54,00:19:01,"man running around, genetically modified mouse man. Mickey mouse. That's cool. Yeah, it's"
00:19:01,00:19:06,"cool. So I have been there a lot, actually. And have you then got access? We've spoken"
00:19:06,00:19:10,in the past on the podcast about all these like crazy corridors that you can go. Yeah.
00:19:10,00:19:13,The tunnels underneath what Disney has done all that. I've been in those tunnels. They
00:19:13,00:19:17,"are called, what are they called? They're called the Utilidores. All of these tunnels."
00:19:17,00:19:20,"And you know, they're actually not a basement. People think they're the basement, but because"
00:19:20,00:19:26,"it's built in Florida, and it's essentially on a swamp, you can't have basements in Florida."
00:19:26,00:19:30,Okay. So it's all. So everything else is on the first floor? Exactly. Magic Kingdoms
00:19:30,00:19:34,"on the first floor. What? Yeah. That's so funny. And if you walk up to Magic Kingdom,"
00:19:34,00:19:40,"it's on a very, very subtle slope. So you're actually climbing up a full flight of stairs"
00:19:40,00:19:45,as you approach Magic Kingdom. That's incredible. That's incredible. Yeah. Wow. But those tunnels
00:19:45,00:19:52,are mad. And there's everything in there. There's like coffee shops. There's like dry cleaners.
00:19:52,00:19:56,"Yeah, it's amazing for the staff, exclusive staff. Yeah. And it's good to kind of get"
00:19:56,00:20:03,people through the park so that like no character or cast member from one part of the park will
00:20:03,00:20:07,ever be seen in a different part of the park. They'll just go through the tunnels. I imagine
00:20:07,00:20:11,like a race of troglodytes who live under there and have never come to the first floor.
00:20:11,00:20:16,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that. I don't think it would be a great movie. Yeah. Disney
00:20:16,00:20:28,will never make now. From the maker of Double D undead custom brawl comes. This does quickly
00:20:28,00:20:32,on Tomorrowland before he goes to Broad Disney. It does sound absolutely bananas because
00:20:32,00:20:36,all of it was sponsored by one company or another. And there were so the house of the future
00:20:36,00:20:42,"itself was actually sponsored by Monsanto, who later became extremely controversial as"
00:20:42,00:20:47,"one of the makers of Agent Orange. Oh, really? Yeah. So Disney kind of dropped that sponsorship"
00:20:47,00:20:51,"once. Yeah. Sort of, you know, came out. But all of these different firms. So American"
00:20:51,00:20:57,"Dairy Association, American Motors, National Lead Paint, who sound great. Wow. Very much"
00:20:57,00:21:03,"of an era, aren't they? Very mid 20th century. The Dutch Boy Color Gallery was sponsored"
00:21:03,00:21:07,by Dutch Boy Paint. Wow. Wow. Can't find much more information about it. Friends with
00:21:07,00:21:14,"the gun buys. Yeah. Amazing. And when they opened it, they didn't cut a ribbon, did they?"
00:21:14,00:21:20,They just turned some taps on instead of yeah. Yeah. Because it was the house of the future.
00:21:20,00:21:26,Just to show that it's the future. Yeah. What's more of the past than cutting a ribbon? Yeah.
00:21:26,00:21:31,"I was told by someone that I worked with over there that this is an it is insane, this fact."
00:21:31,00:21:35,"Okay. And I'm not sure if I believe it, but he told me and I and he's very any work. So"
00:21:35,00:21:40,"yeah, quite senior where though, is he one of the trouble adults? Has he gone nuts? He's"
00:21:40,00:21:49,"not seen sun in 10 years. Let's just call him Mr Mickey M. No, the boss. No, 4% of all"
00:21:49,00:21:55,the photographs taken in the United States are taken at either Disneyland or Disney World.
00:21:55,00:22:01,"4%. 4%. It's not insane. It's quite a big country, isn't it? Yeah. States of America."
00:22:01,00:22:06,"4% is that's amazing. Mad, right? Yeah. It doesn't. You're right to be skeptical. Yeah."
00:22:06,00:22:12,"I was like, is that true? But wow, amazing. And you know, they also isn't just theme parks."
00:22:12,00:22:16,They have cruise ships. Right. Have you been on a Disney cruise? I have. Oh my God. Okay.
00:22:16,00:22:19,I've got so many questions to ask you. Right. Okay. This is amazing. Wow. I've never seen
00:22:19,00:22:25,you so animated. Yeah. Not since we started talking about plugs that time. Okay. I was
00:22:25,00:22:31,reading an article called Disney cruise secrets. Right. And I have to say it was the most disappointing
00:22:31,00:22:34,"article I've ever read. Okay. Let me just, I'm just going to tell you a few of the secrets,"
00:22:34,00:22:39,"right? The Disney cruise secrets. Okay. Okay. Secret number one, Disney cruise state rooms"
00:22:39,00:22:48,are not ready until one 30 p.m. Secret. Secret. How's that a secret? I know it's only a secret
00:22:48,00:22:56,"when someone rocks up at 1230 and they say, yes, it's ready. Secret number five, you"
00:22:56,00:23:08,"can bring bottled water on board. Secret number 14, Disney will provide you with soap. Oh,"
00:23:08,00:23:12,the soap's so good on the cruises. It's some of the best soap you've ever had in your entire
00:23:12,00:23:19,life. I may have taken it with me. It's really good. Okay. So that is a secret. Yeah. Yeah.
00:23:19,00:23:21,So can you confirm about the rooms are not being ready until one 30 p.m. I actually can't
00:23:21,00:23:30,confirm that because here's the thing with those ships is that you have to get off them
00:23:30,00:23:34,"really early because they have a, they're, they're changed over the same day. So everyone's"
00:23:34,00:23:39,going to be off the ship by like nine or something. So how long are you on it for? Is it a few
00:23:39,00:23:46,"days? You can do two nights. You can do four nights. Dan, you can do a week. I'm now a"
00:23:46,00:23:52,"travel agent. But so yeah, I guess the turnaround is that they, yeah, so until one 30, that"
00:23:52,00:23:56,"gives them time to clean all the, all the stator rooms. That must be a chaotic four and a half"
00:23:56,00:24:00,"hours on board. Just finding out what's left in all the rooms. I mean, that happens in"
00:24:00,00:24:09,every hotel in the world. It must be absolutely. But what's fascinating about the Disney cruise
00:24:09,00:24:13,line is that they're the only cruise line on the planet that has fireworks at sea. Okay.
00:24:13,00:24:20,"So, yeah. So they have a big deck party normally on the penultimate night and they have fireworks"
00:24:20,00:24:26,that set off from the ship. And what's fascinating about these fireworks is that they are made
00:24:26,00:24:32,"from a biodegradable material so that when they hit the water, they become fish food."
00:24:32,00:24:39,"Oh, that's cool. Isn't that cool? That is really cool. Is it, do you need special dispensation"
00:24:39,00:24:43,for fireworks at sea? I think they would be able to. Yeah. Because it might be seen as
00:24:43,00:24:49,"a signal. It might look like flares, right? An SOS. Yeah. Wow. They're going very whimsical"
00:24:49,00:24:53,"with that. They're very extravagant flares. Wow. They're sinking, but they also want to"
00:24:53,00:25:01,let them goofy is having a great time. I was once on one of these ships and they have these
00:25:01,00:25:05,"rides on board the ship. It's like a slide that goes off the edge. Oh, you know, this"
00:25:05,00:25:10,one is like kind of you stand on like a trap door and it opens and you go down a shoot
00:25:10,00:25:19,"and stuff. I got all the way up to the top, stood on the trap door and I was too heavy."
00:25:19,00:25:24,"But instead of saying, I'm sorry, sir, you're too heavy, they said, I'm so sorry, buddy."
00:25:24,00:25:34,"You're just too full of magic today. Too full of magic. I mean, I could see what they were"
00:25:34,00:25:39,"going for, but it was even more annoying. I was like, just call me a fat bastard to be"
00:25:39,00:25:46,honest. That's so funny. So I had to walk all the way down in front of all the children
00:25:46,00:25:52,"and their parents. You said to each one, too full of magic. I was like, I forgot something"
00:25:52,00:26:00,"in my room. Sorry, couldn't get into 130. It was a low point on what was otherwise a"
00:26:00,00:26:13,"beautiful trip. Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is that 5%"
00:26:13,00:26:20,of the world's electricity is spent turning big rocks into small rocks. Mad. That is mad.
00:26:20,00:26:28,"5%. That is crazy for something that sounds unbelievably dull. I know, but this is this"
00:26:28,00:26:32,"is big. This is a big business. So what exactly is it? Because I'm I mean, I tried to research"
00:26:32,00:26:38,this topic. I failed. I'm not going to lie. I will be a passenger for this podcast. Andy
00:26:38,00:26:41,educate me. I found this in an interview. I was reading an interview with a guy called
00:26:41,00:26:46,John Stanton who specializes in crushing big rocks into small rocks. That's his line of
00:26:46,00:26:51,"work. He's a big rock crusher. And basically, when you're mining, you might get some big"
00:26:51,00:26:56,rocks out of the ground. But the ore is inside those and you can't just you can't just deal
00:26:56,00:26:59,"with the big rock you've got. You need to turn it into a small rock. Yeah, you need a"
00:26:59,00:27:03,rock crushing machine. And there are lots of great lots of great models available on the
00:27:03,00:27:07,"market. Yeah, can I ask when you say he's a big rock crusher? Is he a big as in like"
00:27:07,00:27:12,big in the industry rock crusher? Or is it specifically he's a big rock? I think it's
00:27:12,00:27:17,all for those works on the two levels. I don't know how big he is as a man as well. It could
00:27:17,00:27:22,work on three levels. I don't know. I don't know much magic. It doesn't. I saw that piece
00:27:22,00:27:30,"in the times. He's got as much magic as me. Wow. It's called comminution, isn't it? Turning"
00:27:30,00:27:34,big rocks into little rocks. Oh man. And then you screen them and then you might grind them
00:27:34,00:27:40,"smaller again. Yeah, crushing grinding. Do you know what's better wet grinding or dry grinding?"
00:27:40,00:27:46,Oh my God. Because they're both done. I do know. I've got an Instagram. No. I would feel
00:27:46,00:27:53,"like, what do you say better? Yeah. Grinding mills can be operated both dry and wet according"
00:27:53,00:27:58,to the encyclopedia Britannica. Let's go wet. Yeah. And wet grinding is predominant. Yeah.
00:27:58,00:28:05,Wow. So what is wet grinding you just add? Give me a break. Literally read it directly
00:28:05,00:28:10,from the encyclopedia Britannica. You add water to the crushing. Yeah. I just wonder why it
00:28:10,00:28:16,"helps. I guess it's lubricates. Yeah, lubrication. And it helps with like the dust probably. Absolutely."
00:28:16,00:28:21,"But when you cut into flagstones and things, it helps have a bit of water to kind of. That's"
00:28:21,00:28:26,true. How do you come from? I'm sorry guys have arrived. What can I say? Yeah. But most
00:28:26,00:28:31,of them are like massive nutcrackers basically. They're all top loaded because then the pressure
00:28:31,00:28:34,from the rocks above acts on the rocks that you're trying to crush down and so they're
00:28:34,00:28:39,being forced into two different directions. Right. And you just feed the rock in and the
00:28:39,00:28:42,"rock cracks and because the metal surfaces are harder than the rock, that's, you know,"
00:28:42,00:28:45,"that's the process. And then eventually when it's small enough, it's a dust and you can"
00:28:45,00:28:50,get the lithium out or the gold. So hang on. So you're using big rocks as your tool to
00:28:50,00:28:56,crush the former big rock into smaller rock. It's helping. It's a partner. It's actually
00:28:56,00:29:02,a thing called auto genus milling. It's literally just the rocks that you're crushing are all
00:29:02,00:29:07,crushing each other. That's so cool. That's incredible. I love that. I was reading about
00:29:07,00:29:13,the history of crushing rocks. Think too small. And one of us had to. I just want to give
00:29:13,00:29:18,a shout out to the website machinerypartner.com. Okay. Because I'm quoting directly here. It
00:29:18,00:29:24,"was event in 1881 when Phyllitus W Gates got a US patent for his device, which was that"
00:29:24,00:29:28,was the sort of rock crusher. That was the basic model. Phyllitus. Not a name you hear
00:29:28,00:29:37,"often these days, is it? Yeah, Phil Gates. In 1883, Mr Blake challenged Mr Gates to crush"
00:29:37,00:29:42,nine cubic yards of stone in a contest to see which crusher would finish the job faster.
00:29:42,00:29:47,The Gates crusher completed the task 40 minutes sooner. I was looking into humans who can
00:29:47,00:29:51,"crush rocks. Oh, that's good thing. Because I thought before we had machines, we must have"
00:29:51,00:29:56,"needed humans. Yeah. Yeah. And then I thought, you know, can anyone do it with their bare"
00:29:56,00:30:04,"hands? And I actually found the first non-Roman emperor, Maximus Thrax, who was supposedly"
00:30:04,00:30:10,a rock crusher. The first non-Roman emperor? Yeah. As in he wasn't born in the Roman Empire.
00:30:10,00:30:17,"Yeah, but he was. Sorry, but he was Emperor of Rome. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And he's a person"
00:30:17,00:30:21,"who was very tall, but because he was quite a lot taller than most people, the exaggerations"
00:30:21,00:30:26,"have been written down and it's hard to know where he was. So supposedly, and this was a"
00:30:26,00:30:35,"Roman emperor, he was eight feet, six inches tall. No. Yeah. Apparently, his, his thumb"
00:30:35,00:30:40,was so large that he wore his wife's bracelet as a ring on it. That's how he's gonna hitch
00:30:40,00:30:48,"hike in that guy. And so during public events, he used to impress people by picking up rocks"
00:30:48,00:30:53,and crushing them with his bare hands and pulling wagons on his own. Yeah. Feels a bit
00:30:53,00:30:59,"demeaning for the Emperor of Rome to be having to do like, ""Hey!"" He had a very short tenure."
00:30:59,00:31:06,It was three years as Emperor because he was overthrown because of his disastrous idea
00:31:06,00:31:10,"on war, just by some people, some other people. Yeah, just that's very impressive that they"
00:31:10,00:31:15,"managed to overthrow. I mean, it's not just him fighting against everyone. He's not like,"
00:31:15,00:31:23,"""Let's do a thumb war. Anyone can beat me in a thumb war. I will hand over."" Oh God, yeah."
00:31:23,00:31:26,But he's telling the gladiators whether or not they've survived or not. There's no mistake
00:31:26,00:31:33,in doing that. It's like a foam hand in a basketball match. So this was a really interesting
00:31:33,00:31:42,topic for me. Yeah. So I have decided to go a little off-piste and discuss The Rock. Did
00:31:42,00:31:48,you know that The Rock's nickname as a kid was Jewy? I bet you didn't. No. Jewy. Jewy.
00:31:48,00:31:54,"Was it covered in dew? Yes, exactly. And that's the reason why. Do you know that he has a"
00:31:54,00:31:59,"degree in criminology? I bet none of you knew that. He's an ordinary minister, guys. He's"
00:31:59,00:32:04,"an ordinary... Okay, that's more understandable. That makes sense. On Jewy, is it like Huey,"
00:32:04,00:32:07,Jewy and Louis kind of thing? Do we know why? Or is it the Jewy decibel system? He's spent
00:32:07,00:32:13,"all his time in the library as a kid. I'm going to be honest, these are bullet points."
00:32:13,00:32:17,I haven't really delve deep into it. Do you guys know what the smallest rock is? Here
00:32:17,00:32:24,"we go. Back to business. Back to proper rocks, boys. Well, okay. Well, what is a rock? You"
00:32:24,00:32:29,"know, is a speck of dust a rock? No. Oh, it's not. Is a pebble a rock? Yes, I think it is."
00:32:29,00:32:35,Okay. Is it grit? Is it smaller than grit? You guys are never going to get it. Talc seems
00:32:35,00:32:46,pretty small. Yeah. Yeah. It's clay. Clay. Clay. Oh my God. Clay. Clay. Clay. I'm so
00:32:46,00:32:53,"excited. I'm going to have to really sell this coffee. Okay. No, this is really interesting."
00:32:53,00:33:00,"Genuinely, this sounds so boring. I appreciate that. You don't need to keep saying that."
00:33:00,00:33:05,"Everything in this segment follows that trend. So, which is smaller, sand or clay? We now"
00:33:05,00:33:11,"know it's clay. It's clay. But you might not have thought that, right? No, no, clay. Like"
00:33:11,00:33:15,"sand feels so fine. Like, you know, the very fine Caribbean sand, it feels so fine. Okay."
00:33:15,00:33:21,So clay particles are unbelievably tiny. What is clay? Small rocks. It's a sort of little
00:33:21,00:33:27,"silica. I think it's a silicate. Okay. But yeah, you never feel it as like sand. It doesn't"
00:33:27,00:33:31,fall through your fingers. Yeah. Exactly. Right. But I think you've got clay soils and
00:33:31,00:33:34,stuff like that and there it is in granular form. So particles of clay can be less than
00:33:34,00:33:42,0.002 millimeters across. I think that's two microns possibly. It's unbelievably small.
00:33:42,00:33:48,So the largest particle of clay you can get is not even a thousandth as big as the smallest
00:33:48,00:33:53,particle of sand in the world. That's incredible. That's the scale of difference we're talking
00:33:53,00:33:58,about. I take it all back. And this is the really weird thing. Clay particles can be
00:33:58,00:34:03,so small. I'm quoting directly from a site I read here. Clay particles can be so small
00:34:03,00:34:07,that it could take hundreds of years for them to settle from the top to the bottom of a
00:34:07,00:34:14,"bottle of water. What? Because it just takes everything gets in their way. Everything, you"
00:34:14,00:34:19,"know, the tiny molecule of anything just disrupts the clay from its path. And this is why clay"
00:34:19,00:34:24,"soil is so sticky is because there are so many spaces in between these tiny, tiny particles."
00:34:24,00:34:29,The water fits in between the particles. So it just holds huge amounts of water. That's
00:34:29,00:34:33,why clay soil is so heavy. Has someone actually done that experiment? No. We've had a plastic
00:34:33,00:34:38,"a hundred years ago. Yeah. Well, that's if they started then they would have, they would"
00:34:38,00:34:40,have watched it hit the bottom. I'm afraid I don't think anyone's done that experiment
00:34:40,00:34:45,"properly, but it just needs sort of. Yeah. And also we're actually banning plastic. Yeah."
00:34:45,00:34:51,"We don't want to encourage that. Do we? Sorry. I found a mystery rock. Oh, it's a mystery"
00:34:51,00:35:00,rock that grows baby rocks. And it it's very bizarre. So and it's only found so far as
00:35:00,00:35:05,"we know in one place in the world, or at least so far as the article claims. And this is"
00:35:05,00:35:12,in Romania. And it's in a town called Costesti. And these are called trovant rocks. T R O
00:35:12,00:35:17,"V A N T. If you saw the rock one day, and it's raining overnight or whatever, and you come"
00:35:17,00:35:22,"back the next day, suddenly the rock has grown. It's got like a bulbous new bit of rock that's"
00:35:22,00:35:29,"on top of it. And they basically secret cement and hardened. So what happens is during rain,"
00:35:29,00:35:33,"during a heavy shower, they absorb the rain minerals, and then they come into contact"
00:35:33,00:35:37,"with chemicals that are inside the rock, which then create a pressure reaction, which pushes"
00:35:37,00:35:42,out this kind of concrete. And sometimes they become so bulbous that they loosen and they
00:35:42,00:35:47,fall off. And that's the baby rock that's created next to the rock. Other times they
00:35:47,00:35:52,just stick like giant pimples coming out of them. We could utilize it to build things
00:35:52,00:35:56,like build a bridge. You put one of these rocks and then you fire a hose at it and then
00:35:56,00:36:01,"shake it. Yes, exactly. Yeah, I think it's true. And some are some are tiny. They can"
00:36:01,00:36:06,"be really, really tiny or 15 feet high, these rocks. So when the bulbous bits are secreted,"
00:36:06,00:36:14,"they're like giant rocks. Yeah, two Roman emperors. Yeah, like what? And you just get"
00:36:14,00:36:18,it in this one spot in the world so far as we know. Wow. So interesting. Yeah. But did
00:36:18,00:36:28,you know that the rock has a tattoo that took 60 hours to do? So what is it off? Yes.
00:36:28,00:36:39,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is James. Okay, my fact this"
00:36:39,00:36:44,week is that one of the biggest TV events of 1966 involved someone reading extracts from
00:36:44,00:36:51,a book written by a relative known as Rocky Flintstone. What? This is an outrage. This
00:36:51,00:36:58,"is insane, James. This is an accusation of plagiarism. Isn't it? Against my father. This"
00:36:58,00:37:03,is astonishing. I have never heard this. So I was just reading the old newspaper archives
00:37:03,00:37:06,and I searched for Rocky Flintstone because I thought maybe there was someone with that
00:37:06,00:37:11,actual name who lived in the past. And I couldn't find anyone like that. But there was a big
00:37:11,00:37:17,spike of mentions in 1966. And that was then the final episode of the Flintstones Ed. And
00:37:17,00:37:22,you can still watch this today online. It's an episode where Fred finds an old diary of
00:37:22,00:37:27,"his grandfather, Rocky Flintstone. His name was Rock Bottom Flintstone, but he was nicknamed"
00:37:27,00:37:33,Rocky. That's an even better name for my dad. And it was about a running with some Stone
00:37:33,00:37:40,"Age Nazis and a romantic escape with a character called Mataharok, like who's based on Matahari"
00:37:40,00:37:45,this man. So there's a little bit of romance in there as well. Do you know what? That makes
00:37:45,00:37:53,"some sort of sense because my dad, my dad recently tried to trademark Rocky Flintstone"
00:37:53,00:37:58,because he's an idiot. And he thinks that's going to be able to be done. And he got a letter
00:37:58,00:38:04,"back from Warner Brothers basically saying, absolutely not. No circumstances. And actually"
00:38:04,00:38:07,you're lucky that we're not suing you for using it up until this point. But you know what?
00:38:07,00:38:12,The parallels here go a bit further than just the name being the same. So my dad wrote a
00:38:12,00:38:18,porno is ending now after six seasons because we're being sued by the Flintstone. And the
00:38:18,00:38:22,"final episode of my dad wrote a porno is going to feature for the first time, Rocky"
00:38:22,00:38:26,Flintstone himself. That is the first ever appearance of Rocky Flintstone. Someone's
00:38:26,00:38:32,"read the press release. So Flintstones, this episode where Rocky Flintstone appears for"
00:38:32,00:38:41,"the first time is the final episode of season six. Yeah, so it's the exact same scenario"
00:38:41,00:38:46,"as you. That's so what this is. So did you have any idea that your dad, I mean, has your"
00:38:46,00:38:49,dad seen the episode of the Flintstones? No. Did you sort of see it and then forget all
00:38:49,00:38:53,"about it and then years later? No, because he would have been, I think it's just an"
00:38:53,00:38:58,"awesome name and the coincidence. Yeah, well, he was he named himself the Rocky after a"
00:38:58,00:39:03,"dog in Brazil, which we don't need to go to. But the Flintstone bit was because he really"
00:39:03,00:39:08,"relates to, you know, in the title sequence, yeah, when he gets locked out the house, he"
00:39:08,00:39:15,"gets like back to the talk. Yes. Yeah, that's very much like my parents. So I think that"
00:39:15,00:39:20,that's where he was inspired from. But that is mad that is actually a character and the
00:39:20,00:39:23,"grandfather of Fred, you said. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So one generation difference,"
00:39:23,00:39:29,but closer. And I watched a bit of the episode in it. It's going from Fred reading out loud
00:39:29,00:39:34,"to his wife and Barney, his friends. So it's a similar thing. Extracts of the diary out"
00:39:34,00:39:39,loud while they then cut to the scenes itself. I think there's something of Alice in Wilma
00:39:39,00:39:43,"as well. Is it there? What do you not say? Yeah. Redhead. Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure"
00:39:43,00:39:49,how I feel about this. That makes me think my whole career has been a lie. But obviously
00:39:49,00:39:53,the Flintstones was massive and the 60s was absolutely enormous. And so the end of the
00:39:53,00:39:56,"Flintstones was watched by, I don't know how many people I couldn't, they didn't have the"
00:39:56,00:40:02,"actual figures, but it was like 30% of the TV watching. Wow. Yeah. And it was the end"
00:40:02,00:40:05,of the original series because obviously it's gone on and on and so on. But we're going
00:40:05,00:40:10,to talk about the Flintstones movies later on. Don't you worry. I bloody hope so. Iconic
00:40:10,00:40:16,"bits of cinema. But the Flintstones, the cartoon, I didn't realise, was also originally aimed"
00:40:16,00:40:20,"at adults just as much as children. Yeah. All cast late in late evening. Primetime show,"
00:40:20,00:40:24,8.30pm. Yeah. And I really liked the fact it was originally called the Flagstones. And
00:40:24,00:40:29,"then the Gladstones. Yeah. And then the Flintstones, they finally hit on that as a, because those"
00:40:29,00:40:34,two both sounds so weird. Yeah. A comedy called the Flagstones. Have you seen the pilot of
00:40:34,00:40:40,the Flagstones? No. No. I actually watched it. All 90 seconds of it. 90 seconds. And
00:40:40,00:40:44,"it was, it was good. It's amazing that it got picked up. Are you saying it is good or"
00:40:44,00:40:49,is it? It is good. It is good. But it doesn't have the magic of the Flintstones. Was it the
00:40:49,00:40:55,same characters as well? Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah. But it was made in 1959 but never aired
00:40:55,00:41:00,until 1994 when it was discovered. Okay. Right. We should watch it. It's interesting
00:41:00,00:41:07,"to see. 1994 is the year that the Flintstones movie came out. No. Yeah. So anyway, in the"
00:41:07,00:41:11,"original series, one of the things that to appeal to adults as well that they did, I'm"
00:41:11,00:41:17,"pushing on, is they would have celebrity guests that would come on or they would parody celebrities"
00:41:17,00:41:22,"of the day in order to give some comic, as you would say, for the adult sort of recognition."
00:41:22,00:41:28,"So quick quiz, because they loved a pun. They absolutely loved a pun. Okay. Cary Grant is"
00:41:28,00:41:35,"a character. What has he been renamed? Clay Grant. Oh, that's good. Cary Granite. Yes."
00:41:35,00:41:41,"1-0. Tony Curtis, who voiced himself is on. What is he called? Boney Curtis because they"
00:41:41,00:41:46,were in there. That's good. Yeah. No. Close. You're in the right area of the name. Stony
00:41:46,00:41:57,Curtis. Yeah. Keep going. They're one of these. Yeah. There's Rock Hudson. Amazingly. Yeah.
00:41:57,00:42:05,"It's Rock Hudson stone. Oh my God. And Halle Berry in the movie, the Flintstones. I don't"
00:42:05,00:42:09,know if you're keen to talk about that. She was actually directly named after a famous
00:42:09,00:42:14,"female celebrity. Halle Beryl. No. So, no. So you've got to step away from Halle's name"
00:42:14,00:42:23,all together. Shelly Berry. No. No. What? Hallite Berry. No. Her name is nothing to do with
00:42:23,00:42:27,it. Right. It's another famous actress. The character's name. Yeah. The character's name
00:42:27,00:42:32,is actress. Yeah. Named after another famous actress. Shelly's The Rock. No. So there's
00:42:32,00:42:37,no pun. It's just outright her name. Sharon Stone. Yeah. There we go. And she's called
00:42:37,00:42:41,Sharon Stone in the movie. Halle Berry is called Sharon Stone in the movie. But that's enough
00:42:41,00:42:47,"on the movie. Let's get back to the TV series. Well, just lots of, I really find it interesting"
00:42:47,00:42:50,"that the sort of adult elements of it, because I did not, I never watched the Flintstones"
00:42:50,00:42:57,"really. Really? Yeah. Just not referring to me with it. I guess so. But it's, they, they,"
00:42:57,00:43:03,"they were sponsored by cigarettes in the original days, which Winston Andy, how many times did"
00:43:03,00:43:09,"I have to tell you? Jesus. Anyway, they were sponsored by this film, Winston Cigarettes."
00:43:09,00:43:13,Was that when it was going out to children? It feels like that was when it was being shot.
00:43:13,00:43:15,"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even then it was good. Well, yeah, because advertising was just different"
00:43:15,00:43:19,"back then. They were advertising to adults. They weren't, they weren't kids smoking. Have"
00:43:19,00:43:23,you seen that as well? I actually watched that. Yeah. It isn't the smoking that got me. It's
00:43:23,00:43:30,"the outrageous misogyny of those two men. Oh, really? It is insane. Like Barley and Fred"
00:43:30,00:43:35,are just like watching their wives do loads of chores and housework. And then they're
00:43:35,00:43:39,"like, let's go around the back and they sneak off and they just like, oh, like reclining and"
00:43:39,00:43:44,"just smoking and just chatting and watching their wives work. Right. They are cavemen,"
00:43:44,00:43:51,"but it is literally. There's a theory that the Flintstones are from the future, which"
00:43:51,00:43:56,"I quite like. That's the Jetsons. Well, they do meet the Jetsons at one stage, don't they?"
00:43:56,00:44:03,"So that's part of the theory. Okay. One theory is because they have four fingers. Obviously,"
00:44:03,00:44:09,we have five fingers in this time. So perhaps the little finger has sort of vestigially disappeared
00:44:09,00:44:13,"because you don't need it anymore because, you know, what do you use your little finger"
00:44:13,00:44:18,"for? You're right. And we never had four fingers. So that has to be an evolution. Yeah. They,"
00:44:18,00:44:23,"the animals in the Flintstones can speak. Obviously, these days, animals can't speak"
00:44:23,00:44:27,"and never in the past, as far as we know, have animals been able to speak. Yes. So perhaps"
00:44:27,00:44:31,"in the future, they will be able to speak. Humans coexisting with dinosaurs never happened"
00:44:31,00:44:41,in the past. So Jurassic Park. Is it a sequel to Jurassic Park? The theory is that it's
00:44:41,00:44:46,a post-apocalyptic future where all current technology has collapsed. They're trying
00:44:46,00:44:53,to replicate it using the mutant dinosaurs. My theory is that they listened to this podcast
00:44:53,00:44:57,and rocks became so popular because of the last section that we just did away with all
00:44:57,00:45:02,"of the technology and people lived in a rock-based society. Yeah, I'd live there. I'd move. Wow."
00:45:02,00:45:10,Did you guys see the Flintstones kids just say no holiday special? I missed that one.
00:45:10,00:45:16,This was something that went out in 1988 and it was a public service say no to drugs Flintstones
00:45:16,00:45:21,"episode. Brilliant. Oh man. Can I tell you the plot? Yes, please. So the Flintstones kids,"
00:45:21,00:45:26,"it's like young Flintstones. It's just bam, bam and pebbles. No, it's not. It's actually"
00:45:26,00:45:36,"the main generation we know, but they're trying to win tickets to a Michael Jackson"
00:45:36,00:45:42,concert who in this is called Michael Jackstone. Thank you. Exactly. And Wilma is tempted to
00:45:42,00:45:49,"join up with a gang of older kids whose leader, Stony, smokes, crack marijuana. Unfortunately."
00:45:49,00:45:55,You're right. They should have gone with it. And then we'll talk to her parents and they
00:45:55,00:46:00,tell her that a real friend wouldn't offer you drugs. And Stony is arrested for drug usage
00:46:00,00:46:05,and ends with a version of Michael Jackstone's song beat it. And the episode also features
00:46:05,00:46:10,Nancy Reagan as herself. Does she have a funny name? I think she might have been doing a
00:46:10,00:46:17,"kind of extra like hi everybody, you know, rather than Nancy Reagan. Yeah, that is a"
00:46:17,00:46:22,really hot. That's probably why she never made it onto the Flintstones. Can we talk a little
00:46:22,00:46:27,"bit about the movie? Oh, go on. Okay. Well, this is kind of tangential. It's not really"
00:46:27,00:46:34,"about the movies, even though it is the B 52s. Oh, yes, the band. Yes. Love Jack of"
00:46:34,00:46:41,love Jack Fane. Yeah. What a tune. They recorded versions of meet the Flintstones and the bedrock
00:46:41,00:46:47,"twitch, which I'm sure you've got that record. Did you? The B 52s are they did change their"
00:46:47,00:46:54,name? They changed their name to the BC 52. And they even appeared on the top 40 chart
00:46:54,00:47:02,as the BC 52. That's great. Everyone got on board. I really want to see both the Flintstones
00:47:02,00:47:09,"film and the Flintstones film sequel, Viva Rock Vegas. Yeah. So you've seen both. Of course."
00:47:09,00:47:12,Yeah. I just mentioned to my wife that we were recording this. I've seen that. How they
00:47:12,00:47:17,"buried tries to have sex with John Goodman in the film. And it's quite, it's quite a"
00:47:17,00:47:22,sort of saucy plot where John Goodman is Fred Flintstone because he's incredibly eminent
00:47:22,00:47:26,as an actor now and seeing him in 1994 playing Fred Flintstone is very funny. But he looked
00:47:26,00:47:33,"so like Fred Flintstone. It's amazing to have to say yes. Is it not a good film? It's, it's"
00:47:33,00:47:38,"quite like his cult film. It was commercially successful. But afterwards, the entire cast"
00:47:38,00:47:44,"refused to return for the sequel, which is why prequel Viva Rock Vegas was recast entirely."
00:47:44,00:47:49,Nobody the same. Yeah. Because the first of its own movie is Elizabeth Taylor's last
00:47:49,00:47:55,"ever film, which is really terrible. The casting is amazing. What a way to go out. It's got"
00:47:55,00:48:00,Rick Moranis. It's got Elizabeth Taylor. They clearly thought they had something. One thing
00:48:00,00:48:05,I read was that Rick Moranis basically quit acting after this movie because they realized
00:48:05,00:48:12,"that they were using him. He peaked. I personally, I think I'd read that he had, he had family"
00:48:12,00:48:16,"issues, which meant he had to step back from acting. But the thing claims that he was just"
00:48:16,00:48:24,"like, I can't be put in any more movies like this. Rick Moranis, like a Moranis, like a,"
00:48:24,00:48:31,it's like Scree that you get on top of a mountain. Very nice. Because Rock Moranis was
00:48:31,00:48:44,right there. He needs the puns you need explaining for. That's his puns. Glass was banished from
00:48:44,00:48:48,the entire set of the Flintstones. What was it? He guesses why. No glass in the future.
00:48:48,00:48:55,"In the future, there's no glass. That's correct. Was it that though? Because I know that in,"
00:48:55,00:48:59,"is it in Downton Abbey, you're not allowed to wear Calvin Klein underwear. Because even"
00:48:59,00:49:03,"though it's not on show, they think maybe your sackcloth or whatever it is they wear"
00:49:03,00:49:09,in it might ride up and they might see it. So your sackcloth? Do you think it's set like
00:49:09,00:49:13,"in the 14th century with peasants and things? It's not, it's not. But you can see, you can"
00:49:13,00:49:19,"see there are lots of, it's an Abbey. I thought it was about monks. There are lots of probably"
00:49:19,00:49:22,quite sheer and slinky gowns and outfits and maybe if you're wearing modern. You can't
00:49:22,00:49:26,"wear modern underwear basically, even though it's not going to be on show. Is it similar?"
00:49:26,00:49:30,"It's not that. No. Glass ban from set. I think Jamie, you're the only one who hasn't"
00:49:30,00:49:34,slung it again. James has got quite a good one. Darren's no glass in the future. There's
00:49:34,00:49:38,a wide range of plausibility. I forgot again that we talk about the Flintstones. The Flintstones
00:49:38,00:49:42,"movie. They're worried that, because there was so much rock on set. No shoes. No one's"
00:49:42,00:49:46,"wearing shoes. Oh, no one's wearing shoes. The entire cast are filming barefoot. That's"
00:49:46,00:49:52,"clever. And so, really, kind of any glass on set. Yeah. Well done, Daphne. That is good."
00:49:52,00:50:00,"There was the actor in the original series, Miss Jean Vanda Ply, or PIL, PYL is her surname,"
00:50:00,00:50:06,and she was the voice of Wilma. And she gave an interview in 1995 where she explained that
00:50:06,00:50:11,"they were basically for the amazing amount of money that this made, because it was syndicated"
00:50:11,00:50:15,"around the world. I mean, there was just so much money being made. She only received $250"
00:50:15,00:50:21,an episode. And then she did a contract that said the residual payments from syndication.
00:50:21,00:50:26,"She did a one-off payment of $15,000. And that was it that she got. And she was a great"
00:50:26,00:50:30,"voice. She did a lot of voices in the Jetsons as well. And she did, I think, as well as"
