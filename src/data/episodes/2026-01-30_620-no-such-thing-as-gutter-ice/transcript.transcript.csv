00:00:00,00:00:01,(upbeat music)
00:00:01,00:00:04,"- Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:04,00:00:06,"of Fish, Dan, and James here."
00:00:06,00:00:07,We're just very excited to let you know
00:00:07,00:00:10,about our guest this week 'cause it's a classic.
00:00:10,00:00:12,"- Absolutely, we're most excited 'cause Andy isn't here,"
00:00:12,00:00:14,"but we are excited about our guest,"
00:00:14,00:00:19,"who was the incredible, wonderful Sally Phillips."
00:00:19,00:00:22,"The great thing about Sally is she came on the show,"
00:00:22,00:00:23,she's got nothing to plug.
00:00:23,00:00:26,"I mean, you could Google her and find out everything about her,"
00:00:26,00:00:29,but she just came on because she loves knowledge.
00:00:29,00:00:31,She loves the research period.
00:00:31,00:00:33,I think she prefers the research part
00:00:33,00:00:34,to actually do the show.
00:00:34,00:00:37,She just goes down all these incredible rabbit holes
00:00:37,00:00:39,and she's just the best person to podcast with.
00:00:39,00:00:40,"- I know, she came into the office saying,"
00:00:40,00:00:43,I'm so sorry I haven't had any time to do research
00:00:43,00:00:45,"for the show, she had more notes than any of us."
00:00:45,00:00:47,"She had like 20 pages, sure."
00:00:47,00:00:50,"They were in size 25 font, but they were there."
00:00:50,00:00:52,She does her stuff.
00:00:52,00:00:53,"- The show is really, really fun."
00:00:53,00:00:55,I'm absolutely certain you're gonna win Choyette.
00:00:55,00:00:57,"If you would like to hear more,"
00:00:57,00:00:59,then you could go to Patreon.
00:00:59,00:01:02,"If you'd like to Patreon.com/nosesingsafish,"
00:01:02,00:01:03,you could join one of our tiers
00:01:03,00:01:07,"and the middle tier will have an Excel version of this show,"
00:01:07,00:01:10,which I can exclusively reveal.
00:01:10,00:01:13,It has an incredible anecdote about Bob Martimer in it
00:01:13,00:01:15,that there was no space for in this edit.
00:01:15,00:01:18,"- But also, you can just join our Patreon for free."
00:01:18,00:01:19,"And if you do that this week,"
00:01:19,00:01:22,you're gonna find a little bonus video.
00:01:22,00:01:27,It is of Sally taking a Bible and predicting our fortunes.
00:01:27,00:01:28,It was nuts.
00:01:28,00:01:29,It's really fun.
00:01:29,00:01:30,You can watch that there now.
00:01:30,00:01:31,So go check that out.
00:01:31,00:01:34,"And if you want to follow Sally, she's on Instagram."
00:01:34,00:01:35,So follow @sallysmack.
00:01:35,00:01:37,She's always doing amazing projects.
00:01:37,00:01:40,She's always in brilliant TV shows and brilliant movies.
00:01:40,00:01:41,She's just awesome.
00:01:41,00:01:44,"So go say hi there, but enjoy her here now."
00:01:44,00:01:45,Or no such thing as a fish.
00:01:45,00:01:47,"Okay, I'm with the episode."
00:01:47,00:01:48,- I'm with the podcast.
00:01:48,00:01:54,(playful music)
00:01:54,00:01:59,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing"
00:01:59,00:02:10,"as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:02:10,00:02:11,from the QI offices in Hobern.
00:02:11,00:02:13,My name is Dan Triber.
00:02:13,00:02:15,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:02:15,00:02:18,"James Harkin, and Sally Phillips."
00:02:18,00:02:20,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:20,00:02:22,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:22,00:02:24,"And in no particular order,"
00:02:24,00:02:26,"here we go, starting with fact number one."
00:02:26,00:02:29,And that is Sally.
00:02:29,00:02:31,"- Well, I've been interested in Greenland"
00:02:31,00:02:33,"for obvious reasons this week,"
00:02:33,00:02:37,and I came across a fact that Greenlanders
00:02:37,00:02:39,"start their new year countdown,"
00:02:39,00:02:44,"14,410 seconds before midnight."
00:02:44,00:02:46,(laughing)
00:02:46,00:02:46,- Brilliant.
00:02:46,00:02:48,"- Well, you've got to make the time pass somehow."
00:02:48,00:02:51,I imagine it's pretty cold and dark for a long time.
00:02:51,00:02:54,And so that'll be a fun evening's activity.
00:02:54,00:02:57,And that is because they currently are attached
00:02:57,00:02:59,"part of the Kingdom of Denmark,"
00:02:59,00:03:03,and Denmark celebrates midnight several hours before them.
00:03:03,00:03:07,"And so if they attach to the United States,"
00:03:07,00:03:11,they would be celebrating midnight at midnight and at 3 a.m.
00:03:11,00:03:11,"- Oh, right."
00:03:11,00:03:15,- They have to do Pacific Eastern Central and Hawaii.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"- Well, I've looked up Washington."
00:03:17,00:03:18,How long would it be?
00:03:18,00:03:19,- Three hours from Washington.
00:03:19,00:03:21,- It's not a good reason not to do it.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"We don't need any more reasons,"
00:03:23,00:03:26,but this new year thing is not dissimilar
00:03:26,00:03:27,"to what I'm currently doing,"
00:03:27,00:03:30,which is the fake new year at 8 p.m. for all the kids.
00:03:30,00:03:31,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:03:31,00:03:32,- And then you do the 12 p.m.
00:03:32,00:03:34,and it's probably not too dissimilar
00:03:34,00:03:35,at time difference.
00:03:35,00:03:36,"- I will say, Sally,"
00:03:36,00:03:38,"it's quite risky doing a section on Greenland,"
00:03:38,00:03:41,because we did a section on Venezuela several weeks ago
00:03:41,00:03:42,with Michael Palin.
00:03:42,00:03:43,"And then soon afterwards,"
00:03:43,00:03:44,at the unpleasant disaster.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"- We're just working our way through all the new states,"
00:03:46,00:03:47,"aren't we, of America?"
00:03:47,00:03:48,(laughing)
00:03:48,00:03:50,"- Yeah, I find it really fascinating that he said,"
00:03:50,00:03:52,"he said, ""Yeah, it's about the oil."""
00:03:52,00:03:54,But they've got access to the oil
00:03:54,00:03:55,and they're not taking it out.
00:03:55,00:03:57,"So we know it isn't about,"
00:03:57,00:03:59,"if he says it's about the oil, it's not about the oil, right?"
00:03:59,00:04:00,So what is it about?
00:04:00,00:04:01,Is it about the fact that everything's gonna melt
00:04:01,00:04:04,in which case it's gonna be a better place to be?
00:04:04,00:04:06,- There's a good theory.
00:04:06,00:04:07,- What's that?
00:04:07,00:04:09,- That it's about the Mercato projection.
00:04:09,00:04:10,"Yeah, the problem is,"
00:04:10,00:04:12,"what's that? - So the Mercato,"
00:04:12,00:04:15,"if you look at a flat map of the globe,"
00:04:15,00:04:17,things that are further from the equator look bigger.
00:04:17,00:04:19,So there's no doubt Greenland is extremely big.
00:04:19,00:04:20,"- Oh, that's funny."
00:04:20,00:04:21,- It's extremely big Greenland.
00:04:21,00:04:22,"- The biggest island in the world,"
00:04:22,00:04:23,if you're not counting Australia.
00:04:23,00:04:24,"- No, well, that's not an island."
00:04:24,00:04:25,"- Right, yeah, yeah."
00:04:25,00:04:27,"- Yeah, that's a continent, that's the tiniest continent."
00:04:27,00:04:29,"- So it's the biggest, so Greenland's the biggest island"
00:04:29,00:04:30,in the world. - So it's the biggest island.
00:04:30,00:04:31,- Without caveats.
00:04:31,00:04:32,"But basically the problem is,"
00:04:32,00:04:34,it looks 12 times bigger than it is.
00:04:34,00:04:35,"Like really, it looks, yeah, yeah."
00:04:35,00:04:37,And it's all because the Mercato projection
00:04:37,00:04:41,"is a very good way of making a 3D object flat,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,"you know, rendering it in a flat form."
00:04:43,00:04:45,And it's thanks to a Flemish cartographer
00:04:45,00:04:49,called Gerardus Mercato from several centuries ago.
00:04:49,00:04:52,- It looks as big as Africa on a flat map.
00:04:52,00:04:54,"It's really not, you know, it is big,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,but it's nowhere near as big as it looks.
00:04:56,00:04:58,"I mean, it looks almost as big as North America."
00:04:58,00:05:02,So what we need to do is change the map immediately
00:05:02,00:05:04,to make it look a bit more accurate.
00:05:04,00:05:06,"- It's bigger than Mexico, so it is big."
00:05:06,00:05:07,- It's big.
00:05:07,00:05:10,- And it means that Denmark is the biggest country
00:05:10,00:05:12,that's wholly in Europe.
00:05:12,00:05:14,"So that's always a fun, quick question."
00:05:14,00:05:16,"It's like, apart from Russia,"
00:05:16,00:05:17,"which is partly in Asia,"
00:05:17,00:05:19,"what's the biggest country in Europe and it's Denmark,"
00:05:19,00:05:22,even though it looks small because it has this huge battery.
00:05:22,00:05:24,"- That's great, yeah, that's very interesting."
00:05:24,00:05:27,"- But hasn't it, it has belonged to America before?"
00:05:27,00:05:28,Or?
00:05:28,00:05:29,"- Greenland, no."
00:05:29,00:05:31,I thought it was Eric the Red and then--
00:05:31,00:05:33,"- Well, he was actually a landic."
00:05:33,00:05:36,So he was expelled from Iceland for manslaughter.
00:05:36,00:05:39,And the idea is that he called it Greenland
00:05:39,00:05:40,"to lure people there,"
00:05:40,00:05:42,"because he thought that if he called it Greenland,"
00:05:42,00:05:43,people would want to go there.
00:05:43,00:05:44,- More tourist would come.
00:05:44,00:05:46,Isn't it great that there still exists
00:05:46,00:05:49,"on the map of the world, a joke, a prank?"
00:05:49,00:05:50,Isn't that great?
00:05:50,00:05:52,"- Yeah, well, that's really, that's really, really interesting."
00:05:52,00:05:53,"- James, have you been there?"
00:05:53,00:05:56,"- No, I haven't, I'd love to go one day a bit tight"
00:05:56,00:05:59,"on the few times, but yeah, it's just tricky to get to"
00:05:59,00:06:01,"from here, as Nick, 'cause you have to go to Denmark"
00:06:01,00:06:02,and then go back over.
00:06:02,00:06:03,"- Yes, right."
00:06:03,00:06:04,- I'd love to go over.
00:06:04,00:06:08,It claimed on the internet that in your traditions
00:06:08,00:06:11,"coming back, one is to towing your face"
00:06:11,00:06:13,when you get your first period.
00:06:13,00:06:14,- Okay.
00:06:14,00:06:16,"- Oh, a specific kind of tattoo, or--"
00:06:16,00:06:18,"- A specific, yeah, dots between the eyes,"
00:06:18,00:06:21,"that kind of thing, and childbirth, every child you have,"
00:06:21,00:06:23,and those traditions are coming back.
00:06:23,00:06:24,And what was the other ingredient?
00:06:24,00:06:26,"Oh yeah, washing your hair with urine."
00:06:26,00:06:29,And I obviously was attracted by that fact.
00:06:29,00:06:30,(laughing)
00:06:30,00:06:34,"I went after that, and I found that James Cracknell's wife,"
00:06:34,00:06:36,Beverly has been online to--
00:06:36,00:06:37,- The roller.
00:06:37,00:06:38,- Beverly Turner.
00:06:38,00:06:40,"- Yeah, Beverly Turner."
00:06:40,00:06:42,"I've been online going, yeah, I'm doing that."
00:06:42,00:06:43,That's great.
00:06:43,00:06:44,I'm just getting to the show and washing my hair
00:06:44,00:06:47,"with a cup full of pee, and lots of people swear by it."
00:06:47,00:06:48,- Is that true?
00:06:48,00:06:53,"- Yeah, that's so much so that the Icelandic company,"
00:06:53,00:06:57,"no, not company, students, Icelandic students,"
00:06:57,00:07:01,"have made a hard, a bar shampoo out of cow urine."
00:07:01,00:07:02,- Wow.
00:07:02,00:07:03,"- So it has ammonia, right, so it could be--"
00:07:03,00:07:04,- It's ammonia.
00:07:04,00:07:06,"- For sure, it could bleach your hair."
00:07:06,00:07:08,"That was going to be my question, though."
00:07:08,00:07:10,Is she doing it with animal or family?
00:07:10,00:07:11,- Her own urine.
00:07:11,00:07:12,- Right.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"And so there's quite a lot of people out there doing it,"
00:07:14,00:07:19,"and I came across the word urine munger, which I was like,"
00:07:19,00:07:22,"so thrilled to know existed, from Peeps's diary,"
00:07:22,00:07:25,"where obviously urine was a commodity,"
00:07:25,00:07:28,"because it was used for tanning animal hides,"
00:07:28,00:07:30,"but also for bleaching, you know what it was."
00:07:30,00:07:31,"- Of course it was, of course it was."
00:07:31,00:07:32,"- For you for bleaching clothes,"
00:07:32,00:07:36,as they used to put a big bucket outside the textile manufacturer's
00:07:36,00:07:39,"house with people to piss in on the way back from the pub,"
00:07:39,00:07:41,because it was a fixative for dye.
00:07:41,00:07:44,"So if you were making very fancy clothes for queens and stuff,"
00:07:44,00:07:46,you would only use newborn baby piss.
00:07:46,00:07:47,"- Oh, come on."
00:07:47,00:07:48,- That makes sense.
00:07:48,00:07:49,- This is what the internet says.
00:07:49,00:07:52,"Just prove me wrong, guys, prove me wrong."
00:07:52,00:07:56,"- I think we have the same sources, 'cause we do the fact"
00:07:56,00:07:59,"ages ago, remember about how the urine of redheads"
00:07:59,00:08:01,"would be used in stained glass window,"
00:08:01,00:08:02,"because it had magical properties,"
00:08:02,00:08:04,and it would just last longer.
00:08:04,00:08:05,- Oh really?
00:08:05,00:08:05,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:05,00:08:07,- When you say we did a fact.
00:08:07,00:08:08,(laughing)
00:08:08,00:08:10,- But newborn babies produce very little.
00:08:10,00:08:13,"- I know, well, I imagine that made it all more expensive."
00:08:13,00:08:13,- Exactly.
00:08:13,00:08:16,- It's a client demand.
00:08:16,00:08:17,- It's a client demand.
00:08:17,00:08:18,- That was quite a rabbit hole.
00:08:18,00:08:20,"Sally, you have to say it was wonderful."
00:08:20,00:08:24,- There's a thing that they're exporting from Greenland to Dubai.
00:08:24,00:08:30,"Yeah, which is ice for their ice cubes, for their cocktails."
00:08:30,00:08:32,So there's a startup company in Greenland that say
00:08:32,00:08:36,that they have the purest of ice that you can possibly get.
00:08:36,00:08:37,"Black ice, they call it."
00:08:37,00:08:40,"It's where you go, it's where you go."
00:08:40,00:08:41,(laughing)
00:08:41,00:08:43,- It sounds like it's got grits in it.
00:08:43,00:08:46,"- The purest ice possible, black ice."
00:08:46,00:08:50,"- I know, it's a Greenland situation again, it's a prank."
00:08:50,00:08:53,"It melts slower, apparently."
00:08:53,00:08:55,- Oh yeah. - It's part of the marketing I read.
00:08:55,00:08:58,And they say it's quite environmentally friendly.
00:08:58,00:08:59,Is there a pitch?
00:08:59,00:09:00,"- Oh yeah, 'cause it doesn't sound like it."
00:09:00,00:09:02,- Not many people have the pitch.
00:09:02,00:09:04,This is clearly the worst thing we could be doing.
00:09:04,00:09:06,We're gonna sail our diesel boat out to a...
00:09:06,00:09:09,"- Well, here's the thing, Greenland has to import a lot of stuff"
00:09:09,00:09:11,"by boat, by diesel boat, right?"
00:09:11,00:09:13,"So you're sending in full boats, but you're leaving with nothing."
00:09:13,00:09:17,So they're saying at least you're leaving with ice.
00:09:17,00:09:18,And so we're making money off of that.
00:09:18,00:09:19,So they're saying at least these boats
00:09:19,00:09:21,are making the return journey full.
00:09:21,00:09:23,"- But the ice thing, they have that in Sweden as well."
00:09:23,00:09:25,"I mean, the ice bar in Stockholm,"
00:09:25,00:09:28,they have a whole thing about where the ice has come from
00:09:28,00:09:30,and ice mining.
00:09:30,00:09:34,"- Yeah, I've had the water from ice bugs in Iceland."
00:09:34,00:09:37,"In fact, like they sold it in the air pot."
00:09:37,00:09:41,"- You only feed your cat a melted ice bag water, don't you?"
00:09:41,00:09:44,"- It's environmentally friendly though, so that's good."
00:09:44,00:09:47,You leave my cat out of this.
00:09:47,00:09:50,- We've heard icicles from our blocked gutters this week.
00:09:50,00:09:53,"- As you move, you've been selling them too."
00:09:53,00:09:53,"- Thank you, here you go."
00:09:53,00:09:54,- Badly turner.
00:09:54,00:09:56,- Sally Phillips is gutter water.
00:09:56,00:09:57,- Sally Phillips is gutter ice.
00:09:57,00:10:00,I think it's something you've been selling.
00:10:00,00:10:02,- 'Cause like the delivered roof drivers
00:10:02,00:10:03,go into your house with a pizza.
00:10:03,00:10:05,"You might as well leave with something, right?"
00:10:05,00:10:08,"- Exactly, exactly."
00:10:08,00:10:12,- So Greenland has a great history of explorers.
00:10:12,00:10:16,There's a guy who I obsessed with who was called Peter Freikin
00:10:16,00:10:20,and he did a lot of early exploration with the Inuit.
00:10:20,00:10:22,He was Icelandic and so he would go over there
00:10:22,00:10:24,"and he lived there and he married someone from there,"
00:10:24,00:10:25,had two kids there.
00:10:25,00:10:28,And he's quite notable because of a story
00:10:28,00:10:30,that he wrote about in his book where he was caught in a storm.
00:10:30,00:10:32,There was a bit of an avalanche of where he was sleeping
00:10:32,00:10:36,and he had to get out of the burrow he was in
00:10:36,00:10:40,"using Poo Knife, right?"
00:10:40,00:10:40,- Poo Knife.
00:10:40,00:10:42,"- Yeah, now this has been debunked."
00:10:42,00:10:44,"- That is not possible, that's the idea."
00:10:44,00:10:46,- It is a pig when you have to tell me.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"- Yeah, the idea is Sally what it sounds like."
00:10:48,00:10:49,"Sally, I'm afraid to say."
00:10:49,00:10:50,- Why do you need a knife?
00:10:50,00:10:52,- So he's stuck in sight.
00:10:52,00:10:54,"- Oh, it's not exactly what it sounds like then."
00:10:54,00:10:57,(laughing)
00:10:57,00:10:58,- It's like a fish knife.
00:10:58,00:11:01,"Yeah, slightly different shape to better serve it."
00:11:01,00:11:02,- It's so embarrassing when you accidentally use
00:11:02,00:11:04,a Poo Knife to eat your mellad.
00:11:04,00:11:05,(laughing)
00:11:05,00:11:07,- So it's to get Poo out of animals.
00:11:07,00:11:09,"- No, so he's stuck underneath the snow."
00:11:09,00:11:11,"It's really hard packed, he couldn't get out."
00:11:11,00:11:15,"So he had this idea, what if I poo,"
00:11:15,00:11:16,"and then what if I let it freeze,"
00:11:16,00:11:19,"and then what if I then use it as a knife,"
00:11:19,00:11:21,"as a tool, as an instrument to get out of here?"
00:11:21,00:11:23,And so that's the story that he wrote down in his book.
00:11:23,00:11:27,And it's been questioned by certain members
00:11:27,00:11:30,of this podcast and the general scientific community.
00:11:30,00:11:31,(laughing)
00:11:31,00:11:34,And they've shown in recreations
00:11:34,00:11:35,that you couldn't possibly do that.
00:11:35,00:11:37,"However, I looked into his story."
00:11:37,00:11:38,- I loved that there was a recreation.
00:11:38,00:11:39,- Yeah.
00:11:39,00:11:43,- I wanted to make a movie of the recreation.
00:11:43,00:11:46,"- It was like 127 hours, it's really exciting."
00:11:46,00:11:47,"Well, that's the thing."
00:11:47,00:11:48,"When you read the whole story,"
00:11:48,00:11:51,you realize this surely can't be a lie.
00:11:51,00:11:53,"Surely this man did it because he was in this hole,"
00:11:53,00:11:57,he was sleeping that night while this storm was raging
00:11:57,00:12:00,on the head of a bear that he had killed a few days ago.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"- This can't be untrue, right?"
00:12:02,00:12:04,"And then, as he was trying to get out"
00:12:04,00:12:07,"after having made his poo knife,"
00:12:07,00:12:10,his beard got wet from all of the exertion he was giving.
00:12:10,00:12:13,"It got really sweaty, and it went on the rails of his sled"
00:12:13,00:12:15,and got stuck to it.
00:12:15,00:12:18,So he had to rip the beard off his face
00:12:18,00:12:19,in order to get out as well.
00:12:19,00:12:23,"So this is a guy using a cut, why didn't he pull a razor?"
00:12:23,00:12:25,(laughing)
00:12:25,00:12:29,- Is it early 3D printer?
00:12:29,00:12:31,(laughing)
00:12:31,00:12:43,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:12:43,00:12:46,"- Okay, my fact this week is that Miriam Webster"
00:12:46,00:12:49,has a collection of cards of all words
00:12:49,00:12:53,in the English language spelled backwards.
00:12:53,00:12:54,- It's fantastic.
00:12:54,00:12:55,"- Oh, wow."
00:12:55,00:12:57,Interesting. - Interesting.
00:12:57,00:13:00,"- Well, that's the question, isn't it?"
00:13:00,00:13:01,Why would you need it?
00:13:01,00:13:02,- Yeah.
00:13:02,00:13:03,"- You guys have researched it, right?"
00:13:03,00:13:05,- You had a theory done when James first told us
00:13:05,00:13:07,"this headline fact, and I liked it so much."
00:13:07,00:13:11,"- Oh, was it for ambulances?"
00:13:11,00:13:12,- For ambulances.
00:13:12,00:13:13,(laughing)
00:13:13,00:13:16,"- They've got it backwards, so yeah."
00:13:16,00:13:19,And we never really fleshed out the theory in that.
00:13:19,00:13:23,To clarify exactly how it was useful to know.
00:13:23,00:13:27,"- No, so this is according to Miriam Webster,"
00:13:27,00:13:28,they have these things.
00:13:28,00:13:31,And what it is is if someone sends you a query
00:13:31,00:13:35,about how many words are there ending phobia?
00:13:35,00:13:40,Or what are the only three words in English that end G-R-Y?
00:13:40,00:13:41,- Yes.
00:13:41,00:13:44,- So people would send these questions to them.
00:13:44,00:13:46,"So there's quite a famous sort of puzzle,"
00:13:46,00:13:49,which is there are three words in English language
00:13:49,00:13:52,"ending in G-R-Y, hungry and angry."
00:13:52,00:13:53,- Two of them.
00:13:53,00:13:54,"- Yeah, you got me two."
00:13:54,00:13:55,- What is the third word?
00:13:55,00:13:57,- Hungry.
00:13:57,00:13:59,- Hungry was not in the English language.
00:13:59,00:14:01,It might be soon.
00:14:01,00:14:03,"In actual fact, it's a trick."
00:14:03,00:14:07,"So it begins, there are three words in the English language."
00:14:07,00:14:11,And the trick is that the answer is the third word is language
00:14:11,00:14:12,in the English language.
00:14:12,00:14:13,"- Oh, yes, yes."
00:14:13,00:14:15,"- So that was the, when you're kids,"
00:14:15,00:14:17,"that's the kind of trick they do, right?"
00:14:17,00:14:19,"In actual fact, there are other words."
00:14:19,00:14:21,"- Language doesn't end G-R-Y, I've got very confused."
00:14:21,00:14:23,"- I know, I know."
00:14:23,00:14:25,It's like a school child.
00:14:25,00:14:26,- Sorry.
00:14:26,00:14:29,"- Riddle, but there is a word and hungry,"
00:14:29,00:14:33,"used by Shakespeare, which I guess means not hungry,"
00:14:33,00:14:35,as in Correlayness.
00:14:35,00:14:39,"He, O-E-D also has Magri, Pugri and Iguri."
00:14:39,00:14:40,"- Oh, no, no, no."
00:14:40,00:14:41,"- Okay, no, no."
00:14:41,00:14:42,- Not that common.
00:14:42,00:14:43,- What do any of those mean?
00:14:43,00:14:46,"- Magri means in spite of, Pugri is a type of Indian scarf"
00:14:46,00:14:50,"and Iguri is an Egyptian word meaning ""curry up""."
00:14:50,00:14:52,"- Yeah, Magri, that's French, isn't it?"
00:14:52,00:14:53,Meaning in spite of.
00:14:53,00:14:53,- Of course.
00:14:53,00:14:54,"- Oh, there you go."
00:14:54,00:14:56,- No fake echoes of school.
00:14:56,00:14:58,- It feels like it comes from there.
00:14:58,00:15:01,"So, they would get these questions every single week"
00:15:01,00:15:03,and they would need to be able to answer them.
00:15:03,00:15:08,"And so, they came up with these 315,000 slips of paper"
00:15:08,00:15:12,with backward words and they're in 129 boxes.
00:15:12,00:15:15,And they're still there in the basement of Million Webster.
00:15:15,00:15:16,- Do you know what I quite like?
00:15:16,00:15:19,"There would be a few words that you'd go,"
00:15:19,00:15:20,"ah, they got that wrong."
00:15:20,00:15:25,"Like wolf, for example, which is actually flow backwards, right?"
00:15:25,00:15:26,"- Oh, I see."
00:15:26,00:15:28,"So, I believe this is in the wrong box."
00:15:28,00:15:31,"- Exactly, so these are called anodromes"
00:15:31,00:15:35,and it's an anodrome is where the word is another word backwards
00:15:35,00:15:36,"and we've got over 900 of those,"
00:15:36,00:15:38,supposedly in the English language.
00:15:38,00:15:40,"So, you would constantly come across"
00:15:40,00:15:41,like those ones.
00:15:41,00:15:41,- Like that is not.
00:15:41,00:15:42,- Yes.
00:15:42,00:15:44,- Evil and live.
00:15:44,00:15:46,"- Is another example, yes."
00:15:46,00:15:47,"- Marion Webster, by the way,"
00:15:47,00:15:50,"is basically the American dictionary, isn't it?"
00:15:50,00:15:51,- Yeah.
00:15:51,00:15:52,"- Yes, it's the biggie."
00:15:52,00:15:53,I don't know.
00:15:53,00:15:54,"Obviously, I'm an OED guy, you know?"
00:15:54,00:15:59,"Well, I email Susie Dent and ask her if we have the same thing"
00:15:59,00:16:01,at the OED and she chat with her colleagues
00:16:01,00:16:03,and said that they don't have it.
00:16:03,00:16:05,"She said it was a nice idea, but these days,"
00:16:05,00:16:07,'cause we have digital dictionaries
00:16:07,00:16:10,"and now AI can find all these things in a few seconds,"
00:16:10,00:16:12,they're probably not gonna start it now.
00:16:12,00:16:13,- Shame.
00:16:13,00:16:14,'Cause it's good for rhyming as well.
00:16:14,00:16:15,Rhyming dictionaries.
00:16:15,00:16:17,- I look at them all the time when they're online.
00:16:17,00:16:18,"Yeah, I do, a lot."
00:16:18,00:16:19,"When I'm writing, yeah, I do."
00:16:19,00:16:22,"- Marion Webster, by the way, so founded by Webster Brothers,"
00:16:22,00:16:26,but Noah Webster being the biggest character of that group
00:16:26,00:16:30,"and the one who really did most of the work on it,"
00:16:30,00:16:31,fascinating life.
00:16:31,00:16:33,He was a huge impact in America.
00:16:33,00:16:34,He's sort of silently a founding father
00:16:34,00:16:36,that doesn't really get mentioned much.
00:16:36,00:16:38,"For example, Alexander Hamilton"
00:16:38,00:16:41,and him worked closely on the Federalist paper
00:16:41,00:16:43,"and he was in New York City because of Hamilton,"
00:16:43,00:16:45,but he doesn't appear as far as I can tell in that story
00:16:45,00:16:46,or maybe he does.
00:16:46,00:16:47,- I don't know.
00:16:47,00:16:49,- But he would have been useful for all the rhymes
00:16:49,00:16:50,in the rap.
00:16:50,00:16:52,"- That's what I thought, like this guy's,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,this guy probably taught this guy to rap.
00:16:54,00:16:56,(laughing)
00:16:56,00:16:58,- That these cards were the work of another guy
00:16:58,00:17:00,"called Philip Babcock Gove,"
00:17:00,00:17:03,who worked on the third Webster's dictionary.
00:17:03,00:17:06,And he was quite controversial
00:17:06,00:17:08,because he wanted to put slang in the dictionary
00:17:08,00:17:11,and until then you didn't really have slang in dictionaries.
00:17:11,00:17:16,And he basically listed almost all the populist werewords
00:17:16,00:17:18,"apart from the really, really strongest ones."
00:17:18,00:17:20,- It was controversial.
00:17:20,00:17:22,And the whole point about dictionaries
00:17:22,00:17:25,is they're describing the way languages used
00:17:25,00:17:29,rather than what you want to be in the dictionary
00:17:29,00:17:30,or what the appropriate.
00:17:30,00:17:33,- Are they more prescriptive or descriptive dictionaries?
00:17:33,00:17:35,"- Yeah, these days they're descriptive."
00:17:35,00:17:37,- But they used to be prescriptive.
00:17:37,00:17:38,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:17:38,00:17:40,And I was reading about the life of a lexicographer
00:17:40,00:17:42,and what it's like.
00:17:42,00:17:45,You know how senior you are as a lexicographer
00:17:45,00:17:47,depending on what words you're working on.
00:17:47,00:17:48,So... - Wow.
00:17:48,00:17:50,- As you get more senior and more practice.
00:17:50,00:17:52,- Get longer words. - No.
00:17:52,00:17:53,- Short words. - Short words.
00:17:53,00:17:56,- Really hard ones to do. - Really hard ones to do.
00:17:56,00:17:58,- Are small words which can have many meanings.
00:17:58,00:18:00,- It's easy to know what a zylophone is.
00:18:00,00:18:02,"- Right. - But what does ""as"" mean?"
00:18:02,00:18:05,- Precisely. - So there's a lexicographer
00:18:05,00:18:07,called Corey Stamper.
00:18:07,00:18:09,"- Yeah, no, oh. - You know what?"
00:18:09,00:18:10,"Yes, we can go shatter."
00:18:10,00:18:11,(laughing)
00:18:11,00:18:14,"There's someone, there's a lexicographer"
00:18:14,00:18:19,"called Emily Brewster, who found a new meaning for the word ""ah."""
00:18:19,00:18:20,And that was a big deal.
00:18:20,00:18:21,(laughing)
00:18:21,00:18:22,Do you know what it was? - I do.
00:18:22,00:18:27,"So it's when you're using ""a"" to mean a function word"
00:18:27,00:18:29,before a proper noun to show that a condition
00:18:29,00:18:30,is new or unusual.
00:18:30,00:18:31,I'm gonna explain what I mean.
00:18:31,00:18:34,"So after the recording was over,"
00:18:34,00:18:38,"a furious Schreiber challenged Harkin, right?"
00:18:38,00:18:40,Now what that would be is to show that Dan is not normally
00:18:40,00:18:41,furious.
00:18:41,00:18:44,"A furious Schreiber, it's using it in that sense"
00:18:44,00:18:47,to show that a condition is new or unusual.
00:18:47,00:18:50,"- Right, yeah. - That is a huge sense of the word ""a."""
00:18:50,00:18:50,Wow. - I know.
00:18:50,00:18:51,And that's a--
00:18:51,00:18:52,"- Well, it's not a new sense."
00:18:52,00:18:55,It's a new writing down of a sense.
00:18:55,00:18:56,- What's a new meaning?
00:18:56,00:18:57,"- I think that's always been used, right?"
00:18:57,00:18:59,- Take it up with Emily Brewster.
00:18:59,00:19:00,- That's always been used.
00:19:00,00:19:02,She's just classified it. - She's nailed it.
00:19:02,00:19:04,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:04,00:19:08,- But run in 2013 and OED lexicographer
00:19:08,00:19:11,did the word run and it took him nine months.
00:19:11,00:19:14,"- Yeah, it's just how it would have taken to do walk."
00:19:14,00:19:15,- Yeah.
00:19:15,00:19:17,(laughing)
00:19:17,00:19:20,"- With that, that's, yeah, the word God, for example,"
00:19:20,00:19:23,Miriam Webster had to revise that for a different
00:19:23,00:19:25,and on a bridge version of their dictionary.
00:19:25,00:19:29,"And the person, I think it was Corey Stamper, what's her name?"
00:19:29,00:19:32,- She spent four months talking to everyone
00:19:32,00:19:34,about what that word could possibly mean.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"She also did the word take, which took her a month."
00:19:37,00:19:39,And she said it's so annoying because no one's ever
00:19:39,00:19:40,gonna really read it.
00:19:40,00:19:42,"So it's just there, it's the, yeah."
00:19:42,00:19:43,"- That's true because when you look in a dictionary,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,you wanna look up a word in the dictionary.
00:19:45,00:19:47,Usually it's a word that you've never heard of.
00:19:47,00:19:49,You don't really want to know all the different meanings
00:19:49,00:19:51,"of the word, ah, do you?"
00:19:51,00:19:52,"- I have to read people, right?"
00:19:52,00:19:54,"As reading dictionaries every day, have you?"
00:19:54,00:19:56,"- Well, I've read the, the OED."
00:19:56,00:19:59,"Yeah, we used to do it for QI all the time."
00:19:59,00:20:01,"Like when those a new letter came up on QI,"
00:20:01,00:20:04,"it would be someone's job off and Andy, actually,"
00:20:04,00:20:06,you would go through them the first of the last.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"Right, down I'll do the dictionary."
00:20:08,00:20:08,"- That's quite a play, isn't it?"
00:20:08,00:20:09,I've read the dictionary.
00:20:09,00:20:10,The Bible.
00:20:10,00:20:13,"- It's quite fun to read the shorter letters,"
00:20:13,00:20:15,like your J's and your K's.
00:20:15,00:20:17,They're a bit shorter in the dictionary.
00:20:17,00:20:19,"And you know, how tricky a series of QI was gonna be"
00:20:19,00:20:22,by how short it was because there's almost nothing
00:20:22,00:20:23,"that begins with J, it's quite a,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,because it's a late letter to join the alphabet.
00:20:25,00:20:28,"So you think, oh, gonna have a rough time here."
00:20:28,00:20:30,"Get to O, easy, easy."
00:20:30,00:20:33,"- Well, you're one of those people currently working on X."
00:20:33,00:20:34,I can tell.
00:20:34,00:20:36,- Down I got out in time not to do X.
00:20:36,00:20:37,- Yeah.
00:20:37,00:20:39,- One thing dictionaries do a lot of these days
00:20:39,00:20:41,is posting a word online.
00:20:41,00:20:43,"And you know, and this is the thing that Susie"
00:20:43,00:20:44,doesn't does a bit of as well.
00:20:44,00:20:45,It's sort of posting a word.
00:20:45,00:20:47,- Like Susie will do a word that's to do with
00:20:47,00:20:49,what's happening in the news or what.
00:20:49,00:20:51,"- Yeah, like Wobble Gadget is a useless bastard"
00:20:51,00:20:52,who's the president.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"Or it's like, it's some subtle reference like that."
00:20:54,00:20:55,- Yeah.
00:20:55,00:20:56,"- And it's, but this is basically,"
00:20:56,00:20:58,I think Samuel Johnson is the first to do it.
00:20:58,00:20:59,- Really?
00:20:59,00:21:01,"- Yeah, because there are a few jokes in Johnson's dictionary."
00:21:01,00:21:04,And Johnson didn't write the first dictionary
00:21:04,00:21:05,"by quite a long stretch,"
00:21:05,00:21:08,"but he would put in jokes like oats,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,"a grain which in England is generally given to horses,"
00:21:10,00:21:13,but in Scotland supports the people.
00:21:13,00:21:15,"- And I think he had like lexicographer,"
00:21:15,00:21:17,a harmless trudge or something like that.
00:21:17,00:21:18,- Exactly.
00:21:18,00:21:19,"- Yeah, right."
00:21:19,00:21:20,- But it is basically him having little jokes
00:21:20,00:21:21,all the way through his dictionary.
00:21:21,00:21:23,"- Well no, a Webster did that."
00:21:23,00:21:26,So the word cat was defined as the domestic cat
00:21:26,00:21:27,needs no description.
00:21:27,00:21:30,"It is a deceitful animal and when enraged,"
00:21:30,00:21:31,extremely spiteful.
00:21:31,00:21:32,- Wow.
00:21:32,00:21:34,- Is that a joke or was that a pissed off?
00:21:34,00:21:36,"He was, he was quite a homogenly character."
00:21:36,00:21:38,"So it might, that might be genuine anger."
00:21:38,00:21:40,It's weird that they would just slip that in.
00:21:40,00:21:42,They would break all the rules.
00:21:42,00:21:43,Their own rules that they were setting
00:21:43,00:21:45,for this extraordinary tone.
00:21:45,00:21:46,- Yeah.
00:21:46,00:21:47,- Just release a bit of anger.
00:21:47,00:21:49,- Takes long time to write dictionaries.
00:21:49,00:21:50,- Yeah.
00:21:50,00:21:54,- The OED was published in 1928 and it was accepted.
00:21:54,00:21:58,"Well, they came up with the idea 70 years earlier."
00:21:58,00:22:00,"So it took 70 years, but the brothers Grimm,"
00:22:00,00:22:04,they started the German dictionary in 1838
00:22:04,00:22:08,and it wasn't fully finished until 1961.
00:22:08,00:22:10,- Didn't know that they wrote the dictionary.
00:22:10,00:22:11,- They were linguists.
00:22:11,00:22:12,- Yeah.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"- And before, well, they were,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,"like they didn't really write fairy tales,"
00:22:15,00:22:17,they just collected them from places.
00:22:17,00:22:17,- Yes.
00:22:17,00:22:21,"- And the Swedish Academy dictionary,"
00:22:21,00:22:26,that began in 1786 and the final word was put in in 2023.
00:22:26,00:22:31,"- No, it's very cool."
00:22:31,00:22:33,- How many words are there in the English language language?
00:22:33,00:22:34,- I thought.
00:22:34,00:22:36,"- Well, there's 315,000 cards"
00:22:36,00:22:38,that are in the backward library.
00:22:38,00:22:39,- 315.
00:22:39,00:22:40,- It kind of depends how you count it.
00:22:40,00:22:42,"I mean, I know there's a cup out answer, but."
00:22:42,00:22:46,"- Yeah, yeah, but I, the announced version of that version."
00:22:46,00:22:47,- Interesting.
00:22:47,00:22:49,- Can I tell you one more thing about the OED?
00:22:49,00:22:50,"- No, we've had enough."
00:22:50,00:22:51,- All right.
00:22:51,00:22:52,- I'm sorry.
00:22:52,00:22:54,"- No, tell us what it is."
00:22:54,00:22:57,- Just that the OED has a vault of not yet words.
00:22:57,00:22:58,- Wow.
00:22:58,00:22:58,- Wow.
00:22:58,00:22:59,- That's it.
00:22:59,00:23:00,"- And these are words that have been,"
00:23:00,00:23:02,"I don't think it's actually kept in a,"
00:23:02,00:23:05,"like a basement, but it's basically where they keep words"
00:23:05,00:23:09,"that have been pitched, but not quite been accepted yet."
00:23:09,00:23:09,- Okay.
00:23:09,00:23:11,"- And some of these words, I think arguably,"
00:23:11,00:23:12,you can argue at the top.
00:23:12,00:23:13,- Like Riz.
00:23:13,00:23:15,- Riz is a perfect example.
00:23:15,00:23:17,Is that in wide enough usage yet to qualify
00:23:17,00:23:18,as a pinned down entry?
00:23:18,00:23:20,- What does Riz mean?
00:23:20,00:23:20,"- Ah, you don't know."
00:23:20,00:23:22,"- Yeah, charisma."
00:23:22,00:23:22,- And charisma.
00:23:22,00:23:23,"- Oh, man."
00:23:23,00:23:24,"- If it's classic, basically, you know."
00:23:24,00:23:25,"- Oh, yeah."
00:23:25,00:23:26,- Someone's got Riz.
00:23:26,00:23:28,(laughing)
00:23:28,00:23:32,"- But entries 15 years ago in the OED vault,"
00:23:32,00:23:34,"Dringle, which was the watermark left on wood"
00:23:34,00:23:36,"by a glass of liquid, which is useful,"
00:23:36,00:23:39,but I've never heard anyone use Dringle.
00:23:39,00:23:39,- Okay.
00:23:39,00:23:43,- Fergill to feel in a pocket for a small object.
00:23:43,00:23:43,Just Fergling.
00:23:43,00:23:45,- That just sounds like sex pressures to me.
00:23:45,00:23:47,(laughing)
00:23:47,00:23:49,"- What's it, what are they doing, you're on it?"
00:23:49,00:23:51,- Fergling is down the park.
00:23:51,00:23:52,"- Yeah, what's his face from?"
00:23:52,00:23:53,He's send us in a lay-by.
00:23:53,00:23:56,(laughing)
00:23:56,00:23:58,(upbeat music)
00:23:58,00:24:03,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:24:03,00:24:05,That is my fact.
00:24:05,00:24:08,My fact this week is that if you ever saw a passenger
00:24:08,00:24:10,on British airways sitting with a vodka tonic
00:24:10,00:24:14,"and wearing sunglasses, they were most likely dead."
00:24:14,00:24:17,- This is a piece that came out anecdotally
00:24:17,00:24:21,from air attendants who were reporting what you do
00:24:21,00:24:24,if someone dies while the plane is mid-flight.
00:24:24,00:24:26,A lot of the things would be to just cover them up
00:24:26,00:24:29,"in their seat, move them to a seat in first class,"
00:24:29,00:24:32,"or in this case, as reported by British airways,"
00:24:32,00:24:35,"you would put some sunglasses on them,"
00:24:35,00:24:36,pop a drink down in front of them.
00:24:36,00:24:37,"- And also a copy of the Daily Mail,"
00:24:37,00:24:38,and I don't know how to do that.
00:24:38,00:24:39,"- A copy of the Daily Mail, yeah."
00:24:39,00:24:40,(laughing)
00:24:40,00:24:41,- Really?
00:24:41,00:24:44,- 'Cause nothing makes you not want to talk to someone.
00:24:44,00:24:45,(laughing)
00:24:45,00:24:46,- I'm sitting there with a copy of the Daily Mail.
00:24:46,00:24:48,"- And nothing sucks your will to live like reading it,"
00:24:48,00:24:49,"so that is kind of perfect, yeah?"
00:24:49,00:24:52,- I wonder if they count that in their circulation figures.
00:24:52,00:24:54,"- Yeah, the same thing with newspapers"
00:24:54,00:24:56,is that they bulk out their circulation figures
00:24:56,00:24:59,"by giving a load of them to airlines,"
00:24:59,00:25:01,"and say, oh, you know, thousands of people read them,"
00:25:01,00:25:03,but actually they've just given them way for a month.
00:25:03,00:25:04,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:04,00:25:05,(laughing)
00:25:05,00:25:07,"- Define read, yeah."
00:25:07,00:25:09,- It's a bit classless of them to call it circulation.
00:25:09,00:25:12,"Given how tasteless that is, but yeah, yeah."
00:25:12,00:25:14,"But this is, I think this is completely reasonable,"
00:25:14,00:25:16,because the alternative is to have people
00:25:16,00:25:19,"carrying bodies through the cabin, me a flight."
00:25:19,00:25:21,"Like, I don't think that's very sensible."
00:25:21,00:25:23,"But the article you sent, it said,"
00:25:23,00:25:24,we don't do that anymore.
00:25:24,00:25:25,"- Yes, exactly."
00:25:25,00:25:26,- We don't do that anymore.
00:25:26,00:25:29,And what really made me laugh in that article
00:25:29,00:25:31,"is that the trainer was saying to the students,"
00:25:31,00:25:33,you cannot put a dead passenger in the toilet.
00:25:33,00:25:35,It's not respectful.
00:25:35,00:25:37,And it's not strapped in for landing.
00:25:37,00:25:38,(laughing)
00:25:38,00:25:42,"- And there were cases of bodies getting rigor mortis,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,and they couldn't get them out of the toilet.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"- Wow, yes, okay, I can."
00:25:46,00:25:47,"- Just psychologically though, Andy,"
00:25:47,00:25:50,"if you're sat on a plane next to someone who's just died,"
00:25:50,00:25:53,the last thing I want is them coming over
00:25:53,00:25:54,and popping some sunglasses.
00:25:54,00:25:55,- Getting the free-volctorate.
00:25:55,00:25:57,"- Yeah, it's outrageous."
00:25:57,00:25:58,"- It's been the whole trip going,"
00:25:58,00:25:59,"are you, are you reading that?"
00:25:59,00:26:03,"Can I, I think it's okay."
00:26:03,00:26:06,"- Do you, you would happily just continue your own flight"
00:26:06,00:26:07,sitting next to a dead person.
00:26:07,00:26:08,- What is my alternative?
00:26:08,00:26:09,- Move seats or get them?
00:26:09,00:26:10,- They move seats.
00:26:10,00:26:13,- They go in the stewardess sleeping area though.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"- Well, this is the bumping up to first class thing."
00:26:15,00:26:16,"I mean, the trick, the thing you really want to do"
00:26:16,00:26:18,is you want to die for five minutes.
00:26:18,00:26:19,Get moved up to first class.
00:26:19,00:26:21,"You want to recover, and then, yes."
00:26:21,00:26:23,"- I mean, they'll be back, you know?"
00:26:23,00:26:24,- They're fuckers in first class.
00:26:24,00:26:26,"So you try, I mean, I'm not first class,"
00:26:26,00:26:28,but I remember being in business class with a baby
00:26:28,00:26:31,and it looks you get with a baby.
00:26:31,00:26:33,"Imagine, they wouldn't accept a dead person."
00:26:33,00:26:35,- There are some of my lines are trying to ban babies
00:26:35,00:26:36,in first class now.
00:26:36,00:26:38,I read this in the news this week.
00:26:38,00:26:39,Yeah.
00:26:39,00:26:39,- Right.
00:26:39,00:26:40,- Yeah.
00:26:40,00:26:41,- I don't know what's red.
00:26:41,00:26:43,"- But like, for instance,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,"like if you fly EasyJet or I and I,"
00:26:46,00:26:48,"which is why I would mostly fly,"
00:26:48,00:26:49,there is no first class.
00:26:49,00:26:50,There's no business class.
00:26:50,00:26:51,And all the seats are bucked up.
00:26:51,00:26:52,- Yes.
00:26:52,00:26:53,- So where do you put them?
00:26:53,00:26:54,- That's true.
00:26:54,00:26:55,"- Well, Singapore Airlines supposedly had a corpse"
00:26:55,00:26:57,cupboard that you would put them into.
00:26:57,00:27:00,"- It must have been used for other things engaged, Ellie."
00:27:00,00:27:01,- Yeah.
00:27:01,00:27:03,- People's suits that need had a hanging out.
00:27:03,00:27:05,"- Again, I think it's completely reasonable."
00:27:05,00:27:08,Supposedly Virgin will clear four seats in economy
00:27:08,00:27:10,and like lie the person down over that.
00:27:10,00:27:12,But this is a thing that of course happens
00:27:12,00:27:14,"because if you've ever been on a long haul flight,"
00:27:14,00:27:16,you've probably been sharing it with someone who's died
00:27:16,00:27:18,and is being repatriated.
00:27:18,00:27:20,It's just a thing you have to do.
00:27:20,00:27:22,- But they'll be underneath.
00:27:22,00:27:23,- They'll be in the hole.
00:27:23,00:27:24,"I don't know about the hole,"
00:27:24,00:27:26,but they won't be in the cabin with the rest
00:27:26,00:27:27,"of the passengers, obviously."
00:27:27,00:27:29,"But there was a case, only a few weeks ago,"
00:27:29,00:27:31,there was an 89 year old passenger.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"She with her family, you know, her younger family,"
00:27:34,00:27:35,"boarded an EasyJet flight at Malaga,"
00:27:35,00:27:37,but she boarded while dead.
00:27:37,00:27:40,"And basically the family had brought her along,"
00:27:40,00:27:42,"put her in the seat and then said,"
00:27:42,00:27:44,"oh no, she's died on board."
00:27:44,00:27:47,"- I think there's still controversy about whether she,"
00:27:47,00:27:49,like they're still saying that she died on board.
00:27:49,00:27:51,"- If they were still saying she was just tired,"
00:27:51,00:27:52,but I don't think a lot of people noticed that.
00:27:52,00:27:53,- Why did they do it?
00:27:53,00:27:56,- The theory is that it was very expensive.
00:27:56,00:27:57,- It's very expensive to repatriate.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"- Yes, okay."
00:27:58,00:28:00,"- If you repatriate someone,"
00:28:00,00:28:03,"it'll cost between £2,000 and £4,000,"
00:28:03,00:28:05,which is like somewhere between business
00:28:05,00:28:06,"and fast classes, isn't it?"
00:28:06,00:28:07,It's quite expensive.
00:28:07,00:28:10,- Quite fascinated by the flight simulator community.
00:28:10,00:28:11,- Oh yeah.
00:28:11,00:28:14,"- There's like, I mean, it's a 98% male."
00:28:14,00:28:15,"- Yes, I did perk them a bit too heavily,"
00:28:15,00:28:17,I don't know.
00:28:17,00:28:20,"- So six, you can get your own cockpit in your lounge."
00:28:20,00:28:21,- I love it.
00:28:21,00:28:23,"- There is almost exactly,"
00:28:23,00:28:25,"I mean, it is almost indistinguishable"
00:28:25,00:28:26,from the real thing.
00:28:26,00:28:27,- Wow.
00:28:27,00:28:29,"- But anyway, through that, I found there was a,"
00:28:29,00:28:31,this was a real pilot.
00:28:31,00:28:34,His first job from flight simulating
00:28:34,00:28:37,"was to then flying real planes,"
00:28:37,00:28:39,flying dead bodies across America
00:28:39,00:28:41,to where they were going to be buried.
00:28:41,00:28:44,"And his first flight, nobody told him"
00:28:44,00:28:47,that cadavers grown at altitude.
00:28:47,00:28:48,- Do they?
00:28:48,00:28:48,- Who they are?
00:28:48,00:28:49,- Who they are?
00:28:49,00:28:50,"- Apparently so, yeah."
00:28:50,00:28:51,- Pressure change.
00:28:51,00:28:52,"- Yeah, there's air with a lot."
00:28:52,00:28:55,- Cadavers have air in their lungs when you go higher
00:28:55,00:28:58,"and that air comes out, which means they grow."
00:28:58,00:28:59,- That's astonishing.
00:28:59,00:29:00,- With totally terrifying.
00:29:00,00:29:02,(laughing)
00:29:02,00:29:05,"- But to be honest, I make that noise"
00:29:05,00:29:07,"when I'm reading the Daily Mail anyway, so."
00:29:07,00:29:09,(laughing)
00:29:09,00:29:11,"- Has there ever been,"
00:29:11,00:29:13,I really hope that has been a case of someone
00:29:13,00:29:15,"who's just been flying, who is an enthusiast"
00:29:15,00:29:16,who has their own flight simulator
00:29:16,00:29:18,and they've had to do the announcement.
00:29:18,00:29:20,Is there someone on board who can fly a plane?
00:29:20,00:29:23,"- That's probably everyone's fantasy, fantasy situation."
00:29:23,00:29:25,"I don't know, I did go looking for it."
00:29:25,00:29:26,I couldn't find one.
00:29:26,00:29:31,I found that about 27% of the flight simulation community
00:29:31,00:29:35,have or have had a pilot's license at some point.
00:29:35,00:29:37,"- Okay, okay."
00:29:37,00:29:38,- There's quite a significant amount.
00:29:38,00:29:40,"- 73%, you don't."
00:29:40,00:29:43,- But there's also a gay and lesbian
00:29:43,00:29:46,and trans quite active flight sim community.
00:29:46,00:29:47,"- Okay, okay."
00:29:47,00:29:51,"- Simming, and they talk about really enjoying sightseeing"
00:29:51,00:29:53,and they'll go and all fly together
00:29:53,00:29:54,like across the Massai Mara.
00:29:54,00:29:56,"- Oh, like that."
00:29:56,00:29:57,"- Because there's great, great."
00:29:57,00:29:59,- Because you're all doing the same simulation at the same time.
00:29:59,00:30:00,- At the same time.
00:30:00,00:30:01,"- And when you're in the simulation,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,you can see the actual animals
00:30:03,00:30:05,because there's drones and things like that.
00:30:05,00:30:07,"- I mean, I used to play a bit of flight simulator."
00:30:07,00:30:08,- You surprised me not at all.
00:30:08,00:30:11,(all laughing)
00:30:11,00:30:15,"- You're dad, Sally."
00:30:15,00:30:16,- My dad worked for British Airways.
00:30:16,00:30:18,"- Yeah, that's quite cool."
00:30:18,00:30:19,So you had a...
00:30:19,00:30:20,- When it was glamorous then.
00:30:20,00:30:21,- It was glamorous.
00:30:21,00:30:22,- When are we talking?
00:30:22,00:30:25,- Then he started working for them in the '60s.
00:30:25,00:30:26,- Cool.
00:30:26,00:30:28,- I've not really engaged with that.
00:30:28,00:30:29,I've just been very selfish
00:30:29,00:30:30,and I asked my father about my straights job.
00:30:30,00:30:32,But I did this morning because it was...
00:30:32,00:30:35,"- I said, ""Can you tell me any stories about people dying?"""
00:30:35,00:30:36,"And he said, ""No."""
00:30:36,00:30:37,I can't.
00:30:37,00:30:40,"I said, ""What kind of stories have you got?"""
00:30:40,00:30:44,- And he has lots of stories about heroic stewardesses.
00:30:44,00:30:45,"So I grew up, I wanted to be a stewardess"
00:30:45,00:30:47,'cause they struck me as fantastically glamorous.
00:30:47,00:30:48,- Yeah.
00:30:48,00:30:50,"- There was a story,"
00:30:50,00:30:53,"remember being told, I don't know if it's true or not,"
00:30:53,00:30:56,about star bomb a stewardess who rescued a flight
00:30:56,00:30:59,"because the plane took off, I can't remember where from,"
00:30:59,00:31:04,and the toilets have a cap on for the...
00:31:04,00:31:06,"Anyway, this cap was not on the toilets."
00:31:06,00:31:08,"So when the plane took off,"
00:31:08,00:31:11,she went to the toilet before the lights went on
00:31:11,00:31:13,for the passengers to be able to use it.
00:31:13,00:31:14,"- Yeah, perks of the job."
00:31:14,00:31:16,- And of perks of the job.
00:31:16,00:31:18,And it sucked her in.
00:31:18,00:31:21,And so she was then keeping the pressure.
00:31:21,00:31:26,"But that blue bleach is very, very acid and corrosive."
00:31:26,00:31:30,And so it tattooed a star shape on her.
00:31:30,00:31:32,"And obviously they landed quite quickly afterwards,"
00:31:32,00:31:35,but she's like the little boy with a thumb in the dark.
00:31:35,00:31:36,- Wow.
00:31:36,00:31:37,"- Yes, stewardess with the bottom in the toilet."
00:31:37,00:31:42,"- What a story for that tattoo, it's so off of the plane."
00:31:42,00:31:43,Why do you have that tattoo?
00:31:43,00:31:45,"- I was just drunk in Cambodia, yeah, yeah, this is like..."
00:31:45,00:31:47,- We have all these sort of stewardess heroine stories
00:31:47,00:31:50,like I have a dolly on a plane.
00:31:50,00:31:52,"Stewardess coming up saying, Mr. Ali,"
00:31:52,00:31:56,you need to use your seatbelt.
00:31:56,00:31:58,"And him saying, ""Superman don't need no seatbelt."""
00:31:58,00:32:01,"And her saying, ""Superman don't need no plane, Mr. Ali."""
00:32:01,00:32:01,"- Oh, nice."
00:32:01,00:32:02,- Thank you.
00:32:02,00:32:03,- Lovely.
00:32:03,00:32:05,"- You know, I'm quite scared of flying"
00:32:05,00:32:07,and I thought I was getting over it
00:32:07,00:32:09,and you've now added a new fear.
00:32:09,00:32:11,It's the idea of if that seatbelt sign goes on
00:32:11,00:32:14,that I'm gonna get my ass sucked down through the toilet.
00:32:14,00:32:15,"Can I give you another one, Dan?"
00:32:15,00:32:15,- Yeah.
00:32:15,00:32:17,- This is my favorite BA flight ever.
00:32:17,00:32:18,- Okay.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"- And this is recently, in fact, been featured on QI."
00:32:20,00:32:22,"So this is very, so this was the flight in 1982."
00:32:22,00:32:24,- So that you went to let her reuse facts?
00:32:24,00:32:24,- While I'm going to.
00:32:24,00:32:25,- To watch me.
00:32:25,00:32:26,- Wow.
00:32:26,00:32:29,"If I had a nickel for every time I'd heard about the poo knife,"
00:32:29,00:32:29,all right?
00:32:29,00:32:32,(laughing)
00:32:32,00:32:34,- One of the most exciting BA flights ever is
00:32:34,00:32:37,the one where they flew into an ash cloud by mistake.
00:32:37,00:32:38,The flying over Indonesia.
00:32:38,00:32:39,- Yeah.
00:32:39,00:32:43,- And the plane sensors were fit to look for moisture
00:32:43,00:32:44,in the air.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"If you're flying into a big storm,"
00:32:45,00:32:46,the plane sensors are looking for moisture.
00:32:46,00:32:50,"The ash from this volcanic eruption was dry, right?"
00:32:50,00:32:53,"So all the ash landed inside the engine,"
00:32:53,00:32:55,"melted, then solidified inside."
00:32:55,00:32:58,So the all four engines stopped working.
00:32:58,00:33:00,"And the captain, Eric Moody, 41 years old at the time,"
00:33:00,00:33:03,"made the famous, now quite famous announcement."
00:33:03,00:33:05,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking."
00:33:05,00:33:07,We have a small problem.
00:33:07,00:33:09,All four engines have stopped.
00:33:09,00:33:11,We are doing our downers to get them going again.
00:33:11,00:33:13,I trust you are not in too much distress.
00:33:13,00:33:15,"- Incredible, right?"
00:33:15,00:33:17,- Do you know one of the reasons that flights
00:33:17,00:33:18,was all right and everyone on board survived?
00:33:18,00:33:19,- Why?
00:33:19,00:33:21,- He had recently been on the simulator
00:33:21,00:33:22,(laughing)
00:33:22,00:33:25,and done a simulation of a four engine failure.
00:33:25,00:33:25,- Wow.
00:33:25,00:33:28,- They had to restart the engines.
00:33:28,00:33:30,"What they had to do, they had to wait for the engines"
00:33:30,00:33:33,to cool down enough for the ash to break off
00:33:33,00:33:34,and then they could restart them.
00:33:34,00:33:37,But it took a long time and they were trying to glide
00:33:37,00:33:39,to the ground and he had to do it.
00:33:39,00:33:41,The ash had smashed up the windscreen
00:33:41,00:33:42,and made it impossible to see through.
00:33:42,00:33:45,So he had to land by being told the readings
00:33:45,00:33:48,on the instruments and how close you are to the ground.
00:33:48,00:33:49,Very cautious.
00:33:49,00:33:51,"Anyway, he very sadly died in 2024,"
00:33:51,00:33:53,"but just before that, he was on Q1."
00:33:53,00:33:54,- Yeah.
00:33:54,00:33:55,"- If you look up the cliff of Q1,"
00:33:55,00:33:57,"it's from, I can't remember what later it is,"
00:33:57,00:34:00,"that's the beauty, there we go."
00:34:00,00:34:01,And he was on there for understatement
00:34:01,00:34:02,for his lovely announcement.
00:34:02,00:34:04,And it's a really cool moment on that show.
00:34:04,00:34:04,- That's incredible.
00:34:04,00:34:05,"- Wow, that is cool."
00:34:05,00:34:10,I bet they've got the visuals for that on Microsoft Flight.
00:34:10,00:34:11,- Yeah.
00:34:11,00:34:11,- I bet they do.
00:34:11,00:34:12,I bet they do now.
00:34:12,00:34:13,People will be desperate for that.
00:34:13,00:34:16,- Because they do ice on your windscreens.
00:34:16,00:34:18,- You're really on flight simulator?
00:34:18,00:34:18,"- Yeah, lovely."
00:34:18,00:34:19,- Yeah depending on it.
00:34:19,00:34:20,- They've upgraded it.
00:34:20,00:34:21,- They've got me.
00:34:21,00:34:22,- So excited.
00:34:22,00:34:23,- You need to get a backup.
00:34:23,00:34:24,- I can't wait.
00:34:24,00:34:26,"- It's a mere six grand, so I'll date your copies."
00:34:26,00:34:28,- You don't have to change my lounge as well.
00:34:28,00:34:32,- Do you guys remember that documentary about the fire festival
00:34:32,00:34:34,that went horrible wrong?
00:34:34,00:34:36,One of the characters that just add to the chaos of it all
00:34:36,00:34:39,is a pilot who takes all of them around in a flight.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"And he'd never flown before, purely on flight simulator."
00:34:42,00:34:43,Was this thing?
00:34:43,00:34:45,- Do you listen to Black Box Down?
00:34:45,00:34:46,- No.
00:34:46,00:34:47,- It's a podcast.
00:34:47,00:34:50,- It's a podcast about plane crashes.
00:34:50,00:34:51,"It's ended now, sadly, but every episode"
00:34:51,00:34:53,they did a different flight incident.
00:34:53,00:34:54,"- Well, what happened to it?"
00:34:54,00:34:55,How did it die?
00:34:55,00:34:58,- Both hosts fell asleep very badly.
00:34:58,00:35:01,- My wife is a pilot.
00:35:01,00:35:02,A helicopter pilot.
00:35:02,00:35:05,And she's obsessed with plane crashes.
00:35:05,00:35:07,"And I think that is, if you are a pilot,"
00:35:07,00:35:10,you do want to read about all the crashes
00:35:10,00:35:13,'cause it kind of helps you know about what might happen.
00:35:13,00:35:14,- You want to read about it?
00:35:14,00:35:16,'Cause it always is something so tiny
00:35:16,00:35:17,that you might want to notice.
00:35:17,00:35:19,"So you just, yeah, you want to get those all moments."
00:35:19,00:35:20,And the things that can't go wrong
00:35:20,00:35:21,are so strange and different.
00:35:21,00:35:24,But the point of that is that flying is incredibly safe.
00:35:24,00:35:27,And the point about it is that you're trying to say here.
00:35:27,00:35:28,Is it safe?
00:35:28,00:35:31,"- But that is true that every time something goes wrong,"
00:35:31,00:35:33,the airline and aviation industry
00:35:33,00:35:35,"is unbelievably good at absorbing the stakes,"
00:35:35,00:35:38,learning from them and implementing them for next time.
00:35:38,00:35:39,"- It tries to be not so much like,"
00:35:39,00:35:41,I'm not gonna tell anyone what happened
00:35:41,00:35:44,'cause I'll get in trouble 'cause I think they have a community
00:35:44,00:35:46,"of like, we will try and be as open as possible"
00:35:46,00:35:48,to stop it from happening again.
00:35:48,00:35:49,- Yeah.
00:35:49,00:35:50,Can I tell you something culturally
00:35:50,00:35:52,that British Airways gave us?
00:35:52,00:35:53,- Sure.
00:35:53,00:35:55,- Thanks to British Airways that basically
00:35:55,00:35:56,that we have the Beastie Boys.
00:35:56,00:35:57,- Beastie Boys?
00:35:57,00:35:59,So you'll know Nicelyt or Brooklyn?
00:35:59,00:36:00,Fight for your right party.
00:36:00,00:36:01,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:01,00:36:01,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:01,00:36:02,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:02,00:36:03,- We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:05,00:36:06,We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:06,00:36:07,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:07,00:36:08,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:08,00:36:09,- We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:40,00:36:42,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:42,00:36:43,- We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:47,00:36:48,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:48,00:36:49,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:49,00:36:50,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:50,00:36:51,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:51,00:36:52,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:52,00:36:53,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:53,00:36:54,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:54,00:36:55,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:55,00:36:56,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:56,00:36:57,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:57,00:36:58,- We know the Beastie Boys.
00:36:58,00:37:01,- We do the next 50 minutes in an Aussie accent.
00:37:01,00:37:03,- How's your Aussie accent?
00:37:03,00:37:04,- Terrible.
00:37:04,00:37:05,- It's always been horrific.
00:37:05,00:37:08,- So we should say you grew up in Sydney for a bit.
00:37:08,00:37:10,"- Well, yeah, it's just a couple of years."
00:37:10,00:37:11,"- Yeah, I was too."
00:37:11,00:37:12,But you had an Aussie accent?
00:37:12,00:37:13,- I had an Aussie accent.
00:37:13,00:37:16,I was desperate to fit in.
00:37:16,00:37:17,But I wasn't aware of it.
00:37:17,00:37:19,I had an Aussie accent then I couldn't ditch it.
00:37:19,00:37:21,- So what did you have before you had?
00:37:21,00:37:22,Because you were born and born?
00:37:22,00:37:23,- I had it.
00:37:23,00:37:26,I spoke like a presenter from the World Service circa 1950.
00:37:26,00:37:27,- Okay.
00:37:27,00:37:30,- Until I went to Australia and then started speaking like an Australian.
00:37:30,00:37:33,And then couldn't get rid of it for ages.
00:37:33,00:37:37,"And then when I started acting, it was a one accent I couldn't do for a very, very long time."
00:37:37,00:37:38,"- Oh, really?"
00:37:38,00:37:39,"- Yeah, because I couldn't hear it."
00:37:39,00:37:40,- That's interesting.
00:37:40,00:37:45,- But did you see the story that it was the most attractive accent to Americans?
00:37:45,00:37:46,- I can believe it.
00:37:46,00:37:47,- Sexiest?
00:37:47,00:37:48,- Yeah.
00:37:48,00:37:49,"- Smartest, most appealing."
00:37:49,00:37:51,I guess it's the least threatening accent is next.
00:37:51,00:37:52,Everything goes up at the end.
00:37:52,00:37:53,- Yes.
00:37:53,00:37:58,- And if you're throwing in sexy phrases like fair shake of the sauce bottle.
00:37:58,00:37:59,- Yeah.
00:37:59,00:38:00,- Was that being drunk?
00:38:00,00:38:03,"- No, that's just giving someone a fair crack at something."
00:38:03,00:38:06,"Kevin Rudd, who was PM from Australia."
00:38:06,00:38:11,- He used the phrase fair shake of the sauce bottle so much during the 2013 election
00:38:11,00:38:12,that it became a bit of a thing.
00:38:12,00:38:13,He was trying to be bloke in.
00:38:13,00:38:16,He also said fair suck of the pineapple.
00:38:16,00:38:19,"You've got to give people a fair suck of the pineapple, you know?"
00:38:19,00:38:20,- Yeah.
00:38:20,00:38:21,- Just these are wonderful phrases.
00:38:21,00:38:22,- Yeah.
00:38:22,00:38:26,I remember flying into Perth to do a film and they had a government sponsored billboard
00:38:26,00:38:29,"on the way from the airport saying, ""Don't be a bloody idiot."
00:38:29,00:38:30,"Don't drink and drive."""
00:38:30,00:38:31,"I said, ""Government."""
00:38:31,00:38:32,- Yeah.
00:38:32,00:38:33,- Yeah.
00:38:33,00:38:34,- Yeah.
00:38:34,00:38:35,"- Well, they're very good at that."
00:38:35,00:38:36,- Very good at swearing.
00:38:36,00:38:37,- Very good at swearing.
00:38:37,00:38:38,- Very good at swearing.
00:38:38,00:38:39,- Very good at swearing.
00:38:39,00:38:40,Very good at swearing.
00:38:40,00:38:41,Very good at swearing.
00:38:41,00:38:42,- Very good at swearing.
00:38:42,00:38:43,Very good at swearing.
00:38:43,00:38:45,Very good at being just a bit loose as high up as Prime Minister.
00:38:45,00:38:46,- Yeah.
00:38:46,00:38:50,"- Can I ask Andy this, the fact about they like it if you use Australian slang."
00:38:50,00:38:51,- Use their language.
00:38:51,00:38:52,- Yeah.
00:38:52,00:38:56,"- And it just found that using Australian slang is a pro, but only in an Aussie accent."
00:38:56,00:38:58,- So Australians like Australians?
00:38:58,00:38:59,"- Yeah, it sounds that way."
00:38:59,00:39:03,"- So people, Australians like people who speak with an Australian accent."
00:39:03,00:39:08,And then they like them additionally if they are able to a bit relaxed and use something.
00:39:08,00:39:13,"Because they, it's very, I remember hearing one, which was, ""I'm so hungry I could eat the"
00:39:13,00:39:15,"arse out of a low-flying pigeon."""
00:39:15,00:39:17,"- No, that's kind of great."
00:39:17,00:39:20,"- And again, was that Prime Minister who said that on?"
00:39:20,00:39:21,- Yeah.
00:39:21,00:39:25,"- And that's a sexy phrase that an American would find unbelievably attractive, you know?"
00:39:25,00:39:27,I'm as full as a stripper's dance card.
00:39:27,00:39:28,- Oh yeah.
00:39:28,00:39:29,- It's a nice one.
00:39:29,00:39:32,"But I'm not using an Aussie accent, so this doesn't endear me to any of our Aussie listeners."
00:39:32,00:39:33,"- No, it sounds like you're patronising."
00:39:33,00:39:34,- Which I do not.
00:39:34,00:39:36,- It sounds like you're taking the piss out of yourself.
00:39:36,00:39:37,- If you look at his face.
00:39:37,00:39:38,- I'm very dear to you.
00:39:38,00:39:39,"- Yeah, absolutely not."
00:39:39,00:39:44,- One person who pretended to have a Australian accent was Matthew McConaughey.
00:39:44,00:39:45,- Did he?
00:39:45,00:39:46,- Yeah.
00:39:46,00:39:47,- The actor?
00:39:47,00:39:48,- Yeah.
00:39:48,00:39:51,- But when he was acting or just pretended to be Australian on a train?
00:39:51,00:39:54,"- Well, he lived in Australia for a little while."
00:39:54,00:40:01,And then when he came back to America he decided to keep the accent because all Americans find the Australian accent sexy.
00:40:01,00:40:09,And the only real reason I bring it up is because Matthew McConaughey has a brother called Rooster who has two children.
00:40:09,00:40:14,One of them is called Margarita and the other one is called Miller Light.
00:40:14,00:40:15,- Okay.
00:40:15,00:40:16,- Miller Light.
00:40:16,00:40:17,- Miller Light McConaughey.
00:40:17,00:40:18,- Is that a beer?
00:40:18,00:40:19,- It's a beer.
00:40:19,00:40:29,And his brother got a lifetime supply of Miller Light when he named his child Miller Light McConaughey.
00:40:29,00:40:30,- Wow.
00:40:30,00:40:31,- Isn't that amazing?
00:40:31,00:40:32,- That is amazing.
00:40:32,00:40:34,"- Soft topic, but I love it."
00:40:34,00:40:38,"- A lot of these Australian phrases sound rude and I find this very interesting, but not all of them are."
00:40:38,00:40:45,"So I just like one of the following phrases I'm going to read out is rude, okay? To point the bone at someone."
00:40:45,00:40:49,"To bore it up, someone."
00:40:49,00:40:52,On the vage.
00:40:52,00:40:54,To asshole.
00:40:54,00:40:55,Dogging.
00:40:55,00:40:56,Stiff in the lizards.
00:40:56,00:40:58,Golden donut.
00:40:58,00:41:01,And to come the raw prawn.
00:41:01,00:41:02,Okay.
00:41:02,00:41:03,Only one of those is rude.
00:41:03,00:41:04,- Which one?
00:41:04,00:41:05,- Which one?
00:41:05,00:41:07,- The golden donut I'm going to go for.
00:41:07,00:41:08,- Okay.
00:41:08,00:41:09,- It's gone for the golden donut.
00:41:09,00:41:11,- Surely dogging means the same as it does here.
00:41:11,00:41:12,- Could do.
00:41:12,00:41:13,Could not.
00:41:13,00:41:14,- The raw prawn.
00:41:14,00:41:15,What's that one?
00:41:15,00:41:16,- To come the raw prawn?
00:41:16,00:41:17,- It's not.
00:41:17,00:41:20,- You're not in a good place if you're coming the raw prawn.
00:41:20,00:41:21,James is right.
00:41:21,00:41:22,- Is that the golden donut?
00:41:22,00:41:24,- The golden donut is like for the vagina.
00:41:24,00:41:27,"To come the raw prawn is simply to put something over on someone, to fool someone."
00:41:27,00:41:29,Don't come the raw prawn with me.
00:41:29,00:41:31,"And you said dogging, Sally?"
00:41:31,00:41:32,- Yeah.
00:41:32,00:41:33,- Just dingo hunting.
00:41:33,00:41:37,- To point the bone at someone is to put a jinx on them.
00:41:37,00:41:39,To bore it up someone is just to give them a walloping.
00:41:39,00:41:44,On the vage means according to the provisions of the vagrancy act.
00:41:44,00:41:45,Okay.
00:41:45,00:41:50,To us whole is to dismiss someone preemptorially.
00:41:50,00:41:53,And stiffen the lizards as an exclamation of surprise.
00:41:53,00:41:54,- Very clear.
00:41:54,00:41:56,- It's down the cries and stiffen the lizards.
00:41:56,00:41:57,- Yeah.
00:41:57,00:41:59,- You know the Aussie salute?
00:41:59,00:42:00,- Can I ask that?
00:42:00,00:42:01,- It's not rude.
00:42:01,00:42:02,It's just waving away flies.
00:42:02,00:42:03,- Oh yeah.
00:42:03,00:42:06,"- Well that's the, there's an old theory."
00:42:06,00:42:11,I think we've covered this on fish where that's how the modern Aussie accent developed.
00:42:11,00:42:16,Because there were so many flies that the way you would talk to each other was with your teeth closed
00:42:16,00:42:18,so that you wouldn't get any in your mouth.
00:42:18,00:42:20,And that's where the Aussie accent came from.
00:42:20,00:42:21,- Oh yeah.
00:42:21,00:42:22,- Yeah.
00:42:22,00:42:28,- And actually where it came from is a load of people came over from Britain in 200 years ago.
00:42:28,00:42:33,And it's quite similar to the Cockney accent around that time.
00:42:33,00:42:36,But also loads of people went to Australia at the same time.
00:42:36,00:42:39,Most of them were cockneys but there were people from other places.
00:42:39,00:42:43,And then over the years like the kids would hang out together
00:42:43,00:42:46,and they had to sort of understand what each other was saying
00:42:46,00:42:50,because actually accents were quite intelligible back in those days.
00:42:50,00:42:54,And eventually after one or two generations it's called leveling.
00:42:54,00:42:59,"All the kids start talking the same way. And then all the adults, well they grow up and then many kids do."
00:42:59,00:43:00,- Yeah right.
00:43:00,00:43:01,- This kind of evolution isn't it?
00:43:01,00:43:05,- Yeah kind of but it's like a forced evolution and it's quite a quick evolution.
00:43:05,00:43:10,"- With them, it's not to do Australia but with gendered speech patterns."
00:43:10,00:43:15,"Remember reading this study, I mean again a long time ago, but it says probably been more complex thought about it since."
00:43:15,00:43:23,But that male children and female children had the same speech patterns until they went to nursery.
00:43:23,00:43:26,And then they started declaring themselves with their speech patterns.
00:43:26,00:43:27,- Yeah.
00:43:27,00:43:28,- Which is kind of interesting.
00:43:28,00:43:34,"And so women like me, ape male speech patterns to seem intelligent."
00:43:34,00:43:36,"Which is sort of wrong, isn't it?"
00:43:36,00:43:40,And I didn't realise I did this until I read the study but you know have a slightly lower voice
00:43:40,00:43:42,and I sort of aping male speech patterns.
00:43:42,00:43:46,- Really? And it has been found that men and women if you make your voice lower
00:43:46,00:43:48,you are more successful on average in life.
00:43:48,00:43:49,- Really?
00:43:49,00:43:51,"- And that's what they did to Margaret, that's just it."
00:43:51,00:43:55,"- Yeah, there is no such thing as society."
00:43:55,00:44:00,There are individual men and women and there are families.
00:44:00,00:44:01,- Yeah.
00:44:01,00:44:02,- She didn't speak like that before.
00:44:02,00:44:03,- No.
00:44:03,00:44:04,- So Erin.
00:44:04,00:44:05,"- That was her podcast, wasn't it?"
00:44:05,00:44:06,"- No, she didn't."
00:44:06,00:44:07,"- No, she didn't."
00:44:07,00:44:12,- We have children who are three and a bit older.
00:44:12,00:44:17,"Have your kids started talking like Bluey, the cartoon character from Australia."
00:44:17,00:44:18,- Oh.
00:44:18,00:44:23,- And there is a lot of every now and then you see articles in the newspapers of saying
00:44:23,00:44:27,all our kids have started talking like Bluey now.
00:44:27,00:44:32,Similarly about 10 years ago everyone's kids were talking like Pingu or like the Teletubbies.
00:44:32,00:44:33,- Or Peppa Pig.
00:44:33,00:44:34,- Or Peppa Pig.
00:44:34,00:44:35,- Yeah.
00:44:35,00:44:36,"- Yes, I mean, no."
00:44:36,00:44:37,- No.
00:44:37,00:44:38,- No.
00:44:38,00:44:43,"- But what people are finding that their kids are using Aussie slang, especially in America."
00:44:43,00:44:47,So they'll say rubbish instead of garbage or whatever.
00:44:47,00:44:48,- Are you on the veg?
00:44:48,00:44:49,That kind of thing.
00:44:49,00:44:53,It's the golden donut for me.
00:44:53,00:44:59,"- But actually according to linguists, kids very early, like certainly by the time they're"
00:44:59,00:45:04,"three years old, can tell the difference between the way that a character is speaking and"
00:45:04,00:45:06,the way that their family and friends speak.
00:45:06,00:45:11,"So if they are talking a little bit like Bluey or Pingu or Teletubbies or Peppa Pig,"
00:45:11,00:45:13,they're doing it knowing that that's a character.
00:45:13,00:45:17,"I think it's a register rather than the way they're speaking forever now, because otherwise just"
00:45:17,00:45:19,all British children would speak in American.
00:45:19,00:45:23,There's so much American media consumed that you would just absolutely.
00:45:23,00:45:27,"- That's why there's such a push to have home, grey and children's programming."
00:45:27,00:45:28,- Right.
00:45:28,00:45:30,"- That's a, you know, political thing."
00:45:30,00:45:31,- Yeah.
00:45:31,00:45:32,- Yeah.
00:45:32,00:45:33,- In all different countries.
00:45:33,00:45:38,"- I think the idea of this kind of turn of phrase from Australia, the international grab"
00:45:38,00:45:44,"onto it, really comes down to, in my opinion, one generation of Aussies that moved over here."
00:45:44,00:45:48,"And that's Barry Humphreys, that's Germaine Greer, it's Clive James."
00:45:48,00:45:51,And then I'm going to add Paul Hogan into that as well.
00:45:51,00:45:56,Because I think Paul Hogan more than anyone really turned Australia into a tourist destination
00:45:56,00:46:01,"through the advert campaign with put a shrimp on the barbie, which is a phrase that's still used"
00:46:01,00:46:04,"to this day, even though in Australia it's called prawns, right?"
00:46:04,00:46:09,So it was Americanifying the term that we would use in Australia.
00:46:09,00:46:12,But I was really about Paul Hogan because I didn't really know his story.
00:46:12,00:46:16,So Paul Hogan is Crocodile Dundee for those who don't know his real name.
00:46:16,00:46:18,He used to work on the Sydney Harbor Bridge.
00:46:18,00:46:21,He was a rigor on the Sydney Harbor Bridge while it was being constructed.
00:46:21,00:46:26,And the reason he became famous is there was a show in Australia called New Faces.
00:46:26,00:46:29,"And he decided, yeah, he decided he was going to enter."
00:46:29,00:46:32,So he did as a tap dancing knife thrower.
00:46:32,00:46:35,Now he neither knew how to tap dance or throw knives.
00:46:35,00:46:38,Were they poo knives?
00:46:38,00:46:40,"No, no, no."
00:46:40,00:46:43,Because I would watch that and pretend it's got talent.
00:46:43,00:46:46,Someone threw poo knives in Southern California.
00:46:46,00:46:48,Yeah.
00:46:48,00:46:51,"He basically created, he's got a knife."
00:46:51,00:46:52,That's a lot of knife.
00:46:52,00:46:53,Give me one second.
00:46:53,00:47:01,"Yeah, he faked it."
00:47:01,00:47:04,"He did the audition and they said, let us see the act."
00:47:04,00:47:06,"And he said, it's a pretty dangerous act."
00:47:06,00:47:07,I'll have to do it on the night.
00:47:07,00:47:09,But roughly this is what I'll be doing.
00:47:09,00:47:10,"And they went, that sounds great."
00:47:10,00:47:11,Come on.
00:47:11,00:47:14,"And so he made it to main TV, which was live at the time."
00:47:14,00:47:15,And that was his first break.
00:47:15,00:47:16,Did he do it?
00:47:16,00:47:17,No.
00:47:17,00:47:18,He didn't know how to do any of it.
00:47:18,00:47:19,"Well, happened."
00:47:19,00:47:20,He threw the knives at the ground.
00:47:20,00:47:21,He made fun of the judges.
00:47:21,00:47:26,"And this Aussie, which came out of him, because he became a big comedian in Australia."
00:47:26,00:47:27,And were you there then?
00:47:27,00:47:28,Do you remember that?
00:47:28,00:47:29,"No, no, no."
00:47:29,00:47:30,I know.
00:47:30,00:47:31,You must see how much younger I was.
00:47:31,00:47:32,I don't think I was even born at that point.
00:47:32,00:47:33,No.
00:47:33,00:47:34,Yeah.
00:47:34,00:47:35,Just one more thing about slang in general.
00:47:35,00:47:38,So we mentioned earlier that people don't like sometimes being a dictionary.
00:47:38,00:47:40,So there was a survey in 2014.
00:47:40,00:47:46,"And more than half of people said it wasn't appropriate for words like ""yolo"" to be in the dictionary."
00:47:46,00:47:47,Right?
00:47:47,00:47:48,But I just love this.
00:47:48,00:47:49,This was I think a Yuga thing.
00:47:49,00:47:53,In order to survey people's knowledge of slang terms.
00:47:53,00:47:56,"They had to ask them, do you know what this slang term means?"
00:47:56,00:47:58,And they had to come up with alternatives of what these words might mean.
00:47:58,00:47:59,OK.
00:47:59,00:48:07,"So ""yolo"", 9% of people surveyed thought it was a yoghurt made with caramel and chocolate."
00:48:07,00:48:12,"Cray, 15% thought it was having a strong or unpleasant smell of fish."
00:48:12,00:48:13,Brilliant.
00:48:13,00:48:14,"Great fish, nothing."
00:48:14,00:48:15,And it's crazy.
00:48:15,00:48:16,We should say for...
00:48:16,00:48:17,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:48:17,00:48:18,When it doesn't know that.
00:48:18,00:48:22,"Man's Plane, as Dan just did, about the meaning of Cray."
00:48:22,00:48:26,28% thought that was a man who was especially played.
00:48:26,00:48:29,Man's Plane still describes me.
00:48:29,00:48:32,"And finally, I loved this one."
00:48:32,00:48:40,3% of people thought the Bank of Mum and Dad is a place where Siemens is kept in cold storage for use in artificial insemination.
00:48:40,00:48:42,"This was multi-guess, right?"
00:48:42,00:48:43,They gave them options.
00:48:43,00:48:44,They gave them two options.
00:48:44,00:48:47,So 97% got the Bank of Mum and Dad right.
00:48:47,00:48:49,But 3% thought it was the old sperm free.
00:48:49,00:48:51,But it was the witty people who wrote the thing.
00:48:51,00:48:52,"Yeah, I know."
00:48:52,00:48:53,Just lovely.
00:48:53,00:48:54,Isn't that great?
00:48:54,00:48:57,Do you know what the slang term to swallow a dick means?
00:48:57,00:49:00,"Not any more, this was 18th century."
00:49:00,00:49:01,A 19th century.
00:49:01,00:49:02,Is it Aussie or just General?
00:49:02,00:49:03,It's British actually.
00:49:03,00:49:05,You've asked this before.
00:49:05,00:49:07,It relates to something else we've said today.
00:49:07,00:49:09,Be Dad on a plane.
00:49:09,00:49:11,The other one.
00:49:11,00:49:13,The other one.
00:49:13,00:49:14,"Mary and Webster, the dictionary."
00:49:14,00:49:15,Yeah.
00:49:15,00:49:16,It's all a dictionary.
00:49:16,00:49:17,It's all the English.
00:49:17,00:49:19,It's someone who knows lots of long words.
00:49:19,00:49:21,Or uses lots of long words.
00:49:21,00:49:24,They've swallowed the dick.
00:49:24,00:49:26,Do you have a favourite Aussie ism?
00:49:26,00:49:30,"Australian actors, they say happy to be here, easy to work with."
00:49:30,00:49:34,"So when things get really bad, you say happy to be here, easy to work with."
00:49:34,00:49:36,You don't complain about anything.
00:49:36,00:49:37,"Yeah, too easy mate."
00:49:37,00:49:39,I think the mentality is completely fantastic.
00:49:39,00:49:40,Yeah.
00:49:40,00:49:43,And that's what I was thinking last year when I was ever thinking this is actually the best place.
00:49:43,00:49:49,"You know, when the whole world looks like it's going tits up and there's so much sort of fear and threat of war."
00:49:49,00:49:51,Australia is such a positive place.
00:49:51,00:49:56,Like it's having such a moment of fashion and film and it's a nice safe place to be.
00:49:56,00:49:59,I would say that that generally speaking is true.
00:49:59,00:50:03,But you want to try mispronouncing some of their place names on the popular podcast.
00:50:03,00:50:04,I am.
00:50:04,00:50:07,They suddenly that easygoing attitude just disappears.
00:50:07,00:50:14,"Okay, that is it."

00:50:34,00:50:35,Yes.
00:50:35,00:50:37,Because I was once in a show.
00:50:37,00:50:43,They had the word smack in the title rather than because I take smack.
00:50:43,00:50:46,Or like being smacked.
00:50:46,00:50:49,I should change that.
00:50:49,00:50:50,I don't know.
