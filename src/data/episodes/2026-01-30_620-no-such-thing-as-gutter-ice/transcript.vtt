00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.280
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.340
 of Fish, Dan, and James here.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.960
 We're just very excited to let you know

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.520
 about our guest this week 'cause it's a classic.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.760
 - Absolutely, we're most excited 'cause Andy isn't here,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.720
 but we are excited about our guest,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.600
 who was the incredible, wonderful Sally Phillips.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.320
 The great thing about Sally is she came on the show,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.760
 she's got nothing to plug.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.320
 I mean, you could Google her and find out everything about her,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.680
 but she just came on because she loves knowledge.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.640
 She loves the research period.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.320
 I think she prefers the research part

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.600
 to actually do the show.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.080
 She just goes down all these incredible rabbit holes

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.200
 and she's just the best person to podcast with.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.920
 - I know, she came into the office saying,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.320
 I'm so sorry I haven't had any time to do research

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.720
 for the show, she had more notes than any of us.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.760
 She had like 20 pages, sure.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.960
 They were in size 25 font, but they were there.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.480
 She does her stuff.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.720
 - The show is really, really fun.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.880
 I'm absolutely certain you're gonna win Choyette.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.560
 If you would like to hear more,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.080
 then you could go to Patreon.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.000
 If you'd like to Patreon.com/nosesingsafish,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.680
 you could join one of our tiers

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.800
 and the middle tier will have an Excel version of this show,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.080
 which I can exclusively reveal.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.000
 It has an incredible anecdote about Bob Martimer in it

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.720
 that there was no space for in this edit.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.600
 - But also, you can just join our Patreon for free.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.640
 And if you do that this week,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.160
 you're gonna find a little bonus video.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.160
 It is of Sally taking a Bible and predicting our fortunes.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.240
 It was nuts.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.080
 It's really fun.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.600
 You can watch that there now.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.880
 So go check that out.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.120
 And if you want to follow Sally, she's on Instagram.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.800
 So follow @sallysmack.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.520
 She's always doing amazing projects.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.520
 She's always in brilliant TV shows and brilliant movies.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 She's just awesome.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120
 So go say hi there, but enjoy her here now.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.480
 Or no such thing as a fish.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.240
 Okay, I'm with the episode.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.560
 - I'm with the podcast.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.360
 (playful music)

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.360
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:10.080
 as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.960
 from the QI offices in Hobern.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.080
 My name is Dan Triber.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.480
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.000
 James Harkin, and Sally Phillips.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.680
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.160
 And in no particular order,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.920
 here we go, starting with fact number one.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.240
 And that is Sally.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.880
 - Well, I've been interested in Greenland

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.960
 for obvious reasons this week,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.280
 and I came across a fact that Greenlanders

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.680
 start their new year countdown,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.680
 14,410 seconds before midnight.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.000
 (laughing)

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.840
 - Brilliant.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.840
 - Well, you've got to make the time pass somehow.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.040
 I imagine it's pretty cold and dark for a long time.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.120
 And so that'll be a fun evening's activity.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.880
 And that is because they currently are attached

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.200
 part of the Kingdom of Denmark,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.760
 and Denmark celebrates midnight several hours before them.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.000
 And so if they attach to the United States,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 they would be celebrating midnight at midnight and at 3 a.m.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.840
 - Oh, right.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.200
 - They have to do Pacific Eastern Central and Hawaii.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.640
 - Well, I've looked up Washington.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.480
 How long would it be?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.840
 - Three hours from Washington.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.640
 - It's not a good reason not to do it.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.320
 We don't need any more reasons,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.320
 but this new year thing is not dissimilar

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.760
 to what I'm currently doing,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.440
 which is the fake new year at 8 p.m. for all the kids.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.480
 - And then you do the 12 p.m.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.420
 and it's probably not too dissimilar

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.360
 at time difference.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.200
 - I will say, Sally,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.200
 it's quite risky doing a section on Greenland,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.080
 because we did a section on Venezuela several weeks ago

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.360
 with Michael Palin.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.760
 And then soon afterwards,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.600
 at the unpleasant disaster.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.360
 - We're just working our way through all the new states,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.200
 aren't we, of America?

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.280
 (laughing)

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.760
 - Yeah, I find it really fascinating that he said,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.760
 he said, "Yeah, it's about the oil."

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.480
 But they've got access to the oil

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.680
 and they're not taking it out.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.160
 So we know it isn't about,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.280
 if he says it's about the oil, it's not about the oil, right?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.400
 So what is it about?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.960
 Is it about the fact that everything's gonna melt

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.760
 in which case it's gonna be a better place to be?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.480
 - There's a good theory.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.320
 - What's that?

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.120
 - That it's about the Mercato projection.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.640
 Yeah, the problem is,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.400
 what's that? - So the Mercato,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.160
 if you look at a flat map of the globe,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.600
 things that are further from the equator look bigger.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.480
 So there's no doubt Greenland is extremely big.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.320
 - Oh, that's funny.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.320
 - It's extremely big Greenland.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320
 - The biggest island in the world,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.400
 if you're not counting Australia.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.840
 - No, well, that's not an island.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.680
 - Right, yeah, yeah.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.480
 - Yeah, that's a continent, that's the tiniest continent.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.160
 - So it's the biggest, so Greenland's the biggest island

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.240
 in the world. - So it's the biggest island.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.320
 - Without caveats.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.320
 But basically the problem is,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.480
 it looks 12 times bigger than it is.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.640
 Like really, it looks, yeah, yeah.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.760
 And it's all because the Mercato projection

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.960
 is a very good way of making a 3D object flat,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.880
 you know, rendering it in a flat form.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.840
 And it's thanks to a Flemish cartographer

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.320
 called Gerardus Mercato from several centuries ago.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.000
 - It looks as big as Africa on a flat map.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.200
 It's really not, you know, it is big,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.320
 but it's nowhere near as big as it looks.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.360
 I mean, it looks almost as big as North America.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.040
 So what we need to do is change the map immediately

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.320
 to make it look a bit more accurate.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.560
 - It's bigger than Mexico, so it is big.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.400
 - It's big.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.800
 - And it means that Denmark is the biggest country

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.280
 that's wholly in Europe.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.480
 So that's always a fun, quick question.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.200
 It's like, apart from Russia,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.320
 which is partly in Asia,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.440
 what's the biggest country in Europe and it's Denmark,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.600
 even though it looks small because it has this huge battery.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.480
 - That's great, yeah, that's very interesting.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.320
 - But hasn't it, it has belonged to America before?

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.160
 Or?

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.440
 - Greenland, no.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.800
 I thought it was Eric the Red and then--

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.720
 - Well, he was actually a landic.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.680
 So he was expelled from Iceland for manslaughter.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.240
 And the idea is that he called it Greenland

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.920
 to lure people there,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.680
 because he thought that if he called it Greenland,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.520
 people would want to go there.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.360
 - More tourist would come.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.200
 Isn't it great that there still exists

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.160
 on the map of the world, a joke, a prank?

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.000
 Isn't that great?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.360
 - Yeah, well, that's really, that's really, really interesting.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.520
 - James, have you been there?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.160
 - No, I haven't, I'd love to go one day a bit tight

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.320
 on the few times, but yeah, it's just tricky to get to

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.520
 from here, as Nick, 'cause you have to go to Denmark

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.680
 and then go back over.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.880
 - Yes, right.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.720
 - I'd love to go over.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.920
 It claimed on the internet that in your traditions

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.840
 coming back, one is to towing your face

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.200
 when you get your first period.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.040
 - Okay.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.920
 - Oh, a specific kind of tattoo, or--

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.960
 - A specific, yeah, dots between the eyes,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.120
 that kind of thing, and childbirth, every child you have,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.320
 and those traditions are coming back.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.880
 And what was the other ingredient?

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.800
 Oh yeah, washing your hair with urine.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.560
 And I obviously was attracted by that fact.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.480
 (laughing)

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.760
 I went after that, and I found that James Cracknell's wife,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.840
 Beverly has been online to--

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.680
 - The roller.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.520
 - Beverly Turner.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.240
 - Yeah, Beverly Turner.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.640
 I've been online going, yeah, I'm doing that.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.480
 That's great.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.440
 I'm just getting to the show and washing my hair

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.640
 with a cup full of pee, and lots of people swear by it.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.480
 - Is that true?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.400
 - Yeah, that's so much so that the Icelandic company,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.080
 no, not company, students, Icelandic students,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.200
 have made a hard, a bar shampoo out of cow urine.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.200
 - Wow.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.760
 - So it has ammonia, right, so it could be--

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.600
 - It's ammonia.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.840
 - For sure, it could bleach your hair.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.160
 That was going to be my question, though.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.640
 Is she doing it with animal or family?

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.800
 - Her own urine.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.640
 - Right.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.760
 And so there's quite a lot of people out there doing it,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.320
 and I came across the word urine munger, which I was like,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.720
 so thrilled to know existed, from Peeps's diary,

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.240
 where obviously urine was a commodity,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.520
 because it was used for tanning animal hides,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.280
 but also for bleaching, you know what it was.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.120
 - Of course it was, of course it was.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.880
 - For you for bleaching clothes,

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.720
 as they used to put a big bucket outside the textile manufacturer's

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.280
 house with people to piss in on the way back from the pub,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.320
 because it was a fixative for dye.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.360
 So if you were making very fancy clothes for queens and stuff,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.560
 you would only use newborn baby piss.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.720
 - Oh, come on.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.640
 - That makes sense.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.920
 - This is what the internet says.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.640
 Just prove me wrong, guys, prove me wrong.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.400
 - I think we have the same sources, 'cause we do the fact

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.440
 ages ago, remember about how the urine of redheads

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.440
 would be used in stained glass window,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.960
 because it had magical properties,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.200
 and it would just last longer.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.040
 - Oh really?

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.360
 - When you say we did a fact.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.200
 (laughing)

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.360
 - But newborn babies produce very little.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.080
 - I know, well, I imagine that made it all more expensive.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.920
 - Exactly.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.240
 - It's a client demand.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.400
 - It's a client demand.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.600
 - That was quite a rabbit hole.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.280
 Sally, you have to say it was wonderful.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.200
 - There's a thing that they're exporting from Greenland to Dubai.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:30.080
 Yeah, which is ice for their ice cubes, for their cocktails.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.720
 So there's a startup company in Greenland that say

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.160
 that they have the purest of ice that you can possibly get.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.760
 Black ice, they call it.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.520
 It's where you go, it's where you go.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.360
 (laughing)

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.480
 - It sounds like it's got grits in it.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.320
 - The purest ice possible, black ice.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.400
 - I know, it's a Greenland situation again, it's a prank.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.160
 It melts slower, apparently.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.840
 - Oh yeah. - It's part of the marketing I read.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.480
 And they say it's quite environmentally friendly.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.320
 Is there a pitch?

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.640
 - Oh yeah, 'cause it doesn't sound like it.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.040
 - Not many people have the pitch.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.640
 This is clearly the worst thing we could be doing.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.880
 We're gonna sail our diesel boat out to a...

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.680
 - Well, here's the thing, Greenland has to import a lot of stuff

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.160
 by boat, by diesel boat, right?

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.440
 So you're sending in full boats, but you're leaving with nothing.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.120
 So they're saying at least you're leaving with ice.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.720
 And so we're making money off of that.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.880
 So they're saying at least these boats

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.600
 are making the return journey full.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.800
 - But the ice thing, they have that in Sweden as well.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.920
 I mean, the ice bar in Stockholm,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.280
 they have a whole thing about where the ice has come from

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.840
 and ice mining.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.200
 - Yeah, I've had the water from ice bugs in Iceland.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.200
 In fact, like they sold it in the air pot.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.160
 - You only feed your cat a melted ice bag water, don't you?

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.960
 - It's environmentally friendly though, so that's good.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.200
 You leave my cat out of this.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.920
 - We've heard icicles from our blocked gutters this week.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.040
 - As you move, you've been selling them too.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.880
 - Thank you, here you go.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.720
 - Badly turner.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.400
 - Sally Phillips is gutter water.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.640
 - Sally Phillips is gutter ice.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.560
 I think it's something you've been selling.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.160
 - 'Cause like the delivered roof drivers

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.720
 go into your house with a pizza.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.640
 You might as well leave with something, right?

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.280
 - Exactly, exactly.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.040
 - So Greenland has a great history of explorers.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.400
 There's a guy who I obsessed with who was called Peter Freikin

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.240
 and he did a lot of early exploration with the Inuit.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.440
 He was Icelandic and so he would go over there

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.080
 and he lived there and he married someone from there,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.360
 had two kids there.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.120
 And he's quite notable because of a story

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.720
 that he wrote about in his book where he was caught in a storm.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.960
 There was a bit of an avalanche of where he was sleeping

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.920
 and he had to get out of the burrow he was in

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.080
 using Poo Knife, right?

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.920
 - Poo Knife.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.880
 - Yeah, now this has been debunked.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.920
 - That is not possible, that's the idea.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.240
 - It is a pig when you have to tell me.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.720
 - Yeah, the idea is Sally what it sounds like.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.560
 Sally, I'm afraid to say.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.400
 - Why do you need a knife?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.200
 - So he's stuck in sight.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.520
 - Oh, it's not exactly what it sounds like then.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.240
 (laughing)

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.080
 - It's like a fish knife.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.240
 Yeah, slightly different shape to better serve it.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.920
 - It's so embarrassing when you accidentally use

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.480
 a Poo Knife to eat your mellad.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.840
 (laughing)

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.200
 - So it's to get Poo out of animals.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.800
 - No, so he's stuck underneath the snow.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.920
 It's really hard packed, he couldn't get out.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.120
 So he had this idea, what if I poo,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.920
 and then what if I let it freeze,

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.440
 and then what if I then use it as a knife,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.880
 as a tool, as an instrument to get out of here?

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.960
 And so that's the story that he wrote down in his book.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.120
 And it's been questioned by certain members

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.360
 of this podcast and the general scientific community.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.360
 (laughing)

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.080
 And they've shown in recreations

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.840
 that you couldn't possibly do that.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.400
 However, I looked into his story.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.920
 - I loved that there was a recreation.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.760
 - Yeah.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.200
 - I wanted to make a movie of the recreation.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.040
 - It was like 127 hours, it's really exciting.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.320
 Well, that's the thing.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.400
 When you read the whole story,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.000
 you realize this surely can't be a lie.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.560
 Surely this man did it because he was in this hole,

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.040
 he was sleeping that night while this storm was raging

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.320
 on the head of a bear that he had killed a few days ago.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.320
 - This can't be untrue, right?

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.680
 And then, as he was trying to get out

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.240
 after having made his poo knife,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.520
 his beard got wet from all of the exertion he was giving.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.600
 It got really sweaty, and it went on the rails of his sled

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.040
 and got stuck to it.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.000
 So he had to rip the beard off his face

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.320
 in order to get out as well.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.120
 So this is a guy using a cut, why didn't he pull a razor?

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.400
 (laughing)

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.280
 - Is it early 3D printer?

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.600
 (laughing)

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:43.360
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.040
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Miriam Webster

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.200
 has a collection of cards of all words

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.280
 in the English language spelled backwards.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.200
 - It's fantastic.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.840
 - Oh, wow.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.720
 Interesting. - Interesting.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.000
 - Well, that's the question, isn't it?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.240
 Why would you need it?

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.080
 - Yeah.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.280
 - You guys have researched it, right?

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.400
 - You had a theory done when James first told us

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.520
 this headline fact, and I liked it so much.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.160
 - Oh, was it for ambulances?

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160
 - For ambulances.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.840
 (laughing)

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.800
 - They've got it backwards, so yeah.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.600
 And we never really fleshed out the theory in that.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.800
 To clarify exactly how it was useful to know.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.240
 - No, so this is according to Miriam Webster,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.320
 they have these things.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.800
 And what it is is if someone sends you a query

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.280
 about how many words are there ending phobia?

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.280
 Or what are the only three words in English that end G-R-Y?

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.440
 - Yes.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.160
 - So people would send these questions to them.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.800
 So there's quite a famous sort of puzzle,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.000
 which is there are three words in English language

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.560
 ending in G-R-Y, hungry and angry.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.400
 - Two of them.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.840
 - Yeah, you got me two.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.920
 - What is the third word?

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.400
 - Hungry.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.480
 - Hungry was not in the English language.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.360
 It might be soon.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.800
 In actual fact, it's a trick.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.600
 So it begins, there are three words in the English language.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.440
 And the trick is that the answer is the third word is language

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.600
 in the English language.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.440
 - Oh, yes, yes.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.240
 - So that was the, when you're kids,

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.680
 that's the kind of trick they do, right?

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.200
 In actual fact, there are other words.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.840
 - Language doesn't end G-R-Y, I've got very confused.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.440
 - I know, I know.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.160
 It's like a school child.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.520
 - Sorry.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.720
 - Riddle, but there is a word and hungry,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.760
 used by Shakespeare, which I guess means not hungry,

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.880
 as in Correlayness.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.720
 He, O-E-D also has Magri, Pugri and Iguri.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.560
 - Oh, no, no, no.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.400
 - Okay, no, no.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.240
 - Not that common.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.240
 - What do any of those mean?

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.880
 - Magri means in spite of, Pugri is a type of Indian scarf

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.240
 and Iguri is an Egyptian word meaning "curry up".

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.000
 - Yeah, Magri, that's French, isn't it?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.120
 Meaning in spite of.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.960
 - Of course.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.800
 - Oh, there you go.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.720
 - No fake echoes of school.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.280
 - It feels like it comes from there.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.120
 So, they would get these questions every single week

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.560
 and they would need to be able to answer them.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.560
 And so, they came up with these 315,000 slips of paper

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.960
 with backward words and they're in 129 boxes.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.560
 And they're still there in the basement of Million Webster.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.400
 - Do you know what I quite like?

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.200
 There would be a few words that you'd go,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.920
 ah, they got that wrong.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.440
 Like wolf, for example, which is actually flow backwards, right?

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.840
 - Oh, I see.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.800
 So, I believe this is in the wrong box.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.240
 - Exactly, so these are called anodromes

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.400
 and it's an anodrome is where the word is another word backwards

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.960
 and we've got over 900 of those,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.280
 supposedly in the English language.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.280
 So, you would constantly come across

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.120
 like those ones.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.960
 - Like that is not.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.800
 - Yes.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.680
 - Evil and live.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.200
 - Is another example, yes.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.320
 - Marion Webster, by the way,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.600
 is basically the American dictionary, isn't it?

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.440
 - Yeah.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.280
 - Yes, it's the biggie.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.120
 I don't know.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.920
 Obviously, I'm an OED guy, you know?

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.200
 Well, I email Susie Dent and ask her if we have the same thing

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.680
 at the OED and she chat with her colleagues

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.160
 and said that they don't have it.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.080
 She said it was a nice idea, but these days,

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.680
 'cause we have digital dictionaries

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.840
 and now AI can find all these things in a few seconds,

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.480
 they're probably not gonna start it now.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.320
 - Shame.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.440
 'Cause it's good for rhyming as well.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.280
 Rhyming dictionaries.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.200
 - I look at them all the time when they're online.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.320
 Yeah, I do, a lot.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.840
 When I'm writing, yeah, I do.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.880
 - Marion Webster, by the way, so founded by Webster Brothers,

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.480
 but Noah Webster being the biggest character of that group

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.440
 and the one who really did most of the work on it,

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.440
 fascinating life.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.000
 He was a huge impact in America.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.920
 He's sort of silently a founding father

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.720
 that doesn't really get mentioned much.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.240
 For example, Alexander Hamilton

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.080
 and him worked closely on the Federalist paper

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.280
 and he was in New York City because of Hamilton,

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.800
 but he doesn't appear as far as I can tell in that story

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.920
 or maybe he does.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.760
 - I don't know.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.200
 - But he would have been useful for all the rhymes

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.040
 in the rap.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.440
 - That's what I thought, like this guy's,

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.240
 this guy probably taught this guy to rap.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.000
 (laughing)

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.600
 - That these cards were the work of another guy

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.640
 called Philip Babcock Gove,

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.720
 who worked on the third Webster's dictionary.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.440
 And he was quite controversial

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.640
 because he wanted to put slang in the dictionary

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.760
 and until then you didn't really have slang in dictionaries.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.200
 And he basically listed almost all the populist werewords

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.880
 apart from the really, really strongest ones.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.080
 - It was controversial.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.560
 And the whole point about dictionaries

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.240
 is they're describing the way languages used

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.400
 rather than what you want to be in the dictionary

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400
 or what the appropriate.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.840
 - Are they more prescriptive or descriptive dictionaries?

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.320
 - Yeah, these days they're descriptive.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.200
 - But they used to be prescriptive.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.360
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.640
 And I was reading about the life of a lexicographer

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.400
 and what it's like.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.080
 You know how senior you are as a lexicographer

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.000
 depending on what words you're working on.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.920
 So... - Wow.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.880
 - As you get more senior and more practice.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.160
 - Get longer words. - No.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.520
 - Short words. - Short words.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.000
 - Really hard ones to do. - Really hard ones to do.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.200
 - Are small words which can have many meanings.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.360
 - It's easy to know what a zylophone is.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.680
 - Right. - But what does "as" mean?

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.440
 - Precisely. - So there's a lexicographer

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.320
 called Corey Stamper.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.200
 - Yeah, no, oh. - You know what?

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.840
 Yes, we can go shatter.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.600
 (laughing)

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.400
 There's someone, there's a lexicographer

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.400
 called Emily Brewster, who found a new meaning for the word "ah."

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.960
 And that was a big deal.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.800
 (laughing)

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.800
 Do you know what it was? - I do.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.040
 So it's when you're using "a" to mean a function word

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.640
 before a proper noun to show that a condition

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.680
 is new or unusual.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.560
 I'm gonna explain what I mean.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.480
 So after the recording was over,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.240
 a furious Schreiber challenged Harkin, right?

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.560
 Now what that would be is to show that Dan is not normally

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.640
 furious.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.840
 A furious Schreiber, it's using it in that sense

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.400
 to show that a condition is new or unusual.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.000
 - Right, yeah. - That is a huge sense of the word "a."

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.840
 Wow. - I know.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.680
 And that's a--

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.520
 - Well, it's not a new sense.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.080
 It's a new writing down of a sense.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.160
 - What's a new meaning?

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.960
 - I think that's always been used, right?

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.360
 - Take it up with Emily Brewster.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.200
 - That's always been used.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.320
 She's just classified it. - She's nailed it.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.800
 - But run in 2013 and OED lexicographer

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.120
 did the word run and it took him nine months.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.840
 - Yeah, it's just how it would have taken to do walk.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.680
 - Yeah.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.960
 (laughing)

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.840
 - With that, that's, yeah, the word God, for example,

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.920
 Miriam Webster had to revise that for a different

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.840
 and on a bridge version of their dictionary.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.640
 And the person, I think it was Corey Stamper, what's her name?

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.480
 - She spent four months talking to everyone

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.320
 about what that word could possibly mean.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.280
 She also did the word take, which took her a month.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.000
 And she said it's so annoying because no one's ever

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.080
 gonna really read it.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.320
 So it's just there, it's the, yeah.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.800
 - That's true because when you look in a dictionary,

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.440
 you wanna look up a word in the dictionary.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.240
 Usually it's a word that you've never heard of.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.480
 You don't really want to know all the different meanings

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.200
 of the word, ah, do you?

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.560
 - I have to read people, right?

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.840
 As reading dictionaries every day, have you?

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.880
 - Well, I've read the, the OED.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.040
 Yeah, we used to do it for QI all the time.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.400
 Like when those a new letter came up on QI,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.120
 it would be someone's job off and Andy, actually,

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.840
 you would go through them the first of the last.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.120
 Right, down I'll do the dictionary.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.960
 - That's quite a play, isn't it?

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.800
 I've read the dictionary.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.880
 The Bible.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.040
 - It's quite fun to read the shorter letters,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.600
 like your J's and your K's.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.080
 They're a bit shorter in the dictionary.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.640
 And you know, how tricky a series of QI was gonna be

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.040
 by how short it was because there's almost nothing

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.320
 that begins with J, it's quite a,

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.720
 because it's a late letter to join the alphabet.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.720
 So you think, oh, gonna have a rough time here.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.040
 Get to O, easy, easy.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.000
 - Well, you're one of those people currently working on X.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.400
 I can tell.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.680
 - Down I got out in time not to do X.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.680
 - Yeah.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.440
 - One thing dictionaries do a lot of these days

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.520
 is posting a word online.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.240
 And you know, and this is the thing that Susie

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240
 doesn't does a bit of as well.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.280
 It's sort of posting a word.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.840
 - Like Susie will do a word that's to do with

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.440
 what's happening in the news or what.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.800
 - Yeah, like Wobble Gadget is a useless bastard

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.640
 who's the president.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.680
 Or it's like, it's some subtle reference like that.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.520
 - Yeah.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.360
 - And it's, but this is basically,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.760
 I think Samuel Johnson is the first to do it.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.600
 - Really?

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.760
 - Yeah, because there are a few jokes in Johnson's dictionary.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.360
 And Johnson didn't write the first dictionary

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.720
 by quite a long stretch,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.120
 but he would put in jokes like oats,

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.720
 a grain which in England is generally given to horses,

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.160
 but in Scotland supports the people.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.280
 - And I think he had like lexicographer,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.360
 a harmless trudge or something like that.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.200
 - Exactly.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.040
 - Yeah, right.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.360
 - But it is basically him having little jokes

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.640
 all the way through his dictionary.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.120
 - Well no, a Webster did that.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.760
 So the word cat was defined as the domestic cat

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.720
 needs no description.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.200
 It is a deceitful animal and when enraged,

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.840
 extremely spiteful.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.680
 - Wow.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.680
 - Is that a joke or was that a pissed off?

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.760
 He was, he was quite a homogenly character.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.760
 So it might, that might be genuine anger.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.160
 It's weird that they would just slip that in.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.240
 They would break all the rules.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.760
 Their own rules that they were setting

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.480
 for this extraordinary tone.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.320
 - Yeah.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.160
 - Just release a bit of anger.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.160
 - Takes long time to write dictionaries.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.000
 - Yeah.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.800
 - The OED was published in 1928 and it was accepted.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.120
 Well, they came up with the idea 70 years earlier.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.920
 So it took 70 years, but the brothers Grimm,

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.720
 they started the German dictionary in 1838

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.240
 and it wasn't fully finished until 1961.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.200
 - Didn't know that they wrote the dictionary.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.640
 - They were linguists.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.480
 - Yeah.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.560
 - And before, well, they were,

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.200
 like they didn't really write fairy tales,

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.040
 they just collected them from places.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:17.880
 - Yes.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.400
 - And the Swedish Academy dictionary,

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:26.400
 that began in 1786 and the final word was put in in 2023.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.560
 - No, it's very cool.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.360
 - How many words are there in the English language language?

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.200
 - I thought.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.000
 - Well, there's 315,000 cards

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.240
 that are in the backward library.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.080
 - 315.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.880
 - It kind of depends how you count it.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.920
 I mean, I know there's a cup out answer, but.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.040
 - Yeah, yeah, but I, the announced version of that version.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.000
 - Interesting.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.480
 - Can I tell you one more thing about the OED?

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.320
 - No, we've had enough.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.480
 - All right.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.320
 - I'm sorry.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.160
 - No, tell us what it is.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.240
 - Just that the OED has a vault of not yet words.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.080
 - Wow.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.920
 - Wow.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.760
 - That's it.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.600
 - And these are words that have been,

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.000
 I don't think it's actually kept in a,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.720
 like a basement, but it's basically where they keep words

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.120
 that have been pitched, but not quite been accepted yet.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:09.960
 - Okay.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.800
 - And some of these words, I think arguably,

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.800
 you can argue at the top.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.640
 - Like Riz.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.160
 - Riz is a perfect example.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.840
 Is that in wide enough usage yet to qualify

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.920
 as a pinned down entry?

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.080
 - What does Riz mean?

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.920
 - Ah, you don't know.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.000
 - Yeah, charisma.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.840
 - And charisma.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.680
 - Oh, man.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.680
 - If it's classic, basically, you know.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.520
 - Oh, yeah.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.360
 - Someone's got Riz.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.360
 (laughing)

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.520
 - But entries 15 years ago in the OED vault,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.880
 Dringle, which was the watermark left on wood

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.960
 by a glass of liquid, which is useful,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.040
 but I've never heard anyone use Dringle.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:39.880
 - Okay.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.040
 - Fergill to feel in a pocket for a small object.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:43.880
 Just Fergling.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.520
 - That just sounds like sex pressures to me.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.120
 (laughing)

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.160
 - What's it, what are they doing, you're on it?

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.440
 - Fergling is down the park.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.440
 - Yeah, what's his face from?

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.920
 He's send us in a lay-by.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.280
 (laughing)

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.860
 (upbeat music)

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:03.800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.000
 That is my fact.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.160
 My fact this week is that if you ever saw a passenger

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.920
 on British airways sitting with a vodka tonic

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.720
 and wearing sunglasses, they were most likely dead.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.920
 - This is a piece that came out anecdotally

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.120
 from air attendants who were reporting what you do

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.080
 if someone dies while the plane is mid-flight.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.640
 A lot of the things would be to just cover them up

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.760
 in their seat, move them to a seat in first class,

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.600
 or in this case, as reported by British airways,

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.120
 you would put some sunglasses on them,

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.520
 pop a drink down in front of them.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.760
 - And also a copy of the Daily Mail,

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.760
 and I don't know how to do that.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.760
 - A copy of the Daily Mail, yeah.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.600
 (laughing)

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.440
 - Really?

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.440
 - 'Cause nothing makes you not want to talk to someone.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.280
 (laughing)

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.920
 - I'm sitting there with a copy of the Daily Mail.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.320
 - And nothing sucks your will to live like reading it,

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.760
 so that is kind of perfect, yeah?

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.760
 - I wonder if they count that in their circulation figures.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.880
 - Yeah, the same thing with newspapers

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.920
 is that they bulk out their circulation figures

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.120
 by giving a load of them to airlines,

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.640
 and say, oh, you know, thousands of people read them,

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.480
 but actually they've just given them way for a month.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.560
 (laughing)

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.440
 - Define read, yeah.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.900
 - It's a bit classless of them to call it circulation.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.760
 Given how tasteless that is, but yeah, yeah.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.480
 But this is, I think this is completely reasonable,

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.640
 because the alternative is to have people

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.880
 carrying bodies through the cabin, me a flight.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.320
 Like, I don't think that's very sensible.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.480
 But the article you sent, it said,

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.880
 we don't do that anymore.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.720
 - Yes, exactly.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.880
 - We don't do that anymore.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.200
 And what really made me laugh in that article

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.440
 is that the trainer was saying to the students,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.680
 you cannot put a dead passenger in the toilet.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.280
 It's not respectful.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.720
 And it's not strapped in for landing.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.560
 (laughing)

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.280
 - And there were cases of bodies getting rigor mortis,

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.080
 and they couldn't get them out of the toilet.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.200
 - Wow, yes, okay, I can.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.920
 - Just psychologically though, Andy,

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.960
 if you're sat on a plane next to someone who's just died,

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.360
 the last thing I want is them coming over

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.680
 and popping some sunglasses.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.520
 - Getting the free-volctorate.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.360
 - Yeah, it's outrageous.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.320
 - It's been the whole trip going,

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.640
 are you, are you reading that?

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.480
 Can I, I think it's okay.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.560
 - Do you, you would happily just continue your own flight

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.760
 sitting next to a dead person.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.760
 - What is my alternative?

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.920
 - Move seats or get them?

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.760
 - They move seats.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.360
 - They go in the stewardess sleeping area though.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.040
 - Well, this is the bumping up to first class thing.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.680
 I mean, the trick, the thing you really want to do

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.200
 is you want to die for five minutes.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.400
 Get moved up to first class.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.800
 You want to recover, and then, yes.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.720
 - I mean, they'll be back, you know?

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.920
 - They're fuckers in first class.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.520
 So you try, I mean, I'm not first class,

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.800
 but I remember being in business class with a baby

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.280
 and it looks you get with a baby.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.160
 Imagine, they wouldn't accept a dead person.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.440
 - There are some of my lines are trying to ban babies

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.520
 in first class now.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.200
 I read this in the news this week.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.040
 Yeah.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:39.880
 - Right.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.720
 - Yeah.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.560
 - I don't know what's red.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.600
 - But like, for instance,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.200
 like if you fly EasyJet or I and I,

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.000
 which is why I would mostly fly,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.080
 there is no first class.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.240
 There's no business class.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.920
 And all the seats are bucked up.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.760
 - Yes.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.600
 - So where do you put them?

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.440
 - That's true.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.400
 - Well, Singapore Airlines supposedly had a corpse

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.640
 cupboard that you would put them into.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.560
 - It must have been used for other things engaged, Ellie.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.400
 - Yeah.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.240
 - People's suits that need had a hanging out.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.080
 - Again, I think it's completely reasonable.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.480
 Supposedly Virgin will clear four seats in economy

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.360
 and like lie the person down over that.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.320
 But this is a thing that of course happens

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.640
 because if you've ever been on a long haul flight,

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.920
 you've probably been sharing it with someone who's died

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.320
 and is being repatriated.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.680
 It's just a thing you have to do.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.240
 - But they'll be underneath.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.080
 - They'll be in the hole.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.160
 I don't know about the hole,

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.280
 but they won't be in the cabin with the rest

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.320
 of the passengers, obviously.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.040
 But there was a case, only a few weeks ago,

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.560
 there was an 89 year old passenger.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.160
 She with her family, you know, her younger family,

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.880
 boarded an EasyJet flight at Malaga,

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.800
 but she boarded while dead.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.280
 And basically the family had brought her along,

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.040
 put her in the seat and then said,

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.480
 oh no, she's died on board.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.040
 - I think there's still controversy about whether she,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.160
 like they're still saying that she died on board.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.200
 - If they were still saying she was just tired,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.680
 but I don't think a lot of people noticed that.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.520
 - Why did they do it?

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.400
 - The theory is that it was very expensive.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.880
 - It's very expensive to repatriate.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.720
 - Yes, okay.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.320
 - If you repatriate someone,

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.440
 it'll cost between £2,000 and £4,000,

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.680
 which is like somewhere between business

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.880
 and fast classes, isn't it?

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.880
 It's quite expensive.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.920
 - Quite fascinated by the flight simulator community.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.760
 - Oh yeah.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.240
 - There's like, I mean, it's a 98% male.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.920
 - Yes, I did perk them a bit too heavily,

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.640
 I don't know.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.960
 - So six, you can get your own cockpit in your lounge.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.800
 - I love it.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.240
 - There is almost exactly,

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.800
 I mean, it is almost indistinguishable

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.680
 from the real thing.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680
 - Wow.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.680
 - But anyway, through that, I found there was a,

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.600
 this was a real pilot.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.480
 His first job from flight simulating

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.480
 was to then flying real planes,

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.920
 flying dead bodies across America

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.640
 to where they were going to be buried.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.160
 And his first flight, nobody told him

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.200
 that cadavers grown at altitude.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.040
 - Do they?

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:48.880
 - Who they are?

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.720
 - Who they are?

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.560
 - Apparently so, yeah.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.560
 - Pressure change.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.560
 - Yeah, there's air with a lot.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.520
 - Cadavers have air in their lungs when you go higher

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.320
 and that air comes out, which means they grow.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.320
 - That's astonishing.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.760
 - With totally terrifying.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.680
 (laughing)

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.800
 - But to be honest, I make that noise

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.760
 when I'm reading the Daily Mail anyway, so.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.640
 (laughing)

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.160
 - Has there ever been,

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.040
 I really hope that has been a case of someone

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.200
 who's just been flying, who is an enthusiast

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.640
 who has their own flight simulator

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.040
 and they've had to do the announcement.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.400
 Is there someone on board who can fly a plane?

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.800
 - That's probably everyone's fantasy, fantasy situation.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.360
 I don't know, I did go looking for it.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.800
 I couldn't find one.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.800
 I found that about 27% of the flight simulation community

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.840
 have or have had a pilot's license at some point.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.040
 - Okay, okay.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.560
 - There's quite a significant amount.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.880
 - 73%, you don't.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.280
 - But there's also a gay and lesbian

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.600
 and trans quite active flight sim community.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.440
 - Okay, okay.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.480
 - Simming, and they talk about really enjoying sightseeing

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.240
 and they'll go and all fly together

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.480
 like across the Massai Mara.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.280
 - Oh, like that.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.960
 - Because there's great, great.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.760
 - Because you're all doing the same simulation at the same time.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.600
 - At the same time.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.320
 - And when you're in the simulation,

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.440
 you can see the actual animals

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.080
 because there's drones and things like that.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.120
 - I mean, I used to play a bit of flight simulator.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.880
 - You surprised me not at all.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.480
 (all laughing)

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.680
 - You're dad, Sally.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.800
 - My dad worked for British Airways.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.480
 - Yeah, that's quite cool.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.480
 So you had a...

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.800
 - When it was glamorous then.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.640
 - It was glamorous.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.480
 - When are we talking?

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.400
 - Then he started working for them in the '60s.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.720
 - Cool.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.160
 - I've not really engaged with that.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.600
 I've just been very selfish

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.840
 and I asked my father about my straights job.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.400
 But I did this morning because it was...

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.200
 - I said, "Can you tell me any stories about people dying?"

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.440
 And he said, "No."

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.920
 I can't.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.120
 I said, "What kind of stories have you got?"

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.080
 - And he has lots of stories about heroic stewardesses.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.800
 So I grew up, I wanted to be a stewardess

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.720
 'cause they struck me as fantastically glamorous.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.560
 - Yeah.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.680
 - There was a story,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.240
 remember being told, I don't know if it's true or not,

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.560
 about star bomb a stewardess who rescued a flight

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.240
 because the plane took off, I can't remember where from,

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:04.160
 and the toilets have a cap on for the...

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.120
 Anyway, this cap was not on the toilets.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.320
 So when the plane took off,

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.800
 she went to the toilet before the lights went on

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.680
 for the passengers to be able to use it.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.560
 - Yeah, perks of the job.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.520
 - And of perks of the job.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.760
 And it sucked her in.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.280
 And so she was then keeping the pressure.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.280
 But that blue bleach is very, very acid and corrosive.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.120
 And so it tattooed a star shape on her.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.160
 And obviously they landed quite quickly afterwards,

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.440
 but she's like the little boy with a thumb in the dark.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.280
 - Wow.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.840
 - Yes, stewardess with the bottom in the toilet.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.160
 - What a story for that tattoo, it's so off of the plane.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.320
 Why do you have that tattoo?

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.720
 - I was just drunk in Cambodia, yeah, yeah, this is like...

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.800
 - We have all these sort of stewardess heroine stories

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.240
 like I have a dolly on a plane.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.080
 Stewardess coming up saying, Mr. Ali,

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.240
 you need to use your seatbelt.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.200
 And him saying, "Superman don't need no seatbelt."

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.120
 And her saying, "Superman don't need no plane, Mr. Ali."

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:01.960
 - Oh, nice.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.800
 - Thank you.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.640
 - Lovely.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.560
 - You know, I'm quite scared of flying

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.360
 and I thought I was getting over it

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.320
 and you've now added a new fear.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.720
 It's the idea of if that seatbelt sign goes on

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.120
 that I'm gonna get my ass sucked down through the toilet.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.120
 Can I give you another one, Dan?

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:15.960
 - Yeah.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.480
 - This is my favorite BA flight ever.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.320
 - Okay.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.200
 - And this is recently, in fact, been featured on QI.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.000
 So this is very, so this was the flight in 1982.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.080
 - So that you went to let her reuse facts?

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.920
 - While I'm going to.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.760
 - To watch me.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.920
 - Wow.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.120
 If I had a nickel for every time I'd heard about the poo knife,

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:29.960
 all right?

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.560
 (laughing)

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.720
 - One of the most exciting BA flights ever is

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.040
 the one where they flew into an ash cloud by mistake.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.280
 The flying over Indonesia.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.120
 - Yeah.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.440
 - And the plane sensors were fit to look for moisture

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.280
 in the air.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.240
 If you're flying into a big storm,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.800
 the plane sensors are looking for moisture.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.160
 The ash from this volcanic eruption was dry, right?

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.200
 So all the ash landed inside the engine,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.160
 melted, then solidified inside.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.520
 So the all four engines stopped working.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.960
 And the captain, Eric Moody, 41 years old at the time,

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.800
 made the famous, now quite famous announcement.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.880
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.320
 We have a small problem.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.000
 All four engines have stopped.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.120
 We are doing our downers to get them going again.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.440
 I trust you are not in too much distress.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.000
 - Incredible, right?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.120
 - Do you know one of the reasons that flights

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.760
 was all right and everyone on board survived?

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.600
 - Why?

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.440
 - He had recently been on the simulator

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.280
 (laughing)

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.000
 and done a simulation of a four engine failure.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.840
 - Wow.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.600
 - They had to restart the engines.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.080
 What they had to do, they had to wait for the engines

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.280
 to cool down enough for the ash to break off

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.880
 and then they could restart them.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.240
 But it took a long time and they were trying to glide

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.640
 to the ground and he had to do it.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.360
 The ash had smashed up the windscreen

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.760
 and made it impossible to see through.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.400
 So he had to land by being told the readings

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.520
 on the instruments and how close you are to the ground.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.640
 Very cautious.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.760
 Anyway, he very sadly died in 2024,

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.720
 but just before that, he was on Q1.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.560
 - Yeah.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.760
 - If you look up the cliff of Q1,

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.480
 it's from, I can't remember what later it is,

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.200
 that's the beauty, there we go.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.760
 And he was on there for understatement

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.840
 for his lovely announcement.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.080
 And it's a really cool moment on that show.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:04.920
 - That's incredible.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.920
 - Wow, that is cool.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.160
 I bet they've got the visuals for that on Microsoft Flight.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.000
 - Yeah.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:11.840
 - I bet they do.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.680
 I bet they do now.

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.680
 People will be desperate for that.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.720
 - Because they do ice on your windscreens.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.080
 - You're really on flight simulator?

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:18.920
 - Yeah, lovely.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.760
 - Yeah depending on it.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.600
 - They've upgraded it.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.600
 - They've got me.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.440
 - So excited.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.280
 - You need to get a backup.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.120
 - I can't wait.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.960
 - It's a mere six grand, so I'll date your copies.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.800
 - You don't have to change my lounge as well.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.520
 - Do you guys remember that documentary about the fire festival

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.080
 that went horrible wrong?

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.800
 One of the characters that just add to the chaos of it all

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.600
 is a pilot who takes all of them around in a flight.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.840
 And he'd never flown before, purely on flight simulator.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.680
 Was this thing?

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.920
 - Do you listen to Black Box Down?

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.760
 - No.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.920
 - It's a podcast.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.280
 - It's a podcast about plane crashes.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.800
 It's ended now, sadly, but every episode

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.480
 they did a different flight incident.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.320
 - Well, what happened to it?

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.600
 How did it die?

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.720
 - Both hosts fell asleep very badly.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.320
 - My wife is a pilot.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.760
 A helicopter pilot.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.000
 And she's obsessed with plane crashes.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.720
 And I think that is, if you are a pilot,

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.000
 you do want to read about all the crashes

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.120
 'cause it kind of helps you know about what might happen.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.120
 - You want to read about it?

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.280
 'Cause it always is something so tiny

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.360
 that you might want to notice.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.120
 So you just, yeah, you want to get those all moments.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.120
 And the things that can't go wrong

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.440
 are so strange and different.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.600
 But the point of that is that flying is incredibly safe.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.680
 And the point about it is that you're trying to say here.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.520
 Is it safe?

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.200
 - But that is true that every time something goes wrong,

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.440
 the airline and aviation industry

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.440
 is unbelievably good at absorbing the stakes,

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.440
 learning from them and implementing them for next time.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.880
 - It tries to be not so much like,

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.560
 I'm not gonna tell anyone what happened

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.440
 'cause I'll get in trouble 'cause I think they have a community

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.720
 of like, we will try and be as open as possible

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.200
 to stop it from happening again.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.040
 - Yeah.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.440
 Can I tell you something culturally

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.320
 that British Airways gave us?

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.160
 - Sure.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.160
 - Thanks to British Airways that basically

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.760
 that we have the Beastie Boys.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.600
 - Beastie Boys?

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.080
 So you'll know Nicelyt or Brooklyn?

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.160
 Fight for your right party.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.000
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.840
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.680
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.520
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.680
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.520
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.360
 We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.520
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:29.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:40.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.360
 - We know the Beastie Boys.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.360
 - We do the next 50 minutes in an Aussie accent.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.360
 - How's your Aussie accent?

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.360
 - Terrible.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.360
 - It's always been horrific.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.360
 - So we should say you grew up in Sydney for a bit.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.360
 - Well, yeah, it's just a couple of years.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.360
 - Yeah, I was too.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.360
 But you had an Aussie accent?

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.360
 - I had an Aussie accent.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.360
 I was desperate to fit in.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.360
 But I wasn't aware of it.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.360
 I had an Aussie accent then I couldn't ditch it.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.360
 - So what did you have before you had?

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.360
 Because you were born and born?

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.360
 - I had it.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.360
 I spoke like a presenter from the World Service circa 1950.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.360
 - Okay.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.360
 - Until I went to Australia and then started speaking like an Australian.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.360
 And then couldn't get rid of it for ages.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.360
 And then when I started acting, it was a one accent I couldn't do for a very, very long time.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360
 - Oh, really?

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.360
 - Yeah, because I couldn't hear it.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.360
 - That's interesting.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.360
 - But did you see the story that it was the most attractive accent to Americans?

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.360
 - I can believe it.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.360
 - Sexiest?

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360
 - Yeah.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.360
 - Smartest, most appealing.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.360
 I guess it's the least threatening accent is next.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.360
 Everything goes up at the end.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.360
 - Yes.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.360
 - And if you're throwing in sexy phrases like fair shake of the sauce bottle.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.360
 - Yeah.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.360
 - Was that being drunk?

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.360
 - No, that's just giving someone a fair crack at something.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.360
 Kevin Rudd, who was PM from Australia.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:11.360
 - He used the phrase fair shake of the sauce bottle so much during the 2013 election

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.360
 that it became a bit of a thing.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.360
 He was trying to be bloke in.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.360
 He also said fair suck of the pineapple.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.360
 You've got to give people a fair suck of the pineapple, you know?

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.360
 - Yeah.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.360
 - Just these are wonderful phrases.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.360
 - Yeah.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.360
 I remember flying into Perth to do a film and they had a government sponsored billboard

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.360
 on the way from the airport saying, "Don't be a bloody idiot.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.360
 Don't drink and drive."

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.360
 I said, "Government."

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.360
 - Yeah.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.360
 - Yeah.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.360
 - Yeah.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.360
 - Well, they're very good at that.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.360
 - Very good at swearing.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.360
 - Very good at swearing.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360
 - Very good at swearing.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360
 - Very good at swearing.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.360
 Very good at swearing.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.360
 Very good at swearing.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.360
 - Very good at swearing.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.360
 Very good at swearing.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.360
 Very good at being just a bit loose as high up as Prime Minister.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.360
 - Yeah.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.360
 - Can I ask Andy this, the fact about they like it if you use Australian slang.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.360
 - Use their language.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.360
 - Yeah.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.360
 - And it just found that using Australian slang is a pro, but only in an Aussie accent.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.360
 - So Australians like Australians?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.360
 - Yeah, it sounds that way.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.360
 - So people, Australians like people who speak with an Australian accent.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:08.360
 And then they like them additionally if they are able to a bit relaxed and use something.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:13.360
 Because they, it's very, I remember hearing one, which was, "I'm so hungry I could eat the

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.360
 arse out of a low-flying pigeon."

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.360
 - No, that's kind of great.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.360
 - And again, was that Prime Minister who said that on?

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.360
 - Yeah.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.360
 - And that's a sexy phrase that an American would find unbelievably attractive, you know?

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.360
 I'm as full as a stripper's dance card.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360
 - Oh yeah.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.360
 - It's a nice one.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.360
 But I'm not using an Aussie accent, so this doesn't endear me to any of our Aussie listeners.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.360
 - No, it sounds like you're patronising.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.360
 - Which I do not.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.360
 - It sounds like you're taking the piss out of yourself.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.360
 - If you look at his face.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.360
 - I'm very dear to you.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.360
 - Yeah, absolutely not.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:44.360
 - One person who pretended to have a Australian accent was Matthew McConaughey.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.360
 - Did he?

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.360
 - Yeah.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.360
 - The actor?

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.360
 - Yeah.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.360
 - But when he was acting or just pretended to be Australian on a train?

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.360
 - Well, he lived in Australia for a little while.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:40:01.360
 And then when he came back to America he decided to keep the accent because all Americans find the Australian accent sexy.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:09.360
 And the only real reason I bring it up is because Matthew McConaughey has a brother called Rooster who has two children.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.360
 One of them is called Margarita and the other one is called Miller Light.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.360
 - Okay.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.360
 - Miller Light.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.360
 - Miller Light McConaughey.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.360
 - Is that a beer?

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.360
 - It's a beer.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:29.360
 And his brother got a lifetime supply of Miller Light when he named his child Miller Light McConaughey.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.360
 - Wow.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.360
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.360
 - That is amazing.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.360
 - Soft topic, but I love it.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:38.360
 - A lot of these Australian phrases sound rude and I find this very interesting, but not all of them are.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:45.360
 So I just like one of the following phrases I'm going to read out is rude, okay? To point the bone at someone.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:49.360
 To bore it up, someone.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.360
 On the vage.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.360
 To asshole.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.360
 Dogging.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.360
 Stiff in the lizards.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.360
 Golden donut.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.360
 And to come the raw prawn.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.360
 Okay.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.360
 Only one of those is rude.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.360
 - Which one?

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.360
 - Which one?

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.360
 - The golden donut I'm going to go for.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.360
 - Okay.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.360
 - It's gone for the golden donut.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.360
 - Surely dogging means the same as it does here.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.360
 - Could do.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.360
 Could not.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.360
 - The raw prawn.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.360
 What's that one?

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.360
 - To come the raw prawn?

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.360
 - It's not.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.360
 - You're not in a good place if you're coming the raw prawn.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.360
 James is right.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.360
 - Is that the golden donut?

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.360
 - The golden donut is like for the vagina.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.360
 To come the raw prawn is simply to put something over on someone, to fool someone.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.360
 Don't come the raw prawn with me.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.360
 And you said dogging, Sally?

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.360
 - Yeah.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.360
 - Just dingo hunting.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:37.360
 - To point the bone at someone is to put a jinx on them.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.360
 To bore it up someone is just to give them a walloping.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:44.360
 On the vage means according to the provisions of the vagrancy act.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.360
 Okay.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:50.360
 To us whole is to dismiss someone preemptorially.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.360
 And stiffen the lizards as an exclamation of surprise.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.360
 - Very clear.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.360
 - It's down the cries and stiffen the lizards.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.360
 - Yeah.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.360
 - You know the Aussie salute?

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.360
 - Can I ask that?

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.360
 - It's not rude.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.360
 It's just waving away flies.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.360
 - Oh yeah.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.360
 - Well that's the, there's an old theory.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.360
 I think we've covered this on fish where that's how the modern Aussie accent developed.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.360
 Because there were so many flies that the way you would talk to each other was with your teeth closed

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.360
 so that you wouldn't get any in your mouth.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.360
 And that's where the Aussie accent came from.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.360
 - Oh yeah.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.360
 - Yeah.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:28.360
 - And actually where it came from is a load of people came over from Britain in 200 years ago.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:33.360
 And it's quite similar to the Cockney accent around that time.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.360
 But also loads of people went to Australia at the same time.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.360
 Most of them were cockneys but there were people from other places.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.360
 And then over the years like the kids would hang out together

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.360
 and they had to sort of understand what each other was saying

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:50.360
 because actually accents were quite intelligible back in those days.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.360
 And eventually after one or two generations it's called leveling.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:59.360
 All the kids start talking the same way. And then all the adults, well they grow up and then many kids do.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.360
 - Yeah right.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.360
 - This kind of evolution isn't it?

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.360
 - Yeah kind of but it's like a forced evolution and it's quite a quick evolution.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.360
 - With them, it's not to do Australia but with gendered speech patterns.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:15.360
 Remember reading this study, I mean again a long time ago, but it says probably been more complex thought about it since.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:23.360
 But that male children and female children had the same speech patterns until they went to nursery.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.360
 And then they started declaring themselves with their speech patterns.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.360
 - Yeah.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.360
 - Which is kind of interesting.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:34.360
 And so women like me, ape male speech patterns to seem intelligent.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.360
 Which is sort of wrong, isn't it?

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.360
 And I didn't realise I did this until I read the study but you know have a slightly lower voice

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.360
 and I sort of aping male speech patterns.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.360
 - Really? And it has been found that men and women if you make your voice lower

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.360
 you are more successful on average in life.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.360
 - Really?

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.360
 - And that's what they did to Margaret, that's just it.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:55.360
 - Yeah, there is no such thing as society.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:00.360
 There are individual men and women and there are families.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.360
 - Yeah.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.360
 - She didn't speak like that before.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.360
 - No.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.360
 - So Erin.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.360
 - That was her podcast, wasn't it?

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.360
 - No, she didn't.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.360
 - No, she didn't.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:12.360
 - We have children who are three and a bit older.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:17.360
 Have your kids started talking like Bluey, the cartoon character from Australia.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.360
 - Oh.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:23.360
 - And there is a lot of every now and then you see articles in the newspapers of saying

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.360
 all our kids have started talking like Bluey now.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:32.360
 Similarly about 10 years ago everyone's kids were talking like Pingu or like the Teletubbies.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.360
 - Or Peppa Pig.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.360
 - Or Peppa Pig.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.360
 - Yeah.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.360
 - Yes, I mean, no.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.360
 - No.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.360
 - No.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:43.360
 - But what people are finding that their kids are using Aussie slang, especially in America.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.360
 So they'll say rubbish instead of garbage or whatever.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360
 - Are you on the veg?

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360
 That kind of thing.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.360
 It's the golden donut for me.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:59.360
 - But actually according to linguists, kids very early, like certainly by the time they're

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:04.360
 three years old, can tell the difference between the way that a character is speaking and

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.360
 the way that their family and friends speak.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.360
 So if they are talking a little bit like Bluey or Pingu or Teletubbies or Peppa Pig,

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.360
 they're doing it knowing that that's a character.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.360
 I think it's a register rather than the way they're speaking forever now, because otherwise just

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.360
 all British children would speak in American.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.360
 There's so much American media consumed that you would just absolutely.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.360
 - That's why there's such a push to have home, grey and children's programming.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.360
 - Right.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.360
 - That's a, you know, political thing.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.360
 - Yeah.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.360
 - Yeah.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.360
 - In all different countries.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:38.760
 - I think the idea of this kind of turn of phrase from Australia, the international grab

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:44.760
 onto it, really comes down to, in my opinion, one generation of Aussies that moved over here.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.760
 And that's Barry Humphreys, that's Germaine Greer, it's Clive James.

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.760
 And then I'm going to add Paul Hogan into that as well.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.760
 Because I think Paul Hogan more than anyone really turned Australia into a tourist destination

00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:01.760
 through the advert campaign with put a shrimp on the barbie, which is a phrase that's still used

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.760
 to this day, even though in Australia it's called prawns, right?

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:09.760
 So it was Americanifying the term that we would use in Australia.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.760
 But I was really about Paul Hogan because I didn't really know his story.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:16.760
 So Paul Hogan is Crocodile Dundee for those who don't know his real name.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.760
 He used to work on the Sydney Harbor Bridge.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.760
 He was a rigor on the Sydney Harbor Bridge while it was being constructed.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.760
 And the reason he became famous is there was a show in Australia called New Faces.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.760
 And he decided, yeah, he decided he was going to enter.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.760
 So he did as a tap dancing knife thrower.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.760
 Now he neither knew how to tap dance or throw knives.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.760
 Were they poo knives?

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.760
 No, no, no.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.760
 Because I would watch that and pretend it's got talent.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.760
 Someone threw poo knives in Southern California.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.760
 Yeah.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.760
 He basically created, he's got a knife.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.760
 That's a lot of knife.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.760
 Give me one second.

00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:01.760
 Yeah, he faked it.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.760
 He did the audition and they said, let us see the act.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.760
 And he said, it's a pretty dangerous act.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760
 I'll have to do it on the night.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.760
 But roughly this is what I'll be doing.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.760
 And they went, that sounds great.

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.760
 Come on.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.760
 And so he made it to main TV, which was live at the time.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.760
 And that was his first break.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:16.760
 Did he do it?

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.760
 No.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.760
 He didn't know how to do any of it.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:19.760
 Well, happened.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.760
 He threw the knives at the ground.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.760
 He made fun of the judges.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:26.760
 And this Aussie, which came out of him, because he became a big comedian in Australia.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.760
 And were you there then?

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.760
 Do you remember that?

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.760
 No, no, no.

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:30.760
 I know.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.760
 You must see how much younger I was.

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.760
 I don't think I was even born at that point.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:33.760
 No.

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:34.760
 Yeah.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.760
 Just one more thing about slang in general.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.760
 So we mentioned earlier that people don't like sometimes being a dictionary.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.760
 So there was a survey in 2014.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:46.760
 And more than half of people said it wasn't appropriate for words like "yolo" to be in the dictionary.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.760
 Right?

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.760
 But I just love this.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760
 This was I think a Yuga thing.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.760
 In order to survey people's knowledge of slang terms.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.760
 They had to ask them, do you know what this slang term means?

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.760
 And they had to come up with alternatives of what these words might mean.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.760
 OK.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:07.760
 So "yolo", 9% of people surveyed thought it was a yoghurt made with caramel and chocolate.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:12.760
 Cray, 15% thought it was having a strong or unpleasant smell of fish.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.760
 Brilliant.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.760
 Great fish, nothing.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.760
 And it's crazy.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.760
 We should say for...

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.760
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.760
 When it doesn't know that.

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.760
 Man's Plane, as Dan just did, about the meaning of Cray.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:26.760
 28% thought that was a man who was especially played.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.760
 Man's Plane still describes me.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.760
 And finally, I loved this one.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:40.760
 3% of people thought the Bank of Mum and Dad is a place where Siemens is kept in cold storage for use in artificial insemination.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.760
 This was multi-guess, right?

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.760
 They gave them options.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.760
 They gave them two options.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.760
 So 97% got the Bank of Mum and Dad right.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.760
 But 3% thought it was the old sperm free.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.760
 But it was the witty people who wrote the thing.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.760
 Yeah, I know.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:53.760
 Just lovely.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.760
 Isn't that great?

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.760
 Do you know what the slang term to swallow a dick means?

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.760
 Not any more, this was 18th century.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.760
 A 19th century.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:02.760
 Is it Aussie or just General?

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:03.760
 It's British actually.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.760
 You've asked this before.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.760
 It relates to something else we've said today.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.760
 Be Dad on a plane.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.760
 The other one.

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.760
 The other one.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.760
 Mary and Webster, the dictionary.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.760
 Yeah.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.760
 It's all a dictionary.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.760
 It's all the English.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.760
 It's someone who knows lots of long words.

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.760
 Or uses lots of long words.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.760
 They've swallowed the dick.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.760
 Do you have a favourite Aussie ism?

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.760
 Australian actors, they say happy to be here, easy to work with.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.760
 So when things get really bad, you say happy to be here, easy to work with.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.760
 You don't complain about anything.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.760
 Yeah, too easy mate.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.760
 I think the mentality is completely fantastic.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:40.760
 Yeah.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.760
 And that's what I was thinking last year when I was ever thinking this is actually the best place.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:49.760
 You know, when the whole world looks like it's going tits up and there's so much sort of fear and threat of war.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.760
 Australia is such a positive place.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:56.760
 Like it's having such a moment of fashion and film and it's a nice safe place to be.

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.760
 I would say that that generally speaking is true.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.760
 But you want to try mispronouncing some of their place names on the popular podcast.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.760
 I am.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.760
 They suddenly that easygoing attitude just disappears.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:14.760
 Okay, that is it.

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:15.760
 That is all of our facts.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.760
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:20.760
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over the course of this show,

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.760
 we can all be found on our online accounts.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.760
 I'm on @Streiberland on Instagram James.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.760
 My Instagram is no such thing as James Harkin.

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:29.760
 Andy?

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.760
 Mine is Andrew Hunter Ebb.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.760
 And Sally, you're on Instagram, right?

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.760
 I think I'm Sally smack.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.760
 Yes.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.760
 Because I was once in a show.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:43.760
 They had the word smack in the title rather than because I take smack.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.760
 Or like being smacked.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.760
 I should change that.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.760
 I don't know.

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.760
 Never change.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:56.760
 Well, listen, if you want to get through to us about any of the things that we've said,

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.760
 we're also available on podcast@ky.com.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:03.760
 You can send us all of your Australian pronunciation complaints to Andy there.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.760
 We'll bring them up most likely in an episode of Drop Us Align.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:11.760
 That's our secret show that you can only get access to if you are a member of Club Fish.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.760
 This is a very exciting group of people who love our show so much that they are willing

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.760
 to go behind a paywall to experience extra goodies.

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:23.760
 And we've got so much great stuff there from bonus episodes all the way through to a quarterly quiz.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:28.760
 So if you want to be part of that, just go to patreon.com/nosuchthingasaffish.

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.760

 Otherwise, just come back here next week because we're going to be back with another episode.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.760
 We will see you then.
