00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's No Switch Things A Fish. Before we start, I just have a quick announcement to make.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,740
 Very excitingly, we have one of our favorite friends in the world,

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,940
 American comic, John Hodgman, guesting on this episode.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,240
 Now, before he came on our show, Anner and I actually went on to his show, Judge John Hodgman,

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,720
 that just went out this week, in it, he settles a dispute that is specific about our relationship

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,360
 between Anner and I on the podcast. And before we begin this show, we're going to play you

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,560
 a little excerpt from that night, because it's relevant to what happens later in Arsha.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,360
 So, without further ado, previously, on someone else's podcast.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:45,560
 Our final dispute on stage from the hit podcast No Such Thing Is A Fish.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,360
 Here with the dispute, please welcome Dan Schreiber and Anna Toshinsky.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:57,760
 Dan and Anna, No Such Thing Is A Fish is one of my very favorite podcasts.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,360
 And it's a real, I've met you before, Dan, where old friends were practically brothers

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,760
 and I look forward to seeing you at Christmas.

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,760
 And I've never met you before, and it's a pleasure to see you in person.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,960
 But let's get to the dispute. What is the problem, Anna?

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,360
 The problem is that we present a factual podcast that people actually listen to.

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,360
 You buzz marketing your podcast on my podcast.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,360
 Yeah, that's the reason we're here. We're having a show tomorrow, a few tickets.

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,760
 No. And every week, Dan has to provide us with one fact and to present on the podcast.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:33,360
 And I keep having to reject his facts on the grounds that they're not interesting and they're not facts.

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,760
 Yeah. And I argue that they are.

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,760
 Well, you and I both know that non-facts are usually more interesting than facts.

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,360
 But do you dispute, I mean, you're disputing the factuality of what he is asserting, is that correct?

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
 Let me give you an example.

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,160
 So, one fact that Dan's presented for consideration is that the real reason

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,960
 that Titanic sank is not that it hid in iceberg, but that so many time travelers visited it

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,360
 at the same time that the weight of them all pushed it underwater.

28
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,960
 Is your problem with him that he puts forward these facts or beliefs?

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,760
 No, my problem is that I think it's very dangerous for us to be spreading these facts.

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,360
 You know, if Donald Trump has thought of anything, it's that people hear tiny little random bits of stuff

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,560
 that they half-remember and then cling to them for life.

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,360
 And I think they'll half-remember what Dan said and then think it was the truth

33
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,160
 and then go away with these insane convictions.

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,160
 Go, you can understand in our country we've given up on facts.

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,360
 Did you end up discussing this on the podcast?

36
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
 No. No. He's tried, we cut it out.

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,760
 Right. Well, I am going to be a guest on the podcast this Monday, and that's the fact that I'm going to bring.

38
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,960
 So, I look forward to discussing it then.

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,560
 I find in favor of Dan just because it's a great theory.

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
 Sorry, Anna.

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:03:06,360
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

42
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,360
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,760
 and special guest John Hodgman.

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,160
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

45
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,160
 and in no particular order, here we go.

46
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,360
 Starting with you, Hodgman.

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,560
 Hello. My fact is not many people know that the real reason the Titanic sank is not because it hit an iceberg,

48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,360
 but because so many time travelers visited at the same time, the weight of all the bodies forced it under the ocean's surface.

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
 And this is a verified fact.

50
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,360
 I can't believe we're doing this.

51
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,360
 We're torturing Anna with this one.

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,360
 So, John invited Dan and I to go on his podcast at the weekend called Judge John Hodgman where he settles a dispute.

53
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,360
 The dispute was my problem with the fact that dance facts aren't real facts.

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,360
 And instead of settling in my favor, he settled in Dan's favor and has presented this ridiculous fact to the class.

55
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
 Well, there's no question that you--

56
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
 Which is obviously one of Dan's.

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:15,360
 You were correct, this is not a fact other than, I think, Dan your argument was, it's a fact that some people think this.

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,360
 Yeah, it's a fact that there is a theory.

59
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,360
 There is a theory, a completely untestable theory.

60
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
 Do you think anyone thinks it?

61
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
 I mean, really thinks it.

62
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,360
 So, the first time I heard this was by Neil deGrasse Tyson, he's the American scientist.

63
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,360
 He has this podcast, it's called Star Talk, and it's a theory that someone had sent in to him.

64
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,360
 And so, he discussed it, and yeah, that's where I first heard it.

65
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,360
 So, yeah, if it's good enough for Neil deGrasse Tyson, it's--

66
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
 Well, I'm not sure it's good enough.

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
 I'm not sure.

68
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 I also went back and watched that video and I'm not sure it's good enough for him either.

69
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,360
 If we watch it now, it's him saying good enough for me.

70
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,360
 I did attempt to reach out to him through his co-host of that podcast, The Great Comedian Eugene Merman.

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
 But so far, I've not heard back.

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,360
 Neil deGrasse Tyson, if you're listening to this in the future, please use Time Travel

73
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,360
 to tell us the source of where you heard this conspiracy theory.

74
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,360
 Stephen Hawking, you may know, held a dinner party in 2008 for future Time Travelers.

75
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,360
 He put out-- and no one attended, except for him, because he sent out the invitations after the party was over.

76
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,360
 Yeah, but it could be that everyone in the future really hates him.

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,360
 Well, I mean, there are a lot of reasons why it was not proof, although he took it as proof.

78
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,360
 And he-- he actually sat there in this room with glasses of champagne and canapes

79
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,360
 and a big banner saying, "Welcome Time Travelers."

80
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,360
 And talked about how this-- this undeniably proved it on a TV special that he made.

81
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,360
 And I have to say, I watched that segment and Stephen Hawking.

82
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,360
 I never thought I'd say this seemed a little bit of a smug asshole about it.

83
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
 Because I mean, no offense, Dr. Hawking, you're obvious.

84
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,360
 But I mean, you know, maybe no one wants to have dinner with you, especially after--

85
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,360
 especially after this smug display of self-righteous--

86
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,360
 There is a short story by E.M. Forster where exactly this happens.

87
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 Time Travelers come back and they come from the, you know, a few centuries ahead

88
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,360
 and they're just passing through a little village and they're on a sort of coach tour looking at people.

89
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,360
 And people get so annoyed by it in our time that they make a tourist attraction out of the time travelers.

90
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,360
 They say, "Come and look at the time travelers and put up big signs of good audiences."

91
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
 And that annoys the time travelers so much. They stop coming.

92
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,360
 That's a good way to get rid of them, for sure.

93
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,360
 But, you know, another explanation for why Stephen Hawking didn't have dinner guests that night is the many world's theory.

94
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,360
 Which is that, in fact, there is a universe in which time travelers did come back

95
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,360
 and that every time we travel through time, we resolve paradoxes by creating a new, entirely new timeline, a new universe.

96
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,360
 And this is a real theory.

97
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:07,360
 And more generally scientifically accepted, the many world's interpretation of quantum mechanics was first proposed by Hugh Everett in '57 or so.

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:16,360
 You see, a relation of Rupert? No, but he is the father of Mark Oliver Everett of the band Eels.

99
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:26,360
 Really? Yeah. And, in fact, Mark Oliver Everett made a documentary about his father called Parallel World's Parallel Lives.

100
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,360
 And the theory, before we get into that, is that the many world's interpretation.

101
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,360
 Now, this is a little bit above my, I don't, I did a lot of reading on quantum mechanics today.

102
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,360
 No, I will, I will be able to explain it. Thank you very much.

103
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,360
 But the idea is that the every quantum effect exists in all possible states until it is observed.

104
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,360
 And then it settles to one state, and that's called wave function collapse, right?

105
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:56,360
 And the idea of many world's interpretation is that there is no wave function collapse because every possible universe that exists exists.

106
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,360
 Do I understand that more or less correctly? Yeah, pretty much.

107
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:08,360
 This is also where Schrodinger's cat comes into things. So, an object can occur in two possible states until you actually look at it.

108
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
 And then when you look at it, it goes in one way or the other.

109
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,360
 Wave function collapse. Exactly that.

110
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,360
 And then so if you have a cat in a box, then it's both alive and dead at the same time until you actually look at it.

111
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
 And then you'll find out whether it's alive or dead.

112
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,360
 And whatever it was saying was that there is a universe in which it is alive, there is a universe in which it is dead.

113
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,360
 There is a universe where it is not a cat, there is a universe where it is a live cat dead cat hybrid.

114
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:40,360
 His interesting thing about that is if you are the cat, then in some universes you will be dead and some you will be alive.

115
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,360
 But the only ones you will ever know about are the ones where you are alive.

116
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:52,360
 So actually in these kind of theories it could be that when we're experiencing things, we're only experiencing the universes where we're still alive.

117
00:08:52,360 --> 00:09:02,360
 So there are lots of universes where we're dead, so the final you which is still kind of extents and still understanding things will be the last one which possibly lived.

118
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:11,360
 And every time you cross the street, you are hit by a car and you die, except in the universe that you experience.

119
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,360
 I'm a survivor just like Destiny's Child said.

120
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:26,360
 Yeah, that's what I was talking about. This is a good argument for John Hodgman exceptionalism. I feel like this is why I'm virtuous and that is why I've lived to this elderly age.

121
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,360
 About Schrodinger, his idea of the cat thing was he was taking the piss out of the theory.

122
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,360
 He was saying how can this even be true because then this thing, the cat would be true.

123
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:50,360
 So he kind of didn't really like the theory and he had another thing called Schrodinger's Flea which he did like and which he used to explain how electrons can go from one level of energy to another.

124
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
 They kind of jump up quickly like a flea.

125
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,360
 So the theory that he likes was Schrodinger's Flea but the one that he didn't like was Schrodinger's cat.

126
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,360
 I can tell you why that Schrodinger's Flea didn't take off, not enough cats.

127
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:10,360
 He had a extremely popular. Yeah, he did the animals definitely the wrong way around. He did also, I think he lived with two women for a while.

128
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,360
 Did he? Which is possibly him putting his quantum experiments into action.

129
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,360
 But yes, it is true. And you know, Everett was essentially laughed out of mainstream science initially for this theory.

130
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:29,360
 He was summoned to Copenhagen to meet Niels Bohr and Niels Bohr called him incredibly stupid to his face, I believe.

131
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:42,360
 He was invited to meet Niels Bohr in Copenhagen and Niels Bohr rejected the idea outright and he quit being a physicist and became a defense contractor.

132
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,360
 And then it was only later that the idea, which is now more or less considered to be feasible at least, is now accepted.

133
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:59,360
 I've only researched the Titanic. Well, I found out a real conspiracy theory about the Titanic that it was switched with its sister ship the Olympic in an massive insurance scam.

134
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:15,360
 This is not true. I'd like straight. But loads of people have proposed this for a very long time because the Olympic had been in an accident and there are all these theories that the ships were kind of given the old switcheroo and that actually one of them was a thousand tons lighter than it should have been.

135
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:25,360
 And that's because the Olympic was actually a bit of a lighter ship and the Titanic had been bogged up. So yeah, it's it's complete bunk, but there are so many theories about the Titanic.

136
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:35,360
 My favorite Titanic conspiracy theory is the one about the film that actually Titanic the film is about Jack Dawson traveling in time.

137
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
 Yes.

138
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:46,360
 Because he accidentally makes constant reference to stuff that happened after the Titanic sank. There's that famous one where he talks about ice fishing on a lake.

139
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:53,360
 Lake was so tough. Lake was so so, which yeah, wasn't built until about four years later. That's right. It's a man-made lake in Wisconsin.

140
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:04,360
 His backpack is a Swedish army issue from 1939. And his haircut is clearly from the 90s.

141
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:12,360
 The first thing he refers to is a roller coaster on Santa Monica Bay, Santa Monica Beach, which again wasn't built until three years after was he says he's going to take rows on it.

142
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,360
 And, you know, he may have been planning to take rows on it, but how did he know it was going to exist?

143
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
 So it was to be in plans though.

144
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,360
 Oh, you say he's gone through the planning of Santa Monica Bay.

145
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,360
 There's more feasible than he's the time traveller to be honest.

146
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:33,360
 I read some of the same websites as you did, obviously, and the problem with the theory is that he saves rows from committing suicide.

147
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:41,360
 If she had gone overboard, they probably would have stopped the ship and looked for her, and that might have prevented them from hitting that iceberg.

148
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,360
 So he basically cared more about rows than every single other person on that ship put together?

149
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,360
 You know, some people just want to watch the world burn.

150
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,360
 Maybe he was the first titanic tourist. Maybe he was just there to see it happen.

151
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:04,360
 But it did have a collision, almost collision, just as it was leaving Southampton. It was so big that it pulled another ship towards it, the titanic.

152
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
 And it was because of gravitational fields?

153
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,360
 No, because of the wash from that.

154
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:17,360
 But the captain, he very craftily navigated and so avoided a smash and set off on the voyage.

155
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,360
 So if he hadn't, obviously, they would have been delayed by a few hours or a day or something.

156
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,360
 Well, they would have met the ice in daylight, perhaps.

157
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 Hey, speaking of the movie, do you guys know when the first ever movie was made about the titanic?

158
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
 Is that a night to remember?

159
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
 There's no really soon afterwards.

160
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:43,360
 Okay, it was called "saved from the titanic." It was made in 1912, and it was made 29 days after the event happened, after the titanic sank.

161
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,360
 It starred this lady called Dorothy Gibson, and she was an actual survivor of the titanic.

162
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,360
 They talked to Rinsuit, they make her wear the actual dress that she was wearing when she was on the titanic.

163
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,360
 You can even see that there's all these press photos that they've released at the time where she's in the dress to promote the movie.

164
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,360
 And yeah, that exists. Some people said it was amazing. Others said too soon.

165
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
 Too soon.

166
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,360
 Look, I don't blame her. She saw her opportunity.

167
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:20,360
 You know what I mean? I've been on some cruises, I've been an entertainer on some Caribbean cruises, and I don't know.

168
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:32,360
 I was on a cruise at the same time that the Carnival Triumph cruise ship ended up being the most ironically named cruise ship because it was not a party, and it was a pure failure.

169
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:41,360
 Where their electrics went out, and they drifted at sea for five or six days, and it almost immediately turned to Ann or cannibalism.

170
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
 Yeah, practically so.

171
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,360
 People were urinating and defecating in the halls because apparently they didn't realize they were surrounded by an ocean.

172
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:58,360
 And sleeping on deck, because they didn't have air conditioning anymore, and it was a big news story, and I was so angry that I was on this functioning cruise ship.

173
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,360
 Rather than this poop cruise, as it came to be known, because then as soon as I got back, I would be on the today show.

174
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
 You would.

175
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,360
 Minor television personality suffers poop cruising.

176
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,360
 Plus, you could have claimed payment, presumably, for the extra five days that you would have been forced to entertain everyone.

177
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:29,360
 I have this image of me in a fool's carb dancing in front of the self-appointed king of the ship after society has broken down.

178
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
 Skating on feces.

179
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
 Yes, exactly.

180
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:42,360
 Have we ever mentioned the fact, just on Titanic films, that there wasn't any footage when the Titanic left, because it wasn't really that big a deal.

181
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,360
 So people were more excited about the Olympic, which left the year before.

182
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:59,360
 And so there wasn't any actual footage, and when they showed the newsreels of, you know, the Titanic's sunk in cinemas, then they had to use footage of the Olympic, and they just scratched out all the names on it, because they didn't have any footage of Titanic.

183
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
 So when they were like, look at this guy leaving.

184
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
 And they added a license plate that said sink, right?

185
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
 Yes.

186
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
 Oh, that's the one.

187
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:16,360
 Maybe that contributed to the conspiracy about them switching. Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing, because all the stuff I read is that it was a huge event, you know, they said that lots of people turned out to wave it off.

188
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
 I think there was, I think there was a big old policy.

189
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,360
 People turned out, you turned out, yeah, but it was probably like, you know, all the families of the people who were actually going moving to America.

190
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
 People were waving off the poop crews, too.

191
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,360
 If it was marketed as the poop crews, I would wave it off.

192
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:39,360
 And when the Titanic took off, 22 tons of soap and beef and mutton fat were smeared on the slipway to get it into the sea.

193
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
 That sounds delicious.

194
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
 Yeah.

195
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,360
 So there is a man named Andrew Basiago.

196
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,360
 I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name correctly, but it's like a Asiago cheese or Asiago cheese with a bar in front of it.

197
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:05,360
 He is a website called Project Pegasus. He claims that when he was a seven-year-old child in the late 70s, he was recruited by DARPA, which is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,

198
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,360
 to be part of Project Pegasus where there were training children to become time travelers.

199
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,360
 And he was sent back through time several times. He visited Gettysburg.

200
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:23,360
 He went to the Ford Theatre during the time of Lincoln's assassination three times and met himself once there as a child, but he never actually saw the assassination.

201
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,360
 He never made it up to the box in time.

202
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:33,360
 And so that's the thing. You could travel back in time to 1912 to go see the Titanic, but you could get on the wrong ship.

203
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
 I mean, maybe, yeah.

204
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,360
 I think just keep going back until you get the right ship.

205
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,360
 Keep going back and tip us Wade and Usher to take you up to the box, guys.

206
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,360
 But DARPA, of course, did create a whole bunch of crazy things that are not time travel.

207
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,360
 Didn't DARPA invent the internet pretty much?

208
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,360
 Yeah, the ARPA net, it was originally called. The back one, DARPA was ARPA.

209
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,360
 It's changed its name twice, from ARPA to DARPA, then to ARPA, and back to DARPA.

210
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,360
 It sounds like it's invented by Dutz Aseus.

211
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
 And arguably, it's both at the same time.

212
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,360
 Alex Bell, who's in the QI office right now, he's wearing a DARPA t-shirt.

213
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
 So what's that in reference?

214
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:24,360
 No, he's wearing a DARPA initiative t-shirt from the TV show Lost, which also dealt with a lot of time travel.

215
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:35,360
 And in specifically, it embraced a kind of obscure principle about time travel, because obviously time travel introduces a lot of paradoxes in the various thought experiments.

216
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:48,360
 And one of the explanations to get around paradoxes is the Novikov self-consistency principle, which was used in Lost to explain you can't change the past, because we were here.

217
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
 That's the time travel happened, and we were here.

218
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,360
 So what we did is what happened.

219
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,360
 And nothing, it's basically, there's, do you see what I mean?

220
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:04,360
 I do, but I'd like to refer you to back to the future too, which makes it very clear how you can end up in a different future where Donald Trump is president.

221
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:15,360
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

222
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:24,360
 Okay, my fact this week is that during the Californian gold rush, a pair of boots could cost the equivalent of $2,300 in today's money.

223
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
 Was it one specific pair?

224
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
 Oh, it was.

225
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
 Yeah.

226
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:39,360
 No, it was any pair, and this is what happened, because they were so much in the middle of nowhere, and because the population had got so high and sort of shot them out of time, and they just didn't have provisions.

227
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
 People just had to pay top dollar for everything.

228
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
 And there's loads of examples of this.

229
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,360
 An individual lemon would sell for the equivalent of $20 today.

230
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
 What is this?

231
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,360
 Yes.

232
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:58,360
 Presumably, most people hadn't found gold, right? Because it was only as small percentage of people who actually struck really lucky. So did most people just not go without lemons?

233
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:06,360
 People would find bits of gold, but yeah, basically you could become rich doing anything, apart from looking for gold.

234
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 Really, in that time, everyone else made a shitloads of money, and the people who actually went looking for gold, one or two people did, but mostly struggled.

235
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,360
 They would do just as badly as they did when they were doing whatever else they did.

236
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:26,360
 So for instance, there was a farmer who sold onions, who made $160,000 in 1849, just for selling onions.

237
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,360
 How do you know how much that is per onion, and how that compares to the lemon?

238
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
 I don't know.

239
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
 Lemon has to be more than I think, right?

240
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,360
 The good thing about lemons is it cures scurvy, or stops scurvy.

241
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
 Right, exactly.

242
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
 Yeah.

243
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,360
 How long did this last for?

244
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:49,360
 So everyone was broke? Well, so it started the gold rush in '48, 1848, and it went on for about three or four years.

245
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,360
 But you know, there's still some people looking for gold out there now.

246
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
 Still have to try.

247
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,360
 I bought these boots.

248
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,360
 I'm going to get the bloody mullies where all the farms were abandoned, weren't they?

249
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,360
 So this has been another reason why food was really expensive is people just left their farms.

250
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,360
 So as a result, land goes followed, all the food has to be imported.

251
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,360
 The other thing is there were basically no women around, and they at that time were doing all the cooking.

252
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,360
 So the men were just going out to eat all the time, they weren't going home.

253
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,360
 Yeah, 75% of men in California gave up their jobs to become gold prospectors.

254
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
 Whoa!

255
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:29,360
 And one in 100 men in the whole of America became gold prospectors, whether that was already living in California or making the trek.

256
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,360
 San Francisco was built with wood from the ships that people took to get to the gold rush.

257
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
 Yeah, that's so cool.

258
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,360
 They abandoned their boats as soon as they got there, and there was such a housing boom they ran out of lumber,

259
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
 and they chopped the ships up.

260
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
 Yeah.

261
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,360
 That would be the one guy who actually was coming back for your ship.

262
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
 Yeah.

263
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,360
 And we parked in harbors sea.

264
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
 We're in harbors sea.

265
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
 This is number five.

266
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,360
 It's become a house.

267
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,360
 So the first millionaire in California was a guy called Sam Brannon.

268
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
 He was a journalist.

269
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,360
 He owned a star, and he also had a star which kind of sold provisions.

270
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,360
 And then someone came into his star with some gold to buy some, you know, shovels and whatever.

271
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
 And he realized that they had found gold.

272
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:20,360
 And so what he did, instead of going out to find gold himself, he smartly went round all the shops, bought all the shovels,

273
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:27,360
 all the pickaxes, all the pans, everything that you would need, put them in his shop, and then went into town going this gold and then their hills.

274
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,360
 Everyone went crazy, went, "Oh no, we need a shovel." He's like, "Well, I know where you can get a shovel, my shop."

275
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,360
 And so he became a millionaire from selling provisions to idiots.

276
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
 The shovel millionaire.

277
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
 Yeah.

278
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
 Very clever.

279
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
 That's not.

280
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
 Not as exciting as going and mining for gold though.

281
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
 No.

282
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,360
 I would have been one of the gold idiots.

283
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
 I went mining for gold the other day.

284
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
 Did you?

285
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
 In Alaska, yeah.

286
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
 How did you do it?

287
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
 Were you panning?

288
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
 Panning, yeah.

289
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
 Nice. Did you find any?

290
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,360
 I only found the ones that they deliberately put in for tourists to fight.

291
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,360
 It is chocolate gold, not guys.

292
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
 They put light-tidy flakes in.

293
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
 How much did the pan cost? $5,000.

294
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,360
 Were you in chicken by any chance?

295
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
 Chicken, no, I was in Juneau.

296
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,360
 Oh, chicken is another place in Alaska where you get a lot of panning for gold.

297
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
 Is it?

298
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,360
 As a population is 23 in winter?

299
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
 Seven.

300
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
 But when is...

301
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
 But when is...

302
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
 But in panning season, it goes up to hundreds.

303
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,360
 Juneau, Alaska, which is the capital of Alaska, is not accessible by road from the United States.

304
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
 That's right.

305
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
 You can only fly there.

306
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
 Or get a boat.

307
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
 Or get a boat.

308
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
 Or get a boat, yes, I suppose.

309
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,360
 If you've still got a boat, I'm right.

310
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
 So you haven't turned it into a house in San Francisco.

311
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
 You can supposedly take a boat.

312
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:44,360
 Actually, when I was in Juneau, you kind of see that all the cruise ships come in and the population just goes massive during the day.

313
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,360
 And then everyone gets back on the boats and then even in its empty.

314
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,360
 And is that paranoia about people turning their boats into houses?

315
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
 It's like if we don't go back here every day.

316
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,360
 No, you've got to have a poo somewhere and you've got to go on the deck of your ship.

317
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,360
 Just going back to Juneau because I was there last week.

318
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
 There's a bar there.

319
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
 It's very old bar.

320
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,360
 And they've kind of got a history of gold miners used to go there.

321
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
 And they have sawdust on the floor.

322
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
 And apparently this is what they always used to do.

323
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
 Have sawdust on the floor of miners' bars.

324
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
 I thought that was a so-called vomit.

325
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
 Yeah, right.

326
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
 You would think that.

327
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,360
 But actually, apparently the reason was, so they would pay for their drinks with little bits of gold.

328
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,360
 But obviously, once you're drunk, you're going to drop your bits of gold, aren't you?

329
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,360
 But if you drop them into sawdust, then you won't be able to find them.

330
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
 So you would drop them there.

331
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,360
 And then the next morning, the owner of the tavern would kind of sweep up all of the sawdust.

332
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,360
 To put it in water, the sawdust would float, but the gold would sink.

333
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,360
 And they'd get the gold out and they'd get loads more gold.

334
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,360
 The same principle as why all entertainment for the gold miners was ball ponds.

335
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,360
 Get the miners in the ball ponds, they drop all their gold.

336
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
 Can't find them among the balls.

337
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,360
 There was a little moment of cultural translation there.

338
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
 Yeah, sorry.

339
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
 What are they?

340
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
 Ball pits.

341
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,360
 Would their ball pits here as well?

342
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,360
 I would say that.

343
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
 Really?

344
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
 Yeah.

345
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
 We had one in my garden as a boy.

346
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
 We had a ball pit.

347
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
 Ball ponds.

348
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 It sounds the ball lake was further down at the end of the ground.

349
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,360
 That sounds much more gracious than ball pit.

350
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
 Ball ponds, surely.

351
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,360
 Okay, I'll go through those children in the ball hole.

352
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,360
 Another one of these businessmen who set up a business to profit was Levi Strauss.

353
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
 Yeah, yeah.

354
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
 Yeah, yeah.

355
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
 So he came over.

356
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,360
 He was selling canvas tarps so that they could take out there.

357
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
 And then as a result, the business started booming.

358
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
 And then he got into Levi jeans.

359
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,360
 Now we have your presumably wearing Levi jeans.

360
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
 Oh, no.

361
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
 Why would you presume that?

362
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
 I assume all jeans are Levi jeans.

363
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
 What?

364
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
 I presume it's fashion for me.

365
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
 Misplaced.

366
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,360
 Yeah, so Levi jeans.

367
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
 Sort of an option.

368
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
 Because the miners were very fashion conscious.

369
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
 Yeah.

370
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
 Got a bit good with your gold.

371
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
 They needed clothes with rivets on them.

372
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,360
 It's okay just to remove the crotch rivet, I think.

373
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
 Didn't they?

374
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
 There was a crotch rivet.

375
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
 Oh, you mean the decades?

376
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,360
 They kept the tradition of having the crotch rivet.

377
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,360
 As opposed to it took actual hours to get lost.

378
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,360
 Let me just slip out of these trousers.

379
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
 One match.

380
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,360
 Another item of clothing that people needed actually

381
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,360
 was egg carrying jackets.

382
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,360
 Because the gold rush was quickly followed by the egg rush.

383
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
 And this was.

384
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
 Gold.

385
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,360
 That's everyone running back to the cruise ship, isn't it?

386
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
 Yes.

387
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
 No, this was.

388
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
 They needed some protein to get their mining done.

389
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
 And so they ran out of eggs quite quickly.

390
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,360
 And someone spotted that on the Ferralan Islands,

391
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,360
 which was just off San Francisco, there were these seabirds

392
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
 that laid these gigantic eggs.

393
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
 Apparently they were twice the size of chickens' eggs.

394
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,360
 And they laid red-yoke and transparent-wited eggs.

395
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
 But they were in high demand.

396
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,360
 And it was incredibly dangerous to get to these islands.

397
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,360
 They were full of great white sharks, the waters around them.

398
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
 And extremely turbulent seas.

399
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
 But people went there and they harvested these eggs.

400
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
 And obviously they could sell the eggs.

401
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,360
 It was a huge price because no one else was getting eggs.

402
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
 Like lemon-style prices.

403
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
 Exactly.

404
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,360
 They were up there with the lemon island was next door.

405
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
 But what they used to do was they used to get there,

406
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,360
 get all the eggs they could into their specially-made egg jackets,

407
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
 which had lots of pockets for eggs.

408
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,360
 And then they'd smash all the other eggs on the island

409
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:26,360
 because they wanted to keep it scarce.

410
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,360
 No, in fact, because they'd come back the next day.

411
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
 But they needed to know which ones were the fresh ones.

412
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,360
 So they smashed the ones that had been there before.

413
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
 Yeah, there was.

414
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
 Oh yeah, clever, right?

415
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,360
 Anyway, then there were these egg wars in the early 50s

416
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
 because it was taken over by one private company,

417
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,360
 this island, and then another company tried to invade.

418
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
 Do they still exist?

419
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
 I'm sorry to interrupt you a bit.

420
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
 Do they still exist?

421
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
 I really want to know.

422
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
 I don't know if anyone's ever had one of these giant--

423
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,360
 And what kind of seabird are we talking about here?

424
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
 It's a kind of-- it looks like a penguin.

425
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
 And it's called a common-mer.

426
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,360
 M-U-D-R-E.

427
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
 Common-mer.

428
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,360
 Yeah, it's kind of an unpleasant name for what provided

429
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
 quite a valuable--

430
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
 I guess that's where the name Moralats comes from.

431
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
 We'll be a small version.

432
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
 Is it a demo?

433
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,360
 Yeah.

434
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
 Have you heard of a Hangtown Fry?

435
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,360
 No.

436
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,360
 The Hangtown Fry is something you get in San Francisco.

437
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,360
 And it is-- it's derived from the Gold Rush.

438
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
 It's an egg dish.

439
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,360
 And the legend, again, we're dealing with legends here,

440
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,360
 is that when someone struck it big in the Gold Rush,

441
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,360
 they would-- someone went in and ordered--

442
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,360
 I'd just give me anything that involves the most expensive things

443
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
 you have.

444
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,360
 So a Hangtown Fry was an omelette made of expensive eggs

445
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,360
 and mixed with bacon, which was shipped in from the east,

446
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
 and fried oysters on top.

447
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
 Oh, yeah.

448
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
 And served in a pair of boots.

449
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,360
 Serve in a pair of golden boots.

450
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,360
 And it was originally in Placerville, California,

451
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,360
 which was then known as Hangtown,

452
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,360
 because they hanged a lot of people there.

453
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
 Justice was harsh in Placerville.

454
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,360
 I'd give my desirable breakfast a different name, I think,

455
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,360
 that didn't have so much association with kidding people.

456
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
 It's kind of got cowboys sound to it, I suppose.

457
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,360
 I suppose people of the west are weird.

458
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
 Yeah.

459
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,360
 They want vengeance with their breakfast.

460
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,360
 That sounds a good film name.

461
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
 Vengeance with breakfast.

462
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
 Vengeance for breakfast.

463
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
 I'm going to cook it.

464
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
 They smash all the other eggs in the kitchen.

465
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
 That's right.

466
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,360
 Just to make sure.

467
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,360
 So were there a lot of rushes in that period?

468
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
 Like egg rush, gold rush?

469
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,360
 I read that there was a silver rush, which was in Calico,

470
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
 which is now a ghost town.

471
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
 Anything else?

472
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,360
 There was another gold rush, which Melbourne was casually

473
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
 not making too much fuss about down under,

474
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,360
 but Melbourne became the richest city in the world in the 1850s,

475
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,360
 I think, because they had a gold rush.

476
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
 Gold was found there.

477
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,360
 And people did better in Melbourne than in San Francisco.

478
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,360
 It seems like there were fewer of them.

479
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
 So maybe that helps.

480
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,360
 There was a thing in Australia where in the west of Australia,

481
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,360
 in Calgurli, sorry, Calgurli.

482
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
 I can't say it.

483
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,360
 Calgurli.

484
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,360
 Calgurli.

485
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
 Calgurli?

486
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
 Calgurli.

487
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,360
 I thought it was Calgurli.

488
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,360
 Chicago.

489
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,360
 Calgurli wouldn't be what I said.

490
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
 Calgurli.

491
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,360
 So this in western Australia,

492
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,360
 and they had a similar sort of gold rush,

493
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,360
 but what they didn't notice was there's a different type of gold,

494
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
 which is it just wasn't recognized as gold,

495
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,360
 probably at the time, because it wasn't shiny and it wasn't gold.

496
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,360
 Anyway, the point is, is that they thought it was a bit of a waste rock,

497
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
 so they were paving the streets with it.

498
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,360
 And suddenly they discovered that it was an element of gold inside it,

499
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,360
 so suddenly they realized that they'd been paving the streets with gold effectively.

500
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,360
 And so all the roads would dug up,

501
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,360
 and they would then collecting it and making lots of money.

502
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,360
 Are you sure that sounds a bit like a lie you've been spun by your jewelry dealer

503
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
 for the engagement ring?

504
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
 It's a different type of gold.

505
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
 It's not shiny.

506
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,360
 It may look like Tom Act to you, sir, but actually...

507
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
 She'll love it.

508
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
 I have heard of that Calgurli thing, actually.

509
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
 I think it is.

510
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,360
 If you do ever go on a Caribbean cruise,

511
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,360
 prepare for a lot of seminars on Tanzanite,

512
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
 the mineral of the future.

513
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
 Oh, yeah.

514
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,360
 They are really?

515
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
 They are really pushing Tanzanite hard.

516
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,360
 Is that what you were entertaining people with on your cruise?

517
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
 I was a Tanzanite salesman.

518
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,360
 I just thought of another rush.

519
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,360
 There was an Alpaca rush in America.

520
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,360
 Oh, no.

521
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
 Let me tell you, yeah, that was a big deal.

522
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,360
 I think a lot of people lost a lot of money on the Alpaca rush.

523
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,360
 Yeah, and that's not that long ago, maybe 15 years ago or so.

524
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
 How do you mind for Alpacas?

525
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,360
 This is people's Alpaca rights, it's called.

526
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,360
 I'm from New England, and in Western New England,

527
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,360
 there was a huge llama and Alpaca boom.

528
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,360
 People started raising Alpacas and llamas for their fur

529
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
 to make into textiles and yarn and junk.

530
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,360
 And they're also adorably dumb to look at.

531
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
 Oh, my God.

532
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
 They're my favorite animal.

533
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
 If any fans want to get me a present, get me a llama.

534
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
 Well, they found them quite intensively,

535
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
 and so they're not that intensively.

536
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
 You don't see it all this.

537
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
 It's a country alpha.

538
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
 Yeah, shit.

539
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
 It's full of Alpacas.

540
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
 It's totally the stuff.

541
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,360
 You did see them, though, in Western Massachusetts and throughout the United States.

542
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,360
 There was a huge boom in Alpaca farming.

543
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,360
 And then it went Alpaca bust.

544
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:20,360
 And people were buying Alpacas from South America for tens of thousands of dollars,

545
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,360
 and then they were selling them for $1,500 or something like that,

546
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
 just for all the market collapse.

547
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,360
 Yeah, it was the case that you would be able to buy a young Alpaca

548
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,360
 and then grow it up, and then you make a load of money.

549
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
 But that was only for about a couple of years.

550
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,360
 And then suddenly people realized these things

551
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,360
 that definitely not worth that much money.

552
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
 I'm a bit like Chewlick Bay near, I guess.

553
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,360
 But I'll pay anything for them, seriously.

554
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
 Do you live in an apartment?

555
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,360
 Yeah.

556
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
 Let me recommend a Vaikunya.

557
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
 What's that?

558
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,360
 It's the smallest of the llamas.

559
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
 Okay.

560
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,360
 Thank you.

561
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,360
 It's more of a lap llama.

562
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
 You know what I mean?

563
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
 It's such a good tip.

564
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,360
 Yeah, because we've only got one small sofa,

565
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
 and there's already two of us.

566
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
 It's a little happily with a Vaikunya.

567
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
 Okay.

568
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
 Thank you.

569
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,360
 Just sit on the llama that you've got two sofas right there.

570
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
 Oh, yeah.

571
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
 Yeah.

572
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
 That's a really good, but a llama is a sofa.

573
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,360
 You're not really allowed to use them.

574
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,360
 You shouldn't use them as sofas.

575
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,360
 But also, I don't think you're allowed to sit on their backs

576
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,360
 because they snap.

577
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,360
 Oh, yeah, they're mean creatures.

578
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,360
 No, sorry.

579
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,360
 Get the fuck off me.

580
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,360
 You're saying that I would break a llama in half

581
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
 if I sat on that thing?

582
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,360
 I'm not saying anything about anybody, but I am saying that you can damage their backs.

583
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,360
 There are photos of Edwardian gentlemen having a great time sitting on llamas,

584
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,360
 but I think the current medical advice says we shouldn't.

585
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,360
 They're among the gentlest of the vertebrates.

586
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,360
 [laughter]

587
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,360
 [music]

588
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,360
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

589
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,360
 My fact is that the area of Australia owned by British people

590
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,360
 is larger than Britain.

591
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,360
 That's amazing.

592
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,360
 Oh, fucking car parker, my fact.

593
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
 I was a real car parker.

594
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
 I'll take this moment apart.

595
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,360
 You made your opinion.

596
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
 Oh, that's alright.

597
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,360
 [laughter]

598
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
 Mm-hmm.

599
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
 I see.

600
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
 That's a great fact, Andy.

601
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,360
 Thank you very much, James.

602
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
 What I'll tell you.

603
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,360
 So what this means is basically Australia is absolutely massive

604
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,360
 and they've just done a survey of sort of foreign land ownership

605
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,360
 because there's been a lot of gaffafel about this in Australia.

606
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,360
 And the amount owned by British companies is 27.5 million hectares

607
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,360
 and Britain itself is only 24 million hectares.

608
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,360
 Although, I mean, technically one British person owns the whole of Australia, right?

609
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,360
 Technically, none of these people own the land.

610
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,360
 They're just leasing it from Her Majesty the Queen.

611
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
 To the Queen, yes, yes.

612
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
 That's true.

613
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:57,360
 The largest non-state non-monarchy private land holding on earth

614
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:03,360
 is this family called the Kidmans, who they own a bit of Australia,

615
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
 which is larger than Scotland.

616
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
 It's larger than Hungary.

617
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,360
 It's three quarters of the size of England.

618
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
 Wow.

619
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,360
 And they recently tried to put it up a sale.

620
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,360
 It was founded by a man called Sidney Kidman in 1899,

621
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,360
 who went off as a teenager with a one-eyed horse.

622
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,360
 We founded a load of these castle stations all over Australia.

623
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
 It went up for sale last year.

624
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,360
 It would have taken about a week, just to visit the property,

625
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,360
 because it's in a few different places.

626
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
 You'd have to have a plane between them all.

627
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,360
 Yeah, only 150 people live there.

628
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,360
 It's basically a series of massive cattle stations out in the...

629
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
 Yeah.

630
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
 I think it's the Outback.

631
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,360
 I'm not quite sure where the Outback begins and ends.

632
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
 Yeah.

633
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
 And didn't they try and sell it recently?

634
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
 They tried to sell it, but the stock denied.

635
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,360
 It was blocked, because they were selling it to a Chinese majority owned consortium.

636
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,360
 And the Australian government said, "No, no, you're not allowed to do that.

637
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,360
 I'm trying to keep it Australian owned."

638
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,360
 I read a headline about the largest foreign landowner in China being IKEA.

639
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
 Oh, really?

640
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,360
 I'm not really sure what this means, but according to a Reuters report

641
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,360
 from a couple of years ago, IKEA was the biggest foreign landowner in China

642
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,360
 with 6.89 million square feet,

643
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,360
 which doesn't seem like very much compared to 29 million hectares.

644
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
 No.

645
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,360
 But maybe it's bullshit.

646
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,360
 That might just be one massive branch of IKEA.

647
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
 Yeah, right.

648
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,360
 It actually takes a week to get round the hole.

649
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,360
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

650
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,360
 The largest electoral district in Australia is bigger than Mongolia.

651
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,360
 What a swap.

652
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,360
 Yeah.

653
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,360
 It's called Jirak, and it's in Westerns in WA.

654
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,360
 Uh-huh.

655
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,360
 And yeah, it's slightly bigger than Mongolia.

656
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
 I should have written down those figures.

657
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,360
 It's about 1,000 km squared, bigger than the square plumber area of Mongolia.

658
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,360
 Wow.

659
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,360
 I just can't believe it, because Mongolia is massive.

660
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
 It's huge.

661
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
 I know.

662
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
 I don't get it.

663
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,360
 I read in 1933 that Western Australia voted to leave Australia.

664
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,360
 So like a Brexit, they just said we don't want to be a part of Australia anymore.

665
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
 They did the vote.

666
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
 It was successful.

667
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,360
 And then they just Australia said, no, we're not letting you do it.

668
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,360
 It was a poll, I think, wasn't it?

669
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
 Yeah, yeah.

670
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,360
 So it wasn't a vote.

671
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
 It was to see if they would want to leave.

672
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,360
 And then I think they said they would.

673
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,360
 So the government was like, cool, let's not have an election on that.

674
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,360
 It was just advisory.

675
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
 Yes.

676
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,360
 Western Australia, I wrote down that it's got 2.6 million people,

677
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,360
 over 2.5 million square kilometers.

678
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,360
 And most of those people are all crammed into.

679
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
 Is Perth Western Australia?

680
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,360
 Yeah.

681
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,360
 So basically everyone there is in Perth.

682
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
 Yeah.

683
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,360
 And there's a town called Kimberley, which has a population of 3rd,

684
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,360
 the size of Wembley Stadium, Wemful,

685
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,360
 but is 3 times the size of England.

686
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
 Oh, cool.

687
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
 I've stayed in Kimberley.

688
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
 I have you.

689
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
 Yeah, my grandmother lived there.

690
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
 Did she?

691
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
 And I went panning for gold there.

693
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
 Did you?

694
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
 Yeah.

695
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
 What a weird connection.

696
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,360
 Yeah.

697
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,360
 So it's a place where they get uples.

698
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,360
 And I think they have a lot of people living underground there,

699
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
 because it's so hot.

700
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
 Oh, yes.

701
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,360
 All the opal miners all live underground.

702
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,360
 Yeah, so the heat is so great that they've decided,

703
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,360
 okay, let's actually just build underground.

704
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,360
 So you go and you can see these amazing pictures online of just everyone's houses.

705
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,360
 I mean, they're not that amazing, because they just look like a lounge room,

706
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
 but they're underground.

707
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,360
 So it's, yeah, you have to picture that bit in your head when you're going.

708
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
 I was feeling they might have a golf course,

709
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,360
 you'd only play at night time, because it's too hot during the day.

710
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,360
 But I might have made that up.

711
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,360
 Well, at least golf survives.

712
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,360
 It is the ultimate survivor.

713
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
 It'll be there after the apocalypse.

714
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
 It's so hot.

715
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,360
 Do they have grass?

716
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
 Or is it one massive bunker?

717
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,360
 Yeah, it's a sand course.

718
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,360
 I think it's compacted sand, yeah.

719
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,360
 They also have a ball pond, but all the balls evaporated.

720
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:37,360
 Because Australia sells sand to Saudi Arabia, isn't it?

721
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,360
 Sand and camels, because Saudi Arabia's sand doesn't work for building in.

722
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
 And its camels don't work for easing.

723
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
 So Australia's got plenty extra.

724
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,360
 I saw, I saw, I went, my sister lives in Abu Dhabi,

725
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,360
 and we went on a kind of desert trek, and you can go and ride on camels and see the camels.

726
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,360
 So you go on these four by four cars, you get to the bit.

727
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,360
 And what they have is this kind of edge of a huge sand june,

728
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,360
 where they lead the camel to, and they point it backwards,

729
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,360
 and the camel poos off the edge.

730
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,360
 And they tell you, go look at the amazing toilet of the camels,

731
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,360
 and you walk to the edge of this sand june,

732
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,360
 and you just see this terrifying shit world just below you.

733
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,360
 But what they don't tell you is that obviously...

734
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,360
 They're very much the ships of the desert.

735
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:24,360
 But yeah, some people were almost falling off the edge right into it,

736
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,360
 because you're on the lip of a sand june.

737
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,360
 If someone said, sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.

738
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,360
 If someone said to me, go over to that cliff,

739
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,360
 and look at a bunch of camel poos.

740
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,360
 I would say no, thank you.

741
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,360
 I'm fine here.

742
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
 I believe you that it's there.

743
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,360
 To us, the traction is a few and far between there, I believe.

744
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,360
 I suppose so.

745
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,360
 Was it impressive, that, what'd you say?

746
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,360
 Yeah, it was amazing.

747
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
 Yeah, yeah.

748
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,360
 It was a huge mound of poos.

749
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,360
 On the edge of a sand june, it was incredible.

750
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
 Sounds good.

751
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,360
 Some more bits about Australia's level of hugeness and isolation.

752
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,360
 The most isolated post office in Australia is also in Western Australia.

753
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,360
 It's 32 kilometres from the nearest customer.

754
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,360
 So everyone who uses that post office is having to drive 32 kilometres.

755
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
 Wow.

756
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,360
 Might as well just keep going.

757
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
 Delivery already yourself.

758
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,360
 Have you heard of the School of the Air?

759
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
 No.

760
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,360
 This is a school for Australian children who live in such remote places

761
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,360
 that it's absolutely impossible to get them to a school, basically.

762
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,360
 And it used to be done over the radio.

763
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,360
 You'd have an hour of lessons.

764
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,360
 And then you'd have a workbook which you would complete with an older brother

765
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
 or a parent or something like that.

766
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
 And now, these days, of course, they do it over the internet.

767
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
 But this is the thing that happens.

768
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
 There are children educated this day.

769
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,360
 But did a teacher then have to drive 200,000 miles around everyone's houses

770
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
 to do the marketing?

771
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,360
 Yes.

772
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:52,360
 I have a hat for a place that's called Mystery Island, which is off of Vanuatu.

773
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
 And it's a hat that says Mystery Island.

774
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,360
 They have a big sign of seeing pictures of it.

775
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
 They have to go there.

776
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
 And he used to do cruises.

777
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
 So he was the comedian on a cruise.

778
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,360
 Last time he went, they were told that Mystery Island no longer exists.

779
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,360
 There was something to do with a tsunami that had hit somewhere

780
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,360
 and the ocean level, it just took it down.

781
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,360
 What made it mysterious before it disappeared?

782
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,360
 That's pretty much the most mysterious thing I can think of.

783
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,360
 I think it was because the way it was positioned that if you came into rough seas,

784
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,360
 the seas were so rough that it was impossible to get to the land.

785
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,360
 And the land was actually--

786
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
 Oh, I see.

787
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,360
 Smash, so it's a Mystery Island because you never knew when you could get on board it.

788
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,360
 Oh, a time traveler resisted it and named it from the future,

789
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,360
 knowing that it was going to mysterious things.

790
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, possibly.

791
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
 Yeah.

792
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,360
 But I went on TripAdvisor and it's reappeared.

793
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
 So Mystery Island is back.

794
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,360
 Do you know something that's under Australia?

795
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
 New Zealand.

796
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
 No.

797
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,360
 Yeah.

798
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,360
 It's the world's longest natural electric current.

799
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,360
 It's more than 6,000 kilometers long.

800
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,360
 You can see a map of it.

801
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,360
 The enormous line stretching all the way under the continent and then carving out.

802
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
 Wow.

803
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
 Yeah, it's caused by the Earth's magnetic field as it shifts.

804
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,360
 It generates this current.

805
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,360
 Unfortunately, it's very weak and could not light a lamp.

806
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
 [LAUGHTER]

807
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
 So it's really pathetic, but it is there.

808
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
 It is massive.

809
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
 Wow.

810
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,360
 Did you see in the news that Australia's GPS is five feet off?

811
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,360
 Yes.

812
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,360
 It's incredible.

813
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,360
 So it's been shifting faster than people were expecting.

814
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,360
 So it's something like seven centimeters a year.

815
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,360
 Yes.

816
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,360
 It's been going.

817
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
 So now it's five feet in the wrong spots.

818
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,360
 So you have now reached your destination.

819
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
 No, I haven't.

820
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
 [LAUGHTER]

821
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,360
 All of Australia's moving seven centimeters a year.

822
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,360
 Yeah.

823
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,360
 They knew it was going to happen.

824
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,360
 It's just that GPS is aware of this and knows it has to update regularly.

825
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,360
 So the last amount of data was 1992, I think.

826
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,360
 Oh, people kept on clicking delay.

827
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
 I'll update later.

828
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,360
 I'll do it tomorrow.

829
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
 Yes, particularly.

830
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
 Since 1992.

831
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
 Yeah.

832
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,360
 But it could be quite dangerous because if there's a robot trucks in future, for instance,

833
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,360
 could use GPS to be transported around.

834
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,360
 And they could be driving on the wrong side of the road if they're a few centimeters out.

835
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
 Yeah.

836
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,360
 Yeah.

837
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
 Head on collisions.

838
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
 Is it the case?

839
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,360
 Did you read in the story that that's faster than most other places?

840
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,360
 All other continents.

841
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,360
 Is the fastest moving continent.

842
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
 Really?

843
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
 Yeah.

844
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,360
 Yeah.

845
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,360
 It's running a escarper from New Zealand like nobody's business.

846
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,360
 Seven centimeters a year.

847
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
 I think it was that.

848
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,360
 That's what I read.

849
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
 Yeah.

850
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
 Still very much.

851
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
 It's not too much.

852
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,360
 [LAUGHTER]

853
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
 You know you're a huge continent.

854
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,360
 You know it's some credit.

855
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,360
 Does Australia have any land ownership anywhere else in the world?

856
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,360
 They have some islands, don't they?

857
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,360
 Yeah, but in kind of surround.

858
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,360
 Is there any, like, just Canada, somewhere in Canada, kind of thing?

859
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,360
 Have we got anything?

860
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,360
 Yeah, I don't know.

861
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
 Yeah, just a little--

862
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,360
 I think they own Slau.

863
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,360
 Supes on all of Australia?

864
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,360
 Yeah.

865
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,360
 Oh, just curious.

866
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,360
 No, I don't think so.

867
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,360
 Oh, they claim a kind of a pie piece of Antarctica.

868
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,360
 Yeah.

869
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,360
 Oh, yeah.

870
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,360
 Well, actually--

871
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,360
 There's a bunch of others.

872
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:48,360
 If you add together that and all the rest of the stuff, the Queenones,

873
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,360
 then the Russian Federation is no longer the largest single political entity on Earth.

874
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,360
 But Russia also claims all of the North Pole and some of the South Pole as well.

875
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,360
 Yes.

876
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,360
 Oh, well, there we go.

877
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
 I boast of Eastern Europe.

878
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,360
 [LAUGHTER]

879
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
 You'll move, Queenie.

880
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
 [LAUGHTER]

881
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:12,360
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

882
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,360
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

883
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,360
 And that is Chazinski.

884
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:24,360
 My fact is that in the first half of the 20th century, multiple countries considered draining the Mediterranean Sea.

885
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,360
 And this is something--

886
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,360
 Sure.

887
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,360
 Yeah, why not?

888
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,360
 Were they looking for the lost city of Atlantis?

889
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,360
 They weren't, although weirdly, the new continent that it created was going to be called Atlantropa.

890
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,360
 So this was the brainchild of an architect.

891
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,360
 A German architect called Herman Sorgl.

892
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,360
 And he was promoting this from 1928 until he died in 1952.

893
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:49,360
 And he had this vision of world peace and thought almost emptying the med was the way to do it.

894
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,360
 So he wouldn't completely empty it.

895
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,360
 But it would decrease in level by like 100 to 200 meters.

896
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,360
 Is this the idea of, like, will all come together if I cause an ecological catastrophe?

897
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,360
 [LAUGHTER]

898
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,360
 In a crisis, people work together.

899
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,360
 It was the idea that we could use a lot of the land.

900
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:14,360
 So obviously, we know there was a problem with Laban Schraum and living space around that time.

901
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,360
 And Europe wanted to expand its population into different places.

902
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,360
 So it was the idea of creating all this new land.

903
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,360
 I'd say there was a perceived problem with that.

904
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,360
 All right, we know who's side you're on.

905
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,360
 The Allies?

906
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,360
 Exactly.

907
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360
 [LAUGHTER]

908
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,360
 Still going with that old team?

909
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,360
 Getting an inkling as to who's side you're on, eh?

910
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,360
 To be fair, Faradah, they're also called the Allies.

911
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,360
 They're just her allies.

912
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,360
 Well, actually, so this guy wrote a bunch of books promoting this idea.

913
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:49,360
 And he had a quote from Hitler on the fly leaf of one of his books in 1938, which was...

914
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,360
 Could not put it down.

915
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,360
 [LAUGHTER]

916
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,360
 So how were they going to drain the Mediterranean pull the plug?

917
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,360
 Um, he was going to... it was going to take a long time.

918
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,360
 I think it was going to take 150 years.

919
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,360
 [LAUGHTER]

920
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,360
 Just buckets.

921
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,360
 [LAUGHTER]

922
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,360
 The idea was damning up all the places where water could get in.

923
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:20,360
 So dam up the strait of Gibraltar, dam up the Dardanelles, dam up the bit between Tunisia and Sicily.

924
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,360
 And eventually, water would stop coming into the Mediterranean, it would dry up.

925
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:28,360
 And also, all these dams would be the locations of huge hydroelectric power plants.

926
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,360
 And so the power generated by them would provide power for everyone.

927
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,360
 And the final advantage of his plan was that it would be so costly for all countries that signed up

928
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,360
 and all countries would have to sign up that they wouldn't have any money to fight each other after that.

929
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,360
 [LAUGHTER]

930
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:49,360
 And he said, if any country starts threatening peace, then their hydroelectric power would be cut off.

931
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,360
 The idea was that the power would be a central control.

932
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
 Exactly.

933
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,360
 The U.N.

934
00:46:53,360 --> 00:47:00,360
 It's literally administered. Yeah, yeah. So there wasn't disadvantage. Wasn't it going to turn a lot of North Africa into a massive inland lake?

935
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,360
 Yes, it was.

936
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,360
 So I need to have advantage, though.

937
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,360
 Well, it didn't enter into his plans that quite a lot of people lived in North Africa.

938
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,360
 Sure.

939
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,360
 Well, I'm not sure he thought of it that way.

940
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,360
 But actually, there have been plans to turn a lot of North Africa into a lake.

941
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,360
 Anyway, like separate plants.

942
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,360
 Really?

943
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,360
 So how and see people have been suggesting this.

944
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,360
 Actually, the French government, when they owned a lot of North Africa, looked into it properly.

945
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,360
 And what they found is there's quite a few depressions in the Sahara that are under kind of sea level.

946
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,360
 And they thought maybe we could get some water in there.

947
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:37,360
 And it would instead of being a desert, would become a place where people could live more comfortably.

948
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,360
 It would be a desert with a lake in it.

949
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,360
 That's probably true.

950
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:48,360
 But they actually had some funding, but it was withdrawn when surveys revealed that many areas were not as far below sea level as had been believed.

951
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:53,360
 So they thought these depressions were below sea level, but actually they were higher because they were in high land.

952
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,360
 Do you know about the last time that the Mediterranean dried up?

953
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,360
 No.

954
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,360
 This was a thing called the Messinian Salinity Crisis, which happened six million years.

955
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,360
 It was right off the tongue.

956
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,360
 Yeah.

957
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,360
 They need some branding.

958
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,360
 It became a landlock.

959
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,360
 That's it.

960
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,360
 Spain and Morocco crashed into each other, basically.

961
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,360
 Seven centimeters per year.

962
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
 Yeah, pretty slow.

963
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,360
 But the line was seven centimeters away from them.

964
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,360
 You just don't think ahead, darling.

965
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,360
 And so the climate is really dry.

966
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,360
 And so the med is proged a lot of evaporation.

967
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:32,360
 And as a result of that drying process, there are salt deposits on the bottom of the med,

968
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,360
 which in some places are two miles thick.

969
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,360
 Whoa.

970
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,360
 Yeah.

971
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,360
 And during the time it was closing when they were moving towards each other,

972
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,360
 the basin of the med evaporated and then re-flooded 69 separate times.

973
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,360
 Yeah.

974
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,360
 And then it finally was cut off completely 5.6 million years ago.

975
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:54,360
 The theory is that one of these flooding could have been what caused a lot of the flood myths

976
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,360
 in various religions, isn't it?

977
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,360
 Yeah.

978
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,360
 But that's so pre-human.

979
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,360
 It's so pre-human years ago.

980
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:04,360
 It's fine because it eventually re-flooded properly 5.3 million years ago.

981
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,360
 And that's the biggest flood that Earth has ever seen.

982
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,360
 And that flooded in the space of I think a few months or maybe a year.

983
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,360
 And the flood waters would move at 100 kilometres per hour, I think,

984
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,360
 because they seeped back in.

985
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,360
 And it was caused by a bit of land just caving in at one of the little joints.

986
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,360
 Gibraltar, wasn't it?

987
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,360
 That was when the Straits of Gibraltar were created.

988
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,360
 It was that gradually tipping over and then gradually, you know,

989
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,360
 war away more of the bridge that gets faster and faster.

990
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,360
 And it sounds amazing.

991
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,360
 What happens to you if you're a fish in that sort of just in that moment?

992
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,360
 Yeah. Like, do you die? Is that too fast? Is there too fast for a fish?

993
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360
 No, it is.

994
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,360
 A few kilometres in that hour isn't too fast?

995
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,360
 Yeah, sure.

996
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,360
 But there certainly is too fast for a fish.

997
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,360
 Is it?

998
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,360
 I would say so.

999
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,360
 Yeah, in the same--

1000
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,360
 It's a spin-off podcast.

1001
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,360
 [LAUGHTER]

1002
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,360
 What speed would it be?

1003
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,360
 Well, I don't know what the speed is.

1004
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,360
 But like, for instance, there's too windy for a human.

1005
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,360
 Yeah.

1006
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,360
 For instance, like, you know, if something's hitting you at a certain speed,

1007
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,360
 but molecules are water molecules or anything, or a wall,

1008
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,360
 there is too fast for a fish.

1009
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,360
 But if you're going with the tide, if you're going with--

1010
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,360
 If you're going with the wind, though.

1011
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,360
 No, but--

1012
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,360
 No, with Dan on this one.

1013
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,360
 Wouldn't GeForce, wouldn't-- you're going with the GeForce.

1014
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,360
 If the medium in which you are traveling is carrying you along

1015
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,360
 100 kilometres per hour, it's like you're fishing a car at that point.

1016
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,360
 Yes, that's what I'm thinking.

1017
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,360
 Yeah.

1018
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,360
 The turbulence of the water, but that might cause some stress.

1019
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,360
 Yeah.

1020
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,360
 It's going to be a fish mate.

1021
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,360
 Yeah, right.

1022
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,360
 You wouldn't experience it as moving at 100 miles an hour

1023
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,360
 because you're in the car.

1024
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,360
 Right.

1025
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,360
 And then what's weird is that when the fish got back home,

1026
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,360
 all the fish at home would be thousands of years later for them.

1027
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,360
 [LAUGHTER]

1028
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,360
 That's called time dilation.

1029
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,360
 It's the only scientifically proven form of time travel at work.

1030
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,360

1032
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,360
 OK, that's it.

1033
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,360
 That's all of our facts.

1034
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,360
 Thank you so much for listening.

1035
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,360
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said

1036
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,360
 over the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

1037
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,360
 I'm on @Streiberland.

 You can email podcast@QI.com.

1045
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,360
 Yep.

1046
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,360
 Or you can go to our group account, which is @QIPodcast, or go to our website.

1047
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,360
 No such thing as a fish.com, which has all of our previous episodes.

1048
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,360
 We will be back again next week with another episode.

1049
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,360
 We'll see you then.

1050
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,360
 Goodbye.
