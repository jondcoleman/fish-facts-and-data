00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's No Switch Things A Fish. Before we start, I just have a quick announcement to make.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.740
 Very excitingly, we have one of our favorite friends in the world,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.940
 American comic, John Hodgman, guesting on this episode.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.240
 Now, before he came on our show, Anner and I actually went on to his show, Judge John Hodgman,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.720
 that just went out this week, in it, he settles a dispute that is specific about our relationship

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.360
 between Anner and I on the podcast. And before we begin this show, we're going to play you

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.560
 a little excerpt from that night, because it's relevant to what happens later in Arsha.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.360
 So, without further ado, previously, on someone else's podcast.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.560
 Our final dispute on stage from the hit podcast No Such Thing Is A Fish.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.360
 Here with the dispute, please welcome Dan Schreiber and Anna Toshinsky.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.760
 Dan and Anna, No Such Thing Is A Fish is one of my very favorite podcasts.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.360
 And it's a real, I've met you before, Dan, where old friends were practically brothers

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.760
 and I look forward to seeing you at Christmas.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.760
 And I've never met you before, and it's a pleasure to see you in person.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.960
 But let's get to the dispute. What is the problem, Anna?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.360
 The problem is that we present a factual podcast that people actually listen to.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 You buzz marketing your podcast on my podcast.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.360
 Yeah, that's the reason we're here. We're having a show tomorrow, a few tickets.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.760
 No. And every week, Dan has to provide us with one fact and to present on the podcast.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.360
 And I keep having to reject his facts on the grounds that they're not interesting and they're not facts.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.760
 Yeah. And I argue that they are.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.760
 Well, you and I both know that non-facts are usually more interesting than facts.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.360
 But do you dispute, I mean, you're disputing the factuality of what he is asserting, is that correct?

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.360
 Let me give you an example.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.160
 So, one fact that Dan's presented for consideration is that the real reason

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.960
 that Titanic sank is not that it hid in iceberg, but that so many time travelers visited it

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.360
 at the same time that the weight of them all pushed it underwater.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.960
 Is your problem with him that he puts forward these facts or beliefs?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.760
 No, my problem is that I think it's very dangerous for us to be spreading these facts.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.360
 You know, if Donald Trump has thought of anything, it's that people hear tiny little random bits of stuff

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.560
 that they half-remember and then cling to them for life.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.360
 And I think they'll half-remember what Dan said and then think it was the truth

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.160
 and then go away with these insane convictions.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
 Go, you can understand in our country we've given up on facts.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.360
 Did you end up discussing this on the podcast?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.360
 No. No. He's tried, we cut it out.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.760
 Right. Well, I am going to be a guest on the podcast this Monday, and that's the fact that I'm going to bring.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.960
 So, I look forward to discussing it then.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.560
 I find in favor of Dan just because it's a great theory.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560
 Sorry, Anna.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:03:06.360
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.360
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.760
 and special guest John Hodgman.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.160
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.360
 Starting with you, Hodgman.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.560
 Hello. My fact is not many people know that the real reason the Titanic sank is not because it hit an iceberg,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.360
 but because so many time travelers visited at the same time, the weight of all the bodies forced it under the ocean's surface.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.360
 And this is a verified fact.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.360
 I can't believe we're doing this.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.360
 We're torturing Anna with this one.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.360
 So, John invited Dan and I to go on his podcast at the weekend called Judge John Hodgman where he settles a dispute.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.360
 The dispute was my problem with the fact that dance facts aren't real facts.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.360
 And instead of settling in my favor, he settled in Dan's favor and has presented this ridiculous fact to the class.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.360
 Well, there's no question that you--

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.360
 Which is obviously one of Dan's.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:15.360
 You were correct, this is not a fact other than, I think, Dan your argument was, it's a fact that some people think this.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.360
 Yeah, it's a fact that there is a theory.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.360
 There is a theory, a completely untestable theory.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.360
 Do you think anyone thinks it?

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.360
 I mean, really thinks it.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.360
 So, the first time I heard this was by Neil deGrasse Tyson, he's the American scientist.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.360
 He has this podcast, it's called Star Talk, and it's a theory that someone had sent in to him.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.360
 And so, he discussed it, and yeah, that's where I first heard it.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.360
 So, yeah, if it's good enough for Neil deGrasse Tyson, it's--

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.360
 Well, I'm not sure it's good enough.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360
 I'm not sure.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.360
 I also went back and watched that video and I'm not sure it's good enough for him either.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.360
 If we watch it now, it's him saying good enough for me.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.360
 I did attempt to reach out to him through his co-host of that podcast, The Great Comedian Eugene Merman.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.360
 But so far, I've not heard back.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.360
 Neil deGrasse Tyson, if you're listening to this in the future, please use Time Travel

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.360
 to tell us the source of where you heard this conspiracy theory.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.360
 Stephen Hawking, you may know, held a dinner party in 2008 for future Time Travelers.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.360
 He put out-- and no one attended, except for him, because he sent out the invitations after the party was over.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.360
 Yeah, but it could be that everyone in the future really hates him.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.360
 Well, I mean, there are a lot of reasons why it was not proof, although he took it as proof.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.360
 And he-- he actually sat there in this room with glasses of champagne and canapes

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.360
 and a big banner saying, "Welcome Time Travelers."

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.360
 And talked about how this-- this undeniably proved it on a TV special that he made.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.360
 And I have to say, I watched that segment and Stephen Hawking.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.360
 I never thought I'd say this seemed a little bit of a smug asshole about it.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.360
 Because I mean, no offense, Dr. Hawking, you're obvious.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.360
 But I mean, you know, maybe no one wants to have dinner with you, especially after--

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.360
 especially after this smug display of self-righteous--

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.360
 There is a short story by E.M. Forster where exactly this happens.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.360
 Time Travelers come back and they come from the, you know, a few centuries ahead

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.360
 and they're just passing through a little village and they're on a sort of coach tour looking at people.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.360
 And people get so annoyed by it in our time that they make a tourist attraction out of the time travelers.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.360
 They say, "Come and look at the time travelers and put up big signs of good audiences."

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.360
 And that annoys the time travelers so much. They stop coming.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.360
 That's a good way to get rid of them, for sure.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.360
 But, you know, another explanation for why Stephen Hawking didn't have dinner guests that night is the many world's theory.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.360
 Which is that, in fact, there is a universe in which time travelers did come back

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.360
 and that every time we travel through time, we resolve paradoxes by creating a new, entirely new timeline, a new universe.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.360
 And this is a real theory.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:07.360
 And more generally scientifically accepted, the many world's interpretation of quantum mechanics was first proposed by Hugh Everett in '57 or so.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:16.360
 You see, a relation of Rupert? No, but he is the father of Mark Oliver Everett of the band Eels.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:26.360
 Really? Yeah. And, in fact, Mark Oliver Everett made a documentary about his father called Parallel World's Parallel Lives.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.360
 And the theory, before we get into that, is that the many world's interpretation.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.360
 Now, this is a little bit above my, I don't, I did a lot of reading on quantum mechanics today.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.360
 No, I will, I will be able to explain it. Thank you very much.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:44.360
 But the idea is that the every quantum effect exists in all possible states until it is observed.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.360
 And then it settles to one state, and that's called wave function collapse, right?

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:56.360
 And the idea of many world's interpretation is that there is no wave function collapse because every possible universe that exists exists.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.360
 Do I understand that more or less correctly? Yeah, pretty much.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:08.360
 This is also where Schrodinger's cat comes into things. So, an object can occur in two possible states until you actually look at it.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.360
 And then when you look at it, it goes in one way or the other.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.360
 Wave function collapse. Exactly that.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.360
 And then so if you have a cat in a box, then it's both alive and dead at the same time until you actually look at it.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.360
 And then you'll find out whether it's alive or dead.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.360
 And whatever it was saying was that there is a universe in which it is alive, there is a universe in which it is dead.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:32.360
 There is a universe where it is not a cat, there is a universe where it is a live cat dead cat hybrid.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:40.360
 His interesting thing about that is if you are the cat, then in some universes you will be dead and some you will be alive.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.360
 But the only ones you will ever know about are the ones where you are alive.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:52.360
 So actually in these kind of theories it could be that when we're experiencing things, we're only experiencing the universes where we're still alive.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:09:02.360
 So there are lots of universes where we're dead, so the final you which is still kind of extents and still understanding things will be the last one which possibly lived.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:11.360
 And every time you cross the street, you are hit by a car and you die, except in the universe that you experience.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.360
 I'm a survivor just like Destiny's Child said.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:26.360
 Yeah, that's what I was talking about. This is a good argument for John Hodgman exceptionalism. I feel like this is why I'm virtuous and that is why I've lived to this elderly age.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:32.360
 About Schrodinger, his idea of the cat thing was he was taking the piss out of the theory.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:37.360
 He was saying how can this even be true because then this thing, the cat would be true.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:50.360
 So he kind of didn't really like the theory and he had another thing called Schrodinger's Flea which he did like and which he used to explain how electrons can go from one level of energy to another.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.360
 They kind of jump up quickly like a flea.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.360
 So the theory that he likes was Schrodinger's Flea but the one that he didn't like was Schrodinger's cat.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.360
 I can tell you why that Schrodinger's Flea didn't take off, not enough cats.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:10.360
 He had a extremely popular. Yeah, he did the animals definitely the wrong way around. He did also, I think he lived with two women for a while.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.360
 Did he? Which is possibly him putting his quantum experiments into action.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:22.360
 But yes, it is true. And you know, Everett was essentially laughed out of mainstream science initially for this theory.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:29.360
 He was summoned to Copenhagen to meet Niels Bohr and Niels Bohr called him incredibly stupid to his face, I believe.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:42.360
 He was invited to meet Niels Bohr in Copenhagen and Niels Bohr rejected the idea outright and he quit being a physicist and became a defense contractor.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:49.360
 And then it was only later that the idea, which is now more or less considered to be feasible at least, is now accepted.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:59.360
 I've only researched the Titanic. Well, I found out a real conspiracy theory about the Titanic that it was switched with its sister ship the Olympic in an massive insurance scam.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:15.360
 This is not true. I'd like straight. But loads of people have proposed this for a very long time because the Olympic had been in an accident and there are all these theories that the ships were kind of given the old switcheroo and that actually one of them was a thousand tons lighter than it should have been.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:25.360
 And that's because the Olympic was actually a bit of a lighter ship and the Titanic had been bogged up. So yeah, it's it's complete bunk, but there are so many theories about the Titanic.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:35.360
 My favorite Titanic conspiracy theory is the one about the film that actually Titanic the film is about Jack Dawson traveling in time.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.360
 Yes.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:46.360
 Because he accidentally makes constant reference to stuff that happened after the Titanic sank. There's that famous one where he talks about ice fishing on a lake.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:53.360
 Lake was so tough. Lake was so so, which yeah, wasn't built until about four years later. That's right. It's a man-made lake in Wisconsin.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:04.360
 His backpack is a Swedish army issue from 1939. And his haircut is clearly from the 90s.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:12.360
 The first thing he refers to is a roller coaster on Santa Monica Bay, Santa Monica Beach, which again wasn't built until three years after was he says he's going to take rows on it.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.360
 And, you know, he may have been planning to take rows on it, but how did he know it was going to exist?

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.360
 So it was to be in plans though.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.360
 Oh, you say he's gone through the planning of Santa Monica Bay.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.360
 There's more feasible than he's the time traveller to be honest.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:33.360
 I read some of the same websites as you did, obviously, and the problem with the theory is that he saves rows from committing suicide.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:41.360
 If she had gone overboard, they probably would have stopped the ship and looked for her, and that might have prevented them from hitting that iceberg.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.360
 So he basically cared more about rows than every single other person on that ship put together?

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.360
 You know, some people just want to watch the world burn.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.360
 Maybe he was the first titanic tourist. Maybe he was just there to see it happen.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:04.360
 But it did have a collision, almost collision, just as it was leaving Southampton. It was so big that it pulled another ship towards it, the titanic.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.360
 And it was because of gravitational fields?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.360
 No, because of the wash from that.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:17.360
 But the captain, he very craftily navigated and so avoided a smash and set off on the voyage.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.360
 So if he hadn't, obviously, they would have been delayed by a few hours or a day or something.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.360
 Well, they would have met the ice in daylight, perhaps.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:30.360
 Hey, speaking of the movie, do you guys know when the first ever movie was made about the titanic?

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.360
 Is that a night to remember?

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.360
 There's no really soon afterwards.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:43.360
 Okay, it was called "saved from the titanic." It was made in 1912, and it was made 29 days after the event happened, after the titanic sank.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.360
 It starred this lady called Dorothy Gibson, and she was an actual survivor of the titanic.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.360
 They talked to Rinsuit, they make her wear the actual dress that she was wearing when she was on the titanic.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.360
 You can even see that there's all these press photos that they've released at the time where she's in the dress to promote the movie.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:06.360
 And yeah, that exists. Some people said it was amazing. Others said too soon.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.360
 Too soon.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.360
 Look, I don't blame her. She saw her opportunity.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:20.360
 You know what I mean? I've been on some cruises, I've been an entertainer on some Caribbean cruises, and I don't know.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:32.360
 I was on a cruise at the same time that the Carnival Triumph cruise ship ended up being the most ironically named cruise ship because it was not a party, and it was a pure failure.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:41.360
 Where their electrics went out, and they drifted at sea for five or six days, and it almost immediately turned to Ann or cannibalism.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.360
 Yeah, practically so.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:49.360
 People were urinating and defecating in the halls because apparently they didn't realize they were surrounded by an ocean.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:58.360
 And sleeping on deck, because they didn't have air conditioning anymore, and it was a big news story, and I was so angry that I was on this functioning cruise ship.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:05.360
 Rather than this poop cruise, as it came to be known, because then as soon as I got back, I would be on the today show.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.360
 You would.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.360
 Minor television personality suffers poop cruising.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.360
 Plus, you could have claimed payment, presumably, for the extra five days that you would have been forced to entertain everyone.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:29.360
 I have this image of me in a fool's carb dancing in front of the self-appointed king of the ship after society has broken down.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.360
 Skating on feces.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.360
 Yes, exactly.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:42.360
 Have we ever mentioned the fact, just on Titanic films, that there wasn't any footage when the Titanic left, because it wasn't really that big a deal.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.360
 So people were more excited about the Olympic, which left the year before.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:59.360
 And so there wasn't any actual footage, and when they showed the newsreels of, you know, the Titanic's sunk in cinemas, then they had to use footage of the Olympic, and they just scratched out all the names on it, because they didn't have any footage of Titanic.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.360
 So when they were like, look at this guy leaving.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.360
 And they added a license plate that said sink, right?

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.360
 Yes.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.360
 Oh, that's the one.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:16.360
 Maybe that contributed to the conspiracy about them switching. Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing, because all the stuff I read is that it was a huge event, you know, they said that lots of people turned out to wave it off.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.360
 I think there was, I think there was a big old policy.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.360
 People turned out, you turned out, yeah, but it was probably like, you know, all the families of the people who were actually going moving to America.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.360
 People were waving off the poop crews, too.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:29.360
 If it was marketed as the poop crews, I would wave it off.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:39.360
 And when the Titanic took off, 22 tons of soap and beef and mutton fat were smeared on the slipway to get it into the sea.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.360
 That sounds delicious.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.360
 Yeah.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.360
 So there is a man named Andrew Basiago.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:52.360
 I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name correctly, but it's like a Asiago cheese or Asiago cheese with a bar in front of it.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:17:05.360
 He is a website called Project Pegasus. He claims that when he was a seven-year-old child in the late 70s, he was recruited by DARPA, which is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.360
 to be part of Project Pegasus where there were training children to become time travelers.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.360
 And he was sent back through time several times. He visited Gettysburg.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:23.360
 He went to the Ford Theatre during the time of Lincoln's assassination three times and met himself once there as a child, but he never actually saw the assassination.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.360
 He never made it up to the box in time.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:33.360
 And so that's the thing. You could travel back in time to 1912 to go see the Titanic, but you could get on the wrong ship.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.360
 I mean, maybe, yeah.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.360
 I think just keep going back until you get the right ship.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.360
 Keep going back and tip us Wade and Usher to take you up to the box, guys.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.360
 But DARPA, of course, did create a whole bunch of crazy things that are not time travel.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.360
 Didn't DARPA invent the internet pretty much?

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:53.360
 Yeah, the ARPA net, it was originally called. The back one, DARPA was ARPA.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.360
 It's changed its name twice, from ARPA to DARPA, then to ARPA, and back to DARPA.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.360
 It sounds like it's invented by Dutz Aseus.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.360
 And arguably, it's both at the same time.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:11.360
 Alex Bell, who's in the QI office right now, he's wearing a DARPA t-shirt.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.360
 So what's that in reference?

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:24.360
 No, he's wearing a DARPA initiative t-shirt from the TV show Lost, which also dealt with a lot of time travel.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:35.360
 And in specifically, it embraced a kind of obscure principle about time travel, because obviously time travel introduces a lot of paradoxes in the various thought experiments.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:48.360
 And one of the explanations to get around paradoxes is the Novikov self-consistency principle, which was used in Lost to explain you can't change the past, because we were here.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.360
 That's the time travel happened, and we were here.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.360
 So what we did is what happened.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.360
 And nothing, it's basically, there's, do you see what I mean?

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:04.360
 I do, but I'd like to refer you to back to the future too, which makes it very clear how you can end up in a different future where Donald Trump is president.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:15.360
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:24.360
 Okay, my fact this week is that during the Californian gold rush, a pair of boots could cost the equivalent of $2,300 in today's money.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.360
 Was it one specific pair?

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.360
 Oh, it was.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.360
 Yeah.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:39.360
 No, it was any pair, and this is what happened, because they were so much in the middle of nowhere, and because the population had got so high and sort of shot them out of time, and they just didn't have provisions.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.360
 People just had to pay top dollar for everything.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.360
 And there's loads of examples of this.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.360
 An individual lemon would sell for the equivalent of $20 today.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.360
 What is this?

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.360
 Yes.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:58.360
 Presumably, most people hadn't found gold, right? Because it was only as small percentage of people who actually struck really lucky. So did most people just not go without lemons?

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:06.360
 People would find bits of gold, but yeah, basically you could become rich doing anything, apart from looking for gold.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:14.360
 Really, in that time, everyone else made a shitloads of money, and the people who actually went looking for gold, one or two people did, but mostly struggled.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.360
 They would do just as badly as they did when they were doing whatever else they did.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:26.360
 So for instance, there was a farmer who sold onions, who made $160,000 in 1849, just for selling onions.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.360
 How do you know how much that is per onion, and how that compares to the lemon?

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360
 I don't know.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.360
 Lemon has to be more than I think, right?

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.360
 The good thing about lemons is it cures scurvy, or stops scurvy.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.360
 Right, exactly.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.360
 Yeah.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.360
 How long did this last for?

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:49.360
 So everyone was broke? Well, so it started the gold rush in '48, 1848, and it went on for about three or four years.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.360
 But you know, there's still some people looking for gold out there now.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.360
 Still have to try.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.360
 I bought these boots.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.360
 I'm going to get the bloody mullies where all the farms were abandoned, weren't they?

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.360
 So this has been another reason why food was really expensive is people just left their farms.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.360
 So as a result, land goes followed, all the food has to be imported.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.360
 The other thing is there were basically no women around, and they at that time were doing all the cooking.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.360
 So the men were just going out to eat all the time, they weren't going home.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.360
 Yeah, 75% of men in California gave up their jobs to become gold prospectors.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.360
 Whoa!

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:29.360
 And one in 100 men in the whole of America became gold prospectors, whether that was already living in California or making the trek.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.360
 San Francisco was built with wood from the ships that people took to get to the gold rush.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.360
 Yeah, that's so cool.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.360
 They abandoned their boats as soon as they got there, and there was such a housing boom they ran out of lumber,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.360
 and they chopped the ships up.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.360
 Yeah.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.360
 That would be the one guy who actually was coming back for your ship.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.360
 Yeah.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.360
 And we parked in harbors sea.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.360
 We're in harbors sea.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.360
 This is number five.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.360
 It's become a house.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.360
 So the first millionaire in California was a guy called Sam Brannon.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.360
 He was a journalist.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.360
 He owned a star, and he also had a star which kind of sold provisions.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:11.360
 And then someone came into his star with some gold to buy some, you know, shovels and whatever.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.360
 And he realized that they had found gold.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:20.360
 And so what he did, instead of going out to find gold himself, he smartly went round all the shops, bought all the shovels,

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:27.360
 all the pickaxes, all the pans, everything that you would need, put them in his shop, and then went into town going this gold and then their hills.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:33.360
 Everyone went crazy, went, "Oh no, we need a shovel." He's like, "Well, I know where you can get a shovel, my shop."

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.360
 And so he became a millionaire from selling provisions to idiots.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.360
 The shovel millionaire.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.360
 Yeah.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.360
 Very clever.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.360
 That's not.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.360
 Not as exciting as going and mining for gold though.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.360
 No.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.360
 I would have been one of the gold idiots.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.360
 I went mining for gold the other day.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.360
 Did you?

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.360
 In Alaska, yeah.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.360
 How did you do it?

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.360
 Were you panning?

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.360
 Panning, yeah.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.360
 Nice. Did you find any?

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.360
 I only found the ones that they deliberately put in for tourists to fight.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.360
 It is chocolate gold, not guys.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.360
 They put light-tidy flakes in.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.360
 How much did the pan cost? $5,000.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.360
 Were you in chicken by any chance?

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.360
 Chicken, no, I was in Juneau.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.360
 Oh, chicken is another place in Alaska where you get a lot of panning for gold.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.360
 Is it?

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.360
 As a population is 23 in winter?

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360
 Seven.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.360
 But when is...

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.360
 But when is...

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.360
 But in panning season, it goes up to hundreds.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.360
 Juneau, Alaska, which is the capital of Alaska, is not accessible by road from the United States.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360
 That's right.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.360
 You can only fly there.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.360
 Or get a boat.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.360
 Or get a boat.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.360
 Or get a boat, yes, I suppose.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.360
 If you've still got a boat, I'm right.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.360
 So you haven't turned it into a house in San Francisco.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.360
 You can supposedly take a boat.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:44.360
 Actually, when I was in Juneau, you kind of see that all the cruise ships come in and the population just goes massive during the day.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.360
 And then everyone gets back on the boats and then even in its empty.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.360
 And is that paranoia about people turning their boats into houses?

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.360
 It's like if we don't go back here every day.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.360
 No, you've got to have a poo somewhere and you've got to go on the deck of your ship.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.360
 Just going back to Juneau because I was there last week.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.360
 There's a bar there.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.360
 It's very old bar.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.360
 And they've kind of got a history of gold miners used to go there.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.360
 And they have sawdust on the floor.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.360
 And apparently this is what they always used to do.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.360
 Have sawdust on the floor of miners' bars.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.360
 I thought that was a so-called vomit.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.360
 Yeah, right.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.360
 You would think that.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:24.360
 But actually, apparently the reason was, so they would pay for their drinks with little bits of gold.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.360
 But obviously, once you're drunk, you're going to drop your bits of gold, aren't you?

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.360
 But if you drop them into sawdust, then you won't be able to find them.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.360
 So you would drop them there.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.360
 And then the next morning, the owner of the tavern would kind of sweep up all of the sawdust.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.360
 To put it in water, the sawdust would float, but the gold would sink.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.360
 And they'd get the gold out and they'd get loads more gold.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.360
 The same principle as why all entertainment for the gold miners was ball ponds.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.360
 Get the miners in the ball ponds, they drop all their gold.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.360
 Can't find them among the balls.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.360
 There was a little moment of cultural translation there.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.360
 Yeah, sorry.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.360
 What are they?

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.360
 Ball pits.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.360
 Would their ball pits here as well?

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.360
 I would say that.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.360
 Really?

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.360
 Yeah.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.360
 We had one in my garden as a boy.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.360
 We had a ball pit.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360
 Ball ponds.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.360
 It sounds the ball lake was further down at the end of the ground.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.360
 That sounds much more gracious than ball pit.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.360
 Ball ponds, surely.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.360
 Okay, I'll go through those children in the ball hole.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:27.360
 Another one of these businessmen who set up a business to profit was Levi Strauss.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.360
 So he came over.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.360
 He was selling canvas tarps so that they could take out there.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.360
 And then as a result, the business started booming.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.360
 And then he got into Levi jeans.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.360
 Now we have your presumably wearing Levi jeans.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.360
 Oh, no.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.360
 Why would you presume that?

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.360
 I assume all jeans are Levi jeans.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.360
 What?

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.360
 I presume it's fashion for me.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.360
 Misplaced.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.360
 Yeah, so Levi jeans.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.360
 Sort of an option.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.360
 Because the miners were very fashion conscious.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.360
 Yeah.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.360
 Got a bit good with your gold.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.360
 They needed clothes with rivets on them.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.360
 It's okay just to remove the crotch rivet, I think.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.360
 Didn't they?

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.360
 There was a crotch rivet.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.360
 Oh, you mean the decades?

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.360
 They kept the tradition of having the crotch rivet.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.360
 As opposed to it took actual hours to get lost.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.360
 Let me just slip out of these trousers.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.360
 One match.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.360
 Another item of clothing that people needed actually

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.360
 was egg carrying jackets.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.360
 Because the gold rush was quickly followed by the egg rush.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.360
 And this was.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.360
 Gold.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.360
 That's everyone running back to the cruise ship, isn't it?

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.360
 Yes.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.360
 No, this was.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.360
 They needed some protein to get their mining done.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.360
 And so they ran out of eggs quite quickly.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.360
 And someone spotted that on the Ferralan Islands,

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.360
 which was just off San Francisco, there were these seabirds

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.360
 that laid these gigantic eggs.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.360
 Apparently they were twice the size of chickens' eggs.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.360
 And they laid red-yoke and transparent-wited eggs.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.360
 But they were in high demand.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.360
 And it was incredibly dangerous to get to these islands.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.360
 They were full of great white sharks, the waters around them.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.360
 And extremely turbulent seas.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.360
 But people went there and they harvested these eggs.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.360
 And obviously they could sell the eggs.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.360
 It was a huge price because no one else was getting eggs.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.360
 Like lemon-style prices.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.360
 Exactly.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.360
 They were up there with the lemon island was next door.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.360
 But what they used to do was they used to get there,

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.360
 get all the eggs they could into their specially-made egg jackets,

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.360
 which had lots of pockets for eggs.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.360
 And then they'd smash all the other eggs on the island

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:26.360
 because they wanted to keep it scarce.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.360
 No, in fact, because they'd come back the next day.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.360
 But they needed to know which ones were the fresh ones.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.360
 So they smashed the ones that had been there before.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.360
 Yeah, there was.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.360
 Oh yeah, clever, right?

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.360
 Anyway, then there were these egg wars in the early 50s

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.360
 because it was taken over by one private company,

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.360
 this island, and then another company tried to invade.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.360
 Do they still exist?

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360
 I'm sorry to interrupt you a bit.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.360
 Do they still exist?

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.360
 I really want to know.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.360
 I don't know if anyone's ever had one of these giant--

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.360
 And what kind of seabird are we talking about here?

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.360
 It's a kind of-- it looks like a penguin.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.360
 And it's called a common-mer.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.360
 M-U-D-R-E.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.360
 Common-mer.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.360
 Yeah, it's kind of an unpleasant name for what provided

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.360
 quite a valuable--

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.360
 I guess that's where the name Moralats comes from.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.360
 We'll be a small version.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.360
 Is it a demo?

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.360
 Yeah.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.360
 Have you heard of a Hangtown Fry?

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.360
 No.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.360
 The Hangtown Fry is something you get in San Francisco.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.360
 And it is-- it's derived from the Gold Rush.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.360
 It's an egg dish.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.360
 And the legend, again, we're dealing with legends here,

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.360
 is that when someone struck it big in the Gold Rush,

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.360
 they would-- someone went in and ordered--

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.360
 I'd just give me anything that involves the most expensive things

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.360
 you have.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.360
 So a Hangtown Fry was an omelette made of expensive eggs

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.360
 and mixed with bacon, which was shipped in from the east,

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.360
 and fried oysters on top.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.360
 And served in a pair of boots.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.360
 Serve in a pair of golden boots.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.360
 And it was originally in Placerville, California,

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.360
 which was then known as Hangtown,

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.360
 because they hanged a lot of people there.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.360
 Justice was harsh in Placerville.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.360
 I'd give my desirable breakfast a different name, I think,

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.360
 that didn't have so much association with kidding people.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.360
 It's kind of got cowboys sound to it, I suppose.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.360
 I suppose people of the west are weird.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.360
 Yeah.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.360
 They want vengeance with their breakfast.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.360
 That sounds a good film name.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.360
 Vengeance with breakfast.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.360
 Vengeance for breakfast.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.360
 I'm going to cook it.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.360
 They smash all the other eggs in the kitchen.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.360
 That's right.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.360
 Just to make sure.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.360
 So were there a lot of rushes in that period?

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.360
 Like egg rush, gold rush?

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.360
 I read that there was a silver rush, which was in Calico,

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.360
 which is now a ghost town.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.360
 Anything else?

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.360
 There was another gold rush, which Melbourne was casually

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.360
 not making too much fuss about down under,

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.360
 but Melbourne became the richest city in the world in the 1850s,

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.360
 I think, because they had a gold rush.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.360
 Gold was found there.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.360
 And people did better in Melbourne than in San Francisco.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.360
 It seems like there were fewer of them.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.360
 So maybe that helps.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.360
 There was a thing in Australia where in the west of Australia,

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.360
 in Calgurli, sorry, Calgurli.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.360
 I can't say it.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.360
 Calgurli.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.360
 Calgurli.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.360
 Calgurli?

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.360
 Calgurli.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.360
 I thought it was Calgurli.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.360
 Chicago.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.360
 Calgurli wouldn't be what I said.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.360
 Calgurli.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.360
 So this in western Australia,

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.360
 and they had a similar sort of gold rush,

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.360
 but what they didn't notice was there's a different type of gold,

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.360
 which is it just wasn't recognized as gold,

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.360
 probably at the time, because it wasn't shiny and it wasn't gold.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.360
 Anyway, the point is, is that they thought it was a bit of a waste rock,

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.360
 so they were paving the streets with it.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.360
 And suddenly they discovered that it was an element of gold inside it,

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.360
 so suddenly they realized that they'd been paving the streets with gold effectively.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.360
 And so all the roads would dug up,

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.360
 and they would then collecting it and making lots of money.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.360
 Are you sure that sounds a bit like a lie you've been spun by your jewelry dealer

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.360
 for the engagement ring?

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.360
 It's a different type of gold.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.360
 It's not shiny.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.360
 It may look like Tom Act to you, sir, but actually...

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.360
 She'll love it.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.360
 I have heard of that Calgurli thing, actually.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.360
 I think it is.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.360
 If you do ever go on a Caribbean cruise,

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.360
 prepare for a lot of seminars on Tanzanite,

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.360
 the mineral of the future.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.360
 They are really?

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.360
 They are really pushing Tanzanite hard.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.360
 Is that what you were entertaining people with on your cruise?

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.360
 I was a Tanzanite salesman.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.360
 I just thought of another rush.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.360
 There was an Alpaca rush in America.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.360
 Oh, no.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.360
 Let me tell you, yeah, that was a big deal.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.360
 I think a lot of people lost a lot of money on the Alpaca rush.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.360
 Yeah, and that's not that long ago, maybe 15 years ago or so.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.360
 How do you mind for Alpacas?

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.360
 This is people's Alpaca rights, it's called.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.360
 I'm from New England, and in Western New England,

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.360
 there was a huge llama and Alpaca boom.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:48.360
 People started raising Alpacas and llamas for their fur

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.360
 to make into textiles and yarn and junk.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.360
 And they're also adorably dumb to look at.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.360
 Oh, my God.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.360
 They're my favorite animal.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.360
 If any fans want to get me a present, get me a llama.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.360
 Well, they found them quite intensively,

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.360
 and so they're not that intensively.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.360
 You don't see it all this.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.360
 It's a country alpha.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.360
 Yeah, shit.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.360
 It's full of Alpacas.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.360
 It's totally the stuff.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.360
 You did see them, though, in Western Massachusetts and throughout the United States.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.360
 There was a huge boom in Alpaca farming.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.360
 And then it went Alpaca bust.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:20.360
 And people were buying Alpacas from South America for tens of thousands of dollars,

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.360
 and then they were selling them for $1,500 or something like that,

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.360
 just for all the market collapse.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.360
 Yeah, it was the case that you would be able to buy a young Alpaca

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.360
 and then grow it up, and then you make a load of money.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.360
 But that was only for about a couple of years.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.360
 And then suddenly people realized these things

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.360
 that definitely not worth that much money.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.360
 I'm a bit like Chewlick Bay near, I guess.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.360
 But I'll pay anything for them, seriously.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.360
 Do you live in an apartment?

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.360
 Yeah.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.360
 Let me recommend a Vaikunya.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.360
 What's that?

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.360
 It's the smallest of the llamas.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.360
 Okay.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.360
 Thank you.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.360
 It's more of a lap llama.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.360
 You know what I mean?

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.360
 It's such a good tip.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.360
 Yeah, because we've only got one small sofa,

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.360
 and there's already two of us.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.360
 It's a little happily with a Vaikunya.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360
 Okay.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.360
 Thank you.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.360
 Just sit on the llama that you've got two sofas right there.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.360
 Yeah.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.360
 That's a really good, but a llama is a sofa.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.360
 You're not really allowed to use them.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.360
 You shouldn't use them as sofas.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.360
 But also, I don't think you're allowed to sit on their backs

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.360
 because they snap.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.360
 Oh, yeah, they're mean creatures.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.360
 No, sorry.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:27.360
 Get the fuck off me.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.360
 You're saying that I would break a llama in half

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.360
 if I sat on that thing?

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.360
 I'm not saying anything about anybody, but I am saying that you can damage their backs.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.360
 There are photos of Edwardian gentlemen having a great time sitting on llamas,

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.360
 but I think the current medical advice says we shouldn't.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.360
 They're among the gentlest of the vertebrates.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.360
 [laughter]

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:51.360
 [music]

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.360
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.360
 My fact is that the area of Australia owned by British people

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.360
 is larger than Britain.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.360
 That's amazing.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.360
 Oh, fucking car parker, my fact.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.360
 I was a real car parker.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.360
 I'll take this moment apart.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.360
 You made your opinion.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.360
 Oh, that's alright.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.360
 [laughter]

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.360
 Mm-hmm.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.360
 I see.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.360
 That's a great fact, Andy.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.360
 Thank you very much, James.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.360
 What I'll tell you.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.360
 So what this means is basically Australia is absolutely massive

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.360
 and they've just done a survey of sort of foreign land ownership

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.360
 because there's been a lot of gaffafel about this in Australia.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:35.360
 And the amount owned by British companies is 27.5 million hectares

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.360
 and Britain itself is only 24 million hectares.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:44.360
 Although, I mean, technically one British person owns the whole of Australia, right?

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.360
 Technically, none of these people own the land.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.360
 They're just leasing it from Her Majesty the Queen.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.360
 To the Queen, yes, yes.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.360
 That's true.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:57.360
 The largest non-state non-monarchy private land holding on earth

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:03.360
 is this family called the Kidmans, who they own a bit of Australia,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.360
 which is larger than Scotland.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.360
 It's larger than Hungary.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.360
 It's three quarters of the size of England.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.360
 Wow.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.360
 And they recently tried to put it up a sale.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.360
 It was founded by a man called Sidney Kidman in 1899,

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.360
 who went off as a teenager with a one-eyed horse.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.360
 We founded a load of these castle stations all over Australia.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.360
 It went up for sale last year.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.360
 It would have taken about a week, just to visit the property,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.360
 because it's in a few different places.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.360
 You'd have to have a plane between them all.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.360
 Yeah, only 150 people live there.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.360
 It's basically a series of massive cattle stations out in the...

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.360
 Yeah.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.360
 I think it's the Outback.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.360
 I'm not quite sure where the Outback begins and ends.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.360
 Yeah.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.360
 And didn't they try and sell it recently?

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.360
 They tried to sell it, but the stock denied.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.360
 It was blocked, because they were selling it to a Chinese majority owned consortium.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.360
 And the Australian government said, "No, no, you're not allowed to do that.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.360
 I'm trying to keep it Australian owned."

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.360
 I read a headline about the largest foreign landowner in China being IKEA.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.360
 Oh, really?

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.360
 I'm not really sure what this means, but according to a Reuters report

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.360
 from a couple of years ago, IKEA was the biggest foreign landowner in China

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.360
 with 6.89 million square feet,

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.360
 which doesn't seem like very much compared to 29 million hectares.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.360
 No.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.360
 But maybe it's bullshit.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.360
 That might just be one massive branch of IKEA.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.360
 Yeah, right.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.360
 It actually takes a week to get round the hole.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.360
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.360
 The largest electoral district in Australia is bigger than Mongolia.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.360
 What a swap.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.360
 Yeah.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.360
 It's called Jirak, and it's in Westerns in WA.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.360
 Uh-huh.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.360
 And yeah, it's slightly bigger than Mongolia.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.360
 I should have written down those figures.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.360
 It's about 1,000 km squared, bigger than the square plumber area of Mongolia.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.360
 Wow.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.360
 I just can't believe it, because Mongolia is massive.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.360
 It's huge.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.360
 I know.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360
 I don't get it.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.360
 I read in 1933 that Western Australia voted to leave Australia.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.360
 So like a Brexit, they just said we don't want to be a part of Australia anymore.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.360
 They did the vote.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.360
 It was successful.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.360
 And then they just Australia said, no, we're not letting you do it.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.360
 It was a poll, I think, wasn't it?

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.360
 So it wasn't a vote.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.360
 It was to see if they would want to leave.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.360
 And then I think they said they would.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.360
 So the government was like, cool, let's not have an election on that.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.360
 It was just advisory.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.360
 Yes.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.360
 Western Australia, I wrote down that it's got 2.6 million people,

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.360
 over 2.5 million square kilometers.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.360
 And most of those people are all crammed into.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.360
 Is Perth Western Australia?

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360
 Yeah.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.360
 So basically everyone there is in Perth.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.360
 Yeah.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.360
 And there's a town called Kimberley, which has a population of 3rd,

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.360
 the size of Wembley Stadium, Wemful,

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.360
 but is 3 times the size of England.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.360
 Oh, cool.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.360
 I've stayed in Kimberley.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.360
 I have you.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.360
 Yeah, my grandmother lived there.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.360
 Did she?

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.360
 And I went panning for gold there.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360
 Did you?

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.360
 Yeah.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.360
 What a weird connection.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.360
 Yeah.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.360
 So it's a place where they get uples.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.360
 And I think they have a lot of people living underground there,

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.360
 because it's so hot.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360
 Oh, yes.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.360
 All the opal miners all live underground.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.360
 Yeah, so the heat is so great that they've decided,

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.360
 okay, let's actually just build underground.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:58.360
 So you go and you can see these amazing pictures online of just everyone's houses.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.360
 I mean, they're not that amazing, because they just look like a lounge room,

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.360
 but they're underground.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.360
 So it's, yeah, you have to picture that bit in your head when you're going.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.360
 I was feeling they might have a golf course,

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.360
 you'd only play at night time, because it's too hot during the day.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.360
 But I might have made that up.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.360
 Well, at least golf survives.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.360
 It is the ultimate survivor.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360
 It'll be there after the apocalypse.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.360
 It's so hot.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.360
 Do they have grass?

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.360
 Or is it one massive bunker?

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.360
 Yeah, it's a sand course.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.360
 I think it's compacted sand, yeah.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.360
 They also have a ball pond, but all the balls evaporated.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:37.360
 Because Australia sells sand to Saudi Arabia, isn't it?

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.360
 Sand and camels, because Saudi Arabia's sand doesn't work for building in.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.360
 And its camels don't work for easing.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.360
 So Australia's got plenty extra.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.360
 I saw, I saw, I went, my sister lives in Abu Dhabi,

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.360
 and we went on a kind of desert trek, and you can go and ride on camels and see the camels.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.360
 So you go on these four by four cars, you get to the bit.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.360
 And what they have is this kind of edge of a huge sand june,

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.360
 where they lead the camel to, and they point it backwards,

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.360
 and the camel poos off the edge.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.360
 And they tell you, go look at the amazing toilet of the camels,

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.360
 and you walk to the edge of this sand june,

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:13.360
 and you just see this terrifying shit world just below you.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.360
 But what they don't tell you is that obviously...

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.360
 They're very much the ships of the desert.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:24.360
 But yeah, some people were almost falling off the edge right into it,

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.360
 because you're on the lip of a sand june.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.360
 If someone said, sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.360
 If someone said to me, go over to that cliff,

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.360
 and look at a bunch of camel poos.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.360
 I would say no, thank you.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.360
 I'm fine here.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.360
 I believe you that it's there.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.360
 To us, the traction is a few and far between there, I believe.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.360
 I suppose so.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.360
 Was it impressive, that, what'd you say?

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.360
 Yeah, it was amazing.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.360
 It was a huge mound of poos.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.360
 On the edge of a sand june, it was incredible.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.360
 Sounds good.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:59.360
 Some more bits about Australia's level of hugeness and isolation.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:04.360
 The most isolated post office in Australia is also in Western Australia.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.360
 It's 32 kilometres from the nearest customer.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:12.360
 So everyone who uses that post office is having to drive 32 kilometres.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360
 Wow.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.360
 Might as well just keep going.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.360
 Delivery already yourself.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.360
 Have you heard of the School of the Air?

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.360
 No.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.360
 This is a school for Australian children who live in such remote places

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.360
 that it's absolutely impossible to get them to a school, basically.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.360
 And it used to be done over the radio.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.360
 You'd have an hour of lessons.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.360
 And then you'd have a workbook which you would complete with an older brother

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.360
 or a parent or something like that.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.360
 And now, these days, of course, they do it over the internet.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.360
 But this is the thing that happens.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.360
 There are children educated this day.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.360
 But did a teacher then have to drive 200,000 miles around everyone's houses

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.360
 to do the marketing?

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.360
 Yes.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:52.360
 I have a hat for a place that's called Mystery Island, which is off of Vanuatu.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.360
 And it's a hat that says Mystery Island.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.360
 They have a big sign of seeing pictures of it.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.360
 They have to go there.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.360
 And he used to do cruises.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.360
 So he was the comedian on a cruise.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.360
 Last time he went, they were told that Mystery Island no longer exists.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.360
 There was something to do with a tsunami that had hit somewhere

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.360
 and the ocean level, it just took it down.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.360
 What made it mysterious before it disappeared?

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.360
 That's pretty much the most mysterious thing I can think of.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.360
 I think it was because the way it was positioned that if you came into rough seas,

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.360
 the seas were so rough that it was impossible to get to the land.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.360
 And the land was actually--

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.360
 Oh, I see.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.360
 Smash, so it's a Mystery Island because you never knew when you could get on board it.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.360
 Oh, a time traveler resisted it and named it from the future,

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.360
 knowing that it was going to mysterious things.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, possibly.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.360
 Yeah.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.360
 But I went on TripAdvisor and it's reappeared.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.360
 So Mystery Island is back.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.360
 Do you know something that's under Australia?

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.360
 New Zealand.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.360
 No.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.360
 Yeah.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.360
 It's the world's longest natural electric current.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.360
 It's more than 6,000 kilometers long.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.360
 You can see a map of it.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.360
 The enormous line stretching all the way under the continent and then carving out.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.360
 Wow.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.360
 Yeah, it's caused by the Earth's magnetic field as it shifts.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.360
 It generates this current.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.360
 Unfortunately, it's very weak and could not light a lamp.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.360
 So it's really pathetic, but it is there.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.360
 It is massive.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.360
 Wow.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.360
 Did you see in the news that Australia's GPS is five feet off?

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.360
 Yes.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.360
 It's incredible.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.360
 So it's been shifting faster than people were expecting.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.360
 So it's something like seven centimeters a year.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.360
 Yes.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.360
 It's been going.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.360
 So now it's five feet in the wrong spots.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.360
 So you have now reached your destination.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.360
 No, I haven't.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.360
 All of Australia's moving seven centimeters a year.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.360
 Yeah.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.360
 They knew it was going to happen.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.360
 It's just that GPS is aware of this and knows it has to update regularly.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.360
 So the last amount of data was 1992, I think.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.360
 Oh, people kept on clicking delay.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.360
 I'll update later.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.360
 I'll do it tomorrow.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.360
 Yes, particularly.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.360
 Since 1992.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.360
 Yeah.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.360
 But it could be quite dangerous because if there's a robot trucks in future, for instance,

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.360
 could use GPS to be transported around.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.360
 And they could be driving on the wrong side of the road if they're a few centimeters out.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.360
 Yeah.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.360
 Yeah.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.360
 Head on collisions.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.360
 Is it the case?

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.360
 Did you read in the story that that's faster than most other places?

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.360
 All other continents.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.360
 Is the fastest moving continent.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.360
 Really?

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.360
 Yeah.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.360
 Yeah.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.360
 It's running a escarper from New Zealand like nobody's business.

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.360
 Seven centimeters a year.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.360
 I think it was that.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.360
 That's what I read.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.360
 Yeah.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.360
 Still very much.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.360
 It's not too much.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.360
 You know you're a huge continent.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.360
 You know it's some credit.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.360
 Does Australia have any land ownership anywhere else in the world?

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.360
 They have some islands, don't they?

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.360
 Yeah, but in kind of surround.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:25.360
 Is there any, like, just Canada, somewhere in Canada, kind of thing?

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.360
 Have we got anything?

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.360
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.360
 Yeah, just a little--

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360
 I think they own Slau.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.360
 Supes on all of Australia?

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.360
 Yeah.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.360
 Oh, just curious.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.360
 No, I don't think so.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:39.360
 Oh, they claim a kind of a pie piece of Antarctica.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.360
 Yeah.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.360
 Well, actually--

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.360
 There's a bunch of others.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.360
 If you add together that and all the rest of the stuff, the Queenones,

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:53.360
 then the Russian Federation is no longer the largest single political entity on Earth.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.360
 But Russia also claims all of the North Pole and some of the South Pole as well.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.360
 Yes.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.360
 Oh, well, there we go.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.360
 I boast of Eastern Europe.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.360
 You'll move, Queenie.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:12.360
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.360
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.360
 And that is Chazinski.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:24.360
 My fact is that in the first half of the 20th century, multiple countries considered draining the Mediterranean Sea.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.360
 And this is something--

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360
 Sure.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.360
 Yeah, why not?

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.360
 Were they looking for the lost city of Atlantis?

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:35.360
 They weren't, although weirdly, the new continent that it created was going to be called Atlantropa.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.360
 So this was the brainchild of an architect.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.360
 A German architect called Herman Sorgl.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.360
 And he was promoting this from 1928 until he died in 1952.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:49.360
 And he had this vision of world peace and thought almost emptying the med was the way to do it.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.360
 So he wouldn't completely empty it.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:55.360
 But it would decrease in level by like 100 to 200 meters.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:00.360
 Is this the idea of, like, will all come together if I cause an ecological catastrophe?

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.360
 In a crisis, people work together.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.360
 It was the idea that we could use a lot of the land.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:14.360
 So obviously, we know there was a problem with Laban Schraum and living space around that time.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.360
 And Europe wanted to expand its population into different places.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.360
 So it was the idea of creating all this new land.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.360
 I'd say there was a perceived problem with that.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.360
 All right, we know who's side you're on.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.360
 The Allies?

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.360
 Exactly.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.360
 Still going with that old team?

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.360
 Getting an inkling as to who's side you're on, eh?

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.360
 To be fair, Faradah, they're also called the Allies.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.360
 They're just her allies.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:44.360
 Well, actually, so this guy wrote a bunch of books promoting this idea.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:49.360
 And he had a quote from Hitler on the fly leaf of one of his books in 1938, which was...

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.360
 Could not put it down.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:56.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.360
 So how were they going to drain the Mediterranean pull the plug?

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.360
 Um, he was going to... it was going to take a long time.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.360
 I think it was going to take 150 years.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.360
 Just buckets.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.360
 The idea was damning up all the places where water could get in.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:20.360
 So dam up the strait of Gibraltar, dam up the Dardanelles, dam up the bit between Tunisia and Sicily.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.360
 And eventually, water would stop coming into the Mediterranean, it would dry up.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:28.360
 And also, all these dams would be the locations of huge hydroelectric power plants.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:32.360
 And so the power generated by them would provide power for everyone.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:37.360
 And the final advantage of his plan was that it would be so costly for all countries that signed up

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:41.360
 and all countries would have to sign up that they wouldn't have any money to fight each other after that.

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:49.360
 And he said, if any country starts threatening peace, then their hydroelectric power would be cut off.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.360
 The idea was that the power would be a central control.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.360
 Exactly.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.360
 The U.N.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:47:00.360
 It's literally administered. Yeah, yeah. So there wasn't disadvantage. Wasn't it going to turn a lot of North Africa into a massive inland lake?

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.360
 Yes, it was.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.360
 So I need to have advantage, though.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.360
 Well, it didn't enter into his plans that quite a lot of people lived in North Africa.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.360
 Sure.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.360
 Well, I'm not sure he thought of it that way.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.360
 But actually, there have been plans to turn a lot of North Africa into a lake.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.360
 Anyway, like separate plants.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.360
 Really?

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.360
 So how and see people have been suggesting this.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:24.360
 Actually, the French government, when they owned a lot of North Africa, looked into it properly.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:30.360
 And what they found is there's quite a few depressions in the Sahara that are under kind of sea level.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.360
 And they thought maybe we could get some water in there.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:37.360
 And it would instead of being a desert, would become a place where people could live more comfortably.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.360
 It would be a desert with a lake in it.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.360
 That's probably true.

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:48.360
 But they actually had some funding, but it was withdrawn when surveys revealed that many areas were not as far below sea level as had been believed.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:53.360
 So they thought these depressions were below sea level, but actually they were higher because they were in high land.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.360
 Do you know about the last time that the Mediterranean dried up?

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.360
 No.

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.360
 This was a thing called the Messinian Salinity Crisis, which happened six million years.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.360
 It was right off the tongue.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.360
 Yeah.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.360
 They need some branding.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.360
 It became a landlock.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.360
 That's it.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.360
 Spain and Morocco crashed into each other, basically.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.360
 Seven centimeters per year.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.360
 Yeah, pretty slow.

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:19.360
 But the line was seven centimeters away from them.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.360
 You just don't think ahead, darling.

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.360
 And so the climate is really dry.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.360
 And so the med is proged a lot of evaporation.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:32.360
 And as a result of that drying process, there are salt deposits on the bottom of the med,

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.360
 which in some places are two miles thick.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.360
 Whoa.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.360
 Yeah.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.360
 And during the time it was closing when they were moving towards each other,

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:44.360
 the basin of the med evaporated and then re-flooded 69 separate times.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.360
 Yeah.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.360
 And then it finally was cut off completely 5.6 million years ago.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:54.360
 The theory is that one of these flooding could have been what caused a lot of the flood myths

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.360
 in various religions, isn't it?

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.360
 Yeah.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.360
 But that's so pre-human.

00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.360
 It's so pre-human years ago.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.360
 It's fine because it eventually re-flooded properly 5.3 million years ago.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.360
 And that's the biggest flood that Earth has ever seen.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.360
 And that flooded in the space of I think a few months or maybe a year.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.360
 And the flood waters would move at 100 kilometres per hour, I think,

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:16.360
 because they seeped back in.

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:20.360
 And it was caused by a bit of land just caving in at one of the little joints.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.360
 Gibraltar, wasn't it?

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.360
 That was when the Straits of Gibraltar were created.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.360
 It was that gradually tipping over and then gradually, you know,

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.360
 war away more of the bridge that gets faster and faster.

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.360
 And it sounds amazing.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:34.360
 What happens to you if you're a fish in that sort of just in that moment?

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.360
 Yeah. Like, do you die? Is that too fast? Is there too fast for a fish?

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.360
 No, it is.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.360
 A few kilometres in that hour isn't too fast?

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.360
 Yeah, sure.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.360
 But there certainly is too fast for a fish.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360
 Is it?

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.360
 I would say so.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.360
 Yeah, in the same--

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.360
 It's a spin-off podcast.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.360
 What speed would it be?

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.360
 Well, I don't know what the speed is.

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.360
 But like, for instance, there's too windy for a human.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.360
 Yeah.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:00.360
 For instance, like, you know, if something's hitting you at a certain speed,

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:04.360
 but molecules are water molecules or anything, or a wall,

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.360
 there is too fast for a fish.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.360
 But if you're going with the tide, if you're going with--

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.360
 If you're going with the wind, though.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.360
 No, but--

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.360
 No, with Dan on this one.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.360
 Wouldn't GeForce, wouldn't-- you're going with the GeForce.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.360
 If the medium in which you are traveling is carrying you along

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.360
 100 kilometres per hour, it's like you're fishing a car at that point.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.360
 Yes, that's what I'm thinking.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.360
 Yeah.

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.360
 The turbulence of the water, but that might cause some stress.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.360
 Yeah.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.360
 It's going to be a fish mate.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.360
 Yeah, right.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.360
 You wouldn't experience it as moving at 100 miles an hour

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.360
 because you're in the car.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.360
 Right.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.360
 And then what's weird is that when the fish got back home,

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.360
 all the fish at home would be thousands of years later for them.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.360
 That's called time dilation.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.360
 It's the only scientifically proven form of time travel at work.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.360
