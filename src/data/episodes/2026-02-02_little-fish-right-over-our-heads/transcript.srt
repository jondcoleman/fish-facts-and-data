00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,460
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Little Fish.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:22,440
 This is our audience facto you have been sending in brilliant facts to podcast@QY.com

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,800
 and we are here to tell you the best ones.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,960
 And who are we Andy?

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,880
 Oh yeah, I'm Andrew Hunter Murray and these are my friends.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,960
 Dan Schreiver and James Harkin.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,200
 Good to be here Andy.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
 James?

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,200
 Oh yeah, I love it.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
 Let's crack on.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
 Who's got a fact?

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
 I've got one.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 Yep.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,600
 This is from Mary Kuhner.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,040
 I think maybe from Colorado because she said here's a fact from Colorado.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,600
 When Denver smells like manure, it's about to snow.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
 Oh.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,280
 When Denver smells like, what a great riddle.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
 When Denver smells like manure, it's about to snow.

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,840
 Does that feel like the old, if you can see the hills that I mean.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
 Is it about to rain?

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,880
 And if you can't see the hills, it is raining.

24
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,280
 That's all we say in Bolton.

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
 Yeah.

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:13,600
 Is it because the area is going very dry because it's getting so cold that the smell can travel

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
 to your nostrils.

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
 Not quite.

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 Not quite.

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
 What is the riddle?

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
 Good attempt.

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
 Nice one professor.

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,920
 There are no points for trying on this show.

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,400
 I thought it was a very good effort, Dan, I don't mind saying so.

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,960
 It's because Denver's in kind of a bowl and lots of cattle live there.

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,680
 And you get this thing called the upslope effect where it pushes up against the mountains and

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,840
 goes up to the top of the mountains.

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,880
 And then when it gets to the top, it condenses and you get rain or snow.

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,280
 So it is one of these things where actually people think it's, they say, oh, if it smells

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,600
 like manure, it's going to snow, but it actually is true.

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,880
 So the air gets sort of pulled off the land, the cowey manure land.

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
 Yes.

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
 That's right.

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,880
 Then turn the snow.

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
 Precisely correct.

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
 It's like feces.

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
 Don't eat brown snow.

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
 That's what they say in Denver.

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
 Yeah, there you go.

50
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,400
 Would you like one more fact about Denver?

51
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
 Yeah.

52
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:10,520
 Much of the tap water in Denver comes from a place called Gross Reservoir.

53
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,000
 It might be, don't write in if you're from there because it might be that it's pronounced

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 gross.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I'm not sure.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,360
 Because it's named after former chief engineer of Denver water, Dwight D-G-R-O-S.

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
 Ah, right.

58
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
 Nice.

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
 Gross, gross.

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
 Yeah, yeah.

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
 Potato potato.

62
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
 Want a great Denver nugget?

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
 Lovely.

64
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,960
 And if you can spell those Denver nuggets, it's about to snow.

65
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,320
 It's a name of their basketball team as well.

66
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
 The Denver nuggets.

67
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
 Oh.

68
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
 Is it?

69
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
 It is.

70
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
 Yeah.

71
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
 Very good.

72
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
 That was a good one.

73
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
 Yeah.

74
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
 It went right over my head.

75
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
 Is that a basketball joke?

76
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
 It went right over my head.

77
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
 Well, that one also went over my head.

78
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
 Three points.

79
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
 I don't understand basketball either.

80
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
 Let's do a fact.

81
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
 Let's do a fact.

82
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,440
 This one comes from Camille Jordan, sister of Michael Jordan, of course, from the

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
 Chicago Bulls.

84
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,720
 No, Camille Jordan is from Alton in Switzerland.

85
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,920
 And this is a fantastic fact.

86
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,760
 Technically, Camille says, the first flag on the moon was the Swiss flag.

87
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
 Yeah.

88
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
 Well.

89
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
 So.

90
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,840
 Well, I'm not sure that is true.

91
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,840
 Well, let's let Camille show her workings.

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,440
 Can I just say, I think we might have done this on QI where everyone thinks it's the

93
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,360
 American flag, but the Russians sent a probe up, it crashed, and there was a Soviet flag

94
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
 on there.

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,000
 So we always thought it was Soviet, but what's the Swiss thing?

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,200
 You've absolutely kiboshed her reasoning here.

97
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
 If that's the case.

98
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,320
 But so let's say when the Americans landed on the moon, before they put up the American

99
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,400
 flag, they sort of accidentally put up another flag.

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
 No.

101
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,240
 Physicists from the University of Bern designed an experiment to be performed during the

102
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,720
 first moon expedition, a solar sail to capture solar wind particles.

103
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,560
 For the best result, the sail needed to stay up as long as possible, which is why it was

104
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,080
 set up even before the US flag.

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,320
 The equipment had a little Swiss cross on it, which depending on your definition of a flag

106
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,240
 makes the Swiss flag the first flag to be placed on the surface of the moon.

107
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
 Yeah, absolutely.

108
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,360
 Camille says that there's a short documentary that everyone can watch on YouTube called

109
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,160
 Burn on the Moon, which shows this story and shows how it is.

110
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,040
 So if anyone's interested to look into that more, you can check that out there.

111
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,920
 Interestingly, there was another flag that was taken to the moon, not just the American,

112
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,720
 not just the Swiss flag, or the Soviets, or the Soviets.

113
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,040
 And this was taken up by Buzz Aldrin, which was the Freemason flag.

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
 Oh, God.

115
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,160
 Well, he was part of a Freemason's Lodge, and the idea was that they wanted to open their

116
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,800
 own lodge on the moon.

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
 No.

118
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,440
 Well, this is according to Bedfisher Freemason's website.

119
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
 Temperature.

120
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
 Yeah.

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
 They would know.

122
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,040
 And probably they won't tell it to any of the other Freemason's, but just the Bedfisher

123
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
 branch, they're the ones who really know what's going on.

124
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,000
 Here's what they say on their website.

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,200
 They say, so two American astronauts landed on the moon in the Sea Tranquility.

126
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,120
 One of these brave men's was brother Edwin, brother Edwin Eugene Aldrin, Jr.

127
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,040
 A member of the Clear Lake Lodge number one, four, one, seven in Texas.

128
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,200
 Brother Buzz was authorized by the grandmaster of Texas to claim Masonic territorial jurisdiction

129
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,040
 for a grand lodge of Texas on the moon.

130
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,360
 No, I've just, sorry, I'm just thinking back because you know the footage of them getting

131
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
 off.

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
 Oh, yeah.

133
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
 Buzz has his trousers rolled up, doesn't it?

134
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
 He does, he does.

135
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,560
 And he's got that big wizard wand as well.

136
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,760
 It's not a wand to them.

137
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,560
 It's just a piece of word that you do spells with.

138
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
 Yeah.

139
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,440
 So it got permission, and the idea was because it was a lot of belief from the Mason.

140
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
 From the Mason's.

141
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
 Not from NASA.

142
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
 No.

143
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,440
 Well, because he also, he snuck on Nick.

144
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
 He snuck on, yes.

145
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
 He's doing lots of stuff, wasn't he?

146
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
 Yeah, he did lots of...

147
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
 It's amazing.

148
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
 We had time to do any science on the moon.

149
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,160
 It seems to be mostly like a tourist thing for Buzz.

150
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
 Yeah, wow.

151
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,680
 The thought was because apparently people were projecting that by the year 2000 there would

152
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,840
 be permanent lunar bases on the moon that would allow you to get there as quickly from

153
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,480
 Earth to the moon as you would fly plane from San Francisco to Boston.

154
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,280
 And it would be a stopping point between your trip to Mars or the rings of Saturn.

155
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,400
 Therefore, it made sense for them to open a special lodge for them to have ready for

156
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
 them for that time.

157
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
 Right.

158
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
 Yeah.

159
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
 So there we go.

160
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
 Good.

161
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,640
 And this is a fact from Alex Wilson.

162
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,840
 And it's about regret.

163
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
 Okay.

164
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
 There you go.

165
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,680
 In 2009, Lily Allen was asked to do a gig.

166
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,440
 She was asked to do a gig online, right?

167
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
 But not as herself.

168
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
 She was asked to do a sort of streaming gig.

169
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
 Do you remember the video game's second life?

170
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
 Yes.

171
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,000
 People had avatars and they had jobs inside second life.

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,280
 There was a whole second life economy like it was a...

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,840
 It was a really big thing for a long time.

174
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,200
 Comedians like Jimmy Carr were doing live gigs.

175
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
 He'll play anywhere.

176
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,680
 So Lily Allen was asked to do a gig in second life, right?

177
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,120
 And she was offered a fee not in pounds, right?

178
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,720
 But in a new sort of like fake currency that was sort of doing rounds a bit.

179
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
 It was in Bitcoin.

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
 She was offered.

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,680
 She was offered hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin.

182
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
 Ooh.

183
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
 Which might...

184
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,400
 I think I found a source that said it was equivalent to like $600.

185
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,800
 Interestingly, she did regrett it.

186
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
 She thought it was a dogecoin.

187
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 Yeah.

188
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
 Thought it was a dogecoin?

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
 No.

190
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,080
 It's like that's one of her big songs, that's her album.

191
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
 Really?

192
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
 Yeah.

193
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
 That's a really good joke that went super good joke.

194
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
 Right over our heads.

195
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,240
 That's going to be the name of this episode, isn't it?

196
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
 I think so.

197
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,640
 Lovely when you hear it form in real time.

198
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
 No, it didn't know that.

199
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
 That's a really good joke.

200
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
 Yeah.

201
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
 She finds a...

202
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
 It's Pussy Palace and she thought it was a dogecoin.

203
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
 Oh, yes.

204
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
 Yes, on her new album.

205
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
 Yeah.

206
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

207
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
 Got it.

208
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
 Yeah.

209
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
 Well.

210
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,200
 She was offered.

211
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,920
 So she says hundreds of thousands of bitcoin, right?

212
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
 Yeah.

213
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:46,360
 If it was literally 200,000 bitcoin, which she turned down, that would be worth about 13 billion

214
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
 pounds today.

215
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
 Okay.

216
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,040
 I have found a source which said it was $600 and with the value of bitcoin as it was then,

217
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:59,840
 that would have been about 860,000 bitcoin, which at today's value would be $56,000,000,

218
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,640
 50 times the net worth of the king.

219
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
 Okay.

220
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,240
 How about the 20th richest person on the planet?

221
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
 Yeah.

222
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
 Wow.

223
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
 Oh, she said no to the gig.

224
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
 And instead they brought this blues artist called Elon Musk.

225
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
 He came in.

226
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
 Okay.

227
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
 All right.

228
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,800
 When started, it's a new act night.

229
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
 Come on, Elon.

230
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,040
 Can you imagine that?

231
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
 I think you can't.

232
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,440
 I think you have to not imagine that.

233
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
 She's doing all right.

234
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
 She's doing great.

235
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
 She's doing great.

236
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
 But she's not...

237
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,800
 Well, I mean, she's not doing great as the new album of a test, but she's doing it far.

238
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
 Oh, yeah.

239
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,600
 I'm sure she's in a better place now.

240
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
 Oh, definitely.

241
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
 Definitely.

242
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
 Well, she's the Lord Byron of the 21st century.

243
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
 Yeah.

244
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 You're right.

245
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
 But would it have made her happy?

246
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
 No.

247
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
 No.

248
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
 Well, maybe.

249
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 It makes you happy.

250
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 Up to a certain point.

251
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
 Then it doesn't make you happy.

252
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,840
 But I think above a certain point, surely it's going to make you happy a bit.

253
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
 Yeah.

254
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
 Well, I don't know.

255
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
 Do you remember we had Malcolm Gladwell on No Such Thing as a Fish?

256
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,440
 You should check out that episode if you haven't heard it because it's a great guest

257
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
 appearance.

258
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,240
 Well, asked us a question, which would you take if you were offered?

259
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
 Yeah.

260
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
 Either what was it?

261
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
 10 million.

262
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
 100,000 pounds.

263
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
 A million.

264
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
 10 million.

265
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
 100 million.

266
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
 Yeah.

267
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
 Or a thousand million.

268
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
 Yeah.

269
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
 A billion.

270
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
 And he said most people picked 10 million.

271
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
 I think so.

272
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
 I imagine a number.

273
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
 And Dan Swall blind.

274
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
 He would take the billion.

275
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,240
 I just said a billion for the sake of playing the game and he went nuts on me.

276
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
 Tell you a new one.

277
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
 Yeah, in a very funny way.

278
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
 It was great.

279
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
 But he just...

280
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
 The unhappiness that would bring to your life to take a billion.

281
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
 Yeah.

282
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
 Versus a million.

283
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
 So what did you do with it at the end?

284
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
 Put it all in Bitcoin.

285
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
 Incredibly the day before.

286
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,240
 Anyway, you have to still keep making the show forever now.

287
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
 Okay.

288
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,520
 Here is a fact from Peter Marsh and Peter says this is very good.

289
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,480
 At any one time there must be a Polish person who is northernmost on planet Earth.

290
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,840
 And so they would be the North Pole.

291
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
 Yep.

292
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
 Okay.

293
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,840
 Not a fact so far.

294
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,520
 But he says, but Peter says that it's usually very difficult to tell who it might be.

295
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:14,680
 But on 23rd of May 1995, we can be sure it was either Marek Kaminsky or Wojciech Moskal because

296
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,520
 they were the first poles to reach the geographic North Pole on that day.

297
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,280
 So they were the two North Poles at the North Pole.

298
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
 That's lovely.

299
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
 That's wonderful.

300
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
 That's lovely.

301
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,840
 And I thought I'd have a look at the South Pole and it turns out there is an Arktowski Polish

302
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,560
 Antarctic Station, which is in the Antarctic in the South Pole.

303
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,040
 And basically Polish people live there and do science there.

304
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,920
 And so there's always like a little community of South Poles.

305
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
 North Poles.

306
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
 That's very good.

307
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
 That does.

308
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
 We can't do it now because we're putting it out.

309
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,400
 But that is a great quiz question.

310
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,720
 In 1995, for one day, there were three North Poles.

311
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
 Yeah.

312
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,080
 So on their five already, there's geographic and then there's magnetic and then there's

313
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
 OK.

314
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,120
 Well, it's a complicated question, sure, for the quiz.

315
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,960
 But which quiz are you pitching it to?

316
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
 Maybe one of our quizzes that we do for Patreon?

317
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
 Yeah.

318
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
 Yeah, we could do it the next one.

319
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,280
 We're doing them quarterly and we're about to do our first one tonight as we're recording

320
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
 this episode.

321
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,440
 So yeah, let's bring it to the next one.

322
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
 Right.

323
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
 Dan's pole quiz.

324
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
 Yep.

325
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
 Oh, no.

326
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,360
 Shall I bring another fact here?

327
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,140
 This is from Andrew Perez, who writes, "Jone of Arc once prayed at a chapel in Milwaukee,

328
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,140
 Wisconsin."

329
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,140
 No.

330
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,140
 Yes.

331
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,140
 Not true.

332
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,140
 True.

333
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,140
 Is that the dairy stage?

334
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,140
 Wisconsin is, yeah.

335
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,140
 Yeah.

336
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,140
 Yeah.

337
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,140
 Just showing my knowledge.

338
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,140
 Great.

339
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,140
 Carry on.

340
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,140
 What do you know she did?

341
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
 She lived as far as I understood it.

342
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,140
 She lived and died in France.

343
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,140
 Yeah.

344
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
 And the new world hadn't been discovered at that stage.

345
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,140
 Yeah.

346
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
 Both correct.

347
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,580
 But she was magic or there was another person called Joan of Arc.

348
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,580
 Oh, that's it.

349
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:02,260
 It played a quarter back for the Green Bay Packers.

350
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
 That's it.

351
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,260
 No, it's not.

352
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:10,940
 No, what this is is there is a church that was built in 1420 and it's in a town that is

353
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:16,220
 southeast of Leon and it was where Joan of Arc prayed.

354
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220
 Yeah.

355
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,900
 Now, there was a very rich American called Gertrude Hill Gavin who was daughter of an

356
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,740
 American railroad magnate and she was obsessed with Joan of Arc.

357
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,340
 She learnt that this chapel was a for sale.

358
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,620
 So she acquired it.

359
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,900
 She had it dismantled and she had it shipped over to her property in Long Island.

360
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,500
 And from there, it's been an America ever since.

361
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,020
 But maybe it's moved from Long Island to Wisconsin.

362
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
 Yeah, I guess so.

363
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,020
 That's another journey.

364
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,020
 Yeah.

365
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:53,020
 Interesting is this particular church was so beloved by one person in particular who was

366
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,020
 an architect that he basically mapped out every single brick and just said if this was

367
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,100
 ever dismantled, this is how it would come back together.

368
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,700
 So the blueprint for how to put it back together was already written for her by the

369
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,700
 successor.

370
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,100
 So did he like label each brick and say this one has to go here.

371
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
 This one has to go here.

372
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
 Basically.

373
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
 Yeah.

374
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
 Yeah.

375
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,420
 So she even renamed the chapel so that had Joan's name in the chapel.

376
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:22,380
 And in 1933 Pope Pius XI gave her written permission to have mass in that building.

377
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,140
 So it's officially sanctioned by the Vatican as well.

378
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
 I think we did a fact.

379
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:33,060
 Ages ago about Rosa Parks had a house that was going to be dismantled and just completely

380
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,540
 destroyed in America and people wanted to save it.

381
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,540
 So someone bought it and shipped it over to Berlin in Germany where it was for years.

382
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,980
 So you could go and visit Rosa Parks's house, which was not one of her main houses, but

383
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,060
 somewhere she spent a lot of time.

384
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,020
 I think her brother lived in it and owned it.

385
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
 She sent it.

386
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,860
 She rented it out as an Airbnb for the summer.

387
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,860
 Yeah.

388
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,260
 You make it sound like she was more of a property lady than anything else Rosa Parks.

389
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,300
 But then why she was getting the bus to and from, of course, it was just to check on the

390
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,660
 property portfolio.

391
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,940
 But she, so it was been in Berlin for ages and then America requested that it be sent

392
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,180
 back for an exhibition.

393
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,300
 So it went back to America, was shown there and then brought back over to Europe.

394
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,340
 It's very dicey all this moving stuff around, I'm not sure why I feel about it.

395
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
 Yeah.

396
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,660
 It's like they're about to move the bio tapestry over here.

397
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
 How they?

398
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
 Yeah, we're going to get it back.

399
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
 That's good.

400
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,660
 Briefly.

401
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,820
 I feel like tapestries are easier to move around than houses.

402
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,820
 You would think so.

403
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,540
 They are having the devil of a time.

404
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,540
 They are.

405
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,540
 Obviously it's so old.

406
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,140
 And they're terribly worried that any movement of more than two millimeters and it'll just

407
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,140
 fall apart.

408
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,780
 And it'll be incredibly embarrassing if they open it up at the other end and it's been

409
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,940
 damaged in transit.

410
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,220
 So they're making a dummy 900-year-old tapestry rolling it up and doing the journey

411
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:47,260
 with that in this ultra buffered thing because of pot holes and things, right, and vibrations

412
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,260
 in the road.

413
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,180
 Oh, it's going to be, it's going to be a nightmare.

414
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,180
 I wouldn't mind.

415
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,020
 It would be easier just to move everyone who wants to see it to France.

416
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
 100%.

417
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
 Absolutely.

418
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,540
 I can move up and down two millimeters.

419
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,540
 I'm fine.

420
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,540
 Have you ever seen it?

421
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,540
 Yeah.

422
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,540
 Me neither.

423
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,540
 No, I haven't actually.

424
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,540
 Oh.

425
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,540
 Oh, Dan's wondering.

426
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
 Was it shown in the British library a while ago?

427
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,540
 It was not.

428
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,460
 It's been in bio for 800 years.

429
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,700
 I think I'm going to say no, then.

430
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:20,820
 I would say no on account of the fact I'm not 100% certain where the hell is.

431
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,500
 Um, here's another fact.

432
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
 Yeah.

433
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
 From Morton Fading.

434
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
 What's the great name?

435
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
 Yeah.

436
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
 I suspect it might be Norwegian.

437
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
 Morton.

438
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,980
 Like Morton Huckett from Arha.

439
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,980
 Is Morton Huckett Norwegian?

440
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,980
 Yes.

441
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,980
 There we go.

442
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:42,660
 But Morton writes, the most famous traitor in Norwegian history was named famous traitor.

443
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
 Was that not?

444
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,660
 Is it quizzling?

445
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:50,900
 So it's a guy called Vidcon Quizzling who was the head of the puppet government in Norway

446
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,260
 in the second world war after the Nazis invaded.

447
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:59,060
 And basically, for a very long time, I didn't know what the puppet government meant.

448
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,180
 And I took it to mean the other version of what that is.

449
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,180
 What's that?

450
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,740
 Why don't you take over Greenland?

451
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
 Oh, wow.

452
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
 That's really funny.

453
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,740
 Yeah.

454
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,740
 Well, he was the head of that.

455
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,100
 Um, and he was a, you know, big ol' collaborator.

456
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,700
 Anyway, quizzling has become a byword for being a traitor.

457
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
 In English.

458
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:28,220
 English and in Norwegian and basically Vidcon, which is his first name, is a Norse name,

459
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,700
 which means widely known.

460
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
 Oh.

461
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,220
 So Vidcon quizzling literally means famous traitor.

462
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,220
 Oh, yeah.

463
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,220
 He's a famous traitor.

464
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
 That's good.

465
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
 He's a, yeah.

466
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,740
 He was the first Norwegian executed by the state in 75 years.

467
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
 I'll see.

468
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,300
 They didn't do it, but they did bring that out of retirement for him.

469
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
 Yes.

470
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,300
 Yeah.

471
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
 After the war.

472
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
 So bad news.

473
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
 We're going to execute you.

474
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
 Good news.

475
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
 You're going to be a very interesting fact.

476
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
 Yeah.

477
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
 Yeah.

478
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
 He tried.

479
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
 Also, I did a bit more reading up on him.

480
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
 He tried to do the world's first ever radio coup d'état.

481
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,300
 Interesting.

482
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
 Oh, yeah.

483
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,660
 So you go in and you just do a radio broadcast saying, we control everything now.

484
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,980
 Well, quite often you would see a coup d'état in, let's say, in Africa or something.

485
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,980
 Yeah.

486
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,980
 And the first thing you really see is the army either side of the former president saying,

487
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,300
 we're in charge now.

488
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,300
 Completely.

489
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,980
 So you can kind of see where they're coming from.

490
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
 Broadcast is absolutely essential.

491
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,580
 You've got to see the means of communication.

492
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,580
 Yeah.

493
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,580
 The supposed problem with radio is people can't see whether or not you're holding their

494
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,540
 president at gunpoint at that stage.

495
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
 Yes.

496
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,540
 Yes.

497
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,140
 You have to do very good folly to make them believe what's happening.

498
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,140
 Yeah.

499
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,140
 We're in charge.

500
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,140
 Yeah.

501
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,820
 You can do that these days, of course, because there are too many podcasts.

502
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,060
 It's very hard to seize all the podcasts at the same time.

503
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
 Interesting.

504
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,780
 You could buy an inserted ad.

505
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:50,100
 And if you use the offer code fish, you can also take over nearby islands.

506
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,060
 Here's one from Kate Boyle.

507
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,500
 Kate says, "Botulism cures anal fishes."

508
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
 Oh, gosh.

509
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
 Okay.

510
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,260
 Portulism is bad.

511
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,540
 In large doses, it's very bad.

512
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,340
 Even in quite small doses, it's very bad.

513
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,340
 It's the most poisonous thing, basic.

514
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,860
 Is it related to Botox?

515
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,420
 It's so related that they're exactly the same thing.

516
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
 I understand.

517
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,180
 But you put my new amounts of botulism into your wrinkles.

518
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
 Right.

519
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,180
 And it paralyzes your skin and it removes the wrinkles.

520
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,180
 Yeah.

521
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,620
 But yeah, botulism is the most poisonous thing you can get.

522
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,420
 And because it stops muscle from spasming, it's used to help anal fishes as well as migraines,

523
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,420
 excessive sweating, overactive bladders, and cerebral palsy.

524
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
 Gosh.

525
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
 Okay.

526
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
 That's pretty good.

527
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,420
 Useful stuff.

528
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:45,940
 2023 study that I had in my files looked at the brain scans of people who had Botox and

529
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,900
 said that they have different brain activity than the rest of us when they look at happy

530
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,740
 and angry faces.

531
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,820
 And that's because when you see someone happy, you kind of mimic their face and it makes

532
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,500
 you feel more happy, but they can't mimic their faces because they don't have so much Botox

533
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 in their heads.

534
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
 That's so funny.

535
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
 So it makes you less happy.

536
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
 Or it makes you less sad.

537
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
 It makes you less sad.

538
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
 Yeah.

539
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,780
 Do poker players secretly get Botox?

540
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,780
 I would be surprised if they didn't.

541
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,780
 Yeah.

542
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,700
 Because you're always looking for the tiniest little help in poker.

543
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
 Yeah.

544
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,260
 Can you Botox away your tail, if it's say like a little twitch in your eye?

545
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,260
 Absolutely.

546
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,180
 How much of you are allowed to… because they were shades, don't they?

547
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
 Or sometimes.

548
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,180
 Many of them do.

549
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,180
 Yeah.

550
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,180
 Do you like to work like a mask?

551
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,180
 I do.

552
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,180
 Do you like to sit in a bin?

553
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,700
 Like a little eyehole cut out.

554
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
 You can play online.

555
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
 Good.

556
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
 That's pretty good.

557
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
 Yes.

558
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
 You see my home set up.

559
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
 I see.

560
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
 Oh.

561
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
 Yeah.

562
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,700
 That's wonderful.

563
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
 Yeah.

564
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
 Okay.

565
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
 I go on here.

566
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,700
 It's from Mark Vent, who I know.

567
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
 I know Mark Vent.

568
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,700
 He is.

569
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
 Yeah.

570
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,380
 He has written in saying in Oxford, there's a building where the weather forecast could

571
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:01,980
 honestly read between -269 degrees and +150 million degrees.

572
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,740
 This is Columns Fusion Reactor, which produces plasma hotter than the sun.

573
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,260
 And it's right next to a machine that is colder than deep space.

574
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,260
 So yeah.

575
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,220
 Why is that useful for them to be next to each other?

576
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
 No.

577
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,900
 Well, you're building that's dealing in - Could be.

578
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,500
 Oh, do you mean, do they need to be just to add a heat out of one space, and that probably

579
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,380
 helps you get up towards 150 million degrees in the other space?

580
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,380
 It could very well be.

581
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,380
 It's possible it could work that way.

582
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,580
 It's like how it's hot sometimes next to the fridge.

583
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,580
 Behind your fridge.

584
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,580
 Behind your fridge.

585
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,580
 Exactly.

586
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,580
 So that's probably what this is.

587
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,580
 That's what this is.

588
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,740
 They probably didn't even mean to create the fusion reactor, because it was so bloody

589
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,740
 warm next to this.

590
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,740
 But we should use this.

591
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,300
 This is just an unusable fridge, which went too far in its coldness of heat.

592
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,100
 Is there a position between those two places where it's just right?

593
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
 Oh.

594
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,380
 There must be a bit where you stand there and it's perfect, but you've got to keep rotating.

595
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,380
 Yes.

596
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,380
 Like a rotisserie ticket.

597
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,380
 Yeah.

598
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,380
 Yeah.

599
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,380
 Yeah.

600
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,380
 Anyway, very cool.

601
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,380
 Very cool.

602
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,380
 Very cool.

603
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,380
 Add very hot.

604
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
 Lovely.

605
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,380
 All right.

606
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,500
 Those are your facts.

607
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,140
 But now let's have some of our facts, because what we're going to do now is everyone who

608
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,380
 has joined Club Fish, our members club, at the friend of the podcast here, gets one

609
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:21,300
 of our headline facts given to them in perpetuity to love and care for with a certificate.

610
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,140
 It's great fun.

611
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,020
 If you want to check it out, go to patreon.com/no such thing as a fish.

612
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,060
 You can see all the stuff we've got there, ad free episodes, lots of bonus content, and

613
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,540
 friends of the podcast certificates.

614
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,820
 So let's dish out some facts now.

615
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,820
 Who wants to go first?

616
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,820
 I can do that.

617
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,820
 Yeah.

618
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,700
 This is a fact that now belongs to Dave Chronister.

619
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,180
 Dave, this is a fact from episode 25, rats wearing polyester pants can't get a

620
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,180
 direction.

621
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,180
 Very nice.

622
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,180
 Not if you're a rat.

623
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,180
 Yeah, bad.

624
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,180
 Bad.

625
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,180
 Is it polyester?

626
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
 Is it the polyester?

627
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,700
 Is it the, like, as opposed to linen?

628
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,700
 I think this was, yeah.

629
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,740
 Obviously, right in linen, little linen trousers will be very sexy.

630
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
 It's silk.

631
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
 Oh.

632
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,740
 Oh.

633
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,140
 I think this was research that we got from Mary Roach.

634
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,180
 I think she wrote in a book of hers.

635
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,180
 She might want to.

636
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,180
 Was it fun?

637
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,180
 I think it was bonk, and I think she went and she visited.

638
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,180
 Yeah.

639
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
 It's a wonderful book.

640
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
 I mean, she's one of our favourite writers.

641
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,180
 That's the rat Taylor, didn't she?

642
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
 Yeah.

643
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
 Yeah.

644
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
 That's a great fact.

645
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,180
 Okay.

646
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
 Here's another one.

647
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,820
 This is now under the custodianship of Tom Watson and Tom, this is your fact during the

648
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:32,580
 First World War, entertainment for the troops included pillow fights, wheelbarrow races

649
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,620
 and wrestling on the backs of mules.

650
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,300
 It does feel like it sounds fun.

651
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
 It does.

652
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,300
 Andrew Hunter Murray.

653
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
 You were the one who said this the first time, wasn't it?

654
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,300
 Yeah.

655
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,060
 Well, I can remember every word of the fact itself, because we've got a list of them in

656
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
 front of us.

657
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,060
 I don't remember the pillow fights.

658
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,820
 I have just finished today reading Journey's End, which is an absolutely classic play set in

659
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,420
 the First World War by someone who'd been through the First World War.

660
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,100
 And there is not a pillow fight to be seen.

661
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
 I'll tell you that.

662
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
 He very much edited that out.

663
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
 Right.

664
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
 His mise en scène.

665
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
 I'll dish one out.

666
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
 Yeah.

667
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,220
 This one goes to Matthew Acorn.

668
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:11,020
 It's that the atmosphere in Venus is so hot that if you took a pizza out of the

669
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,820
 freezer there, it would cook in three seconds.

670
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,700
 You could do that in Oxford in the building.

671
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,620
 Take it out of the special minus 269 degree freezer.

672
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,620
 Yeah.

673
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,380
 Frisbee it across.

674
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,820
 By the time it lands perfect.

675
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,820
 Perfect.

676
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,820
 Lovely.

677
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,820
 Yeah, that was my fight.

678
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,380
 I don't remember much about it, apart from I don't think I worked it out myself.

679
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,020
 I think it was something I read elsewhere.

680
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,700
 Oh, that was before you went on your 10-year binge of creation effects.

681
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,540
 But I think the idea was it would cook it, but it would be very crispy on the outside,

682
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,460
 and perhaps not exactly frozen on the inside.

683
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,460
 Yeah.

684
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,460
 But like if I do a barbecue for it's...

685
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,180
 You really want to give it five seconds, don't you?

686
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,020
 That's of another one.

687
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,020
 Okay.

688
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,020
 Here's another fact.

689
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,060
 And this is going to Melanie Young.

690
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:04,340
 Melanie, this was one of my facts from episode 25 in Iceland.

691
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,820
 There is a phone app which tells you whether you're related to the person you're hitting

692
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,820
 on.

693
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,940
 It's an interesting one because there have been debunks of that.

694
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,940
 Yeah.

695
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,380
 But I think that it did exist.

696
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,620
 But I don't think it was like something you could buy in the app store or anything like

697
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,620
 that.

698
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,620
 Oh.

699
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,500
 Basically, Iceland got all of this data and made it available online so that anyone could

700
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,900
 use it.

701
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,140
 And some people as a project came up with this idea.

702
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,540
 And they did actually make the app, but it wasn't commercially available.

703
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,540
 Oh, well, there we go.

704
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,820
 Well, it had a motto that went along with it, which was bump phones before you're bumping

705
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:41,260
 in bed and quite a nice idea because it is a small-ish population over there.

706
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,260
 Yeah.

707
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,740
 You probably know if some of your cousins, though.

708
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,740
 Would you?

709
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,740
 Of course.

710
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,540
 You guys didn't know your cousins?

711
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,700
 It's worried not your cousins.

712
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,380
 You guys don't know that your cousins?

713
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,380
 Oh, God.

714
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,780
 And I saw you kissing.

715
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,780
 Oh, no.

716
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,780
 Oh, no.

717
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
 No, no.

718
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,780
 No, I know what you mean.

719
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,700
 I was like, you'll know your immediate family and anyone who's more than a few cousins

720
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,620
 away, I think, is a fake agent.

721
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,620
 Oh, wow.

722
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,620
 Okay.

723
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,260
 But it's in plot twist.

724
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,540
 Isn't people used to marry their first cousins all the time?

725
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,540
 Yeah.

726
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
 And sometimes people still do.

727
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,980
 And it's like, it's, you know, it's nobody's business.

728
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,980
 Yeah.

729
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,940
 But I think there are more people who are second or third cousins that they don't necessarily

730
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,820
 know about in Iceland than they might be in another country because of the small population.

731
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,540
 And because no one really goes in and out very much.

732
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
 I don't know.

733
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,580
 The problem is they're going in and out, isn't it?

734
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,820
 But yeah, like the people who have lived there for many generations.

735
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,820
 Right.

736
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,820
 Okay.

737
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,820
 Okay.

738
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,820
 Okay.

739
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,820
 Here is a fact.

740
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,940
 And this was a fact given to us by Simon Rich, the author.

741
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
 Simon Rich?

742
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,940
 Yeah.

743
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,940
 So he was a writer for SNL.

744
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,660
 I think he was possibly the youngest writer that they ever had.

745
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,740
 And he's a brilliant short fiction writer.

746
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,260
 He writes a lot for the New Yorker in America.

747
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
 Yes, very funny.

748
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
 Very good.

749
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:01,900
 And the custodian of this fact is also writer Galen, presumably the ancient Greek physician.

750
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
 That's what it seems like.

751
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
 I don't know.

752
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,940
 And it is that we've been told that this person is called Galen, whether that's a non-duplume

753
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,300
 or whether that's your actual name I don't know.

754
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:17,500
 But it doesn't matter because your fact forever in your possession now is that Coco, the

755
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:23,660
 guerrilla who knows sign language, has owned and cared for three cats over her life.

756
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,420
 Did she look after them well?

757
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
 I think she did.

758
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
 Did she eat the cats?

759
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,420
 Did she eat the cats?

760
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,420
 Is all I'm trying to say.

761
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,420
 I'm not sure.

762
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,420
 No, I don't know.

763
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,420
 I think she looked after them.

764
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,300
 If Coco, if you were looking after Coco and you gave her a cat as she ate it, you might

765
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
 not give her another one.

766
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,780
 No, you think she's full up?

767
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,780
 That's fine.

768
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,540
 This is the perfect time to give her a cat, which is just finished.

769
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,540
 Even if she's sign language is saying please can I have another cat?

770
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,660
 I probably was sign language now.

771
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,100
 You know what Pester Power is like.

772
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,940
 I mean, people, you know, and once you've got one cat, you often get another one, don't

773
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,940
 you?

774
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,940
 Yes, very morish.

775
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,940
 Yeah.

776
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,740
 Well, congratulations, Galen.

777
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,900
 This one goes out to Irene Villatorra.

778
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,380
 Irene, congratulations because your fact forever is now.

779
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,140
 See if you can guess who said this one Irene.

780
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
 Here it is.

781
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,620
 It's easier to escape a female Yeti than a male Yeti because females have such long dangling

782
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,620
 boobs.

783
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,980
 They have to throw them over their shoulder before chasing in case they trip.

784
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:25,020
 You know what, Dan, I don't remember in the early days you having such wacky facts literally

785
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,020
 every week.

786
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,020
 Yeah.

787
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
 I thought that you mostly had straight one.

788
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:34,740
 I think we were enjoying the playground of these in the early days.

789
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
 Yeah.

790
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
 No, listening.

791
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,740
 It didn't matter.

792
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,740
 Yeah.

793
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,580
 And then the feedback started coming in and we moved on.

794
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,540
 No, this is, this is almost a sort of classic fact of the show in that it's been brought

795
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,420
 up in live shows and kind of occasionally makes a return.

796
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:53,140
 I made an interesting discovery recently, a sort of update on this, which is that it

797
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:58,820
 is, and I should say this is, this is, this is a fact with air quotes going around it.

798
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,900
 It is believed by, it is a fact within the world of people who believe in Yeti.

799
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,900
 Yes.

800
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,620
 It's an interesting thing for them.

801
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,620
 That's a reality.

802
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,420
 It's a fact in their world.

803
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,740
 So this is when you were being chased downhill.

804
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,300
 It's easier to escape a female Yeti.

805
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,580
 What I discovered recently is that according to these same experts, it's easier to escape

806
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,860
 a male Yeti when they're running uphill because they have such long dangling testicles

807
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,100
 that they will bang on the rocks as they're running up and fall over and talk of your

808
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,740
 - I'm like Dave, Dave, Dave, the Dyson dog. - It's a Sack Dog.

809
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,580
 - Do you still have a make it to a show?

810
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,900
 - Oh, it did. - I did, yeah, yeah.

811
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,460
 - Yes, I like Dave, the sausage dog,

812
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,180
 who was the dog of the producer of the new Lily Allen album.

813
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,420
 - Oh, wow, bringing it back to Lily. - Yeah.

814
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,780
 - She probably could have afforded a different producer

815
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,300
 as she'd have got all that bit of money.

816
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,100
 She could have bought that dog a golden posing pouch.

817
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,700
 (laughing)

818
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,740
 - Okay, how are we gonna do a couple more of these?

819
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,460
 - I think let's do only a couple, though.

820
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,940
 - Okay, so this one, if I wasn't sure whether Gaelin

821
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,620
 was the real name of the last person,

822
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,500
 I suspect even more that this might be a non-duplume.

823
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,380
 But the next fact goes to someone called Smoky Big Spliff.

824
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,540
 - Oh, fantastic. - Smoky.

825
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,740
 Your fact is that the Karma Sutra suggests 64 arts

826
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,540
 to practice alongside sex, including solving word puzzles,

827
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,140
 teaching birds how to talk, tattooing, making beds,

828
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,260
 and playing musical glasses filled with water.

829
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,700
 - That's very nice. - That's so good.

830
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,620
 - Some of those might be nice if you've also just

831
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,820
 Smoky the Big Spliff.

832
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,540
 - I presume? (laughing)

833
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,580
 - I don't know about word puzzles.

834
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,580
 That feels like slightly high effort for that.

835
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,740
 But playing musical glasses filled with water,

836
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,020
 you could probably spend hours doing that.

837
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,220
 - I feel like I've never been to one of those parties,

838
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,740
 but I imagine that's what they're doing.

839
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,740
 (laughing)

840
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,780
 - I love that fact.

841
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,740
 - That's a great fact.

842
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,260
 The Karma Sutra, that was one of your streams.

843
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,100
 - Yeah.

844
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,580
 - Were you working your way through it the time, weren't you?

845
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,140
 - It was, yeah, I'm still up to the third one.

846
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,700
 (laughing)

847
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,820
 - Skip one and two.

848
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
 (laughing)

849
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,460
 - Your pitch and physical for me.

850
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,700
 (laughing)

851
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,740
 - Oh, that's very nice.

852
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,580
 Do you have one last one?

853
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,420
 - Yeah.

854
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,900
 - Is this one, it goes out to Courtney V.

855
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,020
 Congratulations, Courtney, your fact is now that,

856
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,300
 at any given moment, there are more than 15 trillion

857
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,180
 tons of water above the earth.

858
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,020
 - Fantastic.

859
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,860
 - Clowns. - Clowns.

860
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,700
 - Clowns. - Clowns.

861
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,540
 - Clowns. - Clowns.

862
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
 - Clowns. - Clowns.

863
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,700
 - Clowns exist. - Clowns exist.

864
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,900
 (laughing)

865
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,700
 - It's more about the fact that someone added up

866
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,660
 all the clouds, isn't it?

867
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,900
 Like, that's pretty cool.

868
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,020
 - It doesn't fully make sense to me.

869
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,860
 (laughing)

870
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,180
 - I think there are different ways of counting.

871
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,180
 - Yeah. - Like, it's,

872
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,700
 I think you can extrapolate in these situations.

873
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,980
 - I think you'd have to in this case, yeah.

874
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,740
 - Because the thing is, they do move.

875
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,580
 - Yeah.

876
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,060
 - Oh yeah. - And they do empty.

877
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,060
 - Yeah, when they refill.

878
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,140
 - They've not got a list of, like,

879
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,540
 the one that looks like a giraffe.

880
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,380
 (laughing)

881
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,780
 - The one that looks like Mother Teresa.

882
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,780
 (laughing)

883
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,980
 - So, congratulations, Courtney.

884
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,860
 Congratulations to everyone who's just been awarded a fact.

885
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,540
 I'm saying, Courtney V, Smokey Big Spliff, Irene Villatora,

886
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,660
 Galen, Melanie Young, Matthew, Tom, and Dave.

887
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,420
 Congratulations to all of you.

888
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,580
 I hope you enjoy those facts.

889
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,420
