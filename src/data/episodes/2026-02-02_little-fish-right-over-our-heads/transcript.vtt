00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.460
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Little Fish.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.440
 This is our audience facto you have been sending in brilliant facts to podcast@QY.com

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.800
 and we are here to tell you the best ones.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.960
 And who are we Andy?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.880
 Oh yeah, I'm Andrew Hunter Murray and these are my friends.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.960
 Dan Schreiver and James Harkin.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.200
 Good to be here Andy.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.200
 James?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.200
 Oh yeah, I love it.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 Let's crack on.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.200
 Who's got a fact?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.200
 I've got one.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 Yep.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.600
 This is from Mary Kuhner.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.040
 I think maybe from Colorado because she said here's a fact from Colorado.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.600
 When Denver smells like manure, it's about to snow.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 Oh.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.280
 When Denver smells like, what a great riddle.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.480
 When Denver smells like manure, it's about to snow.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.840
 Does that feel like the old, if you can see the hills that I mean.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.280
 Is it about to rain?

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.880
 And if you can't see the hills, it is raining.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.280
 That's all we say in Bolton.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 Yeah.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.600
 Is it because the area is going very dry because it's getting so cold that the smell can travel

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 to your nostrils.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 Not quite.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 Not quite.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 What is the riddle?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 Good attempt.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.600
 Nice one professor.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.920
 There are no points for trying on this show.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.400
 I thought it was a very good effort, Dan, I don't mind saying so.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.960
 It's because Denver's in kind of a bowl and lots of cattle live there.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.680
 And you get this thing called the upslope effect where it pushes up against the mountains and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.840
 goes up to the top of the mountains.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.880
 And then when it gets to the top, it condenses and you get rain or snow.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.280
 So it is one of these things where actually people think it's, they say, oh, if it smells

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.600
 like manure, it's going to snow, but it actually is true.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.880
 So the air gets sort of pulled off the land, the cowey manure land.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880
 Yes.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 That's right.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 Then turn the snow.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 Precisely correct.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 It's like feces.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.880
 Don't eat brown snow.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 That's what they say in Denver.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.880
 Yeah, there you go.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.400
 Would you like one more fact about Denver?

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 Yeah.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.520
 Much of the tap water in Denver comes from a place called Gross Reservoir.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.000
 It might be, don't write in if you're from there because it might be that it's pronounced

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 gross.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 I'm not sure.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.360
 Because it's named after former chief engineer of Denver water, Dwight D-G-R-O-S.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.360
 Ah, right.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.360
 Nice.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.360
 Gross, gross.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.360
 Potato potato.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.360
 Want a great Denver nugget?

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.360
 Lovely.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.960
 And if you can spell those Denver nuggets, it's about to snow.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.320
 It's a name of their basketball team as well.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320
 The Denver nuggets.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.320
 Oh.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.320
 Is it?

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320
 It is.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.320
 Yeah.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.320
 Very good.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.320
 That was a good one.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320
 Yeah.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.320
 It went right over my head.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.320
 Is that a basketball joke?

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.320
 It went right over my head.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.320
 Well, that one also went over my head.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.320
 Three points.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.320
 I don't understand basketball either.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.320
 Let's do a fact.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.320
 Let's do a fact.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.440
 This one comes from Camille Jordan, sister of Michael Jordan, of course, from the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.440
 Chicago Bulls.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.720
 No, Camille Jordan is from Alton in Switzerland.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.920
 And this is a fantastic fact.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.760
 Technically, Camille says, the first flag on the moon was the Swiss flag.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.760
 Yeah.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.760
 Well.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.760
 So.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.840
 Well, I'm not sure that is true.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.840
 Well, let's let Camille show her workings.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.440
 Can I just say, I think we might have done this on QI where everyone thinks it's the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.360
 American flag, but the Russians sent a probe up, it crashed, and there was a Soviet flag

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.360
 on there.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.000
 So we always thought it was Soviet, but what's the Swiss thing?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.200
 You've absolutely kiboshed her reasoning here.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 If that's the case.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.320
 But so let's say when the Americans landed on the moon, before they put up the American

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.400
 flag, they sort of accidentally put up another flag.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400
 No.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.240
 Physicists from the University of Bern designed an experiment to be performed during the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.720
 first moon expedition, a solar sail to capture solar wind particles.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.560
 For the best result, the sail needed to stay up as long as possible, which is why it was

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.080
 set up even before the US flag.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.320
 The equipment had a little Swiss cross on it, which depending on your definition of a flag

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.240
 makes the Swiss flag the first flag to be placed on the surface of the moon.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.240
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.360
 Camille says that there's a short documentary that everyone can watch on YouTube called

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.160
 Burn on the Moon, which shows this story and shows how it is.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.040
 So if anyone's interested to look into that more, you can check that out there.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.920
 Interestingly, there was another flag that was taken to the moon, not just the American,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.720
 not just the Swiss flag, or the Soviets, or the Soviets.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.040
 And this was taken up by Buzz Aldrin, which was the Freemason flag.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.040
 Oh, God.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.160
 Well, he was part of a Freemason's Lodge, and the idea was that they wanted to open their

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.800
 own lodge on the moon.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.800
 No.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.440
 Well, this is according to Bedfisher Freemason's website.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.440
 Temperature.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440
 Yeah.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.440
 They would know.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.040
 And probably they won't tell it to any of the other Freemason's, but just the Bedfisher

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.280
 branch, they're the ones who really know what's going on.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.000
 Here's what they say on their website.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.200
 They say, so two American astronauts landed on the moon in the Sea Tranquility.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.120
 One of these brave men's was brother Edwin, brother Edwin Eugene Aldrin, Jr.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.040
 A member of the Clear Lake Lodge number one, four, one, seven in Texas.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.200
 Brother Buzz was authorized by the grandmaster of Texas to claim Masonic territorial jurisdiction

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.040
 for a grand lodge of Texas on the moon.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.360
 No, I've just, sorry, I'm just thinking back because you know the footage of them getting

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.360
 off.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.360
 Buzz has his trousers rolled up, doesn't it?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.360
 He does, he does.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.560
 And he's got that big wizard wand as well.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.760
 It's not a wand to them.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.560
 It's just a piece of word that you do spells with.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.560
 Yeah.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.440
 So it got permission, and the idea was because it was a lot of belief from the Mason.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440
 From the Mason's.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.440
 Not from NASA.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440
 No.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.440
 Well, because he also, he snuck on Nick.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.440
 He snuck on, yes.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.440
 He's doing lots of stuff, wasn't he?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.440
 Yeah, he did lots of...

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.440
 It's amazing.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.440
 We had time to do any science on the moon.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.160
 It seems to be mostly like a tourist thing for Buzz.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.160
 Yeah, wow.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.680
 The thought was because apparently people were projecting that by the year 2000 there would

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.840
 be permanent lunar bases on the moon that would allow you to get there as quickly from

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.480
 Earth to the moon as you would fly plane from San Francisco to Boston.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.280
 And it would be a stopping point between your trip to Mars or the rings of Saturn.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.400
 Therefore, it made sense for them to open a special lodge for them to have ready for

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 them for that time.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.400
 Right.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.400
 Yeah.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.400
 So there we go.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.400
 Good.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.640
 And this is a fact from Alex Wilson.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.840
 And it's about regret.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.840
 Okay.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.840
 There you go.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.680
 In 2009, Lily Allen was asked to do a gig.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.440
 She was asked to do a gig online, right?

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.440
 But not as herself.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.600
 She was asked to do a sort of streaming gig.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.840
 Do you remember the video game's second life?

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.840
 Yes.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.000
 People had avatars and they had jobs inside second life.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.280
 There was a whole second life economy like it was a...

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.840
 It was a really big thing for a long time.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.200
 Comedians like Jimmy Carr were doing live gigs.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.200
 He'll play anywhere.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.680
 So Lily Allen was asked to do a gig in second life, right?

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.120
 And she was offered a fee not in pounds, right?

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.720
 But in a new sort of like fake currency that was sort of doing rounds a bit.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720
 It was in Bitcoin.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.720
 She was offered.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.680
 She was offered hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.680
 Ooh.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.680
 Which might...

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.400
 I think I found a source that said it was equivalent to like $600.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.800
 Interestingly, she did regrett it.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.800
 She thought it was a dogecoin.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800
 Yeah.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800
 Thought it was a dogecoin?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.800
 No.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.080
 It's like that's one of her big songs, that's her album.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.080
 Really?

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.080
 Yeah.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080
 That's a really good joke that went super good joke.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.080
 Right over our heads.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.240
 That's going to be the name of this episode, isn't it?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240
 I think so.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.640
 Lovely when you hear it form in real time.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.640
 No, it didn't know that.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.640
 That's a really good joke.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.640
 Yeah.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.640
 She finds a...

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.640
 It's Pussy Palace and she thought it was a dogecoin.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.640
 Oh, yes.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.640
 Yes, on her new album.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.640
 Yeah.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.640
 Got it.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.640
 Yeah.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.640
 Well.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.200
 She was offered.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.920
 So she says hundreds of thousands of bitcoin, right?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920
 Yeah.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:46.360
 If it was literally 200,000 bitcoin, which she turned down, that would be worth about 13 billion

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.360
 pounds today.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.360
 Okay.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.040
 I have found a source which said it was $600 and with the value of bitcoin as it was then,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:59.840
 that would have been about 860,000 bitcoin, which at today's value would be $56,000,000,

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.640
 50 times the net worth of the king.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.640
 Okay.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.240
 How about the 20th richest person on the planet?

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.240
 Yeah.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.240
 Wow.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.240
 Oh, she said no to the gig.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.240
 And instead they brought this blues artist called Elon Musk.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.240
 He came in.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.240
 Okay.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.240
 All right.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.800
 When started, it's a new act night.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800
 Come on, Elon.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.040
 Can you imagine that?

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.040
 I think you can't.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.440
 I think you have to not imagine that.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440
 She's doing all right.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.440
 She's doing great.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440
 She's doing great.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.440
 But she's not...

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.800
 Well, I mean, she's not doing great as the new album of a test, but she's doing it far.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.600
 I'm sure she's in a better place now.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 Oh, definitely.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.600
 Definitely.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.600
 Well, she's the Lord Byron of the 21st century.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600
 Yeah.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600
 You're right.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600
 But would it have made her happy?

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600
 No.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600
 No.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.600
 Well, maybe.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.600
 It makes you happy.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.600
 Up to a certain point.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600
 Then it doesn't make you happy.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.840
 But I think above a certain point, surely it's going to make you happy a bit.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.840
 Yeah.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840
 Well, I don't know.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.840
 Do you remember we had Malcolm Gladwell on No Such Thing as a Fish?

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.440
 You should check out that episode if you haven't heard it because it's a great guest

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.440
 appearance.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.240
 Well, asked us a question, which would you take if you were offered?

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.240
 Yeah.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.240
 Either what was it?

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.240
 10 million.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.240
 100,000 pounds.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.240
 A million.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.240
 10 million.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.240
 100 million.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240
 Yeah.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.240
 Or a thousand million.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.240
 Yeah.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.240
 A billion.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240
 And he said most people picked 10 million.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240
 I think so.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.240
 I imagine a number.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.240
 And Dan Swall blind.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240
 He would take the billion.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.240
 I just said a billion for the sake of playing the game and he went nuts on me.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.240
 Tell you a new one.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.240
 Yeah, in a very funny way.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.240
 It was great.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.240
 But he just...

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.240
 The unhappiness that would bring to your life to take a billion.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.240
 Yeah.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.240
 Versus a million.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.240
 So what did you do with it at the end?

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.240
 Put it all in Bitcoin.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240
 Incredibly the day before.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.240
 Anyway, you have to still keep making the show forever now.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.240
 Okay.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:47.520
 Here is a fact from Peter Marsh and Peter says this is very good.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:54.480
 At any one time there must be a Polish person who is northernmost on planet Earth.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.840
 And so they would be the North Pole.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.840
 Yep.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.840
 Okay.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.840
 Not a fact so far.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.520
 But he says, but Peter says that it's usually very difficult to tell who it might be.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:14.680
 But on 23rd of May 1995, we can be sure it was either Marek Kaminsky or Wojciech Moskal because

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.520
 they were the first poles to reach the geographic North Pole on that day.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.280
 So they were the two North Poles at the North Pole.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.280
 That's lovely.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.280
 That's wonderful.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.280
 That's lovely.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.840
 And I thought I'd have a look at the South Pole and it turns out there is an Arktowski Polish

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.560
 Antarctic Station, which is in the Antarctic in the South Pole.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.040
 And basically Polish people live there and do science there.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.920
 And so there's always like a little community of South Poles.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.920
 North Poles.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.920
 That's very good.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.920
 That does.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.920
 We can't do it now because we're putting it out.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.400
 But that is a great quiz question.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.720
 In 1995, for one day, there were three North Poles.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.720
 Yeah.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:59.080
 So on their five already, there's geographic and then there's magnetic and then there's

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.080
 OK.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.120
 Well, it's a complicated question, sure, for the quiz.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.960
 But which quiz are you pitching it to?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.960
 Maybe one of our quizzes that we do for Patreon?

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.960
 Yeah.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.960
 Yeah, we could do it the next one.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.280
 We're doing them quarterly and we're about to do our first one tonight as we're recording

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.280
 this episode.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.440
 So yeah, let's bring it to the next one.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.440
 Right.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.440
 Dan's pole quiz.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.440
 Yep.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.440
 Oh, no.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.360
 Shall I bring another fact here?

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:31.140
 This is from Andrew Perez, who writes, "Jone of Arc once prayed at a chapel in Milwaukee,

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.140
 Wisconsin."

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.140
 No.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.140
 Yes.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.140
 Not true.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.140
 True.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.140
 Is that the dairy stage?

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.140
 Wisconsin is, yeah.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.140
 Yeah.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.140
 Yeah.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.140
 Just showing my knowledge.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.140
 Great.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.140
 Carry on.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.140
 What do you know she did?

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.140
 She lived as far as I understood it.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.140
 She lived and died in France.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.140
 Yeah.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.140
 And the new world hadn't been discovered at that stage.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.140
 Yeah.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.140
 Both correct.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.580
 But she was magic or there was another person called Joan of Arc.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.580
 Oh, that's it.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:02.260
 It played a quarter back for the Green Bay Packers.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.260
 That's it.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.260
 No, it's not.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:10.940
 No, what this is is there is a church that was built in 1420 and it's in a town that is

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:16.220
 southeast of Leon and it was where Joan of Arc prayed.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.220
 Yeah.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.900
 Now, there was a very rich American called Gertrude Hill Gavin who was daughter of an

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.740
 American railroad magnate and she was obsessed with Joan of Arc.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:31.340
 She learnt that this chapel was a for sale.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.620
 So she acquired it.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.900
 She had it dismantled and she had it shipped over to her property in Long Island.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.500
 And from there, it's been an America ever since.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.020
 But maybe it's moved from Long Island to Wisconsin.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.020
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.020
 That's another journey.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.020
 Yeah.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:53.020
 Interesting is this particular church was so beloved by one person in particular who was

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:59.020
 an architect that he basically mapped out every single brick and just said if this was

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.100
 ever dismantled, this is how it would come back together.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.700
 So the blueprint for how to put it back together was already written for her by the

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.700
 successor.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.100
 So did he like label each brick and say this one has to go here.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.100
 This one has to go here.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.100
 Basically.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.100
 Yeah.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.100
 Yeah.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.420
 So she even renamed the chapel so that had Joan's name in the chapel.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:22.380
 And in 1933 Pope Pius XI gave her written permission to have mass in that building.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:27.140
 So it's officially sanctioned by the Vatican as well.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.140
 I think we did a fact.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:33.060
 Ages ago about Rosa Parks had a house that was going to be dismantled and just completely

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.540
 destroyed in America and people wanted to save it.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.540
 So someone bought it and shipped it over to Berlin in Germany where it was for years.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.980
 So you could go and visit Rosa Parks's house, which was not one of her main houses, but

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.060
 somewhere she spent a lot of time.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.020
 I think her brother lived in it and owned it.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.020
 She sent it.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.860
 She rented it out as an Airbnb for the summer.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.860
 Yeah.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.260
 You make it sound like she was more of a property lady than anything else Rosa Parks.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.300
 But then why she was getting the bus to and from, of course, it was just to check on the

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.660
 property portfolio.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.940
 But she, so it was been in Berlin for ages and then America requested that it be sent

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.180
 back for an exhibition.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.300
 So it went back to America, was shown there and then brought back over to Europe.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.340
 It's very dicey all this moving stuff around, I'm not sure why I feel about it.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.340
 Yeah.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.660
 It's like they're about to move the bio tapestry over here.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.660
 How they?

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.660
 Yeah, we're going to get it back.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.660
 That's good.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.660
 Briefly.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.820
 I feel like tapestries are easier to move around than houses.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.820
 You would think so.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.540
 They are having the devil of a time.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.540
 They are.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.540
 Obviously it's so old.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.140
 And they're terribly worried that any movement of more than two millimeters and it'll just

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.140
 fall apart.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.780
 And it'll be incredibly embarrassing if they open it up at the other end and it's been

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:36.940
 damaged in transit.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.220
 So they're making a dummy 900-year-old tapestry rolling it up and doing the journey

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:47.260
 with that in this ultra buffered thing because of pot holes and things, right, and vibrations

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.260
 in the road.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.180
 Oh, it's going to be, it's going to be a nightmare.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.180
 I wouldn't mind.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.020
 It would be easier just to move everyone who wants to see it to France.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.020
 100%.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.020
 Absolutely.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.540
 I can move up and down two millimeters.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.540
 I'm fine.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.540
 Have you ever seen it?

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.540
 Yeah.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.540
 Me neither.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.540
 No, I haven't actually.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.540
 Oh.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.540
 Oh, Dan's wondering.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.540
 Was it shown in the British library a while ago?

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.540
 It was not.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.460
 It's been in bio for 800 years.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.700
 I think I'm going to say no, then.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:20.820
 I would say no on account of the fact I'm not 100% certain where the hell is.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.500
 Um, here's another fact.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.500
 Yeah.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500
 From Morton Fading.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500
 What's the great name?

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.500
 Yeah.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.500
 I suspect it might be Norwegian.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.500
 Morton.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.980
 Like Morton Huckett from Arha.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.980
 Is Morton Huckett Norwegian?

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.980
 Yes.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:35.980
 There we go.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:42.660
 But Morton writes, the most famous traitor in Norwegian history was named famous traitor.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.660
 Was that not?

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.660
 Is it quizzling?

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:50.900
 So it's a guy called Vidcon Quizzling who was the head of the puppet government in Norway

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.260
 in the second world war after the Nazis invaded.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:59.060
 And basically, for a very long time, I didn't know what the puppet government meant.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:04.180
 And I took it to mean the other version of what that is.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.180
 What's that?

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.740
 Why don't you take over Greenland?

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.740
 Oh, wow.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.740
 That's really funny.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.740
 Yeah.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.740
 Well, he was the head of that.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.100
 Um, and he was a, you know, big ol' collaborator.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.700
 Anyway, quizzling has become a byword for being a traitor.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.700
 In English.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:28.220
 English and in Norwegian and basically Vidcon, which is his first name, is a Norse name,

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.700
 which means widely known.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.700
 Oh.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.220
 So Vidcon quizzling literally means famous traitor.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.220
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.220
 He's a famous traitor.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.220
 That's good.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.220
 He's a, yeah.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.740
 He was the first Norwegian executed by the state in 75 years.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.740
 I'll see.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.300
 They didn't do it, but they did bring that out of retirement for him.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.300
 Yes.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.300
 Yeah.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.300
 After the war.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.300
 So bad news.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.300
 We're going to execute you.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.300
 Good news.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.300
 You're going to be a very interesting fact.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.300
 Yeah.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.300
 Yeah.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.300
 He tried.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.300
 Also, I did a bit more reading up on him.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.300
 He tried to do the world's first ever radio coup d'état.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.300
 Interesting.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.300
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.660
 So you go in and you just do a radio broadcast saying, we control everything now.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:04.980
 Well, quite often you would see a coup d'état in, let's say, in Africa or something.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:05.980
 Yeah.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.980
 And the first thing you really see is the army either side of the former president saying,

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.300
 we're in charge now.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.300
 Completely.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.980
 So you can kind of see where they're coming from.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:15.980
 Broadcast is absolutely essential.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.580
 You've got to see the means of communication.

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.580
 Yeah.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:22.580
 The supposed problem with radio is people can't see whether or not you're holding their

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.540
 president at gunpoint at that stage.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.540
 Yes.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.540
 Yes.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.140
 You have to do very good folly to make them believe what's happening.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.140
 Yeah.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.140
 We're in charge.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.140
 Yeah.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.820
 You can do that these days, of course, because there are too many podcasts.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.060
 It's very hard to seize all the podcasts at the same time.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.060
 Interesting.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.780
 You could buy an inserted ad.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:50.100
 And if you use the offer code fish, you can also take over nearby islands.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.060
 Here's one from Kate Boyle.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.500
 Kate says, "Botulism cures anal fishes."

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.500
 Oh, gosh.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.500
 Okay.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.260
 Portulism is bad.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.540
 In large doses, it's very bad.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.340
 Even in quite small doses, it's very bad.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.340
 It's the most poisonous thing, basic.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.860
 Is it related to Botox?

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.420
 It's so related that they're exactly the same thing.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.420
 I understand.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.180
 But you put my new amounts of botulism into your wrinkles.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.180
 Right.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.180
 And it paralyzes your skin and it removes the wrinkles.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.180
 Yeah.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.620
 But yeah, botulism is the most poisonous thing you can get.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:31.420
 And because it stops muscle from spasming, it's used to help anal fishes as well as migraines,

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.420
 excessive sweating, overactive bladders, and cerebral palsy.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.420
 Gosh.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.420
 Okay.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.420
 That's pretty good.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.420
 Useful stuff.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:45.940
 2023 study that I had in my files looked at the brain scans of people who had Botox and

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:51.900
 said that they have different brain activity than the rest of us when they look at happy

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.740
 and angry faces.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.820
 And that's because when you see someone happy, you kind of mimic their face and it makes

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.500
 you feel more happy, but they can't mimic their faces because they don't have so much Botox

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.500
 in their heads.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.500
 That's so funny.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.500
 So it makes you less happy.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.500
 Or it makes you less sad.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.500
 It makes you less sad.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.500
 Yeah.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.780
 Do poker players secretly get Botox?

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.780
 I would be surprised if they didn't.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:12.780
 Yeah.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.700
 Because you're always looking for the tiniest little help in poker.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.700
 Yeah.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.260
 Can you Botox away your tail, if it's say like a little twitch in your eye?

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.260
 Absolutely.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.180
 How much of you are allowed to… because they were shades, don't they?

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.180
 Or sometimes.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.180
 Many of them do.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.180
 Yeah.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.180
 Do you like to work like a mask?

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.180
 I do.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.180
 Do you like to sit in a bin?

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.700
 Like a little eyehole cut out.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.700
 You can play online.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.700
 Good.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.700
 That's pretty good.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.700
 Yes.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:37.700
 You see my home set up.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.700
 I see.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.700
 Oh.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.700
 Yeah.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.700
 That's wonderful.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.700
 Yeah.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.700
 Okay.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.700
 I go on here.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.700
 It's from Mark Vent, who I know.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.700
 I know Mark Vent.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.700
 He is.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.700
 Yeah.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:55.380
 He has written in saying in Oxford, there's a building where the weather forecast could

00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:01.980
 honestly read between -269 degrees and +150 million degrees.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:07.740
 This is Columns Fusion Reactor, which produces plasma hotter than the sun.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:13.260
 And it's right next to a machine that is colder than deep space.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.260
 So yeah.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.220
 Why is that useful for them to be next to each other?

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.220
 No.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.900
 Well, you're building that's dealing in - Could be.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.500
 Oh, do you mean, do they need to be just to add a heat out of one space, and that probably

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.380
 helps you get up towards 150 million degrees in the other space?

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.380
 It could very well be.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.380
 It's possible it could work that way.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.580
 It's like how it's hot sometimes next to the fridge.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.580
 Behind your fridge.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.580
 Behind your fridge.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.580
 Exactly.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.580
 So that's probably what this is.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.580
 That's what this is.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.740
 They probably didn't even mean to create the fusion reactor, because it was so bloody

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.740
 warm next to this.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.740
 But we should use this.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.300
 This is just an unusable fridge, which went too far in its coldness of heat.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.100
 Is there a position between those two places where it's just right?

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.100
 Oh.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:53.380
 There must be a bit where you stand there and it's perfect, but you've got to keep rotating.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.380
 Yes.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.380
 Like a rotisserie ticket.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.380
 Yeah.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.380
 Yeah.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.380
 Yeah.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.380
 Anyway, very cool.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.380
 Very cool.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.380
 Very cool.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.380
 Add very hot.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.380
 Lovely.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.380
 All right.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.500
 Those are your facts.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.140
 But now let's have some of our facts, because what we're going to do now is everyone who

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.380
 has joined Club Fish, our members club, at the friend of the podcast here, gets one

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:21.300
 of our headline facts given to them in perpetuity to love and care for with a certificate.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.140
 It's great fun.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.020
 If you want to check it out, go to patreon.com/no such thing as a fish.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.060
 You can see all the stuff we've got there, ad free episodes, lots of bonus content, and

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.540
 friends of the podcast certificates.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.820
 So let's dish out some facts now.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.820
 Who wants to go first?

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.820
 I can do that.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.820
 Yeah.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.700
 This is a fact that now belongs to Dave Chronister.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:44.180
 Dave, this is a fact from episode 25, rats wearing polyester pants can't get a

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.180
 direction.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.180
 Very nice.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.180
 Not if you're a rat.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.180
 Yeah, bad.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.180
 Bad.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.180
 Is it polyester?

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.180
 Is it the polyester?

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.700
 Is it the, like, as opposed to linen?

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.700
 I think this was, yeah.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.740
 Obviously, right in linen, little linen trousers will be very sexy.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.740
 It's silk.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.740
 Oh.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.740
 Oh.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.140
 I think this was research that we got from Mary Roach.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.180
 I think she wrote in a book of hers.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.180
 She might want to.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.180
 Was it fun?

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.180
 I think it was bonk, and I think she went and she visited.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.180
 Yeah.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.180
 It's a wonderful book.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.180
 I mean, she's one of our favourite writers.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.180
 That's the rat Taylor, didn't she?

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.180
 Yeah.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.180
 Yeah.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.180
 That's a great fact.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.180
 Okay.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.180
 Here's another one.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:24.820
 This is now under the custodianship of Tom Watson and Tom, this is your fact during the

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:32.580
 First World War, entertainment for the troops included pillow fights, wheelbarrow races

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.620
 and wrestling on the backs of mules.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.300
 It does feel like it sounds fun.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.300
 It does.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.300
 Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.300
 You were the one who said this the first time, wasn't it?

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.300
 Yeah.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:48.060
 Well, I can remember every word of the fact itself, because we've got a list of them in

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.060
 front of us.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.060
 I don't remember the pillow fights.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.820
 I have just finished today reading Journey's End, which is an absolutely classic play set in

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.420
 the First World War by someone who'd been through the First World War.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.100
 And there is not a pillow fight to be seen.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.100
 I'll tell you that.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.100
 He very much edited that out.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.100
 Right.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.100
 His mise en scène.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.100
 I'll dish one out.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.100
 Yeah.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.220
 This one goes to Matthew Acorn.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:11.020
 It's that the atmosphere in Venus is so hot that if you took a pizza out of the

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.820
 freezer there, it would cook in three seconds.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.700
 You could do that in Oxford in the building.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.620
 Take it out of the special minus 269 degree freezer.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.620
 Yeah.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.380
 Frisbee it across.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.820
 By the time it lands perfect.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.820
 Perfect.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.820
 Lovely.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.820
 Yeah, that was my fight.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:33.380
 I don't remember much about it, apart from I don't think I worked it out myself.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.020
 I think it was something I read elsewhere.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:39.700
 Oh, that was before you went on your 10-year binge of creation effects.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.540
 But I think the idea was it would cook it, but it would be very crispy on the outside,

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.460
 and perhaps not exactly frozen on the inside.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.460
 Yeah.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.460
 But like if I do a barbecue for it's...

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.180
 You really want to give it five seconds, don't you?

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.020
 That's of another one.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.020
 Okay.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.020
 Here's another fact.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.060
 And this is going to Melanie Young.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:04.340
 Melanie, this was one of my facts from episode 25 in Iceland.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.820
 There is a phone app which tells you whether you're related to the person you're hitting

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.820
 on.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.940
 It's an interesting one because there have been debunks of that.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.940
 Yeah.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.380
 But I think that it did exist.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.620
 But I don't think it was like something you could buy in the app store or anything like

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.620
 that.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:20.620
 Oh.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.500
 Basically, Iceland got all of this data and made it available online so that anyone could

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.900
 use it.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.140
 And some people as a project came up with this idea.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.540
 And they did actually make the app, but it wasn't commercially available.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:32.540
 Oh, well, there we go.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.820
 Well, it had a motto that went along with it, which was bump phones before you're bumping

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:41.260
 in bed and quite a nice idea because it is a small-ish population over there.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.260
 Yeah.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.740
 You probably know if some of your cousins, though.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.740
 Would you?

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.740
 Of course.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.540
 You guys didn't know your cousins?

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.700
 It's worried not your cousins.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.380
 You guys don't know that your cousins?

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.380
 Oh, God.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.780
 And I saw you kissing.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.780
 Oh, no.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.780
 Oh, no.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.780
 No, no.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:56.780
 No, I know what you mean.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.700
 I was like, you'll know your immediate family and anyone who's more than a few cousins

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.620
 away, I think, is a fake agent.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.620
 Oh, wow.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.620
 Okay.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.260
 But it's in plot twist.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.540
 Isn't people used to marry their first cousins all the time?

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.540
 Yeah.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.540
 And sometimes people still do.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.980
 And it's like, it's, you know, it's nobody's business.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.980
 Yeah.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.940
 But I think there are more people who are second or third cousins that they don't necessarily

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:22.820
 know about in Iceland than they might be in another country because of the small population.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.540
 And because no one really goes in and out very much.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.540
 I don't know.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.580
 The problem is they're going in and out, isn't it?

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.820
 But yeah, like the people who have lived there for many generations.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.820
 Right.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:35.820
 Okay.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.820
 Okay.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.820
 Okay.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.820
 Here is a fact.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.940
 And this was a fact given to us by Simon Rich, the author.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.940
 Simon Rich?

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.940
 Yeah.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.940
 So he was a writer for SNL.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.660
 I think he was possibly the youngest writer that they ever had.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.740
 And he's a brilliant short fiction writer.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.260
 He writes a lot for the New Yorker in America.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.260
 Yes, very funny.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.260
 Very good.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:01.900
 And the custodian of this fact is also writer Galen, presumably the ancient Greek physician.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:02.900
 That's what it seems like.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:03.900
 I don't know.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.940
 And it is that we've been told that this person is called Galen, whether that's a non-duplume

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.300
 or whether that's your actual name I don't know.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:17.500
 But it doesn't matter because your fact forever in your possession now is that Coco, the

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:23.660
 guerrilla who knows sign language, has owned and cared for three cats over her life.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.420
 Did she look after them well?

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.420
 I think she did.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.420
 Did she eat the cats?

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.420
 Did she eat the cats?

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.420
 Is all I'm trying to say.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.420
 I'm not sure.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.420
 No, I don't know.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.420
 I think she looked after them.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.300
 If Coco, if you were looking after Coco and you gave her a cat as she ate it, you might

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.300
 not give her another one.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.780
 No, you think she's full up?

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.780
 That's fine.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.540
 This is the perfect time to give her a cat, which is just finished.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.540
 Even if she's sign language is saying please can I have another cat?

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.660
 I probably was sign language now.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.100
 You know what Pester Power is like.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.940
 I mean, people, you know, and once you've got one cat, you often get another one, don't

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.940
 you?

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:54.940
 Yes, very morish.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:55.940
 Yeah.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.740
 Well, congratulations, Galen.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.900
 This one goes out to Irene Villatorra.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:05.380
 Irene, congratulations because your fact forever is now.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.140
 See if you can guess who said this one Irene.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.140
 Here it is.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:14.620
 It's easier to escape a female Yeti than a male Yeti because females have such long dangling

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.620
 boobs.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.980
 They have to throw them over their shoulder before chasing in case they trip.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:25.020
 You know what, Dan, I don't remember in the early days you having such wacky facts literally

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.020
 every week.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.020
 Yeah.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.020
 I thought that you mostly had straight one.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:34.740
 I think we were enjoying the playground of these in the early days.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.740
 Yeah.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.740
 No, listening.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.740
 It didn't matter.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.740
 Yeah.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.580
 And then the feedback started coming in and we moved on.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:45.540
 No, this is, this is almost a sort of classic fact of the show in that it's been brought

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.420
 up in live shows and kind of occasionally makes a return.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:53.140
 I made an interesting discovery recently, a sort of update on this, which is that it

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:58.820
 is, and I should say this is, this is, this is a fact with air quotes going around it.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:03.900
 It is believed by, it is a fact within the world of people who believe in Yeti.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:04.900
 Yes.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.620
 It's an interesting thing for them.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.620
 That's a reality.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.420
 It's a fact in their world.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.740
 So this is when you were being chased downhill.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.300
 It's easier to escape a female Yeti.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:17.580
 What I discovered recently is that according to these same experts, it's easier to escape

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.860
 a male Yeti when they're running uphill because they have such long dangling testicles

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.100
 that they will bang on the rocks as they're running up and fall over and talk of your

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.740
 - I'm like Dave, Dave, Dave, the Dyson dog. - It's a Sack Dog.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.580
 - Do you still have a make it to a show?

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.900
 - Oh, it did. - I did, yeah, yeah.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.460
 - Yes, I like Dave, the sausage dog,

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:41.180
 who was the dog of the producer of the new Lily Allen album.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.420
 - Oh, wow, bringing it back to Lily. - Yeah.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.780
 - She probably could have afforded a different producer

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.300
 as she'd have got all that bit of money.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.100
 She could have bought that dog a golden posing pouch.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.700
 (laughing)

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.740
 - Okay, how are we gonna do a couple more of these?

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.460
 - I think let's do only a couple, though.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.940
 - Okay, so this one, if I wasn't sure whether Gaelin

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.620
 was the real name of the last person,

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.500
 I suspect even more that this might be a non-duplume.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:10.380
 But the next fact goes to someone called Smoky Big Spliff.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.540
 - Oh, fantastic. - Smoky.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.740
 Your fact is that the Karma Sutra suggests 64 arts

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.540
 to practice alongside sex, including solving word puzzles,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.140
 teaching birds how to talk, tattooing, making beds,

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.260
 and playing musical glasses filled with water.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.700
 - That's very nice. - That's so good.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.620
 - Some of those might be nice if you've also just

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.820
 Smoky the Big Spliff.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.540
 - I presume? (laughing)

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.580
 - I don't know about word puzzles.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.580
 That feels like slightly high effort for that.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.740
 But playing musical glasses filled with water,

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.020
 you could probably spend hours doing that.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.220
 - I feel like I've never been to one of those parties,

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.740
 but I imagine that's what they're doing.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.740
 (laughing)

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.780
 - I love that fact.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.740
 - That's a great fact.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.260
 The Karma Sutra, that was one of your streams.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.100
 - Yeah.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.580
 - Were you working your way through it the time, weren't you?

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.140
 - It was, yeah, I'm still up to the third one.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.700
 (laughing)

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.820
 - Skip one and two.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.820
 (laughing)

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.460
 - Your pitch and physical for me.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.700
 (laughing)

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.740
 - Oh, that's very nice.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.580
 Do you have one last one?

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.420
 - Yeah.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.900
 - Is this one, it goes out to Courtney V.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.020
 Congratulations, Courtney, your fact is now that,

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.300
 at any given moment, there are more than 15 trillion

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.180
 tons of water above the earth.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.020
 - Fantastic.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:17.860
 - Clowns. - Clowns.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.700
 - Clowns. - Clowns.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.540
 - Clowns. - Clowns.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.540
 - Clowns. - Clowns.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.700
 - Clowns exist. - Clowns exist.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.900
 (laughing)

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.700
 - It's more about the fact that someone added up

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.660
 all the clouds, isn't it?

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.900
 Like, that's pretty cool.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.020
 - It doesn't fully make sense to me.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:29.860
 (laughing)

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.180
 - I think there are different ways of counting.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.180
 - Yeah. - Like, it's,

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.700
 I think you can extrapolate in these situations.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.980
 - I think you'd have to in this case, yeah.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.740
 - Because the thing is, they do move.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.580
 - Yeah.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.060
 - Oh yeah. - And they do empty.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.060
 - Yeah, when they refill.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.140
 - They've not got a list of, like,

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.540
 the one that looks like a giraffe.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.380
 (laughing)

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.780
 - The one that looks like Mother Teresa.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.780
 (laughing)

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.980
 - So, congratulations, Courtney.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.860
 Congratulations to everyone who's just been awarded a fact.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.540
 I'm saying, Courtney V, Smokey Big Spliff, Irene Villatora,

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.660
 Galen, Melanie Young, Matthew, Tom, and Dave.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.420
 Congratulations to all of you.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.580
 I hope you enjoy those facts.

 Bye for now.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.940
 (upbeat music)

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:32.940
 (upbeat music)
