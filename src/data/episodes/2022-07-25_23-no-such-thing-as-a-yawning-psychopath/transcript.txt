 we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um which was there's no such thing as a fish
 yeah nice such thing as a fish no seriously it's in the Oxford dictionary of underwater life
 he says it right there first paragraph no such thing as a fish
 hello welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you
 from the qi offices in covert garden my name is dan shriver i'm sitting here with james harkin
 anatcha zinsky and alex bell and once again we've gathered around the microphone with our
 favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go
 okay let's start with fact number one anatcha zinsky so my fact is that alexander the great
 band bids in battle to combat beard pulling how long were the bids i'm not sure actually i
 do know they were fashionable before that so he actually was a proponent of bids before one battle
 where he was leading the mass adonians and it was his troops versus the Persians and the Persians
 started grabbing his troops bids and pulling them off their horses and killing them all taking
 them prisoner and there's one anecdote of one of the opposing troops grabs a guy's beard and holds
 it there while he decapitates him which quite a useful word to capitating someone so yeah no
 bids in battle after that that was that was just one battle where half the soldiers died because of
 beers we're going to shave and guys that are going what i didn't think he was that bad yeah i thought it's
 good battle guys but a lot of kills in that and the thing about alexander i read somewhere else that
 one of the reasons he might have done it is that he was only 20 years old at the time and all of the
 other soldiers were older than him and one way that you showed authority if your older was by
 having a big beard and so he didn't want these other guys to have beards because he wanted to have
 the authority over them yeah he was really sure as well it wasn't he so maybe let's see yeah so he
 should have made them all sort of like stand on their knees all the time and limp around not good in
 battle is it yeah another time where war killed bids was world war one people stopped wearing
 stop wearing bids yeah you wear a beard don't you stop wearing bids in world war one because they
 were prone to lice which is an ideal in the trenches one useful beard was the first guy who swam
 from jonna grotesque to lanzand he grew a massive beard to protect his face from jellyfish stings
 oh smart that's clever isn't it another useful beard um was black bids beard oh yeah
 there's a beard too much there um he apparently used to adorn his beard with slow burning fuses
 to make himself look more intimidating in battle so he decorated himself like a big scary Christmas tree
 so he lived his hairy face on fire i know it's quite dangerous isn't it he would put fuses
 for dynamite and things slow burning ones stick them in his hand his beard and light them up
 apparently that made him look even scarier yeah it would i guess yeah slash easy to spot and slightly
 ridiculous slash it has a high chance of setting your face on fire and then you look like an idiot
 bids have really weird though aren't they they've just gone in and out of fashion so wildly since
 the beginning of civilization like ancient Rome i don't think people were pro bids because it was
 a sign of slough and leaners and you weren't looking after yourself and then other points in time
 they've been a sign of manliness so i think medieval times it was a sign of virility well there was
 that study recently about um how women find beards attractive and but only up until a certain
 number of people have beards and once you go over that number then they don't find them attractive
 anymore and apparently we are post that number now so wearing a beard is not attractive anymore
 i think Jeremy Paxman tipped the balance did he agree that was a straw that broke the cows back
 the impact was really regretting his beard now though because he made a big point to the fact that
 you should be allowed to have a beard on tv and then there's the um the blf have you heard of
 the blf is it the beard liberation front yeah i feel like you heard of it well did they go
 on cutting off people's beard no they're they're they're free that beard they're letting them loose
 on the more yeah now they want to encourage beards they think it's one of the great sort of like
 glass ceilings of every job in the world that if you have a beard it stops you from getting higher
 in a company or getting you on tv or they treat it as if it's like worse than the glass ceiling for
 women or or race or anything beards yeah they said that bearded women's even worse bearded women
 don't get many bearded women on panel shows do you don't you don't well there was the saint
 willger fortis wasn't there who was an english saint who there are paintings of her that were
 mistaken for jesus for a long time she looks exactly like jesus she was crucified and she had
 this big long beard and actually she's just a female saint who grew a beard do you remember that guy
 who went to the darts and he looked like jesus and he had to get kicked out no why was he kicked out
 just really quickly what happened it was a few years ago you know how darts matches get quite rowdy
 no they do uh and so there's a match going on and then some of the crowd who are very drunk and
 having a good time notice that one of the other members of the crowd looked a bit like jesus
 and then suddenly it spread and everyone was going jesus jesus to this guy and it was put in the
 darts players off so much that the guy who looked like jesus got escorted out to the venue
 oh my god that's really unfair yeah escort the people out who are chanting it i know but that
 was everyone yeah so it was either just him left or he was left speaking of jesus in the first
 six centuries of christianity all images of him look like an angelic sort of roman statue look like
 a god with curly blonde hair and no facial hair at all and it was only in about i think
 the twelfth century that we suddenly decided to change him into this guy with a big long beard who
 was scrawny and skinny and um just back to women quickly with beards um i uh i found this great thing
 in the in squire the qi um fact database uh which did you guys read this about the twelfth century
 indian scripture the koka it's called it's a twelfth century indian scripture um it basically says
 it recommends that uh augman should not marry a woman with a beard i was one of the like the main
 things in the scripture but just all of the other you shouldn't marry redheads uh you shouldn't
 marry anyone who sighs laughs or cries at meals um any girl with inverted nipples uneven breasts
 flat ears spindle legs or who is scrawny girls whose big toes are disproportionately small
 girls who make the ground shake when they walk past and my favorite any girl named after a mountain
 a tree a river or a bird someone standards it too high up there it's like oh you know what i really
 like everything about you you're non inverted nipples you're non spindly legs but i'm afraid
 Mrs. Tams is nothing i can do about it we have to talk about your girlfriend oak tree
 i'm not sure about her there was a 16th century um uh austrian mayor i think he was a sort of leader
 of a town called at hand steiniger who's um supposedly how one of the longest bids in history
 oh yeah and he he's also famous having supposedly one of the most ironic deaths as well which was
 he died by falling down the stairs and breaking his neck after tripping over his beard um he was
 running to attend a fire uh in the city and he forgot to pick up his beard and tuck it into his
 breast pocket as he used it so yeah guide oh very dangerous dangerous things so i feel sorry for
 roman boys who used to have to their first their first little sprouting which i imagine for men
 is quite an exciting event used to be whisked up to the temple to devote it to the gods which must
 be quite irritating you finally see a whisker appearing on your face after all those years and your
 mums like all right get it off we're giving it to the gods i imagine there's my ends listening to
 this going oh what you become a man and you're taken up there and you lose a little bit of your hat
 tweezed out yeah i have my bowels removed yeah i don't love my son and daughters head off
 first world roman problem yeah you know they're not allowed um the yankees don't allow beards for their
 players the baseball team the baseball team in america new york yankees uh for very long time now they've
 not allowed any player to have a beard so many players who have said that they want to join the Yankees
 say uh there's no way i'm losing my beard that's definitely gonna stay they're just gonna have to
 break the rule for me and then they always backtrack like months later when they're finally signed and
 going they're offered like a ten yeah yeah exactly they go okay i guess i'll just lose that beard then
 that's like kind of like i think dreadlocks were a problem for an australian rugby union player
 who had long dreadlocks and people always used to tackle him by pulling on his dreadlocks and i
 believe the manager at one point said you gotta get rid of those guys this is really jeopardizing our
 game it was naughty rules player this is going completely off topic now but he um so i don't really
 know the rules of us he rules very well but you catch the ball a lot you jump up and catch the ball
 don't you yeah and the ball was kept hitting his little finger and he dislocated it so many times
 that every time he caught the ball it would really give him pain on this little finger and so he
 had it amputated just to make it easier just to be a better player that's right devotion to the game
 there was another player but not for Aussie rules but for um for rugby league in australia who his trick
 fingers as well was that in a scrum uh he'd put his finger up people's butts and they would
 drop the ball and he would always get the ball aside and everyone kept complaining about it but no
 one really believed it and they finally caught him with his finger up someone and he got banned from
 the game for quite a long called brown handed okay time to move on to fact number two that is my
 fact and my fact this week is that psychopaths don't experience contagious yawning like the rest of us
 if if you're not a psychopath was that a real honor fake one that's fake one telling you
 they did this test with dogs where they had 29 dogs experience a yawn to see if they would
 yawn back and 21 out of 29 dogs yawned back and they only yawned when it was a genuine yawn if a
 human just went ugh when their mouth opened they didn't yawn back yeah it's weird i do think it's
 amazing that yawning is contagious in the human community in the dog community and between humans
 and dogs as well yes that's ridiculous although i wonder if a dog makes a human yawn yawning is so
 contagious that humans can yawn just by reading the word yawn or thinking about yawning sometimes
 so if you see a dog yawning and you know it's a yawn then i bet that's contagious yeah basically
 anyone listening to this podcast now is probably yawning and it's not just because of your terrible
 facts wow is it zero i think it's amazing yawning is a mystery we don't know why we yawn there are
 over 20 scientific theories for why we yawn and none of them is agreed upon yeah i think that's
 fascinating that's amazing really weird now the latest theory is that it cools your brain
 so you're warning it to get sucked in so you're more in winter because you suck in the cool air
 and it goes through your nasal tissue and through your throat and it's when your brain's too hot
 the engine greets thought that it was your soul trying to escape that's why you're supposed to put
 your hand over your mouth pretty they thought your soul would escape when you were sneezing as well
 in fact people that's why they say bless you isn't it yeah that makes more sense to me because you're
 pushing it out i would have thought that you're sucking it in it just sounds like people thought they
 had this soul inside them that was just trying to get out in any way possible yeah did you just
 fart no my soul was escaping but also if you failed to put your hand in front of your mouth and you
 sneezed did they just consider you someone who'd then lost their soul good one dick head your
 soul got out and the rest of their life was just the rest of your life you're waiting for someone
 else to sneeze and put your mouth right next to their mouth i got your soul hey jane's just
 yawn was that oh yeah you're on my back oh my god it wasn't it was a genuine one is that a genuine
 one oh yeah no it wasn't it was really it can't be he's a psychopath yeah should we judge why is it
 that psychopaths don't yawn contagiously do we think because i know autistic people and schizophrenia
 are much less likely to yawn contagiously as well but do we know why as far as i know it's to do
 with empathy and i find that a weird thing because i don't think that yawning was a way of showcasing
 emotion to each other so there's a guy a neuroscientist called james fallon and he was he'd worked out what
 people's brains look like if they're certain types of people and he worked out what's a psychopath's
 brains look like and he had a load of different brain scans next to him and he saw one that definitely
 looked like a psychopath and it was his own brain scan so he worked out that he was a psychopath
 himself which is quite a cool thing and then did he go on a killing spree well no he's they didn't
 interview with him and then he said oh you know what i'd never realised i was a psychopath until then
 but then he said i'm obnoxiously competitive i won't let my grandchildren win games i'm kind of
 an asshole and i do jerky things that piss people off so the clues were there falling into place
 ants yawn when they wake up do they yeah yeah they do like it looks like they're yawn so they wake
 up when they stretch all their legs and they open their mouth as if they are adorable as that so it's
 weird how many animals do it there was a study in 1994 and i haven't been able to find anything
 subsequent to that that's disproved it that found that the only vertebrates that don't yawn are
 giraffes there's the 2011 ignoble prize for physiology was won by a couple of scientists who did
 a study called no evidence of contagious yawning in the red-footed tortoise yeah really all psychopaths
 funny fear afraid if fetuses yawn in the first trimester which i find amazing because if you think
 how tiny a fetuses is in the first three months of pregnancy and it's yawning already people don't
 know why are we pretty boring in there i guess there's an antidepressant called an afronil one of
 the side effects of which is spontaneous orgasms triggered by yawning okay so you couldn't use the excuse
 I'm too tired because it would immediately be disproved yeah they've invented a yawn activated
 coffee machine which was tried out to hannersburg airport last year i think which instead of paying
 you just had to go up to it and it has a facial recognition thing and if you genuinely yawned then
 it gives you some coffee oh but then surely the first person does a genuine yawn everyone else in the
 queue with cash yeah and they go out of business immediately yeah it's weird like something that
 i've experienced for years which until looking into this fact i didn't realize was a thing is that
 if i do a stand-up gig i always yawned before the gig i always like just have this
 massive yawn and i just thought that's okay and that's i don't know what that is it must be a
 me getting the adrenaline ready or something but it seems counterintuitive because it makes it seem
 like you're tired and people if they see you yawning they're going oh you're not really that bothered
 about this gig no i think it's an anxiety thing maybe it's a way of your body really wanting more
 oxygen you know you hyperventilate when you're anxious yeah yeah i think maybe it's another way
 for body doing that yeah they found they found that um Olympic athletes the majority of them were
 yawn before their events uh concert violinists were yawned before uh concerto um they even found
 there was a guy in the army who monitored um uh army special forces jumping out of planes
 parachuting and they would all yawn as they would walk up to the door and he did a study on it to
 see if it was like it was just like a camera though they might have been going yeah actually
 sure on a mo his real name was um guy aflay which means one who yawns really that was a good link wow
 as you crowbar around to that i did notice on online when i googled world's longest yawn because i
 thought i bet someone's got that record i don't think anyone does have that record but all of those
 kind of onion wannabe websites that are trying to write satirical news stories that seems to be the
 most popular choice of news so longest yawn recorded as man realizes oasis are forming again like
 and they all try and it was a recorded three minute yawn that's how boring the news of them
 reforming was seems to be recorded as another article about the longest yawn it's exactly someone
 needs to write that one okay time for fact number three and that is James okay my fact is the big
 bang was quieter than a motorhead concert so how loud is a motorhead concert i don't really know
 what they are the motorhead was uh and is a um a metal band who have a very famous lead singer
 called lemmy yeah and they sung the song the ace of spades yeah they're quite loud then
 yeah so they apparently reach uh regularly reach around 126 decibels and according to an article
 in focus magazine that i read the other day uh the big bang was about 120 decibels really now i
 don't really understand exactly what that means but i went on on the internet and had a look around
 and i found this a website telescoper.wordpress.com it's a blog by a physicist and basically they've
 managed to by looking at the background radiation of the universe they've managed to work out that
 there were some sound waves there and they managed to work out how loud those sound waves would have
 been and according to them it was about 120 decibels and well there's no one there to hear it
 yes and these sound waves whether they'd be able to be heard by human ears anyway i don't know but
 you know i don't pretend to be able to completely 100% understand this so i'm going to what i'm
 going to do is i'm going to post a link to this guy's blog on my um twitter feed at x-shaped um people
 can make their own minds up so a blue whale which is the loudest animal in existence can give
 other cool that 188 decibels so that's much louder than the big bang and also loud enough to wrap to
 your ear drums if you heard it in fact isn't it yeah anything a bit over 100 100 and 120 that's going
 to hurt your ears yeah yeah the subject of concerts apparently one of the reasons the Beatles
 stopped touring was because their concerts weren't loud enough during their 1964 tour which was their
 last tour the audience was just screamed so loudly all the way through for the entire evening that
 no one could hear the music and the Beatles came to the conclusion that their concerts weren't about
 the music anymore and they tried all this different equipment they still can get it to work so they
 decided to stop touring that was one of the reasons uh bands now have monitors on stage that play the
 music back to them so they can hear their sound levels and what they sound like they didn't have
 that back then so there was a really famous Beatles gig where they played it in a baseball stadium in
 America where it was so loud screaming of the fans they couldn't hear themselves play so it wasn't
 even that the fans couldn't hear them they couldn't hear themselves and they were just completely out of
 tune the whole time yeah yeah yeah the world's loudest scream that is a British record it's held by
 a lady called Jill Drake from Tentadon in Kent oh I come from there do you yeah oh you might have
 heard her yeah um she set the record with 129 decibels in the year 2000 hang on she yelled
 louder than the big bang motor head to be fair pretend it is a pretty awful place
 and um the funny thing is that she didn't know that she was good at screaming but she was on a trip
 to London when the Millennium dome was there and they just happened to be having a shouting and screaming
 competition so she thought well I'm here I'm on holiday I might as well check and then she did it
 and she found that she had a real skill for it and now she's got the world record
 okay we skill at screaming does it like on her CV or something yeah well how is that a skill I
 think Alicia the best in the world is something I seem to remember that she made the record and
 just beat out the other competitor who was her twin sister is that right yeah I'm pretty sure her
 twin sister is the second loudest screamer her parents must have been so sick of them yeah
 the loudest noise recorded in model all the loudest noise that we know of happening in modern
 history was the eruption of Krakato in 1883 and it could be well it reverberated around the world seven
 times I think it could be detected on instruments going seven times around but it could be heard
 three thousand miles away wow so it's an Indonesia and it could be heard in Western Australia
 didn't it burst people's eardrums yeah any one within a 10 mile radius um their eardrums explode
 all right that's insane yeah um I've got one motor head fact which is that yeah they recently
 uh rocked so hard at a concert that one of the guys head banging uh it got a blood clot in his
 brain as a result of the like absolute just head banging that was going on yeah and he survived
 so it's now a it's now a mark of awesomeness both to the fan and the band that they rocked a guy so
 hard that his brain spasms Kagan and Aguism there was that thing about um was it madness who I think
 they did a thing at Finnsbury Park where everyone was stumping up and down so much that they caused
 an earthquake and very small earthquake it might have been that that was also in a in a football stadium
 in America what's it yeah yeah where they were stepping so hard at the chiefs cancity chiefs
 that that happened quite recently yeah so they triggered an actual earthquake as in it was measured
 it was measured yeah everyone played no no no no crazy although is the Richter is at the Richter
 scale there's not so no news anymore yeah it's a moment magnitude scale now yeah but it's
 pretty much yeah if anyone got any last facts they want to chuck in um so these guys called penzius and
 Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1978 because they detected the cosmic fog
 that's meant to be a signature of the big bang so that's what we study to work out what we think
 happened in the big bang and two pigeons had to die in order for them to work this out so they had
 the horn antenna to detect it and it kept on showing higher temperature than expected when they
 were looking at this cosmic fog and they thought oh is it the pigeon poo in the horn antenna so they
 gave the pigeon to a pigeon fancier and said take these pigeons away and pigeon fancier took them away
 let them go so they returned the horn antenna nested in there again and so they shot the pigeons but
 I just think if you've got two physicists and you're a pigeon fancier you go my one job is to keep
 these two pigeons out of the horn antenna while these guys try to work out the universe and he
 copped it up yeah but what was interesting about that was that I thought the usually these kind of
 things happen to be that some of the things they discovered something amazing and it turns out to be
 actually the pigeon shuttle over the equipment and ruined it and that was it it was actually the
 other way around with this because they thought the pigeon and it turned out to be they discovered
 the background cosmic radiation universe they just didn't realize it who was it I've
 completely forgotten his name now but there was a physicist who spent years studying Venus who
 looking through Venus and a telescope and he thought he was looking at canals on Venus and it turned
 up he was actually he'd actually had his telescope incorrectly calibrate and he was looking at
 cataracts in his eyes and the love vessels are in his eyes for years and years and we're studying these
 and it's really sad actually because yeah and there's maps of Venus isn't that he drew and actually
 it's a map of the inside of his own eyeball yeah that's so cool have you guys heard about the
 mysterious hum apparently it a mysterious hum go greas not true though is it um well it's true
 that people think it exists yeah there's a lot of people reporting that there's this low hum that's
 appearing in certain bits of the planet and a lot of people are experiencing it and no one knows
 where the hum is coming from is it detected on sound detecting equipment I don't know enough about it
 sometimes these facts are better when you don't read into them the electromagnetic radiation
 for Sun makes it noise the really interesting sound I was going to submit it for M series actually
 who music um check out if you go on YouTube and type in some sounds yeah music of this first the
 earth does as well there's a there's a note there's a definite note I think it fluctuates um yeah
 basically anything that's anything that's vibrating will bring a noise sound the earth emits an
 ear piercing combination of shrieks and whistles apparently and that's just from Tencenton
 okay time to move on to our final fact and that is Alex my fact is that Pixar accidentally
 deleted Toy Story 2 halfway through making it oh how how yeah okay so this is a really great story
 okay so um basically everyone in Pixar there are over a hundred people working on the film at the time
 um and um they all had access to the the the files at the same time it there was no sort of protection
 and this was a while ago so it was quite simple computer systems someone literally just typed in
 the wrong command and the computer by accident realized that they'd accidentally told the
 computer to delete the whole film and that it was doing that um they then quickly sent emails around
 being like shit please can someone help me I think I've just deleted Toy Story 2 um they then rang
 downstairs to the place where the servers were and was they just said unplug the machine as quickly
 as you can so they did so they turned it off and turned it on again which is the solution to everything
 when they turned it back on they found that nearly all of the movie had been deleted oh my god um so
 they started panicking and they started asking everyone does anyone have any bits of the film at home
 um because apparently the whole film only took up 10 gigabytes with the the all the information
 took took to make it which was still a large amount in that time but a 13 minute episode of the case
 series of qi is 13 gigabytes on our server so that's you know that's more than all of the information
 to render Toy Story 2 and um so that so they thought they'd lost the entire film until they remembered
 that um one of their employee one of the animators was on maternity leave and had been given a computer
 to work on from home which had the entire film on and it only been backed up two weeks ago so they
 drove around to her house they wrapped up the computer in blankets and put it in the back of a Volvo
 and drove it back to Pixar with the whole film on it and it was estimated to be worth about 100 million
 dollars that computer because it it had all of the work on it was any copy i like the way you you
 specified it was a Volvo as well yeah i know there's something about a Volvo isn't it it's just
 known as the the hundred million dollar Volvo because it was just like everyone was just holding
 the computer and they strapped it in the seat off and they were incredibly worried that it was all
 gonna be destroyed. Jovey 2 miles an hour. The whole story is slightly undermined by the fact that
 they finished the film and it was all fine and then Pixar decided to start again basically from scratch
 because the story wasn't good enough. Yeah i love that. I love that about Pixar i think i mean that's
 such a testament to their quality controls they just looked at it and said actually no let's start
 again. It was their second feature film so they were really wanted to get it right so they did
 redo it but even to the point where they were getting to the final product they they were going
 to release it on vhs it was going to be a director vhs they weren't confident that it was going to
 yeah they certainly weren't confident Billy Crystal turned down the role of voicing woody and he says
 that's the biggest mistake he ever made in his career which was just a voice over all. Bill Murray was
 also approached and he turned it well he didn't turn it down he missed the phone call because Bill
 Murray has a system whereby he doesn't have an agent he has an answer phone message a system that
 you can leave your requests for him to be in your movie on and he missed out on that phone call
 that day maybe yes yes they deleted it halfway through yeah so he would have been in it and he says
 that was the big regret of his career as well. Pixar are great there's that i think this might
 be in the next series of qi but that lunch that the four big cheeses that Pixar had in 1994
 where so it was John Lacer to Pete doctor Andrew Stanton and Joe Rand they had one lunch
 and at that lunch they came up with the ideas and the rough storyline sketches for a bugs life
 monster zinc finding Nemo and Wolley which just made you wonder what they did for the subsequent ten years
 if that's all covered in a lunch but it takes them like six years to make a single movie
 yeah it's very arduous yeah like Tom Hanks was doing the voice over for it when he was filming
 sleepless in Seattle and that feels like that was 30 years ago even though it's something like 20
 and you know forest gump when he was doing forest gump he was still doing the voice over for it
 just doesn't feel as old as those movies are that i read this and i i don't really know enough about
 films to know if it's true but he was doing philadelphia at the same time and he refused to do any
 toy story bet at the same time because he didn't think he should be doing comedy voice over while
 he was doing a yes that's what i read and it was in the period where he was doing philadelphia
 and forest gump and he felt like these aren't the appropriate movies so what was he worried about
 that he was going to accidentally be funny in the really serious yeah maybe in the middle of
 philadelphia you might bring out his um you're my favorite deputy bus light he was originally called
 lunar larry oh i don't know yeah he was called lunar larry and then he had a brief period as tempis
 and then morph they went to bars more but there's a very famous more for ready who's the famous
 more Tony Hart's little um plastic in the 70s oh really very famous maybe they found out about that
 Tony Hart from heartbeat um he's the guy who invented morph yeah and he also drew the um picture for
 blue peter you know the little ship yeah think and um he got a one-off flat fee of 50 pounds or
 something like this but if he'd have got like just one p for every time they used it on a badge or
 on something else like that he would be at multi-millionaire by now that's like i read the story
 the other day about the men who designed the mcdonalds golden arches oh yeah have you have you
 any idea what his name is surely that's he created one of the most iconic yeah runald yeah it wasn't
 and i don't know his name either i read it but i can't remember it now but um he was offered by the
 brothers that he could get a flat fee or he could have a additional royalty for every time a new
 mcdonalds open and he said maldo the flat fee i can't see this going any bigger yeah on the opposite
 end of the scale there's the guy who painted the mural at facebook when facebook had just started
 and he was paid in facebook shares i think so he's now a multi-millionaire or something ridiculous
 yeah um just heading back to toy story too quickly what i love about this fact is i love just hearing
 the behind-the-scenes stories of these these kind of disasters or early stages of things that we've
 become to know and love and i love just in animation generally i was i was reading up recently about
 some early disney movies and um Alice in Wonderland the original early version scripts i don't know
 if it was the very first one but certainly in the very early stages do you know who was the author
 of the script for the animation all this hoxley really yeah he wrote a bunch of versions of it and then
 it just didn't make it through into the end and also uh the uh the lion king was originally called
 king of the jungle it still says on all their press uh king of the jungle you know just in the taglines
 but they dropped it because they suddenly realized that there are no lions in the jungle
 therefore you can't have it but it was pitched the movie was pitched itself as bambian africa meets
 hamlet and it became nicknamed bamblet when they were making it it is based on hamlet isn't it i
 haven't watched line yeah you can see a lot of similarities when you watch it bambi itself was going to
 be uh in the scene spoiler alert where his mum get shot then it was the scene was originally going
 to be bambi saw his mum get shot and saw her being dragged away by hunters and leaving behind a pool
 of blood as the bloodied carcass was dragged away along the meadow and then they thought that
 she that's probably disturbing enough as well on top of that as well the uh the movie who frame roger
 abbot it turned out that they were going to make the killer of bambi's mother the evil guy in who
 frame roger abbot and that was going to be revealed in the movie and they decided to drop that at the
 last minute we just we just recorded the rest recent series the museum of curiosity and one of the
 guests was Richard Williams who's the head animator yeah of course yeah yeah so one of the guests
 was Richard Williams who was the main animator a really big animator and he was the main guy he
 basically drew roger abbot and jeska rabbit and i was talking to him afterwards in the pub and
 i was asking about all of these hidden because in roger abbot especially it's a it's a family film
 but there are a lot of single frames where there's some really dark stuff going on and one of them is
 jeska rabbit pulled out of a cab at one point and um and like her skirt goes up and you see
 everything and there's a big controversy about this when they recently re-released the film and
 basically what happened was uh Richard Williams um drew her falling out and her skirt went up a
 bit but you didn't it wasn't actually explicit you didn't see anything in the 2004 i think
 re-release of the film on dbd some new animators went in and made it explicit and drew some stuff there
 but didn't tell anyone and Richard got the blame for it they also they also put in that movie there was
 some graffiti on the wall which said for a good time this is roughly what it said for a good time
 called allyson wonderland and the number that they put underneath was but the phone number of
 michael isner the head of disney at the time it was his actual number and they had to subsequently
 take that out as well from that movie on the subject of pornographic broadcasting um the concast is
 a massive american broadcasting company and they're responsible for loads and loads of american
 watching television and um they they they have a really bad history of accidentally broadcasting
 hardcore pornography and really inappropriate times so one time they did it during the super bowl
 about thirty seconds one another time was on uh Cartoon Network and the film was on the Disney channel
 they just accidentally replaced programs with pornographic hardcore no yeah wow um i was looking at
 sort of the you know tiny technical mistakes that could have had huge repercussions like the fact
 that last year there was a typo in a sign outside of the Oregon teacher standards and practices
 commission and the sign read Oregon teacher standards and practices commission without a d
 right so just a d missing and a guy got so angry about this that he resolved to explode it with a
 pressure cooker bomb and so he marched in brandishing this bomb into the teacher standards commission
 said i can't believe there's a typo in this and it's outrageous i'm exploding this bomb now
 went to explode at the bomb didn't explode so then he wrote furious letters to everyone and
 campaigned about the fact that the bomb making instructions on the internet also riddled with typos
 and it was for that reason his bomb hadn't worked so the typo caused the crisis but then it also saved
 the crisis from happening so i don't know who signed you on tiny toy story fact one of the working
 titles for toy story was toys in the hood with a z for toys first good catch 22 was originally going
 to be called catch 11 but it was around the same time that oceans 11 the first oceans 11 came out
 and so there was a concern that it was going to be confused but i remember it was called catch 18
 for a while yeah they they toyed with catch 18 so after they discarded catch 11 they went for
 a number of other options well so they had a meeting uh Joseph heller we could you come into the
 office we love the book yeah really good uh we need a new number for the title it's like the work in
 the way up it's like catch 11 know there's oceans 11 okay catch 12 well there's also oceans 12
 okay 13 well actually a follow 13 okay that's it that's all our facts thanks everyone for listening
