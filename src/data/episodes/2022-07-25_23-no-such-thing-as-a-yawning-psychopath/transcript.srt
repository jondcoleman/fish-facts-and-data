1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um which was there's no such thing as a fish

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,440
 yeah nice such thing as a fish no seriously it's in the Oxford dictionary of underwater life

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,560
 he says it right there first paragraph no such thing as a fish

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:23,040
 hello welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,000
 from the qi offices in covert garden my name is dan shriver i'm sitting here with james harkin

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,320
 anatcha zinsky and alex bell and once again we've gathered around the microphone with our

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,160
 favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,400
 okay let's start with fact number one anatcha zinsky so my fact is that alexander the great

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:52,240
 band bids in battle to combat beard pulling how long were the bids i'm not sure actually i

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,760
 do know they were fashionable before that so he actually was a proponent of bids before one battle

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,000
 where he was leading the mass adonians and it was his troops versus the Persians and the Persians

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,960
 started grabbing his troops bids and pulling them off their horses and killing them all taking

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,360
 them prisoner and there's one anecdote of one of the opposing troops grabs a guy's beard and holds

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,600
 it there while he decapitates him which quite a useful word to capitating someone so yeah no

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,240
 bids in battle after that that was that was just one battle where half the soldiers died because of

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,440
 beers we're going to shave and guys that are going what i didn't think he was that bad yeah i thought it's

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,840
 good battle guys but a lot of kills in that and the thing about alexander i read somewhere else that

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,520
 one of the reasons he might have done it is that he was only 20 years old at the time and all of the

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,560
 other soldiers were older than him and one way that you showed authority if your older was by

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,000
 having a big beard and so he didn't want these other guys to have beards because he wanted to have

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,920
 the authority over them yeah he was really sure as well it wasn't he so maybe let's see yeah so he

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,160
 should have made them all sort of like stand on their knees all the time and limp around not good in

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,560
 battle is it yeah another time where war killed bids was world war one people stopped wearing

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,880
 stop wearing bids yeah you wear a beard don't you stop wearing bids in world war one because they

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,600
 were prone to lice which is an ideal in the trenches one useful beard was the first guy who swam

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,560
 from jonna grotesque to lanzand he grew a massive beard to protect his face from jellyfish stings

27
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,560
 oh smart that's clever isn't it another useful beard um was black bids beard oh yeah

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,640
 there's a beard too much there um he apparently used to adorn his beard with slow burning fuses

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,360
 to make himself look more intimidating in battle so he decorated himself like a big scary Christmas tree

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,480
 so he lived his hairy face on fire i know it's quite dangerous isn't it he would put fuses

31
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,200
 for dynamite and things slow burning ones stick them in his hand his beard and light them up

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,200
 apparently that made him look even scarier yeah it would i guess yeah slash easy to spot and slightly

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,560
 ridiculous slash it has a high chance of setting your face on fire and then you look like an idiot

34
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,760
 bids have really weird though aren't they they've just gone in and out of fashion so wildly since

35
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,560
 the beginning of civilization like ancient Rome i don't think people were pro bids because it was

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,800
 a sign of slough and leaners and you weren't looking after yourself and then other points in time

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,280
 they've been a sign of manliness so i think medieval times it was a sign of virility well there was

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,040
 that study recently about um how women find beards attractive and but only up until a certain

39
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,960
 number of people have beards and once you go over that number then they don't find them attractive

40
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,760
 anymore and apparently we are post that number now so wearing a beard is not attractive anymore

41
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,640
 i think Jeremy Paxman tipped the balance did he agree that was a straw that broke the cows back

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,680
 the impact was really regretting his beard now though because he made a big point to the fact that

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,400
 you should be allowed to have a beard on tv and then there's the um the blf have you heard of

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,440
 the blf is it the beard liberation front yeah i feel like you heard of it well did they go

45
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,160
 on cutting off people's beard no they're they're they're free that beard they're letting them loose

46
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,560
 on the more yeah now they want to encourage beards they think it's one of the great sort of like

47
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,080
 glass ceilings of every job in the world that if you have a beard it stops you from getting higher

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,200
 in a company or getting you on tv or they treat it as if it's like worse than the glass ceiling for

49
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,120
 women or or race or anything beards yeah they said that bearded women's even worse bearded women

50
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,040
 don't get many bearded women on panel shows do you don't you don't well there was the saint

51
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,760
 willger fortis wasn't there who was an english saint who there are paintings of her that were

52
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,160
 mistaken for jesus for a long time she looks exactly like jesus she was crucified and she had

53
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,240
 this big long beard and actually she's just a female saint who grew a beard do you remember that guy

54
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,520
 who went to the darts and he looked like jesus and he had to get kicked out no why was he kicked out

55
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,520
 just really quickly what happened it was a few years ago you know how darts matches get quite rowdy

56
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,600
 no they do uh and so there's a match going on and then some of the crowd who are very drunk and

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,320
 having a good time notice that one of the other members of the crowd looked a bit like jesus

58
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,080
 and then suddenly it spread and everyone was going jesus jesus to this guy and it was put in the

59
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,400
 darts players off so much that the guy who looked like jesus got escorted out to the venue

60
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,160
 oh my god that's really unfair yeah escort the people out who are chanting it i know but that

61
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,960
 was everyone yeah so it was either just him left or he was left speaking of jesus in the first

62
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,840
 six centuries of christianity all images of him look like an angelic sort of roman statue look like

63
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,000
 a god with curly blonde hair and no facial hair at all and it was only in about i think

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,920
 the twelfth century that we suddenly decided to change him into this guy with a big long beard who

65
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,720
 was scrawny and skinny and um just back to women quickly with beards um i uh i found this great thing

66
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,360
 in the in squire the qi um fact database uh which did you guys read this about the twelfth century

67
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,600
 indian scripture the koka it's called it's a twelfth century indian scripture um it basically says

68
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,160
 it recommends that uh augman should not marry a woman with a beard i was one of the like the main

69
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,320
 things in the scripture but just all of the other you shouldn't marry redheads uh you shouldn't

70
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:16,720
 marry anyone who sighs laughs or cries at meals um any girl with inverted nipples uneven breasts

71
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,800
 flat ears spindle legs or who is scrawny girls whose big toes are disproportionately small

72
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,200
 girls who make the ground shake when they walk past and my favorite any girl named after a mountain

73
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:38,240
 a tree a river or a bird someone standards it too high up there it's like oh you know what i really

74
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,000
 like everything about you you're non inverted nipples you're non spindly legs but i'm afraid

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,240
 Mrs. Tams is nothing i can do about it we have to talk about your girlfriend oak tree

76
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,880
 i'm not sure about her there was a 16th century um uh austrian mayor i think he was a sort of leader

77
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,080
 of a town called at hand steiniger who's um supposedly how one of the longest bids in history

78
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,600
 oh yeah and he he's also famous having supposedly one of the most ironic deaths as well which was

79
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,880
 he died by falling down the stairs and breaking his neck after tripping over his beard um he was

80
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,520
 running to attend a fire uh in the city and he forgot to pick up his beard and tuck it into his

81
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:26,640
 breast pocket as he used it so yeah guide oh very dangerous dangerous things so i feel sorry for

82
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,960
 roman boys who used to have to their first their first little sprouting which i imagine for men

83
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,800
 is quite an exciting event used to be whisked up to the temple to devote it to the gods which must

84
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,240
 be quite irritating you finally see a whisker appearing on your face after all those years and your

85
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,960
 mums like all right get it off we're giving it to the gods i imagine there's my ends listening to

86
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,400
 this going oh what you become a man and you're taken up there and you lose a little bit of your hat

87
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:02,400
 tweezed out yeah i have my bowels removed yeah i don't love my son and daughters head off

88
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:11,840
 first world roman problem yeah you know they're not allowed um the yankees don't allow beards for their

89
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,600
 players the baseball team the baseball team in america new york yankees uh for very long time now they've

90
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,040
 not allowed any player to have a beard so many players who have said that they want to join the Yankees

91
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,800
 say uh there's no way i'm losing my beard that's definitely gonna stay they're just gonna have to

92
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,720
 break the rule for me and then they always backtrack like months later when they're finally signed and

93
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,840
 going they're offered like a ten yeah yeah exactly they go okay i guess i'll just lose that beard then

94
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,840
 that's like kind of like i think dreadlocks were a problem for an australian rugby union player

95
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,840
 who had long dreadlocks and people always used to tackle him by pulling on his dreadlocks and i

96
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,680
 believe the manager at one point said you gotta get rid of those guys this is really jeopardizing our

97
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,240
 game it was naughty rules player this is going completely off topic now but he um so i don't really

98
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,240
 know the rules of us he rules very well but you catch the ball a lot you jump up and catch the ball

99
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,120
 don't you yeah and the ball was kept hitting his little finger and he dislocated it so many times

100
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,120
 that every time he caught the ball it would really give him pain on this little finger and so he

101
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,440
 had it amputated just to make it easier just to be a better player that's right devotion to the game

102
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,280
 there was another player but not for Aussie rules but for um for rugby league in australia who his trick

103
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,600
 fingers as well was that in a scrum uh he'd put his finger up people's butts and they would

104
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,080
 drop the ball and he would always get the ball aside and everyone kept complaining about it but no

105
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,480
 one really believed it and they finally caught him with his finger up someone and he got banned from

106
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:43,920
 the game for quite a long called brown handed okay time to move on to fact number two that is my

107
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,920
 fact and my fact this week is that psychopaths don't experience contagious yawning like the rest of us

108
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,760
 if if you're not a psychopath was that a real honor fake one that's fake one telling you

109
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,960
 they did this test with dogs where they had 29 dogs experience a yawn to see if they would

110
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,720
 yawn back and 21 out of 29 dogs yawned back and they only yawned when it was a genuine yawn if a

111
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,520
 human just went ugh when their mouth opened they didn't yawn back yeah it's weird i do think it's

112
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,400
 amazing that yawning is contagious in the human community in the dog community and between humans

113
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,600
 and dogs as well yes that's ridiculous although i wonder if a dog makes a human yawn yawning is so

114
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,720
 contagious that humans can yawn just by reading the word yawn or thinking about yawning sometimes

115
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,560
 so if you see a dog yawning and you know it's a yawn then i bet that's contagious yeah basically

116
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,800
 anyone listening to this podcast now is probably yawning and it's not just because of your terrible

117
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:49,280
 facts wow is it zero i think it's amazing yawning is a mystery we don't know why we yawn there are

118
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,960
 over 20 scientific theories for why we yawn and none of them is agreed upon yeah i think that's

119
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,440
 fascinating that's amazing really weird now the latest theory is that it cools your brain

120
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
 so you're warning it to get sucked in so you're more in winter because you suck in the cool air

121
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,440
 and it goes through your nasal tissue and through your throat and it's when your brain's too hot

122
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,400
 the engine greets thought that it was your soul trying to escape that's why you're supposed to put

123
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,960
 your hand over your mouth pretty they thought your soul would escape when you were sneezing as well

124
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,040
 in fact people that's why they say bless you isn't it yeah that makes more sense to me because you're

125
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,040
 pushing it out i would have thought that you're sucking it in it just sounds like people thought they

126
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,200
 had this soul inside them that was just trying to get out in any way possible yeah did you just

127
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,520
 fart no my soul was escaping but also if you failed to put your hand in front of your mouth and you

128
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,640
 sneezed did they just consider you someone who'd then lost their soul good one dick head your

129
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,640
 soul got out and the rest of their life was just the rest of your life you're waiting for someone

130
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,080
 else to sneeze and put your mouth right next to their mouth i got your soul hey jane's just

131
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,880
 yawn was that oh yeah you're on my back oh my god it wasn't it was a genuine one is that a genuine

132
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,120
 one oh yeah no it wasn't it was really it can't be he's a psychopath yeah should we judge why is it

133
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,960
 that psychopaths don't yawn contagiously do we think because i know autistic people and schizophrenia

134
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,600
 are much less likely to yawn contagiously as well but do we know why as far as i know it's to do

135
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,760
 with empathy and i find that a weird thing because i don't think that yawning was a way of showcasing

136
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,400
 emotion to each other so there's a guy a neuroscientist called james fallon and he was he'd worked out what

137
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,320
 people's brains look like if they're certain types of people and he worked out what's a psychopath's

138
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,280
 brains look like and he had a load of different brain scans next to him and he saw one that definitely

139
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,920
 looked like a psychopath and it was his own brain scan so he worked out that he was a psychopath

140
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,000
 himself which is quite a cool thing and then did he go on a killing spree well no he's they didn't

141
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,880
 interview with him and then he said oh you know what i'd never realised i was a psychopath until then

142
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,800
 but then he said i'm obnoxiously competitive i won't let my grandchildren win games i'm kind of

143
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,640
 an asshole and i do jerky things that piss people off so the clues were there falling into place

144
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:10,560
 ants yawn when they wake up do they yeah yeah they do like it looks like they're yawn so they wake

145
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,960
 up when they stretch all their legs and they open their mouth as if they are adorable as that so it's

146
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,440
 weird how many animals do it there was a study in 1994 and i haven't been able to find anything

147
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,240
 subsequent to that that's disproved it that found that the only vertebrates that don't yawn are

148
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:32,240
 giraffes there's the 2011 ignoble prize for physiology was won by a couple of scientists who did

149
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:40,160
 a study called no evidence of contagious yawning in the red-footed tortoise yeah really all psychopaths

150
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,480
 funny fear afraid if fetuses yawn in the first trimester which i find amazing because if you think

151
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,520
 how tiny a fetuses is in the first three months of pregnancy and it's yawning already people don't

152
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,440
 know why are we pretty boring in there i guess there's an antidepressant called an afronil one of

153
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,680
 the side effects of which is spontaneous orgasms triggered by yawning okay so you couldn't use the excuse

154
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,480
 I'm too tired because it would immediately be disproved yeah they've invented a yawn activated

155
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,040
 coffee machine which was tried out to hannersburg airport last year i think which instead of paying

156
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,520
 you just had to go up to it and it has a facial recognition thing and if you genuinely yawned then

157
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,040
 it gives you some coffee oh but then surely the first person does a genuine yawn everyone else in the

158
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,240
 queue with cash yeah and they go out of business immediately yeah it's weird like something that

159
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,440
 i've experienced for years which until looking into this fact i didn't realize was a thing is that

160
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,160
 if i do a stand-up gig i always yawned before the gig i always like just have this

161
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,960
 massive yawn and i just thought that's okay and that's i don't know what that is it must be a

162
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,280
 me getting the adrenaline ready or something but it seems counterintuitive because it makes it seem

163
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,360
 like you're tired and people if they see you yawning they're going oh you're not really that bothered

164
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,120
 about this gig no i think it's an anxiety thing maybe it's a way of your body really wanting more

165
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,160
 oxygen you know you hyperventilate when you're anxious yeah yeah i think maybe it's another way

166
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
 for body doing that yeah they found they found that um Olympic athletes the majority of them were

167
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:09,040
 yawn before their events uh concert violinists were yawned before uh concerto um they even found

168
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,480
 there was a guy in the army who monitored um uh army special forces jumping out of planes

169
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,200
 parachuting and they would all yawn as they would walk up to the door and he did a study on it to

170
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,600
 see if it was like it was just like a camera though they might have been going yeah actually

171
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:33,840
 sure on a mo his real name was um guy aflay which means one who yawns really that was a good link wow

172
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:41,760
 as you crowbar around to that i did notice on online when i googled world's longest yawn because i

173
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,160
 thought i bet someone's got that record i don't think anyone does have that record but all of those

174
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,760
 kind of onion wannabe websites that are trying to write satirical news stories that seems to be the

175
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,240
 most popular choice of news so longest yawn recorded as man realizes oasis are forming again like

176
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,720
 and they all try and it was a recorded three minute yawn that's how boring the news of them

177
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,080
 reforming was seems to be recorded as another article about the longest yawn it's exactly someone

178
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:16,480
 needs to write that one okay time for fact number three and that is James okay my fact is the big

179
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,840
 bang was quieter than a motorhead concert so how loud is a motorhead concert i don't really know

180
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,400
 what they are the motorhead was uh and is a um a metal band who have a very famous lead singer

181
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:37,200
 called lemmy yeah and they sung the song the ace of spades yeah they're quite loud then

182
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:46,400
 yeah so they apparently reach uh regularly reach around 126 decibels and according to an article

183
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,720
 in focus magazine that i read the other day uh the big bang was about 120 decibels really now i

184
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,520
 don't really understand exactly what that means but i went on on the internet and had a look around

185
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:04,560
 and i found this a website telescoper.wordpress.com it's a blog by a physicist and basically they've

186
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,520
 managed to by looking at the background radiation of the universe they've managed to work out that

187
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,520
 there were some sound waves there and they managed to work out how loud those sound waves would have

188
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,280
 been and according to them it was about 120 decibels and well there's no one there to hear it

189
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,480
 yes and these sound waves whether they'd be able to be heard by human ears anyway i don't know but

190
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,960
 you know i don't pretend to be able to completely 100% understand this so i'm going to what i'm

191
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,880
 going to do is i'm going to post a link to this guy's blog on my um twitter feed at x-shaped um people

192
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,880
 can make their own minds up so a blue whale which is the loudest animal in existence can give

193
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,920
 other cool that 188 decibels so that's much louder than the big bang and also loud enough to wrap to

194
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,520
 your ear drums if you heard it in fact isn't it yeah anything a bit over 100 100 and 120 that's going

195
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,720
 to hurt your ears yeah yeah the subject of concerts apparently one of the reasons the Beatles

196
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,040
 stopped touring was because their concerts weren't loud enough during their 1964 tour which was their

197
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,520
 last tour the audience was just screamed so loudly all the way through for the entire evening that

198
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,040
 no one could hear the music and the Beatles came to the conclusion that their concerts weren't about

199
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,560
 the music anymore and they tried all this different equipment they still can get it to work so they

200
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,440
 decided to stop touring that was one of the reasons uh bands now have monitors on stage that play the

201
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,200
 music back to them so they can hear their sound levels and what they sound like they didn't have

202
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,680
 that back then so there was a really famous Beatles gig where they played it in a baseball stadium in

203
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,920
 America where it was so loud screaming of the fans they couldn't hear themselves play so it wasn't

204
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,240
 even that the fans couldn't hear them they couldn't hear themselves and they were just completely out of

205
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,320
 tune the whole time yeah yeah yeah the world's loudest scream that is a British record it's held by

206
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,000
 a lady called Jill Drake from Tentadon in Kent oh I come from there do you yeah oh you might have

207
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:01,280
 heard her yeah um she set the record with 129 decibels in the year 2000 hang on she yelled

208
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,720
 louder than the big bang motor head to be fair pretend it is a pretty awful place

209
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,440
 and um the funny thing is that she didn't know that she was good at screaming but she was on a trip

210
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,240
 to London when the Millennium dome was there and they just happened to be having a shouting and screaming

211
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,720
 competition so she thought well I'm here I'm on holiday I might as well check and then she did it

212
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,160
 and she found that she had a real skill for it and now she's got the world record

213
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,760
 okay we skill at screaming does it like on her CV or something yeah well how is that a skill I

214
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,120
 think Alicia the best in the world is something I seem to remember that she made the record and

215
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,360
 just beat out the other competitor who was her twin sister is that right yeah I'm pretty sure her

216
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,480
 twin sister is the second loudest screamer her parents must have been so sick of them yeah

217
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,880
 the loudest noise recorded in model all the loudest noise that we know of happening in modern

218
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,200
 history was the eruption of Krakato in 1883 and it could be well it reverberated around the world seven

219
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,880
 times I think it could be detected on instruments going seven times around but it could be heard

220
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,440
 three thousand miles away wow so it's an Indonesia and it could be heard in Western Australia

221
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,280
 didn't it burst people's eardrums yeah any one within a 10 mile radius um their eardrums explode

222
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,160
 all right that's insane yeah um I've got one motor head fact which is that yeah they recently

223
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:25,120
 uh rocked so hard at a concert that one of the guys head banging uh it got a blood clot in his

224
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,720
 brain as a result of the like absolute just head banging that was going on yeah and he survived

225
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,680
 so it's now a it's now a mark of awesomeness both to the fan and the band that they rocked a guy so

226
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,600
 hard that his brain spasms Kagan and Aguism there was that thing about um was it madness who I think

227
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,240
 they did a thing at Finnsbury Park where everyone was stumping up and down so much that they caused

228
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,240
 an earthquake and very small earthquake it might have been that that was also in a in a football stadium

229
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,600
 in America what's it yeah yeah where they were stepping so hard at the chiefs cancity chiefs

230
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,160
 that that happened quite recently yeah so they triggered an actual earthquake as in it was measured

231
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:07,280
 it was measured yeah everyone played no no no no crazy although is the Richter is at the Richter

232
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,960
 scale there's not so no news anymore yeah it's a moment magnitude scale now yeah but it's

233
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:18,160
 pretty much yeah if anyone got any last facts they want to chuck in um so these guys called penzius and

234
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,280
 Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1978 because they detected the cosmic fog

235
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,640
 that's meant to be a signature of the big bang so that's what we study to work out what we think

236
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,920
 happened in the big bang and two pigeons had to die in order for them to work this out so they had

237
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,320
 the horn antenna to detect it and it kept on showing higher temperature than expected when they

238
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,880
 were looking at this cosmic fog and they thought oh is it the pigeon poo in the horn antenna so they

239
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,760
 gave the pigeon to a pigeon fancier and said take these pigeons away and pigeon fancier took them away

240
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,360
 let them go so they returned the horn antenna nested in there again and so they shot the pigeons but

241
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,800
 I just think if you've got two physicists and you're a pigeon fancier you go my one job is to keep

242
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,680
 these two pigeons out of the horn antenna while these guys try to work out the universe and he

243
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:09,200
 copped it up yeah but what was interesting about that was that I thought the usually these kind of

244
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,160
 things happen to be that some of the things they discovered something amazing and it turns out to be

245
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,200
 actually the pigeon shuttle over the equipment and ruined it and that was it it was actually the

246
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,560
 other way around with this because they thought the pigeon and it turned out to be they discovered

247
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,080
 the background cosmic radiation universe they just didn't realize it who was it I've

248
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,000
 completely forgotten his name now but there was a physicist who spent years studying Venus who

249
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,480
 looking through Venus and a telescope and he thought he was looking at canals on Venus and it turned

250
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,400
 up he was actually he'd actually had his telescope incorrectly calibrate and he was looking at

251
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,680
 cataracts in his eyes and the love vessels are in his eyes for years and years and we're studying these

252
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,760
 and it's really sad actually because yeah and there's maps of Venus isn't that he drew and actually

253
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,280
 it's a map of the inside of his own eyeball yeah that's so cool have you guys heard about the

254
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,840
 mysterious hum apparently it a mysterious hum go greas not true though is it um well it's true

255
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,840
 that people think it exists yeah there's a lot of people reporting that there's this low hum that's

256
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,320
 appearing in certain bits of the planet and a lot of people are experiencing it and no one knows

257
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,360
 where the hum is coming from is it detected on sound detecting equipment I don't know enough about it

258
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,520
 sometimes these facts are better when you don't read into them the electromagnetic radiation

259
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,920
 for Sun makes it noise the really interesting sound I was going to submit it for M series actually

260
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,800
 who music um check out if you go on YouTube and type in some sounds yeah music of this first the

261
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,280
 earth does as well there's a there's a note there's a definite note I think it fluctuates um yeah

262
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,520
 basically anything that's anything that's vibrating will bring a noise sound the earth emits an

263
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,800
 ear piercing combination of shrieks and whistles apparently and that's just from Tencenton

264
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:51,120
 okay time to move on to our final fact and that is Alex my fact is that Pixar accidentally

265
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,360
 deleted Toy Story 2 halfway through making it oh how how yeah okay so this is a really great story

266
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,400
 okay so um basically everyone in Pixar there are over a hundred people working on the film at the time

267
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,600
 um and um they all had access to the the the files at the same time it there was no sort of protection

268
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,520
 and this was a while ago so it was quite simple computer systems someone literally just typed in

269
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,280
 the wrong command and the computer by accident realized that they'd accidentally told the

270
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,120
 computer to delete the whole film and that it was doing that um they then quickly sent emails around

271
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,400
 being like shit please can someone help me I think I've just deleted Toy Story 2 um they then rang

272
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,360
 downstairs to the place where the servers were and was they just said unplug the machine as quickly

273
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,360
 as you can so they did so they turned it off and turned it on again which is the solution to everything

274
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,160
 when they turned it back on they found that nearly all of the movie had been deleted oh my god um so

275
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,040
 they started panicking and they started asking everyone does anyone have any bits of the film at home

276
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,960
 um because apparently the whole film only took up 10 gigabytes with the the all the information

277
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,120
 took took to make it which was still a large amount in that time but a 13 minute episode of the case

278
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,520
 series of qi is 13 gigabytes on our server so that's you know that's more than all of the information

279
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,760
 to render Toy Story 2 and um so that so they thought they'd lost the entire film until they remembered

280
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,200
 that um one of their employee one of the animators was on maternity leave and had been given a computer

281
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,400
 to work on from home which had the entire film on and it only been backed up two weeks ago so they

282
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,640
 drove around to her house they wrapped up the computer in blankets and put it in the back of a Volvo

283
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,400
 and drove it back to Pixar with the whole film on it and it was estimated to be worth about 100 million

284
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,200
 dollars that computer because it it had all of the work on it was any copy i like the way you you

285
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,320
 specified it was a Volvo as well yeah i know there's something about a Volvo isn't it it's just

286
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,560
 known as the the hundred million dollar Volvo because it was just like everyone was just holding

287
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,440
 the computer and they strapped it in the seat off and they were incredibly worried that it was all

288
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,040
 gonna be destroyed. Jovey 2 miles an hour. The whole story is slightly undermined by the fact that

289
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,520
 they finished the film and it was all fine and then Pixar decided to start again basically from scratch

290
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,480
 because the story wasn't good enough. Yeah i love that. I love that about Pixar i think i mean that's

291
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,040
 such a testament to their quality controls they just looked at it and said actually no let's start

292
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,480
 again. It was their second feature film so they were really wanted to get it right so they did

293
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,600
 redo it but even to the point where they were getting to the final product they they were going

294
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,680
 to release it on vhs it was going to be a director vhs they weren't confident that it was going to

295
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,720
 yeah they certainly weren't confident Billy Crystal turned down the role of voicing woody and he says

296
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,920
 that's the biggest mistake he ever made in his career which was just a voice over all. Bill Murray was

297
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,720
 also approached and he turned it well he didn't turn it down he missed the phone call because Bill

298
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,040
 Murray has a system whereby he doesn't have an agent he has an answer phone message a system that

299
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,320
 you can leave your requests for him to be in your movie on and he missed out on that phone call

300
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,200
 that day maybe yes yes they deleted it halfway through yeah so he would have been in it and he says

301
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,680
 that was the big regret of his career as well. Pixar are great there's that i think this might

302
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,520
 be in the next series of qi but that lunch that the four big cheeses that Pixar had in 1994

303
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:00,000
 where so it was John Lacer to Pete doctor Andrew Stanton and Joe Rand they had one lunch

304
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,160
 and at that lunch they came up with the ideas and the rough storyline sketches for a bugs life

305
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,040
 monster zinc finding Nemo and Wolley which just made you wonder what they did for the subsequent ten years

306
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:17,040
 if that's all covered in a lunch but it takes them like six years to make a single movie

307
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,680
 yeah it's very arduous yeah like Tom Hanks was doing the voice over for it when he was filming

308
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:27,440
 sleepless in Seattle and that feels like that was 30 years ago even though it's something like 20

309
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,000
 and you know forest gump when he was doing forest gump he was still doing the voice over for it

310
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,360
 just doesn't feel as old as those movies are that i read this and i i don't really know enough about

311
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,160
 films to know if it's true but he was doing philadelphia at the same time and he refused to do any

312
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,760
 toy story bet at the same time because he didn't think he should be doing comedy voice over while

313
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,280
 he was doing a yes that's what i read and it was in the period where he was doing philadelphia

314
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,720
 and forest gump and he felt like these aren't the appropriate movies so what was he worried about

315
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,800
 that he was going to accidentally be funny in the really serious yeah maybe in the middle of

316
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:07,440
 philadelphia you might bring out his um you're my favorite deputy bus light he was originally called

317
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,040
 lunar larry oh i don't know yeah he was called lunar larry and then he had a brief period as tempis

318
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,760
 and then morph they went to bars more but there's a very famous more for ready who's the famous

319
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:25,200
 more Tony Hart's little um plastic in the 70s oh really very famous maybe they found out about that

320
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:32,640
 Tony Hart from heartbeat um he's the guy who invented morph yeah and he also drew the um picture for

321
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,120
 blue peter you know the little ship yeah think and um he got a one-off flat fee of 50 pounds or

322
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,160
 something like this but if he'd have got like just one p for every time they used it on a badge or

323
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,400
 on something else like that he would be at multi-millionaire by now that's like i read the story

324
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,640
 the other day about the men who designed the mcdonalds golden arches oh yeah have you have you

325
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,360
 any idea what his name is surely that's he created one of the most iconic yeah runald yeah it wasn't

326
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,000
 and i don't know his name either i read it but i can't remember it now but um he was offered by the

327
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,240
 brothers that he could get a flat fee or he could have a additional royalty for every time a new

328
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,120
 mcdonalds open and he said maldo the flat fee i can't see this going any bigger yeah on the opposite

329
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,960
 end of the scale there's the guy who painted the mural at facebook when facebook had just started

330
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,440
 and he was paid in facebook shares i think so he's now a multi-millionaire or something ridiculous

331
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,560
 yeah um just heading back to toy story too quickly what i love about this fact is i love just hearing

332
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,440
 the behind-the-scenes stories of these these kind of disasters or early stages of things that we've

333
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,640
 become to know and love and i love just in animation generally i was i was reading up recently about

334
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,440
 some early disney movies and um Alice in Wonderland the original early version scripts i don't know

335
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,720
 if it was the very first one but certainly in the very early stages do you know who was the author

336
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,480
 of the script for the animation all this hoxley really yeah he wrote a bunch of versions of it and then

337
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,040
 it just didn't make it through into the end and also uh the uh the lion king was originally called

338
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,320
 king of the jungle it still says on all their press uh king of the jungle you know just in the taglines

339
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,240
 but they dropped it because they suddenly realized that there are no lions in the jungle

340
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,000
 therefore you can't have it but it was pitched the movie was pitched itself as bambian africa meets

341
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,520
 hamlet and it became nicknamed bamblet when they were making it it is based on hamlet isn't it i

342
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,720
 haven't watched line yeah you can see a lot of similarities when you watch it bambi itself was going to

343
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,200
 be uh in the scene spoiler alert where his mum get shot then it was the scene was originally going

344
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,400
 to be bambi saw his mum get shot and saw her being dragged away by hunters and leaving behind a pool

345
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,240
 of blood as the bloodied carcass was dragged away along the meadow and then they thought that

346
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,520
 she that's probably disturbing enough as well on top of that as well the uh the movie who frame roger

347
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,800
 abbot it turned out that they were going to make the killer of bambi's mother the evil guy in who

348
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,480
 frame roger abbot and that was going to be revealed in the movie and they decided to drop that at the

349
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,720
 last minute we just we just recorded the rest recent series the museum of curiosity and one of the

350
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,360
 guests was Richard Williams who's the head animator yeah of course yeah yeah so one of the guests

351
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,520
 was Richard Williams who was the main animator a really big animator and he was the main guy he

352
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,160
 basically drew roger abbot and jeska rabbit and i was talking to him afterwards in the pub and

353
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,080
 i was asking about all of these hidden because in roger abbot especially it's a it's a family film

354
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,760
 but there are a lot of single frames where there's some really dark stuff going on and one of them is

355
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,840
 jeska rabbit pulled out of a cab at one point and um and like her skirt goes up and you see

356
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,200
 everything and there's a big controversy about this when they recently re-released the film and

357
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,520
 basically what happened was uh Richard Williams um drew her falling out and her skirt went up a

358
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,760
 bit but you didn't it wasn't actually explicit you didn't see anything in the 2004 i think

359
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,240
 re-release of the film on dbd some new animators went in and made it explicit and drew some stuff there

360
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,640
 but didn't tell anyone and Richard got the blame for it they also they also put in that movie there was

361
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,120
 some graffiti on the wall which said for a good time this is roughly what it said for a good time

362
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,880
 called allyson wonderland and the number that they put underneath was but the phone number of

363
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,920
 michael isner the head of disney at the time it was his actual number and they had to subsequently

364
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,120
 take that out as well from that movie on the subject of pornographic broadcasting um the concast is

365
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,480
 a massive american broadcasting company and they're responsible for loads and loads of american

366
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,280
 watching television and um they they they have a really bad history of accidentally broadcasting

367
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,600
 hardcore pornography and really inappropriate times so one time they did it during the super bowl

368
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,640
 about thirty seconds one another time was on uh Cartoon Network and the film was on the Disney channel

369
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,360
 they just accidentally replaced programs with pornographic hardcore no yeah wow um i was looking at

370
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,000
 sort of the you know tiny technical mistakes that could have had huge repercussions like the fact

371
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,720
 that last year there was a typo in a sign outside of the Oregon teacher standards and practices

372
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,720
 commission and the sign read Oregon teacher standards and practices commission without a d

373
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,080
 right so just a d missing and a guy got so angry about this that he resolved to explode it with a

374
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,720
 pressure cooker bomb and so he marched in brandishing this bomb into the teacher standards commission

375
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,160
 said i can't believe there's a typo in this and it's outrageous i'm exploding this bomb now

376
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,160
 went to explode at the bomb didn't explode so then he wrote furious letters to everyone and

377
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,360
 campaigned about the fact that the bomb making instructions on the internet also riddled with typos

378
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,200
 and it was for that reason his bomb hadn't worked so the typo caused the crisis but then it also saved

379
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,400
 the crisis from happening so i don't know who signed you on tiny toy story fact one of the working

380
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,480
 titles for toy story was toys in the hood with a z for toys first good catch 22 was originally going

381
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,080
 to be called catch 11 but it was around the same time that oceans 11 the first oceans 11 came out

382
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,480
 and so there was a concern that it was going to be confused but i remember it was called catch 18

383
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,200
 for a while yeah they they toyed with catch 18 so after they discarded catch 11 they went for

384
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,120
 a number of other options well so they had a meeting uh Joseph heller we could you come into the

385
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,040
 office we love the book yeah really good uh we need a new number for the title it's like the work in

386
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,840
 the way up it's like catch 11 know there's oceans 11 okay catch 12 well there's also oceans 12
