00:00:00,00:00:04,we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um which was there's no such thing as a fish
00:00:04,00:00:09,yeah nice such thing as a fish no seriously it's in the Oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:00:09,00:00:12,he says it right there first paragraph no such thing as a fish
00:00:12,00:00:23,hello welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:23,00:00:28,from the qi offices in covert garden my name is dan shriver i'm sitting here with james harkin
00:00:28,00:00:32,anatcha zinsky and alex bell and once again we've gathered around the microphone with our
00:00:32,00:00:36,favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go
00:00:36,00:00:44,okay let's start with fact number one anatcha zinsky so my fact is that alexander the great
00:00:44,00:00:52,band bids in battle to combat beard pulling how long were the bids i'm not sure actually i
00:00:52,00:00:57,do know they were fashionable before that so he actually was a proponent of bids before one battle
00:00:57,00:01:04,where he was leading the mass adonians and it was his troops versus the Persians and the Persians
00:01:04,00:01:08,started grabbing his troops bids and pulling them off their horses and killing them all taking
00:01:08,00:01:13,them prisoner and there's one anecdote of one of the opposing troops grabs a guy's beard and holds
00:01:13,00:01:17,it there while he decapitates him which quite a useful word to capitating someone so yeah no
00:01:17,00:01:22,bids in battle after that that was that was just one battle where half the soldiers died because of
00:01:22,00:01:27,beers we're going to shave and guys that are going what i didn't think he was that bad yeah i thought it's
00:01:27,00:01:33,good battle guys but a lot of kills in that and the thing about alexander i read somewhere else that
00:01:33,00:01:39,one of the reasons he might have done it is that he was only 20 years old at the time and all of the
00:01:39,00:01:44,other soldiers were older than him and one way that you showed authority if your older was by
00:01:44,00:01:48,having a big beard and so he didn't want these other guys to have beards because he wanted to have
00:01:48,00:01:53,the authority over them yeah he was really sure as well it wasn't he so maybe let's see yeah so he
00:01:53,00:01:58,should have made them all sort of like stand on their knees all the time and limp around not good in
00:01:58,00:02:04,battle is it yeah another time where war killed bids was world war one people stopped wearing
00:02:04,00:02:08,stop wearing bids yeah you wear a beard don't you stop wearing bids in world war one because they
00:02:08,00:02:15,were prone to lice which is an ideal in the trenches one useful beard was the first guy who swam
00:02:15,00:02:20,from jonna grotesque to lanzand he grew a massive beard to protect his face from jellyfish stings
00:02:20,00:02:26,oh smart that's clever isn't it another useful beard um was black bids beard oh yeah
00:02:26,00:02:30,there's a beard too much there um he apparently used to adorn his beard with slow burning fuses
00:02:30,00:02:35,to make himself look more intimidating in battle so he decorated himself like a big scary Christmas tree
00:02:35,00:02:40,so he lived his hairy face on fire i know it's quite dangerous isn't it he would put fuses
00:02:40,00:02:45,for dynamite and things slow burning ones stick them in his hand his beard and light them up
00:02:45,00:02:51,apparently that made him look even scarier yeah it would i guess yeah slash easy to spot and slightly
00:02:51,00:02:56,ridiculous slash it has a high chance of setting your face on fire and then you look like an idiot
00:02:56,00:03:01,bids have really weird though aren't they they've just gone in and out of fashion so wildly since
00:03:01,00:03:06,the beginning of civilization like ancient Rome i don't think people were pro bids because it was
00:03:06,00:03:10,a sign of slough and leaners and you weren't looking after yourself and then other points in time
00:03:10,00:03:17,they've been a sign of manliness so i think medieval times it was a sign of virility well there was
00:03:17,00:03:23,that study recently about um how women find beards attractive and but only up until a certain
00:03:23,00:03:26,number of people have beards and once you go over that number then they don't find them attractive
00:03:26,00:03:31,anymore and apparently we are post that number now so wearing a beard is not attractive anymore
00:03:31,00:03:36,i think Jeremy Paxman tipped the balance did he agree that was a straw that broke the cows back
00:03:36,00:03:41,the impact was really regretting his beard now though because he made a big point to the fact that
00:03:41,00:03:46,you should be allowed to have a beard on tv and then there's the um the blf have you heard of
00:03:46,00:03:53,the blf is it the beard liberation front yeah i feel like you heard of it well did they go
00:03:53,00:04:00,on cutting off people's beard no they're they're they're free that beard they're letting them loose
00:04:00,00:04:04,on the more yeah now they want to encourage beards they think it's one of the great sort of like
00:04:04,00:04:10,glass ceilings of every job in the world that if you have a beard it stops you from getting higher
00:04:10,00:04:15,in a company or getting you on tv or they treat it as if it's like worse than the glass ceiling for
00:04:15,00:04:21,women or or race or anything beards yeah they said that bearded women's even worse bearded women
00:04:21,00:04:25,don't get many bearded women on panel shows do you don't you don't well there was the saint
00:04:25,00:04:29,willger fortis wasn't there who was an english saint who there are paintings of her that were
00:04:29,00:04:34,mistaken for jesus for a long time she looks exactly like jesus she was crucified and she had
00:04:34,00:04:38,this big long beard and actually she's just a female saint who grew a beard do you remember that guy
00:04:38,00:04:43,who went to the darts and he looked like jesus and he had to get kicked out no why was he kicked out
00:04:43,00:04:47,just really quickly what happened it was a few years ago you know how darts matches get quite rowdy
00:04:47,00:04:53,no they do uh and so there's a match going on and then some of the crowd who are very drunk and
00:04:53,00:04:58,having a good time notice that one of the other members of the crowd looked a bit like jesus
00:04:58,00:05:04,and then suddenly it spread and everyone was going jesus jesus to this guy and it was put in the
00:05:04,00:05:08,darts players off so much that the guy who looked like jesus got escorted out to the venue
00:05:08,00:05:14,oh my god that's really unfair yeah escort the people out who are chanting it i know but that
00:05:14,00:05:20,was everyone yeah so it was either just him left or he was left speaking of jesus in the first
00:05:20,00:05:27,six centuries of christianity all images of him look like an angelic sort of roman statue look like
00:05:27,00:05:34,a god with curly blonde hair and no facial hair at all and it was only in about i think
00:05:34,00:05:37,the twelfth century that we suddenly decided to change him into this guy with a big long beard who
00:05:37,00:05:44,was scrawny and skinny and um just back to women quickly with beards um i uh i found this great thing
00:05:44,00:05:51,in the in squire the qi um fact database uh which did you guys read this about the twelfth century
00:05:51,00:05:57,indian scripture the koka it's called it's a twelfth century indian scripture um it basically says
00:05:57,00:06:04,it recommends that uh augman should not marry a woman with a beard i was one of the like the main
00:06:04,00:06:08,things in the scripture but just all of the other you shouldn't marry redheads uh you shouldn't
00:06:08,00:06:16,marry anyone who sighs laughs or cries at meals um any girl with inverted nipples uneven breasts
00:06:16,00:06:22,flat ears spindle legs or who is scrawny girls whose big toes are disproportionately small
00:06:22,00:06:29,girls who make the ground shake when they walk past and my favorite any girl named after a mountain
00:06:29,00:06:38,a tree a river or a bird someone standards it too high up there it's like oh you know what i really
00:06:38,00:06:44,like everything about you you're non inverted nipples you're non spindly legs but i'm afraid
00:06:44,00:06:48,Mrs. Tams is nothing i can do about it we have to talk about your girlfriend oak tree
00:06:50,00:06:56,i'm not sure about her there was a 16th century um uh austrian mayor i think he was a sort of leader
00:06:56,00:07:02,of a town called at hand steiniger who's um supposedly how one of the longest bids in history
00:07:02,00:07:07,oh yeah and he he's also famous having supposedly one of the most ironic deaths as well which was
00:07:07,00:07:12,he died by falling down the stairs and breaking his neck after tripping over his beard um he was
00:07:12,00:07:17,running to attend a fire uh in the city and he forgot to pick up his beard and tuck it into his
00:07:17,00:07:26,breast pocket as he used it so yeah guide oh very dangerous dangerous things so i feel sorry for
00:07:26,00:07:32,roman boys who used to have to their first their first little sprouting which i imagine for men
00:07:32,00:07:38,is quite an exciting event used to be whisked up to the temple to devote it to the gods which must
00:07:38,00:07:44,be quite irritating you finally see a whisker appearing on your face after all those years and your
00:07:44,00:07:48,mums like all right get it off we're giving it to the gods i imagine there's my ends listening to
00:07:48,00:07:54,this going oh what you become a man and you're taken up there and you lose a little bit of your hat
00:07:54,00:08:02,tweezed out yeah i have my bowels removed yeah i don't love my son and daughters head off
00:08:02,00:08:11,first world roman problem yeah you know they're not allowed um the yankees don't allow beards for their
00:08:11,00:08:17,players the baseball team the baseball team in america new york yankees uh for very long time now they've
00:08:17,00:08:23,not allowed any player to have a beard so many players who have said that they want to join the Yankees
00:08:23,00:08:26,say uh there's no way i'm losing my beard that's definitely gonna stay they're just gonna have to
00:08:26,00:08:30,break the rule for me and then they always backtrack like months later when they're finally signed and
00:08:30,00:08:35,going they're offered like a ten yeah yeah exactly they go okay i guess i'll just lose that beard then
00:08:35,00:08:39,that's like kind of like i think dreadlocks were a problem for an australian rugby union player
00:08:39,00:08:43,who had long dreadlocks and people always used to tackle him by pulling on his dreadlocks and i
00:08:43,00:08:47,believe the manager at one point said you gotta get rid of those guys this is really jeopardizing our
00:08:47,00:08:54,game it was naughty rules player this is going completely off topic now but he um so i don't really
00:08:54,00:08:58,know the rules of us he rules very well but you catch the ball a lot you jump up and catch the ball
00:08:58,00:09:03,don't you yeah and the ball was kept hitting his little finger and he dislocated it so many times
00:09:03,00:09:07,that every time he caught the ball it would really give him pain on this little finger and so he
00:09:07,00:09:13,had it amputated just to make it easier just to be a better player that's right devotion to the game
00:09:13,00:09:19,there was another player but not for Aussie rules but for um for rugby league in australia who his trick
00:09:19,00:09:25,fingers as well was that in a scrum uh he'd put his finger up people's butts and they would
00:09:25,00:09:30,drop the ball and he would always get the ball aside and everyone kept complaining about it but no
00:09:30,00:09:34,one really believed it and they finally caught him with his finger up someone and he got banned from
00:09:34,00:09:43,the game for quite a long called brown handed okay time to move on to fact number two that is my
00:09:43,00:09:51,fact and my fact this week is that psychopaths don't experience contagious yawning like the rest of us
00:09:51,00:09:59,if if you're not a psychopath was that a real honor fake one that's fake one telling you
00:10:00,00:10:06,they did this test with dogs where they had 29 dogs experience a yawn to see if they would
00:10:06,00:10:12,yawn back and 21 out of 29 dogs yawned back and they only yawned when it was a genuine yawn if a
00:10:12,00:10:17,human just went ugh when their mouth opened they didn't yawn back yeah it's weird i do think it's
00:10:17,00:10:22,amazing that yawning is contagious in the human community in the dog community and between humans
00:10:22,00:10:27,and dogs as well yes that's ridiculous although i wonder if a dog makes a human yawn yawning is so
00:10:27,00:10:32,contagious that humans can yawn just by reading the word yawn or thinking about yawning sometimes
00:10:32,00:10:36,so if you see a dog yawning and you know it's a yawn then i bet that's contagious yeah basically
00:10:36,00:10:40,anyone listening to this podcast now is probably yawning and it's not just because of your terrible
00:10:40,00:10:49,facts wow is it zero i think it's amazing yawning is a mystery we don't know why we yawn there are
00:10:49,00:10:54,over 20 scientific theories for why we yawn and none of them is agreed upon yeah i think that's
00:10:54,00:10:59,fascinating that's amazing really weird now the latest theory is that it cools your brain
00:10:59,00:11:03,so you're warning it to get sucked in so you're more in winter because you suck in the cool air
00:11:03,00:11:07,and it goes through your nasal tissue and through your throat and it's when your brain's too hot
00:11:07,00:11:10,the engine greets thought that it was your soul trying to escape that's why you're supposed to put
00:11:10,00:11:14,your hand over your mouth pretty they thought your soul would escape when you were sneezing as well
00:11:14,00:11:19,in fact people that's why they say bless you isn't it yeah that makes more sense to me because you're
00:11:19,00:11:23,pushing it out i would have thought that you're sucking it in it just sounds like people thought they
00:11:23,00:11:27,had this soul inside them that was just trying to get out in any way possible yeah did you just
00:11:27,00:11:33,fart no my soul was escaping but also if you failed to put your hand in front of your mouth and you
00:11:33,00:11:38,sneezed did they just consider you someone who'd then lost their soul good one dick head your
00:11:38,00:11:42,soul got out and the rest of their life was just the rest of your life you're waiting for someone
00:11:42,00:11:48,else to sneeze and put your mouth right next to their mouth i got your soul hey jane's just
00:11:48,00:11:52,yawn was that oh yeah you're on my back oh my god it wasn't it was a genuine one is that a genuine
00:11:52,00:11:59,one oh yeah no it wasn't it was really it can't be he's a psychopath yeah should we judge why is it
00:11:59,00:12:04,that psychopaths don't yawn contagiously do we think because i know autistic people and schizophrenia
00:12:04,00:12:09,are much less likely to yawn contagiously as well but do we know why as far as i know it's to do
00:12:09,00:12:15,with empathy and i find that a weird thing because i don't think that yawning was a way of showcasing
00:12:15,00:12:22,emotion to each other so there's a guy a neuroscientist called james fallon and he was he'd worked out what
00:12:22,00:12:26,people's brains look like if they're certain types of people and he worked out what's a psychopath's
00:12:26,00:12:33,brains look like and he had a load of different brain scans next to him and he saw one that definitely
00:12:33,00:12:37,looked like a psychopath and it was his own brain scan so he worked out that he was a psychopath
00:12:37,00:12:44,himself which is quite a cool thing and then did he go on a killing spree well no he's they didn't
00:12:44,00:12:48,interview with him and then he said oh you know what i'd never realised i was a psychopath until then
00:12:48,00:12:54,but then he said i'm obnoxiously competitive i won't let my grandchildren win games i'm kind of
00:12:54,00:13:02,an asshole and i do jerky things that piss people off so the clues were there falling into place
00:13:02,00:13:10,ants yawn when they wake up do they yeah yeah they do like it looks like they're yawn so they wake
00:13:10,00:13:14,up when they stretch all their legs and they open their mouth as if they are adorable as that so it's
00:13:14,00:13:19,weird how many animals do it there was a study in 1994 and i haven't been able to find anything
00:13:19,00:13:24,subsequent to that that's disproved it that found that the only vertebrates that don't yawn are
00:13:24,00:13:32,giraffes there's the 2011 ignoble prize for physiology was won by a couple of scientists who did
00:13:32,00:13:40,a study called no evidence of contagious yawning in the red-footed tortoise yeah really all psychopaths
00:13:40,00:13:46,funny fear afraid if fetuses yawn in the first trimester which i find amazing because if you think
00:13:46,00:13:51,how tiny a fetuses is in the first three months of pregnancy and it's yawning already people don't
00:13:51,00:13:57,know why are we pretty boring in there i guess there's an antidepressant called an afronil one of
00:13:57,00:14:03,the side effects of which is spontaneous orgasms triggered by yawning okay so you couldn't use the excuse
00:14:03,00:14:08,I'm too tired because it would immediately be disproved yeah they've invented a yawn activated
00:14:08,00:14:13,coffee machine which was tried out to hannersburg airport last year i think which instead of paying
00:14:13,00:14:17,you just had to go up to it and it has a facial recognition thing and if you genuinely yawned then
00:14:17,00:14:23,it gives you some coffee oh but then surely the first person does a genuine yawn everyone else in the
00:14:23,00:14:28,queue with cash yeah and they go out of business immediately yeah it's weird like something that
00:14:28,00:14:33,i've experienced for years which until looking into this fact i didn't realize was a thing is that
00:14:33,00:14:38,if i do a stand-up gig i always yawned before the gig i always like just have this
00:14:38,00:14:42,massive yawn and i just thought that's okay and that's i don't know what that is it must be a
00:14:42,00:14:47,me getting the adrenaline ready or something but it seems counterintuitive because it makes it seem
00:14:47,00:14:51,like you're tired and people if they see you yawning they're going oh you're not really that bothered
00:14:51,00:14:55,about this gig no i think it's an anxiety thing maybe it's a way of your body really wanting more
00:14:55,00:14:58,oxygen you know you hyperventilate when you're anxious yeah yeah i think maybe it's another way
00:14:58,00:15:02,for body doing that yeah they found they found that um Olympic athletes the majority of them were
00:15:02,00:15:09,yawn before their events uh concert violinists were yawned before uh concerto um they even found
00:15:09,00:15:14,there was a guy in the army who monitored um uh army special forces jumping out of planes
00:15:14,00:15:19,parachuting and they would all yawn as they would walk up to the door and he did a study on it to
00:15:19,00:15:25,see if it was like it was just like a camera though they might have been going yeah actually
00:15:25,00:15:33,sure on a mo his real name was um guy aflay which means one who yawns really that was a good link wow
00:15:33,00:15:41,as you crowbar around to that i did notice on online when i googled world's longest yawn because i
00:15:41,00:15:46,thought i bet someone's got that record i don't think anyone does have that record but all of those
00:15:46,00:15:51,kind of onion wannabe websites that are trying to write satirical news stories that seems to be the
00:15:51,00:15:58,most popular choice of news so longest yawn recorded as man realizes oasis are forming again like
00:15:58,00:16:02,and they all try and it was a recorded three minute yawn that's how boring the news of them
00:16:02,00:16:08,reforming was seems to be recorded as another article about the longest yawn it's exactly someone
00:16:08,00:16:16,needs to write that one okay time for fact number three and that is James okay my fact is the big
00:16:16,00:16:23,bang was quieter than a motorhead concert so how loud is a motorhead concert i don't really know
00:16:23,00:16:30,what they are the motorhead was uh and is a um a metal band who have a very famous lead singer
00:16:30,00:16:37,called lemmy yeah and they sung the song the ace of spades yeah they're quite loud then
00:16:37,00:16:46,yeah so they apparently reach uh regularly reach around 126 decibels and according to an article
00:16:46,00:16:52,in focus magazine that i read the other day uh the big bang was about 120 decibels really now i
00:16:52,00:16:57,don't really understand exactly what that means but i went on on the internet and had a look around
00:16:57,00:17:04,and i found this a website telescoper.wordpress.com it's a blog by a physicist and basically they've
00:17:04,00:17:09,managed to by looking at the background radiation of the universe they've managed to work out that
00:17:09,00:17:13,there were some sound waves there and they managed to work out how loud those sound waves would have
00:17:13,00:17:19,been and according to them it was about 120 decibels and well there's no one there to hear it
00:17:19,00:17:24,yes and these sound waves whether they'd be able to be heard by human ears anyway i don't know but
00:17:24,00:17:28,you know i don't pretend to be able to completely 100% understand this so i'm going to what i'm
00:17:28,00:17:34,going to do is i'm going to post a link to this guy's blog on my um twitter feed at x-shaped um people
00:17:34,00:17:40,can make their own minds up so a blue whale which is the loudest animal in existence can give
00:17:40,00:17:47,other cool that 188 decibels so that's much louder than the big bang and also loud enough to wrap to
00:17:47,00:17:53,your ear drums if you heard it in fact isn't it yeah anything a bit over 100 100 and 120 that's going
00:17:53,00:17:58,to hurt your ears yeah yeah the subject of concerts apparently one of the reasons the Beatles
00:17:58,00:18:05,stopped touring was because their concerts weren't loud enough during their 1964 tour which was their
00:18:05,00:18:09,last tour the audience was just screamed so loudly all the way through for the entire evening that
00:18:09,00:18:13,no one could hear the music and the Beatles came to the conclusion that their concerts weren't about
00:18:13,00:18:16,the music anymore and they tried all this different equipment they still can get it to work so they
00:18:16,00:18:21,decided to stop touring that was one of the reasons uh bands now have monitors on stage that play the
00:18:21,00:18:25,music back to them so they can hear their sound levels and what they sound like they didn't have
00:18:25,00:18:29,that back then so there was a really famous Beatles gig where they played it in a baseball stadium in
00:18:29,00:18:35,America where it was so loud screaming of the fans they couldn't hear themselves play so it wasn't
00:18:35,00:18:40,even that the fans couldn't hear them they couldn't hear themselves and they were just completely out of
00:18:40,00:18:46,tune the whole time yeah yeah yeah the world's loudest scream that is a British record it's held by
00:18:46,00:18:52,a lady called Jill Drake from Tentadon in Kent oh I come from there do you yeah oh you might have
00:18:52,00:19:01,heard her yeah um she set the record with 129 decibels in the year 2000 hang on she yelled
00:19:02,00:19:06,louder than the big bang motor head to be fair pretend it is a pretty awful place
00:19:06,00:19:13,and um the funny thing is that she didn't know that she was good at screaming but she was on a trip
00:19:13,00:19:18,to London when the Millennium dome was there and they just happened to be having a shouting and screaming
00:19:18,00:19:22,competition so she thought well I'm here I'm on holiday I might as well check and then she did it
00:19:22,00:19:26,and she found that she had a real skill for it and now she's got the world record
00:19:26,00:19:31,okay we skill at screaming does it like on her CV or something yeah well how is that a skill I
00:19:31,00:19:37,think Alicia the best in the world is something I seem to remember that she made the record and
00:19:37,00:19:41,just beat out the other competitor who was her twin sister is that right yeah I'm pretty sure her
00:19:41,00:19:46,twin sister is the second loudest screamer her parents must have been so sick of them yeah
00:19:46,00:19:50,the loudest noise recorded in model all the loudest noise that we know of happening in modern
00:19:50,00:19:57,history was the eruption of Krakato in 1883 and it could be well it reverberated around the world seven
00:19:57,00:20:00,times I think it could be detected on instruments going seven times around but it could be heard
00:20:00,00:20:05,three thousand miles away wow so it's an Indonesia and it could be heard in Western Australia
00:20:05,00:20:11,didn't it burst people's eardrums yeah any one within a 10 mile radius um their eardrums explode
00:20:11,00:20:18,all right that's insane yeah um I've got one motor head fact which is that yeah they recently
00:20:18,00:20:25,uh rocked so hard at a concert that one of the guys head banging uh it got a blood clot in his
00:20:25,00:20:30,brain as a result of the like absolute just head banging that was going on yeah and he survived
00:20:30,00:20:35,so it's now a it's now a mark of awesomeness both to the fan and the band that they rocked a guy so
00:20:35,00:20:41,hard that his brain spasms Kagan and Aguism there was that thing about um was it madness who I think
00:20:41,00:20:46,they did a thing at Finnsbury Park where everyone was stumping up and down so much that they caused
00:20:46,00:20:50,an earthquake and very small earthquake it might have been that that was also in a in a football stadium
00:20:50,00:20:55,in America what's it yeah yeah where they were stepping so hard at the chiefs cancity chiefs
00:20:55,00:21:00,that that happened quite recently yeah so they triggered an actual earthquake as in it was measured
00:21:00,00:21:07,it was measured yeah everyone played no no no no crazy although is the Richter is at the Richter
00:21:07,00:21:10,scale there's not so no news anymore yeah it's a moment magnitude scale now yeah but it's
00:21:10,00:21:18,pretty much yeah if anyone got any last facts they want to chuck in um so these guys called penzius and
00:21:18,00:21:23,Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1978 because they detected the cosmic fog
00:21:23,00:21:26,that's meant to be a signature of the big bang so that's what we study to work out what we think
00:21:26,00:21:31,happened in the big bang and two pigeons had to die in order for them to work this out so they had
00:21:31,00:21:38,the horn antenna to detect it and it kept on showing higher temperature than expected when they
00:21:38,00:21:42,were looking at this cosmic fog and they thought oh is it the pigeon poo in the horn antenna so they
00:21:42,00:21:47,gave the pigeon to a pigeon fancier and said take these pigeons away and pigeon fancier took them away
00:21:47,00:21:53,let them go so they returned the horn antenna nested in there again and so they shot the pigeons but
00:21:53,00:21:58,I just think if you've got two physicists and you're a pigeon fancier you go my one job is to keep
00:21:58,00:22:03,these two pigeons out of the horn antenna while these guys try to work out the universe and he
00:22:03,00:22:09,copped it up yeah but what was interesting about that was that I thought the usually these kind of
00:22:09,00:22:14,things happen to be that some of the things they discovered something amazing and it turns out to be
00:22:14,00:22:17,actually the pigeon shuttle over the equipment and ruined it and that was it it was actually the
00:22:17,00:22:20,other way around with this because they thought the pigeon and it turned out to be they discovered
00:22:20,00:22:24,the background cosmic radiation universe they just didn't realize it who was it I've
00:22:24,00:22:28,completely forgotten his name now but there was a physicist who spent years studying Venus who
00:22:28,00:22:32,looking through Venus and a telescope and he thought he was looking at canals on Venus and it turned
00:22:32,00:22:36,up he was actually he'd actually had his telescope incorrectly calibrate and he was looking at
00:22:36,00:22:41,cataracts in his eyes and the love vessels are in his eyes for years and years and we're studying these
00:22:41,00:22:45,and it's really sad actually because yeah and there's maps of Venus isn't that he drew and actually
00:22:45,00:22:49,it's a map of the inside of his own eyeball yeah that's so cool have you guys heard about the
00:22:49,00:22:55,mysterious hum apparently it a mysterious hum go greas not true though is it um well it's true
00:22:55,00:22:59,that people think it exists yeah there's a lot of people reporting that there's this low hum that's
00:22:59,00:23:04,appearing in certain bits of the planet and a lot of people are experiencing it and no one knows
00:23:04,00:23:09,where the hum is coming from is it detected on sound detecting equipment I don't know enough about it
00:23:09,00:23:15,sometimes these facts are better when you don't read into them the electromagnetic radiation
00:23:15,00:23:19,for Sun makes it noise the really interesting sound I was going to submit it for M series actually
00:23:19,00:23:24,who music um check out if you go on YouTube and type in some sounds yeah music of this first the
00:23:24,00:23:29,earth does as well there's a there's a note there's a definite note I think it fluctuates um yeah
00:23:29,00:23:35,basically anything that's anything that's vibrating will bring a noise sound the earth emits an
00:23:35,00:23:40,ear piercing combination of shrieks and whistles apparently and that's just from Tencenton
00:23:40,00:23:51,okay time to move on to our final fact and that is Alex my fact is that Pixar accidentally
00:23:51,00:23:57,deleted Toy Story 2 halfway through making it oh how how yeah okay so this is a really great story
00:23:57,00:24:02,okay so um basically everyone in Pixar there are over a hundred people working on the film at the time
00:24:02,00:24:07,um and um they all had access to the the the files at the same time it there was no sort of protection
00:24:07,00:24:11,and this was a while ago so it was quite simple computer systems someone literally just typed in
00:24:11,00:24:15,the wrong command and the computer by accident realized that they'd accidentally told the
00:24:15,00:24:19,computer to delete the whole film and that it was doing that um they then quickly sent emails around
00:24:19,00:24:24,being like shit please can someone help me I think I've just deleted Toy Story 2 um they then rang
00:24:24,00:24:29,downstairs to the place where the servers were and was they just said unplug the machine as quickly
00:24:29,00:24:33,as you can so they did so they turned it off and turned it on again which is the solution to everything
00:24:33,00:24:38,when they turned it back on they found that nearly all of the movie had been deleted oh my god um so
00:24:38,00:24:43,they started panicking and they started asking everyone does anyone have any bits of the film at home
00:24:43,00:24:46,um because apparently the whole film only took up 10 gigabytes with the the all the information
00:24:46,00:24:51,took took to make it which was still a large amount in that time but a 13 minute episode of the case
00:24:51,00:24:55,series of qi is 13 gigabytes on our server so that's you know that's more than all of the information
00:24:55,00:25:01,to render Toy Story 2 and um so that so they thought they'd lost the entire film until they remembered
00:25:01,00:25:07,that um one of their employee one of the animators was on maternity leave and had been given a computer
00:25:07,00:25:12,to work on from home which had the entire film on and it only been backed up two weeks ago so they
00:25:12,00:25:16,drove around to her house they wrapped up the computer in blankets and put it in the back of a Volvo
00:25:16,00:25:22,and drove it back to Pixar with the whole film on it and it was estimated to be worth about 100 million
00:25:22,00:25:27,dollars that computer because it it had all of the work on it was any copy i like the way you you
00:25:27,00:25:32,specified it was a Volvo as well yeah i know there's something about a Volvo isn't it it's just
00:25:32,00:25:36,known as the the hundred million dollar Volvo because it was just like everyone was just holding
00:25:36,00:25:39,the computer and they strapped it in the seat off and they were incredibly worried that it was all
00:25:39,00:25:45,gonna be destroyed. Jovey 2 miles an hour. The whole story is slightly undermined by the fact that
00:25:45,00:25:49,they finished the film and it was all fine and then Pixar decided to start again basically from scratch
00:25:49,00:25:54,because the story wasn't good enough. Yeah i love that. I love that about Pixar i think i mean that's
00:25:54,00:25:59,such a testament to their quality controls they just looked at it and said actually no let's start
00:25:59,00:26:02,again. It was their second feature film so they were really wanted to get it right so they did
00:26:02,00:26:07,redo it but even to the point where they were getting to the final product they they were going
00:26:07,00:26:11,to release it on vhs it was going to be a director vhs they weren't confident that it was going to
00:26:11,00:26:16,yeah they certainly weren't confident Billy Crystal turned down the role of voicing woody and he says
00:26:16,00:26:21,that's the biggest mistake he ever made in his career which was just a voice over all. Bill Murray was
00:26:21,00:26:26,also approached and he turned it well he didn't turn it down he missed the phone call because Bill
00:26:26,00:26:31,Murray has a system whereby he doesn't have an agent he has an answer phone message a system that
00:26:31,00:26:36,you can leave your requests for him to be in your movie on and he missed out on that phone call
00:26:36,00:26:43,that day maybe yes yes they deleted it halfway through yeah so he would have been in it and he says
00:26:43,00:26:47,that was the big regret of his career as well. Pixar are great there's that i think this might
00:26:47,00:26:53,be in the next series of qi but that lunch that the four big cheeses that Pixar had in 1994
00:26:53,00:27:00,where so it was John Lacer to Pete doctor Andrew Stanton and Joe Rand they had one lunch
00:27:00,00:27:06,and at that lunch they came up with the ideas and the rough storyline sketches for a bugs life
00:27:06,00:27:11,monster zinc finding Nemo and Wolley which just made you wonder what they did for the subsequent ten years
00:27:11,00:27:17,if that's all covered in a lunch but it takes them like six years to make a single movie
00:27:17,00:27:21,yeah it's very arduous yeah like Tom Hanks was doing the voice over for it when he was filming
00:27:21,00:27:27,sleepless in Seattle and that feels like that was 30 years ago even though it's something like 20
00:27:27,00:27:32,and you know forest gump when he was doing forest gump he was still doing the voice over for it
00:27:32,00:27:37,just doesn't feel as old as those movies are that i read this and i i don't really know enough about
00:27:37,00:27:42,films to know if it's true but he was doing philadelphia at the same time and he refused to do any
00:27:42,00:27:45,toy story bet at the same time because he didn't think he should be doing comedy voice over while
00:27:45,00:27:49,he was doing a yes that's what i read and it was in the period where he was doing philadelphia
00:27:49,00:27:54,and forest gump and he felt like these aren't the appropriate movies so what was he worried about
00:27:54,00:27:58,that he was going to accidentally be funny in the really serious yeah maybe in the middle of
00:27:58,00:28:07,philadelphia you might bring out his um you're my favorite deputy bus light he was originally called
00:28:07,00:28:13,lunar larry oh i don't know yeah he was called lunar larry and then he had a brief period as tempis
00:28:13,00:28:17,and then morph they went to bars more but there's a very famous more for ready who's the famous
00:28:17,00:28:25,more Tony Hart's little um plastic in the 70s oh really very famous maybe they found out about that
00:28:25,00:28:32,Tony Hart from heartbeat um he's the guy who invented morph yeah and he also drew the um picture for
00:28:32,00:28:39,blue peter you know the little ship yeah think and um he got a one-off flat fee of 50 pounds or
00:28:39,00:28:44,something like this but if he'd have got like just one p for every time they used it on a badge or
00:28:44,00:28:48,on something else like that he would be at multi-millionaire by now that's like i read the story
00:28:48,00:28:54,the other day about the men who designed the mcdonalds golden arches oh yeah have you have you
00:28:54,00:29:01,any idea what his name is surely that's he created one of the most iconic yeah runald yeah it wasn't
00:29:01,00:29:06,and i don't know his name either i read it but i can't remember it now but um he was offered by the
00:29:06,00:29:12,brothers that he could get a flat fee or he could have a additional royalty for every time a new
00:29:12,00:29:17,mcdonalds open and he said maldo the flat fee i can't see this going any bigger yeah on the opposite
00:29:17,00:29:20,end of the scale there's the guy who painted the mural at facebook when facebook had just started
00:29:20,00:29:25,and he was paid in facebook shares i think so he's now a multi-millionaire or something ridiculous
00:29:25,00:29:30,yeah um just heading back to toy story too quickly what i love about this fact is i love just hearing
00:29:30,00:29:35,the behind-the-scenes stories of these these kind of disasters or early stages of things that we've
00:29:35,00:29:40,become to know and love and i love just in animation generally i was i was reading up recently about
00:29:40,00:29:47,some early disney movies and um Alice in Wonderland the original early version scripts i don't know
00:29:47,00:29:50,if it was the very first one but certainly in the very early stages do you know who was the author
00:29:50,00:29:56,of the script for the animation all this hoxley really yeah he wrote a bunch of versions of it and then
00:29:56,00:30:03,it just didn't make it through into the end and also uh the uh the lion king was originally called
00:30:03,00:30:08,king of the jungle it still says on all their press uh king of the jungle you know just in the taglines
00:30:08,00:30:12,but they dropped it because they suddenly realized that there are no lions in the jungle
00:30:12,00:30:18,therefore you can't have it but it was pitched the movie was pitched itself as bambian africa meets
00:30:18,00:30:23,hamlet and it became nicknamed bamblet when they were making it it is based on hamlet isn't it i
00:30:23,00:30:28,haven't watched line yeah you can see a lot of similarities when you watch it bambi itself was going to
00:30:28,00:30:35,be uh in the scene spoiler alert where his mum get shot then it was the scene was originally going
00:30:35,00:30:40,to be bambi saw his mum get shot and saw her being dragged away by hunters and leaving behind a pool
00:30:40,00:30:44,of blood as the bloodied carcass was dragged away along the meadow and then they thought that
00:30:44,00:30:49,she that's probably disturbing enough as well on top of that as well the uh the movie who frame roger
00:30:49,00:30:54,abbot it turned out that they were going to make the killer of bambi's mother the evil guy in who
00:30:54,00:30:58,frame roger abbot and that was going to be revealed in the movie and they decided to drop that at the
00:30:58,00:31:02,last minute we just we just recorded the rest recent series the museum of curiosity and one of the
00:31:02,00:31:07,guests was Richard Williams who's the head animator yeah of course yeah yeah so one of the guests
00:31:07,00:31:11,was Richard Williams who was the main animator a really big animator and he was the main guy he
00:31:11,00:31:16,basically drew roger abbot and jeska rabbit and i was talking to him afterwards in the pub and
00:31:16,00:31:20,i was asking about all of these hidden because in roger abbot especially it's a it's a family film
00:31:20,00:31:23,but there are a lot of single frames where there's some really dark stuff going on and one of them is
00:31:23,00:31:29,jeska rabbit pulled out of a cab at one point and um and like her skirt goes up and you see
00:31:29,00:31:33,everything and there's a big controversy about this when they recently re-released the film and
00:31:33,00:31:37,basically what happened was uh Richard Williams um drew her falling out and her skirt went up a
00:31:37,00:31:41,bit but you didn't it wasn't actually explicit you didn't see anything in the 2004 i think
00:31:41,00:31:48,re-release of the film on dbd some new animators went in and made it explicit and drew some stuff there
00:31:48,00:31:52,but didn't tell anyone and Richard got the blame for it they also they also put in that movie there was
00:31:52,00:31:57,some graffiti on the wall which said for a good time this is roughly what it said for a good time
00:31:57,00:32:02,called allyson wonderland and the number that they put underneath was but the phone number of
00:32:02,00:32:07,michael isner the head of disney at the time it was his actual number and they had to subsequently
00:32:07,00:32:13,take that out as well from that movie on the subject of pornographic broadcasting um the concast is
00:32:13,00:32:16,a massive american broadcasting company and they're responsible for loads and loads of american
00:32:16,00:32:21,watching television and um they they they have a really bad history of accidentally broadcasting
00:32:21,00:32:25,hardcore pornography and really inappropriate times so one time they did it during the super bowl
00:32:25,00:32:30,about thirty seconds one another time was on uh Cartoon Network and the film was on the Disney channel
00:32:30,00:32:37,they just accidentally replaced programs with pornographic hardcore no yeah wow um i was looking at
00:32:37,00:32:42,sort of the you know tiny technical mistakes that could have had huge repercussions like the fact
00:32:42,00:32:48,that last year there was a typo in a sign outside of the Oregon teacher standards and practices
00:32:48,00:32:54,commission and the sign read Oregon teacher standards and practices commission without a d
00:32:54,00:33:00,right so just a d missing and a guy got so angry about this that he resolved to explode it with a
00:33:00,00:33:04,pressure cooker bomb and so he marched in brandishing this bomb into the teacher standards commission
00:33:04,00:33:08,said i can't believe there's a typo in this and it's outrageous i'm exploding this bomb now
00:33:08,00:33:12,went to explode at the bomb didn't explode so then he wrote furious letters to everyone and
00:33:12,00:33:17,campaigned about the fact that the bomb making instructions on the internet also riddled with typos
00:33:17,00:33:23,and it was for that reason his bomb hadn't worked so the typo caused the crisis but then it also saved
00:33:23,00:33:28,the crisis from happening so i don't know who signed you on tiny toy story fact one of the working
00:33:28,00:33:34,titles for toy story was toys in the hood with a z for toys first good catch 22 was originally going
00:33:34,00:33:40,to be called catch 11 but it was around the same time that oceans 11 the first oceans 11 came out
00:33:40,00:33:44,and so there was a concern that it was going to be confused but i remember it was called catch 18
