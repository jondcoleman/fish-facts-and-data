 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.480
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast that is coming to you today

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.880
 from the QI offices in Covert, Garden.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.520
 I am Anna Toshinsky, and I'm sitting here today

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.640
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.920
 and one Alex Edelman.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.240
 Hi, Alex.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.320
 Thanks for coming on.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.360
 Who is that other guy we used to have?

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.120
 Who?

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.280
 The other-- there was another guy.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.520
 No, it's always been three-person and one guest, doesn't it?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.080
 No, no, you're right, sorry.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.760
 OK, so once again, the three of us and our guests, Alex Edelman,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.840
 have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.960
 facts in the last seven days, and in no particular order.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.880
 Here, we go starting with--

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.680
 this is going to seem suspicious, because I'm never

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.680
 the first fact.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.920
 And yet, the day I host, we're starting with my facts.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.840
 And my fact is that in 1903, it was made illegal in Boston

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.920
 to lie down in a canoe.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.280
 That was very well known.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.360
 And I know it's subtle facts for you guys,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.480
 but for us, growing up, the real neighborhood bad boys

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.920
 would get drunk late at night and take turns lying down

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 in the canoe.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.320
 Sure, so this is not news to Bostonians, obviously.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.280
 It's a big deal.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.040
 No, this was-- this is turn of the 20th century.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.520
 And it was because there were a series of lakes that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.320
 had been created after the Charles River was damned

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.000
 about 100 years earlier.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.400
 And they became lovers' haunts, because basically,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.920
 it created all these little nooks and crannies

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.960
 in the water where you could pop in a canoe,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.320
 and you suddenly didn't have a shaperone,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.840
 and you weren't around the grownups anymore.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.880
 So you took your girlfriend, popped in a canoe,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.320
 and went and lay down sexually in it in the undergrowth.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.320
 And people caught on to the fact this was happening.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.240
 And so a law was passed in the area that said,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.480
 you weren't allowed to act rudely in canoes.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.920
 And that covered doing things like hand-holding in a canoe,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.040
 embracing and lowering your head below that bit that's

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.480
 the top of the canoe, with a bracelet.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.880
 You were forbidden from canoe-deling.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.840
 Canoe-deling.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.560
 Is that what made it to you over here?

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.400
 I've seen them.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.680
 Yeah, some people call it that.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.200
 So if you lay down in a canoe, but you were by yourself,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.120
 would that still get you in trouble?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 Well, I don't think it would, but technically,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.160
 it wasn't what we'd done.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.600
 And it was a $20 fine, wasn't it?

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.400
 Yes.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.720
 But I read somewhere that that was about $500 today.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.720
 Yeah.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.320
 So it's a more serious penalty than--

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320
 Yeah.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.480
 Is it still in effect?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.600
 Well, I didn't mean that it had been withdrawn.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.480
 They only arrested people for a couple of years.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.280
 And I think people got pretty annoyed about it.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.120
 Well, basically, people stopped doing it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.880
 because cars became a thing.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.880
 And so you could get away from your shaperones

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.280
 a lot easier in a car, if you were, you know.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.800
 And did they then call that car noodling?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.960
 But all that the band meant was, as it usually would,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.680
 is that the kids started taking the piss out

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.120
 of the park rangers.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.240
 And so they had phonographs in their canoes,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.960
 which are basically like big--

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.480
 What are they called?

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.480
 Brim boxes.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.360
 That's why I can, you know, if you get an Aldi these days

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.480
 and pimp it up with a massive stereo system,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.080
 this is the equivalent in--

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.880
 Exactly.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.560
 They did that in their canoes and then blast it out,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.040
 like, lewd songs and lots of songs and stuff

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.080
 and snogged each other in front of the park rangers.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.000
 Is this tentative immorality law?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.520
 Yeah, that's exactly what it was.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.560
 People thought it was immoral.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.640
 It spread as well.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.200
 So it wasn't just in Boston.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.800
 I read that 10 years later in Minnesota,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.240
 there was a curfew.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.440
 And the police had motorized boats with spotlights.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.280
 So they would be shining them around on the water,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.360
 looking for lovers.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.200
 And also, in 1913, the following year,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.360
 the Minneapolis Parks Board vetoed all the names.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.160
 You know how these days you get a car license

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.400
 to place the band, because they look like robots.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.600
 So in 1913, there were band canoe names

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.000
 that people tried to register.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.960
 And they included things like the come-on-in kid,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.760
 the Kiss Me Quick, G-I-Love-You, Joy-Tub, Cupid's Nest,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.800
 and I would like to try it.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.400
 What a name.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.760
 I would like to try it.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.760
 Yeah.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.840
 It's funny, because there are in certain states,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.600
 there's actually--

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.680
 Maritime.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.720
 Exemptions.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.400
 Like, in Ohio, you can't be arrested on Sundays

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.640
 or the 4th of July for lesser crimes

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.200
 that you commit on a river.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.720
 Really?

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.400
 Yes.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.960
 They do not extend to cases of treason or felony.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.920
 But so if you commit treason on a river in Ohio,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.360
 on a Sunday, you should have a lot.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.240
 So yeah, the less serious crimes can be

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.680
 arrested on a Sunday or July the 4th.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.360
 Really?

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.880
 Yeah.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.080
 That's like in Scotland.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.480
 I actually-- this is one of those things

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.440
 that we were always told, because when I live in Scotland,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.480
 everyone says, when you're pissed, you're steaming.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.560
 And everyone said it was because the anti-drinking laws,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.040
 the prohibition laws, didn't apply if you took a boat out

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.320
 to sea, so everyone would just go on their steam boats.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.840
 Oh.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.320
 That doesn't sound very true.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.880
 But I haven't verified that.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.120
 Everyone had their old personal steamboats.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.720
 Exactly.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.400
 Clanked up and take the steamboat out.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.000
 Yeah.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.040
 I wonder how low-fi you can find something as a steamboat.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.800
 You're just sitting on the bike and you're working.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.640
 What are you doing?

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.280
 You're like, here's my steamboat.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.040
 Because the SS gives me quickly.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.320
 Was Boston quite famous for this?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.960
 Because there was a phrase that was banned in Boston,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.280
 which this was later on in the century.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.640
 So this was from the 1920s.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.840
 And the phrase banned in Boston became super famous,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.120
 because so much was banned.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.000
 And Boston was already into censoring so many books

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.640
 for immorality and publishers used to try to get their books

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.160
 banned in Boston, because then that was a mark of respect.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.400
 And that's an easiest place to get it banned, right?

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400
 Yeah.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.200
 Is it a very moral place, Boston now?

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.080
 Boston, yes, and no.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.160
 So Boston had a reputation throughout its history

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.840
 for being a place both of debauchery

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.160
 and a place to sort of somewhat atone for your debauchery.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.840
 So there was a very fragile piece that

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.640
 goes all the way to the end of the 1980s in an area

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.520
 called a combat zone, like a very fragile piece

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.080
 between the cedar parts of Boston,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.680
 which is what it was known for.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.800
 And the sort of like conservative side of Boston.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.120
 Is it a pot?

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.960
 It is, must be, right?

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.800
 It is a pot.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.600
 It's one of the biggest ports.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.840
 Yeah, so you're going to have a lot of sailors coming in

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.680
 and that kind of thing, right?

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.280
 If it was landlock, the tea party would

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.160
 have been very difficult at all.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.160
 Yeah.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.280
 The Boston Tea-- yeah, we're just throwing it into a pond.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.800
 They got off, actually, on the technicality,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.520
 because it was a Sunday.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.280
 And it's not technically treason.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.600
 As they poiled the tea up, steaming.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.520
 The Boston Tea Party was December 16, 1773.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.280
 It was a huge landlock day for civil disobedience,

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.040
 because it literally, I'm not getting all the way

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.040
 going back to the founding of Boston.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.240
 The police elements of Boston and the trouble making

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.960
 elements of Boston have been in this like weird alignment.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.840
 So the Boston Tea Party, when it happened,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.000
 was seen as a huge failure of that balance,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.560
 because people really were for both those things existing,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.840
 but very separately, and when the Bostonians

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.920
 start to revolt against the British,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.800
 a lot of the loyalist elements of Boston

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.320
 were really upset that this fragile piece

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.560
 between the brothels, which they like to access themselves

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.800
 and respectable society, were commingling.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.000
 And it was a real big problem for the ruling classes in Boston.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.880
 So you had the Boston massacre around the same time, didn't you?

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.360
 Yes, which is caused by a snowball fight or something.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.640
 Or there was a real problem between the two groups,

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.800
 and then one guy threw a snowball, and then it all kicked off.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.840
 There were so many different little fights in the--

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.360
 the Boston massacre was notable because the papers

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.960
 really seized on it, and there was a popular woodcutting

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.840
 that ended up proliferating in the same way.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.200
 I guess you could say the woodcutting sort of went viral,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.640
 even though it didn't strictly depict the truth.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.280
 Rival woodcuts, the free Twitter age.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.640
 It's a more fun one.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.000
 A lot of people read woodcuts today.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.840
 Exactly, yeah.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.640
 This woodcut became a meme.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.560
 What's a good meme caption for a woodcut of the Boston massacre?

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.360
 Monday, I don't know, right?

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.560
 But the thing that captured popular imagination

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.480
 was an 11-year-old boy named Christopher Sider

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.120
 who was shot in a protest in 1770, and that really kicked

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.960
 things in a high gear.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.240
 And after that, there was until the end of the revolution

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.320
 in Boston, just like a horrible place to be British,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.680
 and an absolutely horrible place to be a British loyalist.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.000
 But I thought it was lit back on with fondness

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.880
 that the heroism of you, independent Americans,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.200
 signed a throw of us respectable Englishmen.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.920
 Crazy king.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.920
 Crazy king.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.040
 But the loyalist elements of the North,

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.000
 they had a really good case until the British reacted,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.120
 and then most of the loyalists were like,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.720
 actually, there's probably not OK.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.160
 Actually, these guys are dickheads.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.600
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.560
 Just give it a run.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.480
 Yeah.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.080
 Well, something interesting about the morality movement

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.280
 in Boston, though, later on, was--

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.840
 so it was all enforced by a society called

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.680
 the Watch and Ward Society.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.920
 And this was a society that clamped down on the severe literature

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.960
 and stuff like that.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.720
 One of the driving forces behind it

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.120
 was a guy called God-free Cabo.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.280
 And he led this thing against books.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.040
 He thought we're immoral.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.840
 He thought the three musketeers was immoral.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.120
 He thought Tolstoy was a moral pervert.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.200
 He told his wife not to read George Eliot when he wasn't there.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.720
 Absolutely not.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.880
 It was dangerous.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.400
 Wow.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.200
 I used up your wife from reading that as well, James.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.760
 But this is the amazing thing about him--

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.080
 someone wrote a biography recently and uncovered

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.680
 a multiple erotic literature and letters

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.800
 that he used to send his wife all the time.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.120
 So he'd write to his wife in German, which he didn't understand

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.800
 very well.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.200
 And he wrote about how he'd had this amazing dream

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.240
 about how she'd urinated in his mouth

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.840
 and he'd greedily swallowed it.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.840
 Oh, my God.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.080
 P.S. do not read any George Eliot.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.840
 There is a divorce in the third chapter.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.640
 He'd send another letter saying he'd

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.320
 had a fantasy about her being a starving giantess

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.960
 who devoured him, hungrily.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.840
 And then he writes all this in German.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.040
 And then he switches to English.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.680
 And he says, better destroy this letter, darling.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.840
 And he just didn't know the word for urine.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.920
 Maybe in German, it's very similar to chocolate cake.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.720
 Right.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.720
 It's probably that.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.960
 That's so--

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.800
 Isn't that weird?

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.240
 No, it's almost too perfect, right?

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.560
 The sensor is like, I'm confiscating this erotic literature.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.520
 You're going to collect it.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.920
 The pages will be stuck together in a few days.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.000
 You know, that's still around the watching world society.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.720
 Is it?

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.160
 It's been-- it changed its focus in the '40s

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.720
 to focus on more socially acceptable vices

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.240
 to hate gambling and other stuff.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.280
 And then they became a criminal justice reform thing.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.320
 And they're around in like a boring bureaucratic office

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.000
 in your Boston common now, like they're--

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.280
 Still weighing in each other's mouths?

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:42.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.760
 Behind closed doors.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.400
 Which of us can honestly say we haven't written to a lover's

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.720
 wishing they were a starving giant who would throw us

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.640
 into their mouths?

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.600
 I've got some more things that are illegal in Boston.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.480
 Actually, most of these are illegal all over Massachusetts.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.000
 Oh, my gosh.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.960
 This is from article on CBS, which is strange,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.400
 but true, obscure Massachusetts laws.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:03.920
 Great stuff.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.280
 Which, normally, if we would read that,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.000
 they would all be false, but I've checked most of them

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 and they do seem to be true.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.600
 So it's illegal to sell rabbits, ducks, or chickens

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.920
 that have been dyed a different color than the natural color.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.440
 Really?

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.720
 That's like the guy that's like a fish seller in Thailand

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.800
 earlier this year who put googly eyes on his fish

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.360
 to make it like a fresher.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.320
 That's so good.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.760
 And it's illegal to sing only a portion of the Star Spangled

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.280
 Banner in public.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.640
 So once you start, you have to get all the way to the end.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.640
 I've read that.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.160
 And it says you can't.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.160
 It says, if you play it as part of a medley of any kind,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.440
 you're breaking the law.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.440
 It's chapter 264, section 9 of the Massachusetts code.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.760
 So it's a definite thing.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.280
 So you have to sing the whole thing?

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.440
 Even if you sing the first word.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.880
 And then you think better of it.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.880
 You have to keep going.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.920
 Well, people are going to want to know you can leave the question.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.120
 I would say, can you sing?

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.560
 And people are like, see what?

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.000
 Why did Don's really like, what do we sing?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.920
 Some reasons like, you need to give a full answer.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.240
 It's full of cliffhangers.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.200
 Does it-- wait, is there a last word to the Star Spangled

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.800
 Banner, which is just, yes, we can see that.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.400
 OK, on to fact number two.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.520
 And that is James' facts.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.880
 OK, my fact this week is that Henry VIII

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.840
 wants enjoyed a pudding so much that he

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.360
 awarded the woman who made it one of the monasteries

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.960
 that he just seized from the Catholic church.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.120
 This is so funny.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.360
 It's amazing.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.760
 What kind of pudding?

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.560
 It was not recounted as to what kind of pudding it was.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.600
 It's the holy grail of pudding.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.520
 When you say pudding, when you say pudding,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.400
 is it like a American, like a chocolate moose?

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:45.920
 Well, pudding.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.360
 Not like a moose, because that's a pudding.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.360
 But it's not a pudding.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.760
 And the old days of pudding was a lump of soot,

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.560
 or started with raisins, or it was a sort of discreet thing.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.200
 So when you say pudding, are we talking dessert?

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.920
 I mean, it is a kind of dessert, but more specific than that.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.920
 OK, so I'm saying so is a moose, or it's not a moose?

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.520
 Not a moose.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.600
 OK, fine.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.600
 Alaska's a much popular game.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.480
 So, yeah, basically, this is what happened.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.080
 A lot of people will know this, that Henry VIII

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.760
 dissolved the monasteries, and which meant that he took

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.760
 all of the property away from the monks and from the nuns.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.880
 And what does he do with it?

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.120
 Well, he puts it into the coffers, but also he gives a lot of it

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.600
 to his friends.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.840
 At one stage, he lost some of it in a game of cards.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.560
 Apparently, he lost the Jesus Bells of Old St. Paul's Church

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.280
 on a single throw of dice.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.400
 Oh, my God.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.720
 But, yeah, suddenly, you've got a load of monasteries.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.880
 What are you going to do with them?

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.080
 You're going to gamble with them.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.760
 Spend them on puddings.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.240
 I like to imagine that he had run out of change,

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.960
 and he just tried the pudding, and it was so good.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.120
 He said, "Oh, I haven't got anything to pay with.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.600
 I suppose you could have this."

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.600
 Sort of more inconvenient than just cash.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.200
 I don't think I'd accept monastery.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.880
 Would you not?

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.120
 If I were working a shop, no.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.320
 No, I'd just ask for the cash.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.440
 You're short-sighted.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.960
 That's what you are.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.560
 Sorry, Henry.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.560
 Do you have contact list, maybe?

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.760
 So, I found out, in fact, that links these two things

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.200
 that you've mentioned in the fact james.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.440
 Pudding and Henry VIII.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.200
 So, today, the great British Bake-Off tent

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.160
 is in a place called Welford Park in Berkshire,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.960
 and it housed a monastery before Henry VIII dissolved them.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.880
 So, today, puddings are made on the site

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.480
 of one of the dissolved monasteries.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.320
 That's amazing.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.480
 That's really good.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.960
 That's incredible.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.440
 That's really good.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.840
 How did you find that out?

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.280
 I don't know.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.560
 You could go bake goods monastery.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.360
 Yeah.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:47.080
 I was like, "You're a lot today, baby."

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.280
 Very cool.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.960
 But, yeah, sweet, sweet food, which I assumed this was,

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.400
 was a massive deal.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.720
 It suddenly took off, didn't it?

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.040
 At least for the nobles in Henry VIII's time.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.400
 And they had such impressive things.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.840
 So, it was called a void, I think, the sweet course.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.440
 So, you'd have a certain number of courses

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.560
 in your meal in the 16th century.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.080
 And the number of courses you had

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.160
 depended on your social status.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.880
 And then, the last course was a void.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.920
 And it was because you had it standing up

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.640
 while the table was cleared.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.040
 So, the servants came along and they cleared everything

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:19.880
 off the table.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.920
 And the void were your sweet things

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.080
 that you just stood up and ate.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.920
 You're kidding.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.480
 Or you went elsewhere to eat them.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.480
 Or, yeah.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.480
 I'm really interesting.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.480
 Yeah.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.480
 I would want...

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480
 That sets me on edge a bit.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.520
 I like to relax with a pudding and sit down.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.880
 Well, they want you on edge.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.880
 Henry, what do you want to edge?

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.400
 What if you just get, like, an ice cream

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.400
 when you're out in the park,

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.960
 do you have to sit down, sweet, that?

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.520
 Preferably at a table with a crockery.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.480
 [laughter]

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.160
 But yeah, it rendered the table void.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.360
 Wow.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.160
 That's unbelievable.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.360
 What, I can't believe we don't know what pudding is.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.920
 It seems like the last word of the year.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.200
 I'm so sorry.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.920
 This comes, I didn't find this in many places.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.280
 The main place I found it online

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.280
 is from Memoirs of the Court of Henry VIII,

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.360
 Vol. 2 by Catherine Thompson.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.840
 Which is a Google book, which you can only get

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.840
 a few of the pages.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.720
 I can only see a few of these pages.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.720
 I don't know.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.240
 I don't think we know what it was.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.160
 I think it was just recounted at the time.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.240
 She probably kept the recipe secret, though,

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.040
 because she doesn't want everyone getting a free monastery.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.200
 Well, here's the thing.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.880
 Henry VIII's favorite dessert was called

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.000
 "Made of honor tarts."

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.560
 No, they're not.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.400
 What?

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.800
 "Made of honor on tarts."

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.000
 Oh, it's ironic, isn't it?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.200
 It's an ironic dessert.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.760
 Yeah, made of honor tarts.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.560
 I hear that he would eat one

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.800
 and then he'd behead the next time.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.080
 Well, he just found these in a place

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.480
 on time they were served to him.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.800
 And he loved them so much that he confiscated the recipe

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.440
 and locked it in an iron box

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.320
 and announced they were for royal consumption only.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.600
 Wow.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.800
 It does sound not very true.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.120
 I haven't seen it debunks.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:54.920
 Yeah, go on.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.640
 Well, no, that's all it was.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.560
 It was just someone said this probably isn't true.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.320
 I've seen other people saying that this lady was killed

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.320
 so that she could hear that.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.840
 I've seen that debunked.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.000
 This might not be true as well.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 I mean, it has the ring of fakeness to it, doesn't it?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 And there's another story that someone from the royal household

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.760
 then snuck the recipe out

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.640
 and that's how we know it now, kind of thing.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.480
 That's cool.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.120
 But they're a bit like those, you know, those

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.320
 custer tarts you get in Portugal.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.160
 Yeah.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.320
 You know what I'm called, but they're like those.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.160
 Oh, just like that.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.400
 And he thought that was worth locking under lock and g.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.240
 I don't like those.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.320
 But a lot of people do really like them, don't they?

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.320
 I guess.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.040
 One pudding that they enjoyed in Henry VIII's time

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.160
 was eel-wrapped in marzipan.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.360
 Mm, that sounds really nice, doesn't it?

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.280
 What's the grossest dish from history

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.760
 that you guys have come across to that?

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.520
 The one that comes to my head straight away

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.040
 is son of a bitch pie, which is made

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.280
 by all of the pieces of a cow.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.440
 I've won onion.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.960
 No.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.640
 And it was like a cow by recipe

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.320
 that they used to make in America.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.600
 Son of a bitch pie?

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.800
 It sounds like a cowboy recipe.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.240
 I would love for you guys to have a day where you do it

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.320
 with a live QI podcast and cook.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.120
 Many of the dishes that you, it would be such a spectrum

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.840
 of deliciousness in terms of grotesque

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.200
 all the way to great, right?

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.880
 I don't know if a podcast of promising for three hours

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.720
 is for people like me.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.840
 Well, you do the podcast first,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.000
 and then you have it out there.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 And then you have it in the inventory.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.920
 I mean, you do facts about it.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.480
 OK, man.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.480
 What's the place?

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.320
 I think we did this when I was on a podcast long time ago

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.800
 about a finger shot, a pickled finger.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.680
 Oh, Sato cocktail.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.160
 Yes.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.160
 There's a big toe.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.160
 In some bar.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.160
 Yes.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.160
 And you have to--

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.160
 In Canada.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.160
 Yeah.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.160
 Yeah.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.480
 And you have to drink the shot, or the cocktail,

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.640
 or whatever, and then give the toe back.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.480
 But sometimes people steal it, or swallow it.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.480
 Or swallow it.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.880
 Well, also you're supposed to kiss the toe,

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.480
 so it needs to touch your lips while you're drinking the whiskey.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.480
 That's pretty disgusting.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.880
 I mean, hey, if we can bug it for the QI podcast live,

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.280
 just run away today.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.600
 I didn't realize there were so many daily accounts

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.520
 of like, tutor, court life.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.600
 And I found this thing called the Voices of Morbath.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:07.280
 And this is a priest named Christopher Triche,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.360
 who survived the religious changes of Henry the Eighth,

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.440
 Edward VI, Mary the First, and Elizabeth the First,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.600
 by sort of subtly shifting his views every time.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.040
 But in his memoirs for the Voices of Morbath,

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.360
 he expresses the most regret about the stripping

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.360
 of the monastery.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.480
 But at the time, he was like, this whole thing,

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.200
 I've been saying we should get rid of this.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.040
 Yeah, but that's exactly how it was his attitude.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.840
 And he's like, who loves Jesus?

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.880
 He's like, you're here, but he's not.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.840
 But when Mary comes along, and he's like,

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.920
 I don't know what those bastards did with my monastery,

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.760
 but I want it back.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.520
 But that's exactly what he says, that he was like,

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.600
 he was like, his righteous fury when they came for it.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.360
 And like, what whiplash you must get most of gotten,

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.440
 but it is lay of you.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.600
 I think we've all done it, though.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.400
 I've definitely made horrible missteps in a conversation,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.800
 and then found out the person I'm talking to

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.280
 has very, very different views and sort of subtly walked it back.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.840
 But to do it four times is quite impressive.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.800
 Four times of 54 years.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.680
 Oh, that's fine.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.600
 Yeah, 13 years per walk, that's fine.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.320
 I can do it in five minutes.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.040
 I once took both sides of an opposing argument

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.120
 over the course of an evening and lost the argument both times.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.120
 No.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.560
 Alex, you've got to get some more mates.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.720
 Yeah, no.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.480
 You're alone in a pub, just talking about one chance in the next.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.800
 Do you know that thing that chess players often do

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.800
 where they play multiple games of chess?

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.680
 But what they do is they play the moves that one person's

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.480
 playing against them against the other person.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.240
 So they always win at least half of the game.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:39.960
 Darren rounded that.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.120
 If 54, not to spoil Darren Brown's one of Darren Brown's

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.760
 specials, but he did that, wouldn't beat all these chess.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.600
 I was thinking you could do that in your arguments.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.120
 You could just run to the other bit of the pub

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.960
 and then just use the arguments to be used against it.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.640
 Well, that's what I tried.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.600
 I tried doing that.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.000
 Because someone made a really good argument.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.320
 I was like, you know what, you've convinced me.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.680
 And then I had the argument later on the evening

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.760
 with my new convinced opinion, and they got cream.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.960
 I've got chess facts, actually, about this fact,

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.080
 which is the Walsy, you know, cardinal Walsy,

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.760
 who was Henry VIII's right-hand man at the start.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.240
 The three killed him.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.040
 Served.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040
 The spiderwelless.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.840
 The spiderwelless.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.600
 Once served an entire chess set made of Marsy Pan

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.440
 as a dessert, which is quite impressive.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.800
 He served it to the French ambassadors when they visited.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.160
 That's a lot of heels.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.160
 I've always wanted to have a cheese chess sport game

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.400
 where all the pieces are made of different kinds of cheese.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.000
 And when you take an opponent's piece, you get to eat it.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.520
 That's only one word away from chess board and cheese board.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.080
 Exactly.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.640
 So I think this is a big commercial opportunity

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.480
 that I'm throwing away now by saying it on a podcast.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.640
 What would be your king, cheese?

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.120
 You know, the ultimate that you're going for.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.560
 It's got to be a baby bell.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.800
 It's got to be a baby bell.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.320
 No, that's crazy.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.320
 That's cheese.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.320
 That's crazy.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.320
 That's crazy.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.320
 It's smoked gouda.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.320
 Nice.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.320
 I think it's going to be a hard cheese, doesn't it?

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.320
 Like, for the king.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.320
 It's quite hard to have a player made of bread.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.320
 I would say, depending on the temperature of the room,

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.320
 you're playing again.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.320
 You might be playing really fast.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.320
 It's pretty so hard to carve.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.320
 No.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.320
 You don't see brie sculptures.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.320
 But they just have an extraordinary number of courses

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.320
 at the Tudor Dining Table.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.320
 So if there were these laws about how many you could have

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.320
 and it depended on your status, as I was saying.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.320
 So if you were a cardinal, you could have seven to nine courses.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.320
 Seven to nine dishes.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.320
 So that isn't it?

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.320
 It's enough.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.320
 If you were, let's say, a member of the Gentry class,

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.320
 you're only about three dishes.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.320
 And so you have to know what equals a dish.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.320
 And it would be a specific number of certain things.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.320
 So if you're having a swan, you only got one swan.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.320
 And that's a full dish.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.320
 If you're having chicken, you get six chickens.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.320
 If you're eating a lock, you get 12 locks.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.320
 For one person.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.320
 It's a family bucket.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.320
 I think it's for the table, yeah.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.320
 Because they have a, they had systems of trenches.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.320
 You know, they'd have a big sort of central plate

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.320
 with all the food served in that and you'd take in that.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.320
 You allow to have half a swan and maybe just six locks.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.320
 I don't, I didn't actually read into the law that much.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.320
 But I'm sure you can negotiate with your authorities if they check.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.320
 So Mark Wahlberg published his routine this week.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.320
 Did any, did either of you guys see that?

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.320
 Mark Wahlberg put his routine online.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.320
 This is, I don't want to bore you with the details.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.320
 But how about I just entertain you with the details?

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.320
 Mark wakes up at 2.30 a.m.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.320
 Then he prays for half an hour and any better pray.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.320
 Because from 3.4 to 5.15 he's working out.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.320
 It's not as last work out of the day.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.320
 Then he showers.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.320
 It is his last shower of the day.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.320
 The shower is an hour and a half long.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.320
 Then he has his first of three snacks.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.320
 The snack only takes half an hour.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.320
 And you might be like, only, yeah, because snack number two

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.320
 is from 8 to 9.30.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.320
 So that's an hour and a half for a snack.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.320
 And he would save a whole hour and a half if he just ate it in the shower.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.320
 So breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all in the schedule.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.320
 But they're not part of snack.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.320
 Mark Wahlberg spends two and a half hours of his day just eating snacks.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.320
 Wow.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.320
 By the way, my favorite detail, he does half an hour of golf during the day.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.320
 And I just like, I know, I just like to imagine him doing 18 holes

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.320
 and half an hour.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.320
 He's like a golf cart 60 miles an hour, not a fairway.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.320
 Just like, can I play through?

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.320
 I have one minute and 44 seconds to play this all of a sudden.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.320
 Here's what Mark Wahlberg eats.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.320
 I start out with steel oats, blueberries, and peanut butter for breakfast.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.320
 Then I have a protein shake, three turkey burgers, five pieces of sweet potato,

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.320
 and then it's 5.30 in the morning.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.320
 At 8 o'clock, I have 10 turkey meatballs.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.320
 At 10.30 a.m., I have a grilled chicken salad with two hard boiled eggs,

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.320
 olives, avocado, cucumber, tomato, and lettuce.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.320
 Then at 1 o'clock, I have a New York steak with green peppers at 3.30,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.320
 I have a grilled chicken with bok choy.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.320
 At 5.30, six o'clock, I have a beautiful piece of halibut,

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.320
 or cod or a sea bass with some vegetables.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.320
 Maybe some saute potatoes in bok choy.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.320
 Then I have a lot of aqua hydrate during the day, and then he goes, "That's it."

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.320
 It sounds like he's a two to nobleman.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.320
 Yeah, it really does give him an opportunity.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.320
 The amount of protein he has.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.320
 By the way, nowhere during his schedule that he's published are there any bathroom bricks?

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.320
 So that digestive system.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320
 He probably does that in the shell.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.320
 Yeah, it's an hour and a half shower.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.320
 That's why he's thinking, "Or he leans out the side of the golf guard going 70,000 hours."

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.320
 With a very stressed-out caddy.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.320
 He was like, "What are you doing?"

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:16.320
 By the way, nowhere in Marguerite's schedule was there any time allocated for work and acting,

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.320
 which I found very interesting.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.320
 I think that makes sense.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:28.320
 So it's time for fact number three that is Andes.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.320
 My fact is that dolphins in the wild have been teaching each other how to moonwalk.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.320
 Pretty cool.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.320
 To Michael Jackson's songs, or like why are they doing that?

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.320
 Not to Michael Jackson's, just the fun.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.320
 In the wilders.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.320
 In the wild.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.320
 So there was a pod of dolphins in Australia, and they are wild.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.320
 But there was one who joined them whose name was Billy.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.320
 Don't know whether.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320
 Billy Jean?

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320
 Maybe.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.320
 He's just a fish who thinks that I am one.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.320
 Sorry, if he's a wild dolphin, why has he got a name?

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.320
 Okay, so this is the thing.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.320
 Billy, I think Billy was a she.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.320
 Like Milly Piper.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.320
 Like Billy Jean.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.320
 Like Billy Jean.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:15.320
 And so Billy was rescued from a polluted harbour and kept an adolfinarium for several weeks.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.320
 And while there, she observed other dolphins doing this moonwalking trick,

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:23.320
 which is where you kind of stand on your tail and you swish back and forth really hard.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.320
 So you move backwards through the water like a moonwalk.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.320
 She wasn't taught to do it.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.320
 She just observed and started doing it herself.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:34.320
 And then when she was released in the wild, she was spotted seven years later in her pod

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.320
 and loads of them were moonwalking and loads of them were really good at it.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.320
 And others in the pod and 11 of them were spotted doing this trick.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.320
 And why I really love about it because this was actually about 10 years ago,

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.320
 this happened.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.320
 But why it's in the news at the moment is because the new generation has just stopped doing it.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.320
 Yeah.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.320
 So it's kind of something that their parents do.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320
 These are kids.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.320
 All these dolphins are now flushing now.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.320
 They're just like, but they don't do it anymore.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.320
 The dolphins are deembarious.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.320
 You're like, my dad's always moonwalking.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.320
 It's not funny when you send it through at first, I was trying to conceive of how they're doing.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.320
 I'm like, where do they get the shoes?

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.320
 There was a news about a dolphin this year, a Randy Dolphin, wasn't there?

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:16.320
 That I think came just slightly too late to get into our book of the year.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.320
 What's that book of the year?

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.320
 It's just a disdain little project we've been working on, the book of the year 2018.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.320
 But yeah, there was news this year about a Randy Dolphin who shut down an entire beach.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.320
 This was in Brittany in August, so Brittany in France.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.320
 And it was a beach in the Bay of Breast, fittingly.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:38.320
 And there's this dolphin called Zafar, with a zed, if you're wondering.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.320
 And people would go to the beach and swim with him, and they could hold onto his fin.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.320
 And he'd sort of bound around, he's very friendly.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.320
 But he wanted something in a time.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.320
 He wanted something.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.320
 And he started trying to have sex with people all the time.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.320
 There was one woman who he picked up and lifted out of the water and wouldn't let her back down.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.320
 He would rub up sexually against kayaks and other small boats.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.320
 Maybe he wanted to do some canoeodle.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.320
 So they shut down the entire beach.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.320
 They shut down the beach and not allow within 50 metres of him.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.320
 I mean, not allowed to go in the water with them.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.320
 People have really learned from jaws, haven't they?

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.320
 And that, they didn't shut down the beach for ages.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.320
 And there was a shark eating people.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.320
 Well, yeah, it was tourist season on Air Mini Island.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.320
 It's part of the industry. What's wrong with you, Andy?

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.320
 People always go after this marriage, just trying to keep his community afloat.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.320
 It's the economics of the thing.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:31.320
 Quite impressively, monkeys and macaques can teach their offspring to floss.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.320
 So on animal teaching, it's not the dance.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.320
 I don't think, although I didn't check it.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.320
 The first thing that's part of mine.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.320
 Well, they're flossing with human hair.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.320
 Does the dance involve human hair?

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.320
 I think it might just be average tooth flossing.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.320
 But yeah, I didn't even know they really flossed.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.320
 But this was first spotted in 2009 in Thailand.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.320
 And female monkeys were nicking hair of human heads or of human clothes.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.320
 And then flossing their teeth with it.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.320
 And they found they spent double the amount of time flossing

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.320
 if they were doing it in front of their children, in front of youths,

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.320
 to show them how to do it.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.320
 If my dancers said, "Do you floss?"

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.320
 And I say, "No," and he said, "Well, monkeys do dickhead."

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.320
 And I think I might do it. I think I might do it well.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.320
 I think you should change your dancers.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.320
 This is a cool thing.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.320
 Killer whales, they teach their young, you know how that move

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.320
 when they surge onto a beach and they grab a seal.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.320
 So killer whale mothers will practice with their calves.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.320
 But they first practice by surging onto a really steep beach

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.320
 so the calf can get back really easily.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.320
 And also one where there are no seals.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.320
 So it's like a driving lesson, basically.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.320
 That's so cool.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.320
 Yeah, and they do that.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.320
 And then the practice may be a slightly shallow a beach

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.320
 and it gets gradually harder.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.320
 But it's sort of the opposite of when humans are willing to drive

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.320
 because you wouldn't do the very steep hill start

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.320
 and feel quite lay on in your lessons.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.320
 Just on dolphins, they have a language.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.320
 So they talk to each other.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.320
 It's German. German.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.320
 Nice to meet you.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.320
 Click noises, isn't it?

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.320
 And noises that we can't really hear.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.320
 But the way that we know that it's a language and not random noise

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:10.320
 is they did studies on something called zips law, that z-i-p-f.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.320
 And what it is is the most common words in any language occur

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.320
 about 10 times more than the second most common,

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.320
 which occur 10 times more than the third most common.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.320
 It's not 10 times, but it's a logarithmic scale.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.320
 And they checked all of these noises that dolphins were making

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.320
 and they found that in dolphin languages,

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.320
 they have exactly the same laws as all human languages.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.320
 So the most common clicks that they make are

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.320
 a certain percentage more than the second most common.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.320
 And by doing all of this study and working that out,

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.320
 they reckon that they're going to use it to work out

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.320
 if aliens are trying to contact us.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.320
 Because if we get any kind of signals from space,

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.320
 we won't know it's a language or it just could be random.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.320
 But if we can work it out like dolphins,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.320
 then it has this kind of zips law.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.320
 That's very good.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.320
 Wow.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.320
 So does that mean that you can spot the really pretentious dolphin?

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.320
 So we're just using the extremely rare.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.320
 This word only came up once in 20 years

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.320
 and it was the dolphin and glasses over there.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.320
 Another thing about dolphins,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.320
 my favorite dolphin is Kelly the Dolphin.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.320
 And what they did was they taught these dolphins

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.320
 that if any grubbish got into their pool,

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.320
 then they could collect it and give it to their keeper

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.320
 and they would get a treat.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.320
 So whenever any tourist dropped in a piece of paper,

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.320
 they pick it up, give it to their keeper and they get a treat.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.320
 So what Kelly did was whenever someone drops in some paper,

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.320
 she would hide it at the bottom of the pool under a stone

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.320
 and then she would rip off a little bit

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.320
 and give it to her keeper and get a treat.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.320
 And then once she's got the treat,

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.320
 she'd go down and rip another little piece off

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.320
 and get loads of treats for one bit.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.320
 Oh my god.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.320
 That's smart, isn't it?

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.320
 That's nauseous what that is.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.320
 It's illegal in Boston unless it's Sunday or the 4th of July.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.320
 That's what that is.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.320
 I'm desperate to know the limits of like an animal.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.320
 Like an animal's...

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.320
 Like there were always fights about what to do with cocoa, the gorilla.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.320
 Because so cocoa, the gorilla was a gorilla

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.320
 who could communicate with people with sign language.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.320
 Yeah.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.320
 Someone wanted cocoa to write a novel and they were like,

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.320
 "No!"

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.320
 "No!"

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.320
 Who was like, "No."

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.320
 The agent, the puppet.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.320
 Coco died this year, didn't she?

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.320
 Yeah, Coco died shortly before the Edinburgh French Festival.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.320
 And I have a joke about Coco and my show

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.320
 and I lived in fear every day.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.320
 Because I would go, "Coco's a gorilla."

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.320
 And every day I lived in fear of someone going,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.320
 "Not anymore."

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.320
 She's an ex gorilla.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.320
 Yeah, luckily I didn't go to Edinburgh this year.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.320
 I had to watch a show otherwise I'd have been straight there on the front door.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.320
 No, no, you definitely would have been it.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.320
 The joke is about Coco meeting Robin Williams.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.320
 And Bob Kekolthwaiter is really good friends with Robin Williams,

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.320
 a comedian, Sami, do the joke, and said to me afterwards,

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.320
 "You know, Coco tried to have sex with Robin Williams."

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.320
 Really?

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320
 Yes.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.320
 And Coco and Robin met twice.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.320
 And the second time, Coco made a sign.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.320
 And apparently, Robin was said to the handlers.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.320
 Like, "What did Coco go to say?"

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.320
 And they're like, "Uh, Robin, let's get you like slowly moving towards the end."

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.320
 So, can we get you over here?

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.320
 So, that's a bit of a hot goss that you probably can include,

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:15.320
 'cause I've seen Bob Kekolthwaiter say it on stage, so that's really good.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:22.320
 Okay, moving on to our final fact.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.320
 And that is from Alex.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.320
 All right.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.320
 In medieval Germany, the funniest joke anyone had ever heard

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.320
 involved replacing a flower with a poo.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.320
 It still looks.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.320
 Still a little funny.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.320
 Haven't even had the full version.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.320
 All right.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.320
 So, how would it go?

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.320
 So, there's a poet named Nighthart, who is walking along,

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.320
 and he finds the first violet of spring,

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.320
 and he puts his cap over the flower to mark the spot.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.320
 And when he's gone, this guy happens by a bit of a prankster,

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.320
 and he lifts up the cap, and he picks the flower,

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.320
 and we'll say he squats down to leave his own souvenir.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.320
 And Nighthart comes back with an entire court,

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.320
 including the King Queen.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.320
 There's this big celebratory dance around the cap,

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.320
 and then with great ceremony and a plum removes it

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.320
 to reveal a fresh, steaming pile of human shit.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.320
 And it was so funny, in medieval Germany,

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.320
 that the book by Ken Jennings called Planet Funny,

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.320
 which talks about it, says,

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.320
 "And variations on the story were recycled

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.320
 in song, dance, prose, and drama, and art."

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.320
 And then in italics, he writes, "For decades."

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.320
 For a time, it was fashionable for people to replace the portraits

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:33.320
 of the saints in their homes, with paintings of the violet trick,

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.320
 which made the church really unhappy.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.320
 And yeah, it was a huge, it was a huge, huge joke that,

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.320
 and it just totally resonated,

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.320
 because maybe because we were so impressed.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.320
 Resonated. We've all been there.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.320
 It's classic, observational comedy.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.320
 Michael Mackenzie will be proud of that material.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.320
 So people's homes used to have portraits of feces,

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.320
 just all over the walls for a time.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.320
 Not feces, it would be night heart, pulling his cap up,

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.320
 and then there'd be the feces in it,

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.320
 and like, you know, court people with their hands over their faces,

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.320
 and stuff like that, I assume.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.320
 Yeah, that's right.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.320
 Was turned into a play.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.320
 Yeah, is it?

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.320
 Was turned into a full-on play.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320
 Wow.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.320
 Yeah, this was, I think it's the earliest non-religious drama

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.320
 of the Middle Ages that we have surviving today, this play.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.320
 No.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.320
 But it gets a bit more serious in the play, because it's a contest

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.320
 to find the first violinist to bring in the play,

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:30.320
 and there's a fanfare of trumpet as the cap is lifted up.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.320
 But when it's revealed, the villagers,

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.320
 they're all teasing night heart,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.320
 who is a knight in the story.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.320
 They take the violet and the turd,

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.320
 and they hoisted on a pole, and they dance around it.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.320
 And night heart doesn't see the funny side,

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.320
 and he cuts off the left legs of 32 of the villagers.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.320
 So they had to lean on the pole.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.320
 Wow.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.320
 Yeah, it's not taking a joke very well.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.320
 Imagine if at the Edinburgh Festival,

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.320
 you had that response when you told a bad joke.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.320
 I think there would be a higher bar to people entering within there.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.320
 But they were quite into this.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.320
 So in the 15th century, I also read about a poem

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.320
 by a guy called Heinz de Kellner,

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.320
 who baked beans were named after.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.320
 No, they weren't, but he wrote a poem about a peasant

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.320
 who outwitted a princess in this verbal duel.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.320
 And so they were having this verbal duel

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.320
 with a bantering back and forth,

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320
 which sounds quite funny anyway,

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.320
 and they're trying to outwit each other.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.320
 And then she says that his material is utter shit,

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:31.320
 and he lifts up his hat to reveal an actual poo underneath it

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.320
 on his head, which apparently proved she was correct

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.320
 and meant that she had to marry him.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.320
 Oh, he had to marry him.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.320
 So that's a variation I'm...

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.320
 That's a variation.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.320
 Yeah, what a relief for him

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.320
 that she said your material is utter shit.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.320
 Because she never says it.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.320
 But he probably, his whole life, he had this poo on his head,

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.320
 and he was just waiting for that one moment.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.320
 Right?

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.320
 Very old poo by that point.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.320
 And she had to marry him.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.320
 I think this never say to any comedian,

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.320
 especially while wearing a hat.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.320
 The material shit, because you might...

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.320
 I don't have any to marry them, I think.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.320
 Oh my god, that's...

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.320
 Yeah, how do you do me?

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.320
 You're not going to like this.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.320
 That I was just looking up sort of other German comedy

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.320
 from the Middle Ages.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.320
 So there was a play called "Dull Cityus",

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.320
 which is an adaptation of a Roman play,

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.320
 and it involves a governor who's got three virgins locked

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:31.320
 in a pantry, and he wants to kind of caress them.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.320
 But he goes in the pantry, and it's all dark in there,

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.320
 and he keeps on molesting various kitchen utensils,

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.320
 thinking that they're the young women,

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.320
 thinking implausibly that they're the young women who...

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.320
 One of these do sound kind of funny.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.320
 They're kind of not really funny.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.320
 I think a lot of this stuff that...

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.320
 Fad comedy, or comedy fads,

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.320
 they're all mechanisms to relieve tension.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.320
 Like, this is probably so funny,

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.320
 because of the dour culture around, you know,

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.320
 being alive in 14th century Germany

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.320
 didn't encourage this kind of irreverence.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.320
 And like, I got a really funny joke from this joke,

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.320
 absolutely swept through 1968 Egypt.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.320
 Which was, a man narrowly misses a bus,

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.320
 takes off down the street in pursuit.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.320
 He's so fast that he catches up with the bus

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.320
 at the end of the Block-and-Homp subordinate.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.320
 The conductor, seeing his feet,

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.320
 only charges him half-fair.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.320
 So, here's what you need to know, apparently.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.320
 In 1967, I didn't get the joke.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.320
 I loved it if you're ready for set.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.320
 Yes, I love it.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.320
 I love the joke.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.320
 It's not gone well this year.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.320
 I didn't love the joke with an afterwards.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.320
 Well, I guess these things were all contextual.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.320
 They all killed contextually.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.320
 So, Egyptian military personnel

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.320
 got 50% off on buses on public transport.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.320
 And they had just been beaten in the '67 war

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.320
 in a way that was so bad that even in their own country,

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.320
 they sort of had like a reputation for retreating.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.320
 That was like sort of not unlike the way

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.320
 that we think about the French in like today,

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.320
 in terms of comedy.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.320
 Oh, so the bus driver sees this guy running.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.320
 And he thinks this guy is running so fast

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.320
 that the only way he could be running this fast

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.320
 is if he's a soldier in retreat.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.320
 So therefore, he gets 50% off on the bus.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.320
 But some jokes are, some jokes do seem to be quite timeless.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.320
 So that one, very specific to 1968, I guess, in Egypt.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.320
 But how about this one from the 5th century BC?

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.320
 This is from ancient Roman joke books.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.320
 So it was told it was recounted a bit later.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.320
 But it's based on the 5th century BC

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.320
 and a Macedonian king was asked by his barber,

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.320
 "How should I cut your hair?"

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.320
 So the Macedonian king was Archelaus.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.320
 And the barber asked him, "How should I cut your hair?"

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.320
 And Archelaus replied in silence.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.320
 That's attributed to Churchill, I've seen that.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.320
 And to Enoch Powell.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.320
 Oh.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.320
 But nicking it, all these classes is.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.320
 And nicking it from the Macedonian king.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.320
 Wow.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.320
 He probably nicks it from someone else.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.320
 So right.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.320
 Researching this, the thing that I found the most interesting

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.320
 was like things, I guess, comedy fads throughout history

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.320
 that had their moment and then just totally disappeared.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.320
 Like, sorry to read again.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.320
 But I do want to give credit to Ken Jennings,

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.320
 who by the way, he's written this book called Planet Funny.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.320
 And it is really funny and a really good history of comedy.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.320
 And Ken, trivia wise, could give anyone on the planet

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.320
 to run for their money because he won 74 episodes of Jeopardy in a row,

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.320
 which is $2.1 million.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.320
 But so Abraham Lincoln gathered his cabinet

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.320
 to the White House early on September 22nd, 1862.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.320
 And his Secretary of War was really annoyed

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.320
 because he had a lot of this plate at the time,

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.320
 because it was the Civil War.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.320
 And the president was reading very popular series of books

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.320
 from a really popular book by Artemis Ward,

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.320
 who was a country-fried humorist

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.320
 that sort of explored American comedy

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.320
 to London in the 1860s.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.320
 And it was sort of like the president doing anchor man quotes.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.320
 Like it was very, very popular.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.320
 And sort of hack.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.320
 And he was reading a sketch called the High-Handed Outrage at Utica

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.320
 about a traveling salesman trying to impress upstate New Yorkers

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.320
 with wax figurines of the 12 apostles.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.320
 And a local ruffian ruins his trip

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.320
 by pounding his Judas stash you all the hell

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.320
 and the fit of religious forever.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.320
 And he was laughing really loudly

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.320
 by the time he got to the end.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.320
 And Stanton says, without a single member of the cabinet joining in.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:27.320
 Undeterred the president, proceed to read a second chapter.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.320
 And Stanton said he was about to walk out when the president declared

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.320
 an end to the open mic night and got to the business at hand.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.320
 Pulling a paper from his trademark hat,

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.320
 he read to them a document he had just finished rising

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.320
 and it decided to issue the Emancipation Proclamation

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.320
 freeing every slave in the Confederacy.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.320
 Whoa.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.320
 But so he loved, so Lincoln loves.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.320
 It's amazing.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.320
 Loved Frontier humor because everyone loved Frontier humor

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.320
 but it wasn't something that people bragged about.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.320
 When Lincoln was campaigning against opponents,

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.320
 they always tried to portray him

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.320
 as someone who enjoyed jokes.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.320
 So the image of Lincoln as a Frontier'sman,

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.320
 which became its own genre of comedy,

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.320
 was actually something he spent so much of his life trying to get away from,

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.320
 like a Frontier comedy thing,

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.320
 was something that Lincoln really hated his entire life

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.320
 because it was a real political stab at him.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:19.320
 But he had the misfortune he said of being part of this cultural phase

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.320
 of like corny comedy, literally coming from the word corny

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.320
 and came from like this idea of people who liked these jokes

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.320
 as cornfed picks.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.320
 Really?

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.320
 Yeah.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:33.320
 And so comedy fads throughout history are like very, very interesting.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.320
 Yeah, really interesting.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.320
 And just back onto what's he called night heart?

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.320
 Night heart.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.320
 Yeah, so he was basically the biggest poet of his age.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:47.320
 Before that, there was a lot of poetry and a lot of stories about nights

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.320
 and stuff like that.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.320
 But he was the first one who talked about villages

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.320
 and that's why he had all this kind of scatological humour.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.320
 Is the scatological element?

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.320
 The smell, is that a big part of the comedy?

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.320
 It was a big part of their lives.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.320
 Yeah.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.320
 But Farts have always been funny as well.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.320
 You look back through over the centuries,

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.320
 people are always making fart jokes.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:11.320
 There was a really cool series of Japanese scrolls

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.320
 that were discovered about 20 years ago, I think,

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.320
 and they're from the 17th and 19th century from the Edo period.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.320
 And they are just literally pictured after picture of people having fart battles.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:24.320
 And no one knows why, but people drop their trousers

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.320
 and they're blasting these massive farts at each other.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.320
 And it shows the farts knocking people over and uprooting trees.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.320
 It shows someone sitting cross-legged on the top of two massive farts

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.320
 being tossed up at him.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.320
 It's bizarre, we don't know why.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.320
 We think that it's probably metaphorical,

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.320
 as opposed to they had incredible flashes.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.320
 Oh, nobody knows.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:51.320
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.320
 Thanks so much for listening.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.320
 We will be back again next week.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.320

 which we've just written.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.320
 Alex, you have anything to sell?

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.320
 No, I just finished my run at the cell,

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.320
 but there should be a UK tour coming up

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.320
 and some dates in the United States.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.320
 Awesome.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.320
 Do you have a website?

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.320
 I do. My website's Alex Edelmancomedy.com,

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.320
 but I prefer you following me on social media.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.320
 Okay, so do that.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.320
 We'll get a time machine, go back in time,

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.320
 watch your show at the Edinburgh Fringe.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.320
 Probably should have had you on a few months ago, shouldn't we?

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.320
 Yeah.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.320
 Give us some tickets, baby.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.320
 Sorry about that.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.320
 I want to plug one thing,

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.320
 which is the upcoming QI podcast slash meal.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:55.320
 We're not doing it.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.320
 We're not letting this go.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.320
 I'm wrapping this shit up.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.320
 You cannot edit this out.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.320
 Oh, Lord.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.320
 Okay, thanks so much for listening.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.320
 See you next week.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.320
 Goodbye.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:32.320
 (upbeat music)
