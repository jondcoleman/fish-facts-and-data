 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,480
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast that is coming to you today

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,880
 from the QI offices in Covert, Garden.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,520
 I am Anna Toshinsky, and I'm sitting here today

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,640
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,920
 and one Alex Edelman.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,240
 Hi, Alex.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,320
 Thanks for coming on.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,360
 Who is that other guy we used to have?

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,120
 Who?

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,280
 The other-- there was another guy.

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,520
 No, it's always been three-person and one guest, doesn't it?

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,160
 Oh, yeah.

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,080
 No, no, you're right, sorry.

19
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,960
 Alex Bell.

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,080
 Alex Bell.

21
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,760
 OK, so once again, the three of us and our guests, Alex Edelman,

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,840
 have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,960
 facts in the last seven days, and in no particular order.

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,880
 Here, we go starting with--

25
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,680
 this is going to seem suspicious, because I'm never

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
 the first fact.

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,920
 And yet, the day I host, we're starting with my facts.

28
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,840
 And my fact is that in 1903, it was made illegal in Boston

29
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,920
 to lie down in a canoe.

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,280
 That was very well known.

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,360
 And I know it's subtle facts for you guys,

32
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,480
 but for us, growing up, the real neighborhood bad boys

33
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,920
 would get drunk late at night and take turns lying down

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
 in the canoe.

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,800
 [LAUGHTER]

36
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,320
 Sure, so this is not news to Bostonians, obviously.

37
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,280
 It's a big deal.

38
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,040
 No, this was-- this is turn of the 20th century.

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,520
 And it was because there were a series of lakes that

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,320
 had been created after the Charles River was damned

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
 about 100 years earlier.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,400
 And they became lovers' haunts, because basically,

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,920
 it created all these little nooks and crannies

44
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,960
 in the water where you could pop in a canoe,

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,320
 and you suddenly didn't have a shaperone,

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,840
 and you weren't around the grownups anymore.

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,880
 So you took your girlfriend, popped in a canoe,

48
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,320
 and went and lay down sexually in it in the undergrowth.

49
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,320
 And people caught on to the fact this was happening.

50
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,240
 And so a law was passed in the area that said,

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,480
 you weren't allowed to act rudely in canoes.

52
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,920
 And that covered doing things like hand-holding in a canoe,

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,040
 embracing and lowering your head below that bit that's

54
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
 the top of the canoe, with a bracelet.

55
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,880
 You were forbidden from canoe-deling.

56
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,840
 Canoe-deling.

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,560
 Is that what made it to you over here?

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,400
 I've seen them.

59
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,680
 Yeah, some people call it that.

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,200
 So if you lay down in a canoe, but you were by yourself,

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,120
 would that still get you in trouble?

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
 Well, I don't think it would, but technically,

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
 it wasn't what we'd done.

64
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,600
 And it was a $20 fine, wasn't it?

65
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,400
 Yes.

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,720
 But I read somewhere that that was about $500 today.

67
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
 Yeah.

68
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,320
 So it's a more serious penalty than--

69
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
 Yeah.

70
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,480
 Is it still in effect?

71
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,600
 Well, I didn't mean that it had been withdrawn.

72
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,480
 They only arrested people for a couple of years.

73
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,280
 And I think people got pretty annoyed about it.

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,120
 Well, basically, people stopped doing it

75
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,880
 because cars became a thing.

76
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,880
 And so you could get away from your shaperones

77
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,280
 a lot easier in a car, if you were, you know.

78
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,800
 And did they then call that car noodling?

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,960
 But all that the band meant was, as it usually would,

80
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,680
 is that the kids started taking the piss out

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
 of the park rangers.

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,240
 And so they had phonographs in their canoes,

83
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,960
 which are basically like big--

84
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,480
 What are they called?

85
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
 Brim boxes.

86
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,000
 Oh, yeah.

87
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,360
 That's why I can, you know, if you get an Aldi these days

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,480
 and pimp it up with a massive stereo system,

89
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,080
 this is the equivalent in--

90
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,880
 Exactly.

91
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,560
 They did that in their canoes and then blast it out,

92
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,040
 like, lewd songs and lots of songs and stuff

93
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,080
 and snogged each other in front of the park rangers.

94
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,000
 Is this tentative immorality law?

95
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,520
 Yeah, that's exactly what it was.

96
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,560
 People thought it was immoral.

97
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,640
 It spread as well.

98
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,200
 So it wasn't just in Boston.

99
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,800
 I read that 10 years later in Minnesota,

100
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
 there was a curfew.

101
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,440
 And the police had motorized boats with spotlights.

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,280
 So they would be shining them around on the water,

103
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,360
 looking for lovers.

104
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,200
 And also, in 1913, the following year,

105
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,360
 the Minneapolis Parks Board vetoed all the names.

106
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,160
 You know how these days you get a car license

107
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,400
 to place the band, because they look like robots.

108
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,600
 So in 1913, there were band canoe names

109
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,000
 that people tried to register.

110
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,960
 And they included things like the come-on-in kid,

111
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,760
 the Kiss Me Quick, G-I-Love-You, Joy-Tub, Cupid's Nest,

112
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,800
 and I would like to try it.

113
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,600
 [LAUGHTER]

114
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,400
 What a name.

115
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,760
 I would like to try it.

116
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
 Yeah.

117
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,840
 It's funny, because there are in certain states,

118
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,600
 there's actually--

119
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,680
 Maritime.

120
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,720
 Exemptions.

121
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,400
 Like, in Ohio, you can't be arrested on Sundays

122
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,640
 or the 4th of July for lesser crimes

123
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,200
 that you commit on a river.

124
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,720
 Really?

125
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,400
 Yes.

126
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,960
 They do not extend to cases of treason or felony.

127
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,920
 But so if you commit treason on a river in Ohio,

128
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
 on a Sunday, you should have a lot.

129
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,520
 [LAUGHTER]

130
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,240
 So yeah, the less serious crimes can be

131
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,680
 arrested on a Sunday or July the 4th.

132
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,360
 Really?

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,880
 Yeah.

134
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,080
 That's like in Scotland.

135
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,480
 I actually-- this is one of those things

136
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,440
 that we were always told, because when I live in Scotland,

137
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,480
 everyone says, when you're pissed, you're steaming.

138
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,560
 And everyone said it was because the anti-drinking laws,

139
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,040
 the prohibition laws, didn't apply if you took a boat out

140
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,320
 to sea, so everyone would just go on their steam boats.

141
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,840
 Oh.

142
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,320
 That doesn't sound very true.

143
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,880
 But I haven't verified that.

144
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,120
 Everyone had their old personal steamboats.

145
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,720
 Exactly.

146
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
 Clanked up and take the steamboat out.

147
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,000
 Yeah.

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,040
 I wonder how low-fi you can find something as a steamboat.

149
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,800
 You're just sitting on the bike and you're working.

150
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
 What are you doing?

151
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,280
 You're like, here's my steamboat.

152
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,040
 Because the SS gives me quickly.

153
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,320
 Was Boston quite famous for this?

154
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,960
 Because there was a phrase that was banned in Boston,

155
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,280
 which this was later on in the century.

156
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,640
 So this was from the 1920s.

157
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,840
 And the phrase banned in Boston became super famous,

158
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,120
 because so much was banned.

159
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,000
 And Boston was already into censoring so many books

160
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,640
 for immorality and publishers used to try to get their books

161
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,160
 banned in Boston, because then that was a mark of respect.

162
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
 And that's an easiest place to get it banned, right?

163
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
 Yeah.

164
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,200
 Is it a very moral place, Boston now?

165
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,080
 Boston, yes, and no.

166
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,160
 So Boston had a reputation throughout its history

167
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,840
 for being a place both of debauchery

168
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,160
 and a place to sort of somewhat atone for your debauchery.

169
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,840
 So there was a very fragile piece that

170
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,640
 goes all the way to the end of the 1980s in an area

171
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,520
 called a combat zone, like a very fragile piece

172
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,080
 between the cedar parts of Boston,

173
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,680
 which is what it was known for.

174
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,800
 And the sort of like conservative side of Boston.

175
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,120
 Is it a pot?

176
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
 It is, must be, right?

177
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,800
 It is a pot.

178
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
 It's one of the biggest ports.

179
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,840
 Yeah, so you're going to have a lot of sailors coming in

180
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,680
 and that kind of thing, right?

181
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,280
 If it was landlock, the tea party would

182
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,160
 have been very difficult at all.

183
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
 Yeah.

184
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,280
 The Boston Tea-- yeah, we're just throwing it into a pond.

185
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,800
 They got off, actually, on the technicality,

186
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,520
 because it was a Sunday.

187
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,280
 And it's not technically treason.

188
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,600
 As they poiled the tea up, steaming.

189
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,520
 The Boston Tea Party was December 16, 1773.

190
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,280
 It was a huge landlock day for civil disobedience,

191
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,040
 because it literally, I'm not getting all the way

192
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
 going back to the founding of Boston.

193
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,240
 The police elements of Boston and the trouble making

194
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,960
 elements of Boston have been in this like weird alignment.

195
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,840
 So the Boston Tea Party, when it happened,

196
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,000
 was seen as a huge failure of that balance,

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,560
 because people really were for both those things existing,

198
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,840
 but very separately, and when the Bostonians

199
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,920
 start to revolt against the British,

200
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,800
 a lot of the loyalist elements of Boston

201
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,320
 were really upset that this fragile piece

202
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,560
 between the brothels, which they like to access themselves

203
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,800
 and respectable society, were commingling.

204
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,000
 And it was a real big problem for the ruling classes in Boston.

205
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,880
 So you had the Boston massacre around the same time, didn't you?

206
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,360
 Yes, which is caused by a snowball fight or something.

207
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,640
 Or there was a real problem between the two groups,

208
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,800
 and then one guy threw a snowball, and then it all kicked off.

209
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,840
 There were so many different little fights in the--

210
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,360
 the Boston massacre was notable because the papers

211
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,960
 really seized on it, and there was a popular woodcutting

212
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,840
 that ended up proliferating in the same way.

213
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,200
 I guess you could say the woodcutting sort of went viral,

214
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,640
 even though it didn't strictly depict the truth.

215
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,280
 Rival woodcuts, the free Twitter age.

216
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,640
 It's a more fun one.

217
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,000
 A lot of people read woodcuts today.

218
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,840
 Exactly, yeah.

219
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,640
 This woodcut became a meme.

220
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,560
 What's a good meme caption for a woodcut of the Boston massacre?

221
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,360
 Monday, I don't know, right?

222
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,560
 But the thing that captured popular imagination

223
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,480
 was an 11-year-old boy named Christopher Sider

224
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,120
 who was shot in a protest in 1770, and that really kicked

225
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,960
 things in a high gear.

226
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,240
 And after that, there was until the end of the revolution

227
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,320
 in Boston, just like a horrible place to be British,

228
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,680
 and an absolutely horrible place to be a British loyalist.

229
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,000
 But I thought it was lit back on with fondness

230
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,880
 that the heroism of you, independent Americans,

231
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,200
 signed a throw of us respectable Englishmen.

232
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,720
 Oh, yeah.

233
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,920
 Crazy king.

234
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
 Crazy king.

235
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,040
 But the loyalist elements of the North,

236
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,000
 they had a really good case until the British reacted,

237
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,120
 and then most of the loyalists were like,

238
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,720
 actually, there's probably not OK.

239
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,160
 Actually, these guys are dickheads.

240
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,600
 Yeah, absolutely.

241
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,560
 Just give it a run.

242
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,480
 Yeah.

243
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,080
 Well, something interesting about the morality movement

244
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,280
 in Boston, though, later on, was--

245
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,840
 so it was all enforced by a society called

246
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,680
 the Watch and Ward Society.

247
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,920
 And this was a society that clamped down on the severe literature

248
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,960
 and stuff like that.

249
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,720
 One of the driving forces behind it

250
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,120
 was a guy called God-free Cabo.

251
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,280
 And he led this thing against books.

252
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,040
 He thought we're immoral.

253
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,840
 He thought the three musketeers was immoral.

254
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,120
 He thought Tolstoy was a moral pervert.

255
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,200
 He told his wife not to read George Eliot when he wasn't there.

256
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,720
 Absolutely not.

257
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,880
 It was dangerous.

258
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,400
 Wow.

259
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,200
 I used up your wife from reading that as well, James.

260
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,760
 But this is the amazing thing about him--

261
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
 someone wrote a biography recently and uncovered

262
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,680
 a multiple erotic literature and letters

263
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,800
 that he used to send his wife all the time.

264
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,120
 So he'd write to his wife in German, which he didn't understand

265
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,800
 very well.

266
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
 And he wrote about how he'd had this amazing dream

267
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,240
 about how she'd urinated in his mouth

268
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,840
 and he'd greedily swallowed it.

269
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
 Oh, my God.

270
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,680
 Yeah, yeah.

271
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,080
 P.S. do not read any George Eliot.

272
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,840
 There is a divorce in the third chapter.

273
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,640
 He'd send another letter saying he'd

274
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,320
 had a fantasy about her being a starving giantess

275
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,960
 who devoured him, hungrily.

276
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,840
 And then he writes all this in German.

277
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,040
 And then he switches to English.

278
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,680
 And he says, better destroy this letter, darling.

279
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,840
 And he just didn't know the word for urine.

280
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,920
 Maybe in German, it's very similar to chocolate cake.

281
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,720
 Right.

282
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
 It's probably that.

283
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,960
 That's so--

284
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,800
 Isn't that weird?

285
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,240
 No, it's almost too perfect, right?

286
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,560
 The sensor is like, I'm confiscating this erotic literature.

287
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,520
 You're going to collect it.

288
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,920
 The pages will be stuck together in a few days.

289
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,000
 You know, that's still around the watching world society.

290
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,720
 Is it?

291
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,160
 It's been-- it changed its focus in the '40s

292
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,720
 to focus on more socially acceptable vices

293
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,240
 to hate gambling and other stuff.

294
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,280
 And then they became a criminal justice reform thing.

295
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,320
 And they're around in like a boring bureaucratic office

296
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,000
 in your Boston common now, like they're--

297
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,280
 Still weighing in each other's mouths?

298
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,800
 Oh, yeah.

299
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,760
 Behind closed doors.

300
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,400
 Which of us can honestly say we haven't written to a lover's

301
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,720
 wishing they were a starving giant who would throw us

302
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,640
 into their mouths?

303
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,600
 I've got some more things that are illegal in Boston.

304
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,480
 Actually, most of these are illegal all over Massachusetts.

305
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,000
 Oh, my gosh.

306
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,960
 This is from article on CBS, which is strange,

307
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,400
 but true, obscure Massachusetts laws.

308
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:03,920
 Great stuff.

309
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,280
 Which, normally, if we would read that,

310
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,000
 they would all be false, but I've checked most of them

311
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 and they do seem to be true.

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,600
 So it's illegal to sell rabbits, ducks, or chickens

313
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,920
 that have been dyed a different color than the natural color.

314
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,440
 Really?

315
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,720
 That's like the guy that's like a fish seller in Thailand

316
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,800
 earlier this year who put googly eyes on his fish

317
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,360
 to make it like a fresher.

318
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,320
 That's so good.

319
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,760
 And it's illegal to sing only a portion of the Star Spangled

320
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,280
 Banner in public.

321
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,640
 So once you start, you have to get all the way to the end.

322
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
 I've read that.

323
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,160
 And it says you can't.

324
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,160
 It says, if you play it as part of a medley of any kind,

325
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,440
 you're breaking the law.

326
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,440
 It's chapter 264, section 9 of the Massachusetts code.

327
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,760
 So it's a definite thing.

328
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,280
 So you have to sing the whole thing?

329
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,440
 Even if you sing the first word.

330
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,880
 And then you think better of it.

331
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
 You have to keep going.

332
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,920
 Well, people are going to want to know you can leave the question.

333
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,120
 I would say, can you sing?

334
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,560
 And people are like, see what?

335
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,000
 Why did Don's really like, what do we sing?

336
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,920
 Some reasons like, you need to give a full answer.

337
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,240
 It's full of cliffhangers.

338
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,200
 Does it-- wait, is there a last word to the Star Spangled

339
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,800
 Banner, which is just, yes, we can see that.

340
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

341
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,400
 OK, on to fact number two.

342
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,520
 And that is James' facts.

343
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,880
 OK, my fact this week is that Henry VIII

344
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,840
 wants enjoyed a pudding so much that he

345
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,360
 awarded the woman who made it one of the monasteries

346
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,960
 that he just seized from the Catholic church.

347
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,120
 This is so funny.

348
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,360
 It's amazing.

349
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,760
 What kind of pudding?

350
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,560
 It was not recounted as to what kind of pudding it was.

351
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,600
 It's the holy grail of pudding.

352
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,520
 When you say pudding, when you say pudding,

353
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,400
 is it like a American, like a chocolate moose?

354
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,920
 Well, pudding.

355
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,360
 Not like a moose, because that's a pudding.

356
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
 But it's not a pudding.

357
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,760
 And the old days of pudding was a lump of soot,

358
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,560
 or started with raisins, or it was a sort of discreet thing.

359
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,200
 So when you say pudding, are we talking dessert?

360
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,920
 I mean, it is a kind of dessert, but more specific than that.

361
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,920
 OK, so I'm saying so is a moose, or it's not a moose?

362
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,520
 Not a moose.

363
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,600
 OK, fine.

364
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
 Alaska's a much popular game.

365
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,120
 [LAUGHTER]

366
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,480
 So, yeah, basically, this is what happened.

367
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,080
 A lot of people will know this, that Henry VIII

368
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,760
 dissolved the monasteries, and which meant that he took

369
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,760
 all of the property away from the monks and from the nuns.

370
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,880
 And what does he do with it?

371
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,120
 Well, he puts it into the coffers, but also he gives a lot of it

372
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,600
 to his friends.

373
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,840
 At one stage, he lost some of it in a game of cards.

374
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,560
 Apparently, he lost the Jesus Bells of Old St. Paul's Church

375
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,280
 on a single throw of dice.

376
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,400
 Oh, my God.

377
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,720
 But, yeah, suddenly, you've got a load of monasteries.

378
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,880
 What are you going to do with them?

379
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,080
 You're going to gamble with them.

380
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,760
 Spend them on puddings.

381
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,240
 I like to imagine that he had run out of change,

382
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,960
 and he just tried the pudding, and it was so good.

383
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,120
 He said, "Oh, I haven't got anything to pay with.

384
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,600
 I suppose you could have this."

385
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,840
 [LAUGHTER]

386
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,600
 Sort of more inconvenient than just cash.

387
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
 I don't think I'd accept monastery.

388
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,880
 Would you not?

389
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,120
 If I were working a shop, no.

390
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,320
 No, I'd just ask for the cash.

391
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,440
 You're short-sighted.

392
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,960
 That's what you are.

393
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,560
 Sorry, Henry.

394
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,560
 Do you have contact list, maybe?

395
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,760
 So, I found out, in fact, that links these two things

396
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,200
 that you've mentioned in the fact james.

397
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,440
 Pudding and Henry VIII.

398
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,200
 So, today, the great British Bake-Off tent

399
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,160
 is in a place called Welford Park in Berkshire,

400
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,960
 and it housed a monastery before Henry VIII dissolved them.

401
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,880
 So, today, puddings are made on the site

402
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,480
 of one of the dissolved monasteries.

403
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,320
 That's amazing.

404
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,480
 That's really good.

405
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,960
 That's incredible.

406
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,440
 That's really good.

407
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,840
 How did you find that out?

408
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,280
 I don't know.

409
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,560
 You could go bake goods monastery.

410
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,360
 Yeah.

411
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,080
 I was like, "You're a lot today, baby."

412
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,280
 Very cool.

413
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,960
 But, yeah, sweet, sweet food, which I assumed this was,

414
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,400
 was a massive deal.

415
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,720
 It suddenly took off, didn't it?

416
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,040
 At least for the nobles in Henry VIII's time.

417
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,400
 And they had such impressive things.

418
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,840
 So, it was called a void, I think, the sweet course.

419
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,440
 So, you'd have a certain number of courses

420
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,560
 in your meal in the 16th century.

421
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,080
 And the number of courses you had

422
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,160
 depended on your social status.

423
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,880
 And then, the last course was a void.

424
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,920
 And it was because you had it standing up

425
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,640
 while the table was cleared.

426
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,040
 So, the servants came along and they cleared everything

427
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,880
 off the table.

428
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,920
 And the void were your sweet things

429
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,080
 that you just stood up and ate.

430
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,920
 You're kidding.

431
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,480
 Or you went elsewhere to eat them.

432
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
 Or, yeah.

433
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
 I'm really interesting.

434
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
 Yeah.

435
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
 I would want...

436
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
 That sets me on edge a bit.

437
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,520
 I like to relax with a pudding and sit down.

438
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,880
 Well, they want you on edge.

439
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
 Henry, what do you want to edge?

440
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,400
 What if you just get, like, an ice cream

441
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
 when you're out in the park,

442
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,960
 do you have to sit down, sweet, that?

443
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,520
 Preferably at a table with a crockery.

444
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,480
 [laughter]

445
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,160
 But yeah, it rendered the table void.

446
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,360
 Wow.

447
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,160
 That's unbelievable.

448
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,360
 What, I can't believe we don't know what pudding is.

449
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,920
 It seems like the last word of the year.

450
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,200
 I'm so sorry.

451
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,920
 This comes, I didn't find this in many places.

452
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,280
 The main place I found it online

453
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
 is from Memoirs of the Court of Henry VIII,

454
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,360
 Vol. 2 by Catherine Thompson.

455
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,840
 Which is a Google book, which you can only get

456
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
 a few of the pages.

457
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,720
 I can only see a few of these pages.

458
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
 I don't know.

459
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,240
 I don't think we know what it was.

460
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,160
 I think it was just recounted at the time.

461
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,240
 She probably kept the recipe secret, though,

462
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,040
 because she doesn't want everyone getting a free monastery.

463
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,200
 Well, here's the thing.

464
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,880
 Henry VIII's favorite dessert was called

465
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,000
 "Made of honor tarts."

466
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,560
 No, they're not.

467
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,400
 What?

468
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,800
 "Made of honor on tarts."

469
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
 Oh, it's ironic, isn't it?

470
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
 It's an ironic dessert.

471
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,760
 Yeah, made of honor tarts.

472
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,560
 I hear that he would eat one

473
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,800
 and then he'd behead the next time.

474
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,080
 Well, he just found these in a place

475
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,480
 on time they were served to him.

476
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,800
 And he loved them so much that he confiscated the recipe

477
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,440
 and locked it in an iron box

478
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,320
 and announced they were for royal consumption only.

479
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,600
 Wow.

480
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,800
 It does sound not very true.

481
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,120
 I haven't seen it debunks.

482
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,920
 Yeah, go on.

483
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,640
 Well, no, that's all it was.

484
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,560
 It was just someone said this probably isn't true.

485
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,320
 I've seen other people saying that this lady was killed

486
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
 so that she could hear that.

487
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,840
 I've seen that debunked.

488
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,000
 This might not be true as well.

489
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I mean, it has the ring of fakeness to it, doesn't it?

490
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 And there's another story that someone from the royal household

491
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,760
 then snuck the recipe out

492
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,640
 and that's how we know it now, kind of thing.

493
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,480
 That's cool.

494
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,120
 But they're a bit like those, you know, those

495
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,320
 custer tarts you get in Portugal.

496
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,160
 Yeah.

497
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,320
 You know what I'm called, but they're like those.

498
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,160
 Oh, just like that.

499
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,400
 And he thought that was worth locking under lock and g.

500
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,240
 I don't like those.

501
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,320
 But a lot of people do really like them, don't they?

502
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
 I guess.

503
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,040
 One pudding that they enjoyed in Henry VIII's time

504
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,160
 was eel-wrapped in marzipan.

505
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,360
 Mm, that sounds really nice, doesn't it?

506
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,280
 What's the grossest dish from history

507
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,760
 that you guys have come across to that?

508
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,520
 The one that comes to my head straight away

509
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,040
 is son of a bitch pie, which is made

510
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,280
 by all of the pieces of a cow.

511
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,440
 I've won onion.

512
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,960
 No.

513
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,640
 And it was like a cow by recipe

514
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,320
 that they used to make in America.

515
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,600
 Son of a bitch pie?

516
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,800
 It sounds like a cowboy recipe.

517
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,240
 I would love for you guys to have a day where you do it

518
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,320
 with a live QI podcast and cook.

519
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,120
 Many of the dishes that you, it would be such a spectrum

520
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,840
 of deliciousness in terms of grotesque

521
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,200
 all the way to great, right?

522
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,880
 I don't know if a podcast of promising for three hours

523
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,720
 is for people like me.

524
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,840
 Well, you do the podcast first,

525
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,000
 and then you have it out there.

526
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And then you have it in the inventory.

527
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,920
 I mean, you do facts about it.

528
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,480
 OK, man.

529
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
 What's the place?

530
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,320
 I think we did this when I was on a podcast long time ago

531
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,800
 about a finger shot, a pickled finger.

532
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,680
 Oh, Sato cocktail.

533
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,160
 Yes.

534
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
 There's a big toe.

535
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
 In some bar.

536
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
 Yes.

537
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
 And you have to--

538
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
 In Canada.

539
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
 Yeah.

540
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
 Yeah.

541
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,480
 And you have to drink the shot, or the cocktail,

542
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,640
 or whatever, and then give the toe back.

543
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,480
 But sometimes people steal it, or swallow it.

544
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
 Or swallow it.

545
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,880
 Well, also you're supposed to kiss the toe,

546
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,480
 so it needs to touch your lips while you're drinking the whiskey.

547
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
 That's pretty disgusting.

548
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,880
 I mean, hey, if we can bug it for the QI podcast live,

549
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,280
 just run away today.

550
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,600
 I didn't realize there were so many daily accounts

551
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,520
 of like, tutor, court life.

552
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,600
 And I found this thing called the Voices of Morbath.

553
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,280
 And this is a priest named Christopher Triche,

554
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,360
 who survived the religious changes of Henry the Eighth,

555
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,440
 Edward VI, Mary the First, and Elizabeth the First,

556
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,600
 by sort of subtly shifting his views every time.

557
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,040
 But in his memoirs for the Voices of Morbath,

558
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,360
 he expresses the most regret about the stripping

559
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
 of the monastery.

560
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,480
 But at the time, he was like, this whole thing,

561
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,200
 I've been saying we should get rid of this.

562
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,040
 Yeah, but that's exactly how it was his attitude.

563
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,840
 And he's like, who loves Jesus?

564
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,880
 He's like, you're here, but he's not.

565
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,840
 But when Mary comes along, and he's like,

566
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,920
 I don't know what those bastards did with my monastery,

567
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,760
 but I want it back.

568
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,520
 But that's exactly what he says, that he was like,

569
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,600
 he was like, his righteous fury when they came for it.

570
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,360
 And like, what whiplash you must get most of gotten,

571
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,440
 but it is lay of you.

572
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,600
 I think we've all done it, though.

573
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,400
 I've definitely made horrible missteps in a conversation,

574
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,800
 and then found out the person I'm talking to

575
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,280
 has very, very different views and sort of subtly walked it back.

576
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,840
 But to do it four times is quite impressive.

577
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,800
 Four times of 54 years.

578
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,680
 Oh, that's fine.

579
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,600
 Yeah, 13 years per walk, that's fine.

580
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,320
 I can do it in five minutes.

581
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,040
 I once took both sides of an opposing argument

582
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,120
 over the course of an evening and lost the argument both times.

583
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
 No.

584
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,560
 Alex, you've got to get some more mates.

585
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,720
 Yeah, no.

586
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,480
 You're alone in a pub, just talking about one chance in the next.

587
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,800
 Do you know that thing that chess players often do

588
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
 where they play multiple games of chess?

589
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,680
 But what they do is they play the moves that one person's

590
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,480
 playing against them against the other person.

591
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,240
 So they always win at least half of the game.

592
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,960
 Darren rounded that.

593
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,120
 If 54, not to spoil Darren Brown's one of Darren Brown's

594
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,760
 specials, but he did that, wouldn't beat all these chess.

595
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
 I was thinking you could do that in your arguments.

596
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,120
 You could just run to the other bit of the pub

597
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,960
 and then just use the arguments to be used against it.

598
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,640
 Well, that's what I tried.

599
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,600
 I tried doing that.

600
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,000
 Because someone made a really good argument.

601
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,320
 I was like, you know what, you've convinced me.

602
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,680
 And then I had the argument later on the evening

603
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,760
 with my new convinced opinion, and they got cream.

604
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,960
 I've got chess facts, actually, about this fact,

605
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,080
 which is the Walsy, you know, cardinal Walsy,

606
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,760
 who was Henry VIII's right-hand man at the start.

607
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,240
 The three killed him.

608
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,040
 Served.

609
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
 The spiderwelless.

610
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,840
 The spiderwelless.

611
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,600
 Once served an entire chess set made of Marsy Pan

612
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,440
 as a dessert, which is quite impressive.

613
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,800
 He served it to the French ambassadors when they visited.

614
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,160
 That's a lot of heels.

615
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,160
 I've always wanted to have a cheese chess sport game

616
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,400
 where all the pieces are made of different kinds of cheese.

617
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,000
 And when you take an opponent's piece, you get to eat it.

618
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,520
 That's only one word away from chess board and cheese board.

619
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,080
 Exactly.

620
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,640
 So I think this is a big commercial opportunity

621
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,480
 that I'm throwing away now by saying it on a podcast.

622
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,640
 What would be your king, cheese?

623
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,120
 You know, the ultimate that you're going for.

624
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,560
 It's got to be a baby bell.

625
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,800
 It's got to be a baby bell.

626
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,320
 No, that's crazy.

627
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
 That's cheese.

628
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
 That's crazy.

629
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
 That's crazy.

630
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
 It's smoked gouda.

631
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
 Nice.

632
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
 I think it's going to be a hard cheese, doesn't it?

633
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
 Like, for the king.

634
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,320
 It's quite hard to have a player made of bread.

635
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,320
 I would say, depending on the temperature of the room,

636
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
 you're playing again.

637
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
 You might be playing really fast.

638
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
 It's pretty so hard to carve.

639
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
 No.

640
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
 You don't see brie sculptures.

641
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,320
 But they just have an extraordinary number of courses

642
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
 at the Tudor Dining Table.

643
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,320
 So if there were these laws about how many you could have

644
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,320
 and it depended on your status, as I was saying.

645
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,320
 So if you were a cardinal, you could have seven to nine courses.

646
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
 Seven to nine dishes.

647
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
 So that isn't it?

648
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
 It's enough.

649
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,320
 If you were, let's say, a member of the Gentry class,

650
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
 you're only about three dishes.

651
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
 And so you have to know what equals a dish.

652
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
 And it would be a specific number of certain things.

653
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
 So if you're having a swan, you only got one swan.

654
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
 And that's a full dish.

655
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
 If you're having chicken, you get six chickens.

656
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
 If you're eating a lock, you get 12 locks.

657
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,320
 For one person.

658
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,320
 It's a family bucket.

659
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
 I think it's for the table, yeah.

660
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,320
 Because they have a, they had systems of trenches.

661
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
 You know, they'd have a big sort of central plate

662
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
 with all the food served in that and you'd take in that.

663
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,320
 You allow to have half a swan and maybe just six locks.

664
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,320
 I don't, I didn't actually read into the law that much.

665
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,320
 But I'm sure you can negotiate with your authorities if they check.

666
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
 So Mark Wahlberg published his routine this week.

667
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
 Did any, did either of you guys see that?

668
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
 Mark Wahlberg put his routine online.

669
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
 This is, I don't want to bore you with the details.

670
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,320
 But how about I just entertain you with the details?

671
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
 Mark wakes up at 2.30 a.m.

672
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,320
 Then he prays for half an hour and any better pray.

673
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
 Because from 3.4 to 5.15 he's working out.

674
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
 It's not as last work out of the day.

675
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
 Then he showers.

676
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,320
 It is his last shower of the day.

677
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
 The shower is an hour and a half long.

678
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,320
 Then he has his first of three snacks.

679
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
 The snack only takes half an hour.

680
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,320
 And you might be like, only, yeah, because snack number two

681
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
 is from 8 to 9.30.

682
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
 So that's an hour and a half for a snack.

683
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,320
 And he would save a whole hour and a half if he just ate it in the shower.

684
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,320
 So breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all in the schedule.

685
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
 But they're not part of snack.

686
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,320
 Mark Wahlberg spends two and a half hours of his day just eating snacks.

687
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
 Wow.

688
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,320
 By the way, my favorite detail, he does half an hour of golf during the day.

689
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,320
 And I just like, I know, I just like to imagine him doing 18 holes

690
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
 and half an hour.

691
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,320
 He's like a golf cart 60 miles an hour, not a fairway.

692
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
 Just like, can I play through?

693
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,320
 I have one minute and 44 seconds to play this all of a sudden.

694
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,320
 Here's what Mark Wahlberg eats.

695
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,320
 I start out with steel oats, blueberries, and peanut butter for breakfast.

696
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,320
 Then I have a protein shake, three turkey burgers, five pieces of sweet potato,

697
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
 and then it's 5.30 in the morning.

698
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,320
 At 8 o'clock, I have 10 turkey meatballs.

699
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,320
 At 10.30 a.m., I have a grilled chicken salad with two hard boiled eggs,

700
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,320
 olives, avocado, cucumber, tomato, and lettuce.

701
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,320
 Then at 1 o'clock, I have a New York steak with green peppers at 3.30,

702
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,320
 I have a grilled chicken with bok choy.

703
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
 At 5.30, six o'clock, I have a beautiful piece of halibut,

704
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
 or cod or a sea bass with some vegetables.

705
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
 Maybe some saute potatoes in bok choy.

706
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,320
 Then I have a lot of aqua hydrate during the day, and then he goes, "That's it."

707
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,320
 It sounds like he's a two to nobleman.

708
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
 Yeah, it really does give him an opportunity.

709
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
 The amount of protein he has.

710
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,320
 By the way, nowhere during his schedule that he's published are there any bathroom bricks?

711
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
 So that digestive system.

712
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
 He probably does that in the shell.

713
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
 Yeah, it's an hour and a half shower.

714
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,320
 That's why he's thinking, "Or he leans out the side of the golf guard going 70,000 hours."

715
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,320
 With a very stressed-out caddy.

716
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,320
 He was like, "What are you doing?"

717
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,320
 By the way, nowhere in Marguerite's schedule was there any time allocated for work and acting,

718
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
 which I found very interesting.

719
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
 I think that makes sense.

720
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:28,320
 So it's time for fact number three that is Andes.

721
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,320
 My fact is that dolphins in the wild have been teaching each other how to moonwalk.

722
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,320
 Pretty cool.

723
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,320
 To Michael Jackson's songs, or like why are they doing that?

724
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
 Not to Michael Jackson's, just the fun.

725
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
 In the wilders.

726
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
 In the wild.

727
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,320
 So there was a pod of dolphins in Australia, and they are wild.

728
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,320
 But there was one who joined them whose name was Billy.

729
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
 Don't know whether.

730
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
 Billy Jean?

731
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
 Maybe.

732
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,320
 He's just a fish who thinks that I am one.

733
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,320
 Sorry, if he's a wild dolphin, why has he got a name?

734
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
 Okay, so this is the thing.

735
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
 Billy, I think Billy was a she.

736
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
 Like Milly Piper.

737
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
 Like Billy Jean.

738
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,320
 Like Billy Jean.

739
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,320
 And so Billy was rescued from a polluted harbour and kept an adolfinarium for several weeks.

740
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,320
 And while there, she observed other dolphins doing this moonwalking trick,

741
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,320
 which is where you kind of stand on your tail and you swish back and forth really hard.

742
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,320
 So you move backwards through the water like a moonwalk.

743
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
 She wasn't taught to do it.

744
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
 She just observed and started doing it herself.

745
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,320
 And then when she was released in the wild, she was spotted seven years later in her pod

746
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,320
 and loads of them were moonwalking and loads of them were really good at it.

747
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,320
 And others in the pod and 11 of them were spotted doing this trick.

748
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,320
 And why I really love about it because this was actually about 10 years ago,

749
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
 this happened.

750
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,320
 But why it's in the news at the moment is because the new generation has just stopped doing it.

751
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,320
 Yeah.

752
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
 So it's kind of something that their parents do.

753
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
 These are kids.

754
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
 All these dolphins are now flushing now.

755
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,320
 They're just like, but they don't do it anymore.

756
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
 The dolphins are deembarious.

757
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,320
 You're like, my dad's always moonwalking.

758
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,320
 It's not funny when you send it through at first, I was trying to conceive of how they're doing.

759
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,320
 I'm like, where do they get the shoes?

760
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,320
 There was a news about a dolphin this year, a Randy Dolphin, wasn't there?

761
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,320
 That I think came just slightly too late to get into our book of the year.

762
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
 What's that book of the year?

763
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,320
 It's just a disdain little project we've been working on, the book of the year 2018.

764
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,320
 But yeah, there was news this year about a Randy Dolphin who shut down an entire beach.

765
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,320
 This was in Brittany in August, so Brittany in France.

766
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,320
 And it was a beach in the Bay of Breast, fittingly.

767
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 And there's this dolphin called Zafar, with a zed, if you're wondering.

768
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,320
 And people would go to the beach and swim with him, and they could hold onto his fin.

769
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
 And he'd sort of bound around, he's very friendly.

770
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
 But he wanted something in a time.

771
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
 He wanted something.

772
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
 And he started trying to have sex with people all the time.

773
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,320
 There was one woman who he picked up and lifted out of the water and wouldn't let her back down.

774
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,320
 He would rub up sexually against kayaks and other small boats.

775
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
 Maybe he wanted to do some canoeodle.

776
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,320
 So they shut down the entire beach.

777
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,320
 They shut down the beach and not allow within 50 metres of him.

778
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,320
 I mean, not allowed to go in the water with them.

779
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
 People have really learned from jaws, haven't they?

780
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
 And that, they didn't shut down the beach for ages.

781
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
 And there was a shark eating people.

782
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,320
 Well, yeah, it was tourist season on Air Mini Island.

783
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,320
 It's part of the industry. What's wrong with you, Andy?

784
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,320
 People always go after this marriage, just trying to keep his community afloat.

785
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
 It's the economics of the thing.

786
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,320
 Quite impressively, monkeys and macaques can teach their offspring to floss.

787
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,320
 So on animal teaching, it's not the dance.

788
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
 I don't think, although I didn't check it.

789
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
 The first thing that's part of mine.

790
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
 Well, they're flossing with human hair.

791
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
 Does the dance involve human hair?

792
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,320
 I think it might just be average tooth flossing.

793
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
 But yeah, I didn't even know they really flossed.

794
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,320
 But this was first spotted in 2009 in Thailand.

795
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,320
 And female monkeys were nicking hair of human heads or of human clothes.

796
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
 And then flossing their teeth with it.

797
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
 And they found they spent double the amount of time flossing

798
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,320
 if they were doing it in front of their children, in front of youths,

799
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,320
 to show them how to do it.

800
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
 If my dancers said, "Do you floss?"

801
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,320
 And I say, "No," and he said, "Well, monkeys do dickhead."

802
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
 And I think I might do it. I think I might do it well.

803
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,320
 I think you should change your dancers.

804
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,320
 This is a cool thing.

805
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,320
 Killer whales, they teach their young, you know how that move

806
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,320
 when they surge onto a beach and they grab a seal.

807
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,320
 So killer whale mothers will practice with their calves.

808
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,320
 But they first practice by surging onto a really steep beach

809
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
 so the calf can get back really easily.

810
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
 And also one where there are no seals.

811
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
 So it's like a driving lesson, basically.

812
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
 That's so cool.

813
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
 Yeah, and they do that.

814
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,320
 And then the practice may be a slightly shallow a beach

815
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,320
 and it gets gradually harder.

816
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,320
 But it's sort of the opposite of when humans are willing to drive

817
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
 because you wouldn't do the very steep hill start

818
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,320
 and feel quite lay on in your lessons.

819
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,320
 Just on dolphins, they have a language.

820
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
 So they talk to each other.

821
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
 It's German. German.

822
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
 Nice to meet you.

823
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,320
 Click noises, isn't it?

824
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,320
 And noises that we can't really hear.

825
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,320
 But the way that we know that it's a language and not random noise

826
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,320
 is they did studies on something called zips law, that z-i-p-f.

827
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,320
 And what it is is the most common words in any language occur

828
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,320
 about 10 times more than the second most common,

829
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
 which occur 10 times more than the third most common.

830
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,320
 It's not 10 times, but it's a logarithmic scale.

831
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,320
 And they checked all of these noises that dolphins were making

832
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,320
 and they found that in dolphin languages,

833
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,320
 they have exactly the same laws as all human languages.

834
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,320
 So the most common clicks that they make are

835
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,320
 a certain percentage more than the second most common.

836
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,320
 And by doing all of this study and working that out,

837
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,320
 they reckon that they're going to use it to work out

838
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,320
 if aliens are trying to contact us.

839
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
 Because if we get any kind of signals from space,

840
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
 we won't know it's a language or it just could be random.

841
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
 But if we can work it out like dolphins,

842
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
 then it has this kind of zips law.

843
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
 That's very good.

844
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
 Wow.

845
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,320
 So does that mean that you can spot the really pretentious dolphin?

846
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,320
 So we're just using the extremely rare.

847
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,320
 This word only came up once in 20 years

848
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,320
 and it was the dolphin and glasses over there.

849
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,320
 Another thing about dolphins,

850
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,320
 my favorite dolphin is Kelly the Dolphin.

851
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,320
 And what they did was they taught these dolphins

852
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,320
 that if any grubbish got into their pool,

853
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
 then they could collect it and give it to their keeper

854
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
 and they would get a treat.

855
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,320
 So whenever any tourist dropped in a piece of paper,

856
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,320
 they pick it up, give it to their keeper and they get a treat.

857
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,320
 So what Kelly did was whenever someone drops in some paper,

858
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,320
 she would hide it at the bottom of the pool under a stone

859
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
 and then she would rip off a little bit

860
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
 and give it to her keeper and get a treat.

861
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
 And then once she's got the treat,

862
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,320
 she'd go down and rip another little piece off

863
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,320
 and get loads of treats for one bit.

864
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
 Oh my god.

865
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
 That's smart, isn't it?

866
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
 That's nauseous what that is.

867
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,320
 It's illegal in Boston unless it's Sunday or the 4th of July.

868
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,320
 That's what that is.

869
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,320
 I'm desperate to know the limits of like an animal.

870
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,320
 Like an animal's...

871
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,320
 Like there were always fights about what to do with cocoa, the gorilla.

872
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,320
 Because so cocoa, the gorilla was a gorilla

873
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,320
 who could communicate with people with sign language.

874
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
 Yeah.

875
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
 Someone wanted cocoa to write a novel and they were like,

876
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
 "No!"

877
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
 "No!"

878
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
 Who was like, "No."

879
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
 The agent, the puppet.

880
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,320
 Coco died this year, didn't she?

881
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,320
 Yeah, Coco died shortly before the Edinburgh French Festival.

882
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
 And I have a joke about Coco and my show

883
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
 and I lived in fear every day.

884
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
 Because I would go, "Coco's a gorilla."

885
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,320
 And every day I lived in fear of someone going,

886
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
 "Not anymore."

887
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
 She's an ex gorilla.

888
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
 Yeah, luckily I didn't go to Edinburgh this year.

889
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
 I had to watch a show otherwise I'd have been straight there on the front door.

890
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,320
 No, no, you definitely would have been it.

891
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
 The joke is about Coco meeting Robin Williams.

892
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,320
 And Bob Kekolthwaiter is really good friends with Robin Williams,

893
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,320
 a comedian, Sami, do the joke, and said to me afterwards,

894
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,320
 "You know, Coco tried to have sex with Robin Williams."

895
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,320
 Really?

896
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,320
 Yes.

897
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,320
 And Coco and Robin met twice.

898
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
 And the second time, Coco made a sign.

899
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,320
 And apparently, Robin was said to the handlers.

900
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
 Like, "What did Coco go to say?"

901
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,320
 And they're like, "Uh, Robin, let's get you like slowly moving towards the end."

902
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,320
 So, can we get you over here?

903
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,320
 So, that's a bit of a hot goss that you probably can include,

904
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,320
 'cause I've seen Bob Kekolthwaiter say it on stage, so that's really good.

905
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:22,320
 Okay, moving on to our final fact.

906
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
 And that is from Alex.

907
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
 All right.

908
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,320
 In medieval Germany, the funniest joke anyone had ever heard

909
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,320
 involved replacing a flower with a poo.

910
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,320
 It still looks.

911
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
 Still a little funny.

912
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
 Haven't even had the full version.

913
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
 All right.

914
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
 So, how would it go?

915
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
 So, there's a poet named Nighthart, who is walking along,

916
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
 and he finds the first violet of spring,

917
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,320
 and he puts his cap over the flower to mark the spot.

918
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,320
 And when he's gone, this guy happens by a bit of a prankster,

919
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,320
 and he lifts up the cap, and he picks the flower,

920
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,320
 and we'll say he squats down to leave his own souvenir.

921
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,320
 And Nighthart comes back with an entire court,

922
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,320
 including the King Queen.

923
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,320
 There's this big celebratory dance around the cap,

924
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,320
 and then with great ceremony and a plum removes it

925
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,320
 to reveal a fresh, steaming pile of human shit.

926
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,320
 And it was so funny, in medieval Germany,

927
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,320
 that the book by Ken Jennings called Planet Funny,

928
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
 which talks about it, says,

929
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
 "And variations on the story were recycled

930
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
 in song, dance, prose, and drama, and art."

931
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,320
 And then in italics, he writes, "For decades."

932
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,320
 For a time, it was fashionable for people to replace the portraits

933
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,320
 of the saints in their homes, with paintings of the violet trick,

934
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,320
 which made the church really unhappy.

935
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,320
 And yeah, it was a huge, it was a huge, huge joke that,

936
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,320
 and it just totally resonated,

937
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
 because maybe because we were so impressed.

938
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,320
 Resonated. We've all been there.

939
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,320
 It's classic, observational comedy.

940
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,320
 Michael Mackenzie will be proud of that material.

941
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,320
 So people's homes used to have portraits of feces,

942
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
 just all over the walls for a time.

943
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,320
 Not feces, it would be night heart, pulling his cap up,

944
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
 and then there'd be the feces in it,

945
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,320
 and like, you know, court people with their hands over their faces,

946
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
 and stuff like that, I assume.

947
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
 Yeah, that's right.

948
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,320
 Was turned into a play.

949
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,320
 Yeah, is it?

950
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
 Was turned into a full-on play.

951
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
 Wow.

952
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,320
 Yeah, this was, I think it's the earliest non-religious drama

953
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,320
 of the Middle Ages that we have surviving today, this play.

954
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
 No.

955
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,320
 But it gets a bit more serious in the play, because it's a contest

956
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
 to find the first violinist to bring in the play,

957
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,320
 and there's a fanfare of trumpet as the cap is lifted up.

958
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
 But when it's revealed, the villagers,

959
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
 they're all teasing night heart,

960
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
 who is a knight in the story.

961
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
 They take the violet and the turd,

962
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,320
 and they hoisted on a pole, and they dance around it.

963
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
 And night heart doesn't see the funny side,

964
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,320
 and he cuts off the left legs of 32 of the villagers.

965
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,320
 So they had to lean on the pole.

966
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
 Wow.

967
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,320
 Yeah, it's not taking a joke very well.

968
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,320
 Imagine if at the Edinburgh Festival,

969
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,320
 you had that response when you told a bad joke.

970
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,320
 I think there would be a higher bar to people entering within there.

971
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
 But they were quite into this.

972
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,320
 So in the 15th century, I also read about a poem

973
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
 by a guy called Heinz de Kellner,

974
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,320
 who baked beans were named after.

975
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,320
 No, they weren't, but he wrote a poem about a peasant

976
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,320
 who outwitted a princess in this verbal duel.

977
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
 And so they were having this verbal duel

978
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
 with a bantering back and forth,

979
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
 which sounds quite funny anyway,

980
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
 and they're trying to outwit each other.

981
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,320
 And then she says that his material is utter shit,

982
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,320
 and he lifts up his hat to reveal an actual poo underneath it

983
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,320
 on his head, which apparently proved she was correct

984
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
 and meant that she had to marry him.

985
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,320
 Oh, he had to marry him.

986
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,320
 So that's a variation I'm...

987
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
 That's a variation.

988
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,320
 Yeah, what a relief for him

989
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,320
 that she said your material is utter shit.

990
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,320
 Because she never says it.

991
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,320
 But he probably, his whole life, he had this poo on his head,

992
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
 and he was just waiting for that one moment.

993
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,320
 Right?

994
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,320
 Very old poo by that point.

995
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,320
 And she had to marry him.

996
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,320
 I think this never say to any comedian,

997
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
 especially while wearing a hat.

998
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
 The material shit, because you might...

999
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
 I don't have any to marry them, I think.

1000
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
 Oh my god, that's...

1001
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
 Yeah, how do you do me?

1002
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
 You're not going to like this.

1003
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,320
 That I was just looking up sort of other German comedy

1004
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
 from the Middle Ages.

1005
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,320
 So there was a play called "Dull Cityus",

1006
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,320
 which is an adaptation of a Roman play,

1007
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,320
 and it involves a governor who's got three virgins locked

1008
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,320
 in a pantry, and he wants to kind of caress them.

1009
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,320
 But he goes in the pantry, and it's all dark in there,

1010
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,320
 and he keeps on molesting various kitchen utensils,

1011
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
 thinking that they're the young women,

1012
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,320
 thinking implausibly that they're the young women who...

1013
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,320
 One of these do sound kind of funny.

1014
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
 They're kind of not really funny.

1015
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
 I think a lot of this stuff that...

1016
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,320
 Fad comedy, or comedy fads,

1017
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,320
 they're all mechanisms to relieve tension.

1018
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
 Like, this is probably so funny,

1019
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,320
 because of the dour culture around, you know,

1020
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,320
 being alive in 14th century Germany

1021
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,320
 didn't encourage this kind of irreverence.

1022
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,320
 And like, I got a really funny joke from this joke,

1023
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,320
 absolutely swept through 1968 Egypt.

1024
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,320
 Which was, a man narrowly misses a bus,

1025
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,320
 takes off down the street in pursuit.

1026
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,320
 He's so fast that he catches up with the bus

1027
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
 at the end of the Block-and-Homp subordinate.

1028
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
 The conductor, seeing his feet,

1029
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
 only charges him half-fair.

1030
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,320
 So, here's what you need to know, apparently.

1031
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,320
 In 1967, I didn't get the joke.

1032
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
 I loved it if you're ready for set.

1033
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
 Yes, I love it.

1034
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
 I love the joke.

1035
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
 It's not gone well this year.

1036
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
 I didn't love the joke with an afterwards.

1037
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,320
 Well, I guess these things were all contextual.

1038
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,320
 They all killed contextually.

1039
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,320
 So, Egyptian military personnel

1040
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,320
 got 50% off on buses on public transport.

1041
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,320
 And they had just been beaten in the '67 war

1042
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,320
 in a way that was so bad that even in their own country,

1043
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,320
 they sort of had like a reputation for retreating.

1044
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
 That was like sort of not unlike the way

1045
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,320
 that we think about the French in like today,

1046
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,320
 in terms of comedy.

1047
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
 Oh, so the bus driver sees this guy running.

1048
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,320
 And he thinks this guy is running so fast

1049
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,320
 that the only way he could be running this fast

1050
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
 is if he's a soldier in retreat.

1051
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,320
 So therefore, he gets 50% off on the bus.

1052
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,320
 But some jokes are, some jokes do seem to be quite timeless.

1053
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,320
 So that one, very specific to 1968, I guess, in Egypt.

1054
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,320
 But how about this one from the 5th century BC?

1055
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,320
 This is from ancient Roman joke books.

1056
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,320
 So it was told it was recounted a bit later.

1057
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
 But it's based on the 5th century BC

1058
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,320
 and a Macedonian king was asked by his barber,

1059
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
 "How should I cut your hair?"

1060
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
 So the Macedonian king was Archelaus.

1061
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,320
 And the barber asked him, "How should I cut your hair?"

1062
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,320
 And Archelaus replied in silence.

1063
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,320
 That's attributed to Churchill, I've seen that.

1064
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,320
 And to Enoch Powell.

1065
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
 Oh.

1066
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
 But nicking it, all these classes is.

1067
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
 And nicking it from the Macedonian king.

1068
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
 Wow.

1069
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
 He probably nicks it from someone else.

1070
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
 So right.

1071
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
 Researching this, the thing that I found the most interesting

1072
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,320
 was like things, I guess, comedy fads throughout history

1073
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,320
 that had their moment and then just totally disappeared.

1074
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,320
 Like, sorry to read again.

1075
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,320
 But I do want to give credit to Ken Jennings,

1076
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,320
 who by the way, he's written this book called Planet Funny.

1077
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,320
 And it is really funny and a really good history of comedy.

1078
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,320
 And Ken, trivia wise, could give anyone on the planet

1079
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,320
 to run for their money because he won 74 episodes of Jeopardy in a row,

1080
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
 which is $2.1 million.

1081
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
 But so Abraham Lincoln gathered his cabinet

1082
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,320
 to the White House early on September 22nd, 1862.

1083
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,320
 And his Secretary of War was really annoyed

1084
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
 because he had a lot of this plate at the time,

1085
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
 because it was the Civil War.

1086
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,320
 And the president was reading very popular series of books

1087
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,320
 from a really popular book by Artemis Ward,

1088
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,320
 who was a country-fried humorist

1089
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,320
 that sort of explored American comedy

1090
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,320
 to London in the 1860s.

1091
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,320
 And it was sort of like the president doing anchor man quotes.

1092
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
 Like it was very, very popular.

1093
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
 And sort of hack.

1094
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,320
 And he was reading a sketch called the High-Handed Outrage at Utica

1095
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,320
 about a traveling salesman trying to impress upstate New Yorkers

1096
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,320
 with wax figurines of the 12 apostles.

1097
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,320
 And a local ruffian ruins his trip

1098
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,320
 by pounding his Judas stash you all the hell

1099
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,320
 and the fit of religious forever.

1100
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,320
 And he was laughing really loudly

1101
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,320
 by the time he got to the end.

1102
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,320
 And Stanton says, without a single member of the cabinet joining in.

1103
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,320
 Undeterred the president, proceed to read a second chapter.

1104
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,320
 And Stanton said he was about to walk out when the president declared

1105
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,320
 an end to the open mic night and got to the business at hand.

1106
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
 Pulling a paper from his trademark hat,

1107
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,320
 he read to them a document he had just finished rising

1108
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,320
 and it decided to issue the Emancipation Proclamation

1109
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,320
 freeing every slave in the Confederacy.

1110
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
 Whoa.

1111
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
 But so he loved, so Lincoln loves.

1112
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
 It's amazing.

1113
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,320
 Loved Frontier humor because everyone loved Frontier humor

1114
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
 but it wasn't something that people bragged about.

1115
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
 When Lincoln was campaigning against opponents,

1116
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
 they always tried to portray him

1117
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
 as someone who enjoyed jokes.

1118
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,320
 So the image of Lincoln as a Frontier'sman,

1119
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,320
 which became its own genre of comedy,

1120
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,320
 was actually something he spent so much of his life trying to get away from,

1121
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
 like a Frontier comedy thing,

1122
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,320
 was something that Lincoln really hated his entire life

1123
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,320
 because it was a real political stab at him.

1124
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,320
 But he had the misfortune he said of being part of this cultural phase

1125
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,320
 of like corny comedy, literally coming from the word corny

1126
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,320
 and came from like this idea of people who liked these jokes

1127
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
 as cornfed picks.

1128
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
 Really?

1129
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
 Yeah.

1130
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,320
 And so comedy fads throughout history are like very, very interesting.

1131
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
 Yeah, really interesting.

1132
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,320
 And just back onto what's he called night heart?

1133
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
 Night heart.

1134
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,320
 Yeah, so he was basically the biggest poet of his age.

1135
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,320
 Before that, there was a lot of poetry and a lot of stories about nights

1136
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
 and stuff like that.

1137
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,320
 But he was the first one who talked about villages

1138
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,320
 and that's why he had all this kind of scatological humour.

1139
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
 Is the scatological element?

1140
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
 The smell, is that a big part of the comedy?

1141
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
 It was a big part of their lives.

1142
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
 Yeah.

1143
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
 But Farts have always been funny as well.

1144
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,320
 You look back through over the centuries,

1145
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
 people are always making fart jokes.

1146
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,320
 There was a really cool series of Japanese scrolls

1147
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,320
 that were discovered about 20 years ago, I think,

1148
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,320
 and they're from the 17th and 19th century from the Edo period.

1149
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,320
 And they are just literally pictured after picture of people having fart battles.

1150
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,320
 And no one knows why, but people drop their trousers

1151
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,320
 and they're blasting these massive farts at each other.

1152
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,320
 And it shows the farts knocking people over and uprooting trees.

1153
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,320
 It shows someone sitting cross-legged on the top of two massive farts

1154
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
 being tossed up at him.

1155
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
 It's bizarre, we don't know why.

1156
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,320
 We think that it's probably metaphorical,

1157
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,320
 as opposed to they had incredible flashes.

1158
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,320
 Oh, nobody knows.

1159
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:51,320
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts.

1160
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,320
 Thanks so much for listening.

1161
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,320

1175
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,320
 Alex, you have anything to sell?

1176
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,320
 No, I just finished my run at the cell,

1177
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,320
 but there should be a UK tour coming up

1178
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,320
 and some dates in the United States.

1179
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
 Awesome.

1180
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,320
 Do you have a website?

1181
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
 I do. My website's Alex Edelmancomedy.com,

1182
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,320
 but I prefer you following me on social media.

1183
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,320
 Okay, so do that.

1184
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
 We'll get a time machine, go back in time,

1185
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
 watch your show at the Edinburgh Fringe.

1186
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
 Probably should have had you on a few months ago, shouldn't we?

1187
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
 Yeah.

1188
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,320
 Give us some tickets, baby.

1189
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
 Sorry about that.

1190
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
 I want to plug one thing,

1191
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,320
 which is the upcoming QI podcast slash meal.

1192
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,320
 We're not doing it.

1193
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,320
 We're not letting this go.

1194
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,320
 I'm wrapping this shit up.

1195
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,320
 You cannot edit this out.

1196
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
 Oh, Lord.

1197
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,320
 Okay, thanks so much for listening.

1198
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,320
 See you next week.

1199
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
 Goodbye.

1200
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:32,320
 (upbeat music)
