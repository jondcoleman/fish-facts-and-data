00:00:08,00:00:16,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing"
00:00:16,00:00:20,"as a Fish, a weekly podcast that is coming to you today"
00:00:20,00:00:23,"from the QI offices in Covert, Garden."
00:00:23,00:00:26,"I am Anna Toshinsky, and I'm sitting here today"
00:00:26,00:00:28,"with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,"
00:00:28,00:00:30,and one Alex Edelman.
00:00:30,00:00:32,"Hi, Alex."
00:00:32,00:00:33,Thanks for coming on.
00:00:33,00:00:35,Who is that other guy we used to have?
00:00:35,00:00:36,Who?
00:00:36,00:00:37,The other-- there was another guy.
00:00:37,00:00:39,"No, it's always been three-person and one guest, doesn't it?"
00:00:39,00:00:40,"Oh, yeah."
00:00:40,00:00:41,"No, no, you're right, sorry."
00:00:41,00:00:41,Alex Bell.
00:00:41,00:00:43,Alex Bell.
00:00:43,00:00:46,"OK, so once again, the three of us and our guests, Alex Edelman,"
00:00:46,00:00:48,have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:48,00:00:51,"facts in the last seven days, and in no particular order."
00:00:51,00:00:54,"Here, we go starting with--"
00:00:54,00:00:56,"this is going to seem suspicious, because I'm never"
00:00:56,00:00:57,the first fact.
00:00:57,00:01:00,"And yet, the day I host, we're starting with my facts."
00:01:00,00:01:04,"And my fact is that in 1903, it was made illegal in Boston"
00:01:04,00:01:06,to lie down in a canoe.
00:01:06,00:01:08,That was very well known.
00:01:08,00:01:10,"And I know it's subtle facts for you guys,"
00:01:10,00:01:13,"but for us, growing up, the real neighborhood bad boys"
00:01:13,00:01:15,would get drunk late at night and take turns lying down
00:01:15,00:01:16,in the canoe.
00:01:16,00:01:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:19,00:01:23,"Sure, so this is not news to Bostonians, obviously."
00:01:23,00:01:24,It's a big deal.
00:01:24,00:01:27,"No, this was-- this is turn of the 20th century."
00:01:27,00:01:29,And it was because there were a series of lakes that
00:01:29,00:01:32,had been created after the Charles River was damned
00:01:32,00:01:34,about 100 years earlier.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"And they became lovers' haunts, because basically,"
00:01:36,00:01:38,it created all these little nooks and crannies
00:01:38,00:01:40,"in the water where you could pop in a canoe,"
00:01:40,00:01:42,"and you suddenly didn't have a shaperone,"
00:01:42,00:01:43,and you weren't around the grownups anymore.
00:01:43,00:01:45,"So you took your girlfriend, popped in a canoe,"
00:01:45,00:01:51,and went and lay down sexually in it in the undergrowth.
00:01:51,00:01:53,And people caught on to the fact this was happening.
00:01:53,00:01:56,"And so a law was passed in the area that said,"
00:01:56,00:01:58,you weren't allowed to act rudely in canoes.
00:01:58,00:02:01,"And that covered doing things like hand-holding in a canoe,"
00:02:01,00:02:06,embracing and lowering your head below that bit that's
00:02:06,00:02:07,"the top of the canoe, with a bracelet."
00:02:07,00:02:09,You were forbidden from canoe-deling.
00:02:09,00:02:10,Canoe-deling.
00:02:10,00:02:12,Is that what made it to you over here?
00:02:12,00:02:13,I've seen them.
00:02:13,00:02:15,"Yeah, some people call it that."
00:02:15,00:02:19,"So if you lay down in a canoe, but you were by yourself,"
00:02:19,00:02:21,would that still get you in trouble?
00:02:21,00:02:23,"Well, I don't think it would, but technically,"
00:02:23,00:02:24,it wasn't what we'd done.
00:02:24,00:02:25,"And it was a $20 fine, wasn't it?"
00:02:25,00:02:26,Yes.
00:02:26,00:02:29,But I read somewhere that that was about $500 today.
00:02:29,00:02:30,Yeah.
00:02:30,00:02:32,So it's a more serious penalty than--
00:02:32,00:02:33,Yeah.
00:02:33,00:02:35,Is it still in effect?
00:02:35,00:02:37,"Well, I didn't mean that it had been withdrawn."
00:02:37,00:02:39,They only arrested people for a couple of years.
00:02:39,00:02:41,And I think people got pretty annoyed about it.
00:02:41,00:02:43,"Well, basically, people stopped doing it"
00:02:43,00:02:44,because cars became a thing.
00:02:44,00:02:46,And so you could get away from your shaperones
00:02:46,00:02:50,"a lot easier in a car, if you were, you know."
00:02:50,00:02:54,And did they then call that car noodling?
00:02:54,00:02:57,"But all that the band meant was, as it usually would,"
00:02:57,00:02:59,is that the kids started taking the piss out
00:02:59,00:03:01,of the park rangers.
00:03:01,00:03:03,"And so they had phonographs in their canoes,"
00:03:03,00:03:04,which are basically like big--
00:03:04,00:03:05,What are they called?
00:03:05,00:03:06,Brim boxes.
00:03:06,00:03:07,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:07,00:03:09,"That's why I can, you know, if you get an Aldi these days"
00:03:09,00:03:11,"and pimp it up with a massive stereo system,"
00:03:11,00:03:13,this is the equivalent in--
00:03:13,00:03:13,Exactly.
00:03:13,00:03:15,"They did that in their canoes and then blast it out,"
00:03:15,00:03:18,"like, lewd songs and lots of songs and stuff"
00:03:18,00:03:21,and snogged each other in front of the park rangers.
00:03:21,00:03:23,Is this tentative immorality law?
00:03:23,00:03:24,"Yeah, that's exactly what it was."
00:03:24,00:03:26,People thought it was immoral.
00:03:26,00:03:27,It spread as well.
00:03:27,00:03:29,So it wasn't just in Boston.
00:03:29,00:03:31,"I read that 10 years later in Minnesota,"
00:03:31,00:03:33,there was a curfew.
00:03:33,00:03:35,And the police had motorized boats with spotlights.
00:03:35,00:03:37,"So they would be shining them around on the water,"
00:03:37,00:03:38,looking for lovers.
00:03:38,00:03:41,"And also, in 1913, the following year,"
00:03:41,00:03:44,the Minneapolis Parks Board vetoed all the names.
00:03:44,00:03:47,You know how these days you get a car license
00:03:47,00:03:49,"to place the band, because they look like robots."
00:03:49,00:03:53,"So in 1913, there were band canoe names"
00:03:53,00:03:55,that people tried to register.
00:03:55,00:03:58,"And they included things like the come-on-in kid,"
00:03:58,00:04:04,"the Kiss Me Quick, G-I-Love-You, Joy-Tub, Cupid's Nest,"
00:04:04,00:04:06,and I would like to try it.
00:04:06,00:04:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:08,00:04:09,What a name.
00:04:09,00:04:10,I would like to try it.
00:04:10,00:04:11,Yeah.
00:04:11,00:04:14,"It's funny, because there are in certain states,"
00:04:14,00:04:15,there's actually--
00:04:15,00:04:16,Maritime.
00:04:16,00:04:17,Exemptions.
00:04:17,00:04:21,"Like, in Ohio, you can't be arrested on Sundays"
00:04:21,00:04:23,or the 4th of July for lesser crimes
00:04:23,00:04:25,that you commit on a river.
00:04:25,00:04:25,Really?
00:04:25,00:04:26,Yes.
00:04:26,00:04:29,They do not extend to cases of treason or felony.
00:04:29,00:04:32,"But so if you commit treason on a river in Ohio,"
00:04:32,00:04:34,"on a Sunday, you should have a lot."
00:04:34,00:04:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:36,00:04:38,"So yeah, the less serious crimes can be"
00:04:38,00:04:40,arrested on a Sunday or July the 4th.
00:04:40,00:04:41,Really?
00:04:41,00:04:41,Yeah.
00:04:41,00:04:44,That's like in Scotland.
00:04:44,00:04:45,I actually-- this is one of those things
00:04:45,00:04:47,"that we were always told, because when I live in Scotland,"
00:04:47,00:04:49,"everyone says, when you're pissed, you're steaming."
00:04:49,00:04:53,"And everyone said it was because the anti-drinking laws,"
00:04:53,00:04:56,"the prohibition laws, didn't apply if you took a boat out"
00:04:56,00:04:58,"to sea, so everyone would just go on their steam boats."
00:04:58,00:04:58,Oh.
00:04:58,00:05:00,That doesn't sound very true.
00:05:00,00:05:01,But I haven't verified that.
00:05:01,00:05:04,Everyone had their old personal steamboats.
00:05:04,00:05:04,Exactly.
00:05:04,00:05:06,Clanked up and take the steamboat out.
00:05:06,00:05:07,Yeah.
00:05:07,00:05:11,I wonder how low-fi you can find something as a steamboat.
00:05:11,00:05:13,You're just sitting on the bike and you're working.
00:05:13,00:05:14,What are you doing?
00:05:14,00:05:16,"You're like, here's my steamboat."
00:05:16,00:05:20,Because the SS gives me quickly.
00:05:20,00:05:22,Was Boston quite famous for this?
00:05:22,00:05:24,"Because there was a phrase that was banned in Boston,"
00:05:24,00:05:27,which this was later on in the century.
00:05:27,00:05:28,So this was from the 1920s.
00:05:28,00:05:30,"And the phrase banned in Boston became super famous,"
00:05:30,00:05:32,because so much was banned.
00:05:32,00:05:35,And Boston was already into censoring so many books
00:05:35,00:05:39,for immorality and publishers used to try to get their books
00:05:39,00:05:42,"banned in Boston, because then that was a mark of respect."
00:05:42,00:05:44,"And that's an easiest place to get it banned, right?"
00:05:44,00:05:45,Yeah.
00:05:45,00:05:47,"Is it a very moral place, Boston now?"
00:05:47,00:05:49,"Boston, yes, and no."
00:05:49,00:05:53,So Boston had a reputation throughout its history
00:05:53,00:05:55,for being a place both of debauchery
00:05:55,00:05:59,and a place to sort of somewhat atone for your debauchery.
00:05:59,00:06:00,So there was a very fragile piece that
00:06:00,00:06:03,goes all the way to the end of the 1980s in an area
00:06:03,00:06:06,"called a combat zone, like a very fragile piece"
00:06:06,00:06:09,"between the cedar parts of Boston,"
00:06:09,00:06:10,which is what it was known for.
00:06:10,00:06:13,And the sort of like conservative side of Boston.
00:06:13,00:06:15,Is it a pot?
00:06:15,00:06:15,"It is, must be, right?"
00:06:15,00:06:16,It is a pot.
00:06:16,00:06:17,It's one of the biggest ports.
00:06:17,00:06:19,"Yeah, so you're going to have a lot of sailors coming in"
00:06:19,00:06:20,"and that kind of thing, right?"
00:06:20,00:06:22,"If it was landlock, the tea party would"
00:06:22,00:06:24,have been very difficult at all.
00:06:24,00:06:25,Yeah.
00:06:25,00:06:28,"The Boston Tea-- yeah, we're just throwing it into a pond."
00:06:28,00:06:29,"They got off, actually, on the technicality,"
00:06:29,00:06:31,because it was a Sunday.
00:06:31,00:06:34,And it's not technically treason.
00:06:34,00:06:37,"As they poiled the tea up, steaming."
00:06:37,00:06:42,"The Boston Tea Party was December 16, 1773."
00:06:42,00:06:46,"It was a huge landlock day for civil disobedience,"
00:06:46,00:06:49,"because it literally, I'm not getting all the way"
00:06:49,00:06:51,going back to the founding of Boston.
00:06:51,00:06:54,The police elements of Boston and the trouble making
00:06:54,00:06:56,elements of Boston have been in this like weird alignment.
00:06:56,00:06:58,"So the Boston Tea Party, when it happened,"
00:06:58,00:07:02,"was seen as a huge failure of that balance,"
00:07:02,00:07:05,"because people really were for both those things existing,"
00:07:05,00:07:08,"but very separately, and when the Bostonians"
00:07:08,00:07:10,"start to revolt against the British,"
00:07:10,00:07:12,a lot of the loyalist elements of Boston
00:07:12,00:07:14,were really upset that this fragile piece
00:07:14,00:07:17,"between the brothels, which they like to access themselves"
00:07:17,00:07:20,"and respectable society, were commingling."
00:07:20,00:07:25,And it was a real big problem for the ruling classes in Boston.
00:07:25,00:07:28,"So you had the Boston massacre around the same time, didn't you?"
00:07:28,00:07:32,"Yes, which is caused by a snowball fight or something."
00:07:32,00:07:35,"Or there was a real problem between the two groups,"
00:07:35,00:07:38,"and then one guy threw a snowball, and then it all kicked off."
00:07:38,00:07:40,There were so many different little fights in the--
00:07:40,00:07:43,the Boston massacre was notable because the papers
00:07:43,00:07:45,"really seized on it, and there was a popular woodcutting"
00:07:45,00:07:48,that ended up proliferating in the same way.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"I guess you could say the woodcutting sort of went viral,"
00:07:51,00:07:52,even though it didn't strictly depict the truth.
00:07:52,00:07:55,"Rival woodcuts, the free Twitter age."
00:07:55,00:07:56,It's a more fun one.
00:07:56,00:07:59,A lot of people read woodcuts today.
00:07:59,00:07:59,"Exactly, yeah."
00:07:59,00:08:01,This woodcut became a meme.
00:08:01,00:08:04,What's a good meme caption for a woodcut of the Boston massacre?
00:08:04,00:08:07,"Monday, I don't know, right?"
00:08:07,00:08:09,But the thing that captured popular imagination
00:08:09,00:08:11,was an 11-year-old boy named Christopher Sider
00:08:11,00:08:16,"who was shot in a protest in 1770, and that really kicked"
00:08:16,00:08:16,things in a high gear.
00:08:16,00:08:19,"And after that, there was until the end of the revolution"
00:08:19,00:08:22,"in Boston, just like a horrible place to be British,"
00:08:22,00:08:24,and an absolutely horrible place to be a British loyalist.
00:08:24,00:08:27,But I thought it was lit back on with fondness
00:08:27,00:08:29,"that the heroism of you, independent Americans,"
00:08:29,00:08:34,signed a throw of us respectable Englishmen.
00:08:34,00:08:34,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:34,00:08:35,Crazy king.
00:08:35,00:08:36,Crazy king.
00:08:36,00:08:39,"But the loyalist elements of the North,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,"they had a really good case until the British reacted,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,"and then most of the loyalists were like,"
00:08:43,00:08:44,"actually, there's probably not OK."
00:08:44,00:08:46,"Actually, these guys are dickheads."
00:08:46,00:08:46,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:08:46,00:08:47,Just give it a run.
00:08:47,00:08:48,Yeah.
00:08:48,00:08:51,"Well, something interesting about the morality movement"
00:08:51,00:08:53,"in Boston, though, later on, was--"
00:08:53,00:08:55,so it was all enforced by a society called
00:08:55,00:08:57,the Watch and Ward Society.
00:08:57,00:09:00,And this was a society that clamped down on the severe literature
00:09:00,00:09:01,and stuff like that.
00:09:01,00:09:03,One of the driving forces behind it
00:09:03,00:09:06,was a guy called God-free Cabo.
00:09:06,00:09:09,And he led this thing against books.
00:09:09,00:09:10,He thought we're immoral.
00:09:10,00:09:11,He thought the three musketeers was immoral.
00:09:11,00:09:14,He thought Tolstoy was a moral pervert.
00:09:14,00:09:17,He told his wife not to read George Eliot when he wasn't there.
00:09:17,00:09:17,Absolutely not.
00:09:17,00:09:18,It was dangerous.
00:09:18,00:09:19,Wow.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"I used up your wife from reading that as well, James."
00:09:22,00:09:23,But this is the amazing thing about him--
00:09:23,00:09:26,someone wrote a biography recently and uncovered
00:09:26,00:09:28,a multiple erotic literature and letters
00:09:28,00:09:30,that he used to send his wife all the time.
00:09:30,00:09:34,"So he'd write to his wife in German, which he didn't understand"
00:09:34,00:09:34,very well.
00:09:34,00:09:37,And he wrote about how he'd had this amazing dream
00:09:37,00:09:39,about how she'd urinated in his mouth
00:09:39,00:09:40,and he'd greedily swallowed it.
00:09:40,00:09:41,"Oh, my God."
00:09:41,00:09:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:09:42,00:09:46,P.S. do not read any George Eliot.
00:09:46,00:09:49,There is a divorce in the third chapter.
00:09:49,00:09:51,He'd send another letter saying he'd
00:09:51,00:09:54,had a fantasy about her being a starving giantess
00:09:54,00:09:55,"who devoured him, hungrily."
00:09:55,00:09:57,And then he writes all this in German.
00:09:57,00:09:59,And then he switches to English.
00:09:59,00:10:01,"And he says, better destroy this letter, darling."
00:10:01,00:10:03,And he just didn't know the word for urine.
00:10:03,00:10:06,"Maybe in German, it's very similar to chocolate cake."
00:10:06,00:10:07,Right.
00:10:07,00:10:08,It's probably that.
00:10:08,00:10:09,That's so--
00:10:09,00:10:10,Isn't that weird?
00:10:10,00:10:13,"No, it's almost too perfect, right?"
00:10:13,00:10:17,"The sensor is like, I'm confiscating this erotic literature."
00:10:17,00:10:18,You're going to collect it.
00:10:18,00:10:21,The pages will be stuck together in a few days.
00:10:21,00:10:24,"You know, that's still around the watching world society."
00:10:24,00:10:24,Is it?
00:10:24,00:10:27,It's been-- it changed its focus in the '40s
00:10:27,00:10:32,to focus on more socially acceptable vices
00:10:32,00:10:35,to hate gambling and other stuff.
00:10:35,00:10:37,And then they became a criminal justice reform thing.
00:10:37,00:10:39,And they're around in like a boring bureaucratic office
00:10:39,00:10:41,"in your Boston common now, like they're--"
00:10:41,00:10:42,Still weighing in each other's mouths?
00:10:42,00:10:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:42,00:10:44,Behind closed doors.
00:10:44,00:10:47,Which of us can honestly say we haven't written to a lover's
00:10:47,00:10:49,wishing they were a starving giant who would throw us
00:10:49,00:10:51,into their mouths?
00:10:51,00:10:54,I've got some more things that are illegal in Boston.
00:10:54,00:10:57,"Actually, most of these are illegal all over Massachusetts."
00:10:57,00:10:58,"Oh, my gosh."
00:10:58,00:11:00,"This is from article on CBS, which is strange,"
00:11:00,00:11:03,"but true, obscure Massachusetts laws."
00:11:03,00:11:03,Great stuff.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"Which, normally, if we would read that,"
00:11:05,00:11:07,"they would all be false, but I've checked most of them"
00:11:07,00:11:08,and they do seem to be true.
00:11:08,00:11:11,"So it's illegal to sell rabbits, ducks, or chickens"
00:11:11,00:11:14,that have been dyed a different color than the natural color.
00:11:14,00:11:15,Really?
00:11:15,00:11:17,That's like the guy that's like a fish seller in Thailand
00:11:17,00:11:19,earlier this year who put googly eyes on his fish
00:11:19,00:11:21,to make it like a fresher.
00:11:21,00:11:22,That's so good.
00:11:22,00:11:25,And it's illegal to sing only a portion of the Star Spangled
00:11:25,00:11:27,Banner in public.
00:11:27,00:11:30,"So once you start, you have to get all the way to the end."
00:11:30,00:11:31,I've read that.
00:11:31,00:11:33,And it says you can't.
00:11:33,00:11:37,"It says, if you play it as part of a medley of any kind,"
00:11:37,00:11:38,you're breaking the law.
00:11:38,00:11:42,"It's chapter 264, section 9 of the Massachusetts code."
00:11:42,00:11:43,So it's a definite thing.
00:11:43,00:11:45,So you have to sing the whole thing?
00:11:45,00:11:47,Even if you sing the first word.
00:11:47,00:11:48,And then you think better of it.
00:11:48,00:11:49,You have to keep going.
00:11:49,00:11:51,"Well, people are going to want to know you can leave the question."
00:11:51,00:11:53,"I would say, can you sing?"
00:11:53,00:11:55,"And people are like, see what?"
00:11:55,00:11:59,"Why did Don's really like, what do we sing?"
00:11:59,00:12:02,"Some reasons like, you need to give a full answer."
00:12:02,00:12:04,It's full of cliffhangers.
00:12:04,00:12:07,"Does it-- wait, is there a last word to the Star Spangled"
00:12:07,00:12:10,"Banner, which is just, yes, we can see that."
00:12:10,00:12:13,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:12:13,00:12:18,"OK, on to fact number two."
00:12:18,00:12:20,And that is James' facts.
00:12:20,00:12:22,"OK, my fact this week is that Henry VIII"
00:12:22,00:12:25,wants enjoyed a pudding so much that he
00:12:25,00:12:28,awarded the woman who made it one of the monasteries
00:12:28,00:12:31,that he just seized from the Catholic church.
00:12:31,00:12:33,This is so funny.
00:12:33,00:12:34,It's amazing.
00:12:34,00:12:35,What kind of pudding?
00:12:35,00:12:38,It was not recounted as to what kind of pudding it was.
00:12:38,00:12:39,It's the holy grail of pudding.
00:12:39,00:12:41,"When you say pudding, when you say pudding,"
00:12:41,00:12:45,"is it like a American, like a chocolate moose?"
00:12:45,00:12:45,"Well, pudding."
00:12:45,00:12:48,"Not like a moose, because that's a pudding."
00:12:48,00:12:49,But it's not a pudding.
00:12:49,00:12:51,"And the old days of pudding was a lump of soot,"
00:12:51,00:12:55,"or started with raisins, or it was a sort of discreet thing."
00:12:55,00:12:58,"So when you say pudding, are we talking dessert?"
00:12:58,00:13:00,"I mean, it is a kind of dessert, but more specific than that."
00:13:00,00:13:03,"OK, so I'm saying so is a moose, or it's not a moose?"
00:13:03,00:13:04,Not a moose.
00:13:04,00:13:05,"OK, fine."
00:13:05,00:13:07,Alaska's a much popular game.
00:13:07,00:13:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:11,00:13:13,"So, yeah, basically, this is what happened."
00:13:13,00:13:16,"A lot of people will know this, that Henry VIII"
00:13:16,00:13:19,"dissolved the monasteries, and which meant that he took"
00:13:19,00:13:22,all of the property away from the monks and from the nuns.
00:13:22,00:13:23,And what does he do with it?
00:13:23,00:13:28,"Well, he puts it into the coffers, but also he gives a lot of it"
00:13:28,00:13:29,to his friends.
00:13:29,00:13:33,"At one stage, he lost some of it in a game of cards."
00:13:33,00:13:36,"Apparently, he lost the Jesus Bells of Old St. Paul's Church"
00:13:36,00:13:38,on a single throw of dice.
00:13:38,00:13:39,"Oh, my God."
00:13:39,00:13:41,"But, yeah, suddenly, you've got a load of monasteries."
00:13:41,00:13:42,What are you going to do with them?
00:13:42,00:13:44,You're going to gamble with them.
00:13:44,00:13:45,Spend them on puddings.
00:13:45,00:13:49,"I like to imagine that he had run out of change,"
00:13:49,00:13:50,"and he just tried the pudding, and it was so good."
00:13:50,00:13:53,"He said, ""Oh, I haven't got anything to pay with."
00:13:53,00:13:54,"I suppose you could have this."""
00:13:54,00:13:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:56,00:13:58,Sort of more inconvenient than just cash.
00:13:58,00:14:00,I don't think I'd accept monastery.
00:14:00,00:14:00,Would you not?
00:14:00,00:14:03,"If I were working a shop, no."
00:14:03,00:14:05,"No, I'd just ask for the cash."
00:14:05,00:14:06,You're short-sighted.
00:14:06,00:14:07,That's what you are.
00:14:07,00:14:08,"Sorry, Henry."
00:14:08,00:14:11,"Do you have contact list, maybe?"
00:14:11,00:14:14,"So, I found out, in fact, that links these two things"
00:14:14,00:14:16,that you've mentioned in the fact james.
00:14:16,00:14:17,Pudding and Henry VIII.
00:14:17,00:14:20,"So, today, the great British Bake-Off tent"
00:14:20,00:14:23,"is in a place called Welford Park in Berkshire,"
00:14:23,00:14:26,and it housed a monastery before Henry VIII dissolved them.
00:14:26,00:14:29,"So, today, puddings are made on the site"
00:14:29,00:14:31,of one of the dissolved monasteries.
00:14:31,00:14:32,That's amazing.
00:14:32,00:14:33,That's really good.
00:14:33,00:14:34,That's incredible.
00:14:34,00:14:36,That's really good.
00:14:36,00:14:37,How did you find that out?
00:14:37,00:14:39,I don't know.
00:14:39,00:14:41,You could go bake goods monastery.
00:14:41,00:14:42,Yeah.
00:14:42,00:14:47,"I was like, ""You're a lot today, baby."""
00:14:47,00:14:48,Very cool.
00:14:48,00:14:50,"But, yeah, sweet, sweet food, which I assumed this was,"
00:14:50,00:14:52,was a massive deal.
00:14:52,00:14:53,"It suddenly took off, didn't it?"
00:14:53,00:14:56,At least for the nobles in Henry VIII's time.
00:14:56,00:14:58,And they had such impressive things.
00:14:58,00:15:01,"So, it was called a void, I think, the sweet course."
00:15:01,00:15:04,"So, you'd have a certain number of courses"
00:15:04,00:15:06,in your meal in the 16th century.
00:15:06,00:15:08,And the number of courses you had
00:15:08,00:15:10,depended on your social status.
00:15:10,00:15:12,"And then, the last course was a void."
00:15:12,00:15:14,And it was because you had it standing up
00:15:14,00:15:16,while the table was cleared.
00:15:16,00:15:19,"So, the servants came along and they cleared everything"
00:15:19,00:15:19,off the table.
00:15:19,00:15:20,And the void were your sweet things
00:15:20,00:15:22,that you just stood up and ate.
00:15:22,00:15:22,You're kidding.
00:15:22,00:15:24,Or you went elsewhere to eat them.
00:15:24,00:15:25,"Or, yeah."
00:15:25,00:15:26,I'm really interesting.
00:15:26,00:15:27,Yeah.
00:15:27,00:15:28,I would want...
00:15:28,00:15:29,That sets me on edge a bit.
00:15:29,00:15:31,I like to relax with a pudding and sit down.
00:15:31,00:15:32,"Well, they want you on edge."
00:15:32,00:15:33,"Henry, what do you want to edge?"
00:15:33,00:15:35,"What if you just get, like, an ice cream"
00:15:35,00:15:36,"when you're out in the park,"
00:15:36,00:15:37,"do you have to sit down, sweet, that?"
00:15:37,00:15:40,Preferably at a table with a crockery.
00:15:40,00:15:43,[laughter]
00:15:43,00:15:45,"But yeah, it rendered the table void."
00:15:45,00:15:46,Wow.
00:15:46,00:15:48,That's unbelievable.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"What, I can't believe we don't know what pudding is."
00:15:50,00:15:51,It seems like the last word of the year.
00:15:51,00:15:53,I'm so sorry.
00:15:53,00:15:55,"This comes, I didn't find this in many places."
00:15:55,00:15:57,The main place I found it online
00:15:57,00:15:59,"is from Memoirs of the Court of Henry VIII,"
00:15:59,00:16:01,Vol. 2 by Catherine Thompson.
00:16:01,00:16:04,"Which is a Google book, which you can only get"
00:16:04,00:16:06,a few of the pages.
00:16:06,00:16:08,I can only see a few of these pages.
00:16:08,00:16:09,I don't know.
00:16:09,00:16:11,I don't think we know what it was.
00:16:11,00:16:13,I think it was just recounted at the time.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"She probably kept the recipe secret, though,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,because she doesn't want everyone getting a free monastery.
00:16:17,00:16:19,"Well, here's the thing."
00:16:19,00:16:21,Henry VIII's favorite dessert was called
00:16:21,00:16:24,"""Made of honor tarts."""
00:16:24,00:16:26,"No, they're not."
00:16:26,00:16:27,What?
00:16:27,00:16:28,"""Made of honor on tarts."""
00:16:28,00:16:30,"Oh, it's ironic, isn't it?"
00:16:30,00:16:31,It's an ironic dessert.
00:16:31,00:16:32,"Yeah, made of honor tarts."
00:16:32,00:16:34,I hear that he would eat one
00:16:34,00:16:38,and then he'd behead the next time.
00:16:38,00:16:41,"Well, he just found these in a place"
00:16:41,00:16:42,on time they were served to him.
00:16:42,00:16:45,And he loved them so much that he confiscated the recipe
00:16:45,00:16:47,and locked it in an iron box
00:16:47,00:16:50,and announced they were for royal consumption only.
00:16:50,00:16:51,Wow.
00:16:51,00:16:52,It does sound not very true.
00:16:52,00:16:54,I haven't seen it debunks.
00:16:54,00:16:54,"Yeah, go on."
00:16:54,00:16:56,"Well, no, that's all it was."
00:16:56,00:16:58,It was just someone said this probably isn't true.
00:16:58,00:17:02,I've seen other people saying that this lady was killed
00:17:02,00:17:03,so that she could hear that.
00:17:03,00:17:04,I've seen that debunked.
00:17:04,00:17:06,This might not be true as well.
00:17:06,00:17:09,"I mean, it has the ring of fakeness to it, doesn't it?"
00:17:09,00:17:12,And there's another story that someone from the royal household
00:17:12,00:17:13,then snuck the recipe out
00:17:13,00:17:15,"and that's how we know it now, kind of thing."
00:17:15,00:17:16,That's cool.
00:17:16,00:17:18,"But they're a bit like those, you know, those"
00:17:18,00:17:20,custer tarts you get in Portugal.
00:17:20,00:17:21,Yeah.
00:17:21,00:17:22,"You know what I'm called, but they're like those."
00:17:22,00:17:23,"Oh, just like that."
00:17:23,00:17:25,And he thought that was worth locking under lock and g.
00:17:25,00:17:26,I don't like those.
00:17:26,00:17:28,"But a lot of people do really like them, don't they?"
00:17:28,00:17:29,I guess.
00:17:29,00:17:32,One pudding that they enjoyed in Henry VIII's time
00:17:32,00:17:34,was eel-wrapped in marzipan.
00:17:34,00:17:36,"Mm, that sounds really nice, doesn't it?"
00:17:36,00:17:38,What's the grossest dish from history
00:17:38,00:17:40,that you guys have come across to that?
00:17:40,00:17:42,The one that comes to my head straight away
00:17:42,00:17:45,"is son of a bitch pie, which is made"
00:17:45,00:17:47,by all of the pieces of a cow.
00:17:47,00:17:48,I've won onion.
00:17:48,00:17:49,No.
00:17:49,00:17:51,And it was like a cow by recipe
00:17:51,00:17:53,that they used to make in America.
00:17:53,00:17:54,Son of a bitch pie?
00:17:54,00:17:57,It sounds like a cowboy recipe.
00:17:57,00:18:01,I would love for you guys to have a day where you do it
00:18:01,00:18:04,with a live QI podcast and cook.
00:18:04,00:18:08,"Many of the dishes that you, it would be such a spectrum"
00:18:08,00:18:10,of deliciousness in terms of grotesque
00:18:10,00:18:12,"all the way to great, right?"
00:18:12,00:18:14,I don't know if a podcast of promising for three hours
00:18:14,00:18:15,is for people like me.
00:18:15,00:18:16,"Well, you do the podcast first,"
00:18:16,00:18:18,and then you have it out there.
00:18:18,00:18:19,And then you have it in the inventory.
00:18:19,00:18:19,"I mean, you do facts about it."
00:18:19,00:18:21,"OK, man."
00:18:21,00:18:22,What's the place?
00:18:22,00:18:25,I think we did this when I was on a podcast long time ago
00:18:25,00:18:27,"about a finger shot, a pickled finger."
00:18:27,00:18:29,"Oh, Sato cocktail."
00:18:29,00:18:30,Yes.
00:18:30,00:18:31,There's a big toe.
00:18:31,00:18:32,In some bar.
00:18:32,00:18:33,Yes.
00:18:33,00:18:34,And you have to--
00:18:34,00:18:35,In Canada.
00:18:35,00:18:36,Yeah.
00:18:36,00:18:37,Yeah.
00:18:37,00:18:38,"And you have to drink the shot, or the cocktail,"
00:18:38,00:18:39,"or whatever, and then give the toe back."
00:18:39,00:18:41,"But sometimes people steal it, or swallow it."
00:18:41,00:18:42,Or swallow it.
00:18:42,00:18:43,"Well, also you're supposed to kiss the toe,"
00:18:43,00:18:46,so it needs to touch your lips while you're drinking the whiskey.
00:18:46,00:18:47,That's pretty disgusting.
00:18:47,00:18:50,"I mean, hey, if we can bug it for the QI podcast live,"
00:18:50,00:18:53,just run away today.
00:18:53,00:18:55,I didn't realize there were so many daily accounts
00:18:55,00:18:58,"of like, tutor, court life."
00:18:58,00:19:01,And I found this thing called the Voices of Morbath.
00:19:01,00:19:07,"And this is a priest named Christopher Triche,"
00:19:07,00:19:11,"who survived the religious changes of Henry the Eighth,"
00:19:11,00:19:14,"Edward VI, Mary the First, and Elizabeth the First,"
00:19:14,00:19:18,by sort of subtly shifting his views every time.
00:19:18,00:19:23,"But in his memoirs for the Voices of Morbath,"
00:19:23,00:19:27,he expresses the most regret about the stripping
00:19:27,00:19:28,of the monastery.
00:19:28,00:19:30,"But at the time, he was like, this whole thing,"
00:19:30,00:19:33,I've been saying we should get rid of this.
00:19:33,00:19:35,"Yeah, but that's exactly how it was his attitude."
00:19:35,00:19:37,"And he's like, who loves Jesus?"
00:19:37,00:19:40,"He's like, you're here, but he's not."
00:19:40,00:19:42,"But when Mary comes along, and he's like,"
00:19:42,00:19:44,"I don't know what those bastards did with my monastery,"
00:19:44,00:19:45,but I want it back.
00:19:45,00:19:48,"But that's exactly what he says, that he was like,"
00:19:48,00:19:51,"he was like, his righteous fury when they came for it."
00:19:51,00:19:54,"And like, what whiplash you must get most of gotten,"
00:19:54,00:19:55,but it is lay of you.
00:19:55,00:19:56,"I think we've all done it, though."
00:19:56,00:19:59,"I've definitely made horrible missteps in a conversation,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,and then found out the person I'm talking to
00:20:01,00:20:06,"has very, very different views and sort of subtly walked it back."
00:20:06,00:20:08,But to do it four times is quite impressive.
00:20:08,00:20:10,Four times of 54 years.
00:20:10,00:20:11,"Oh, that's fine."
00:20:11,00:20:13,"Yeah, 13 years per walk, that's fine."
00:20:13,00:20:15,I can do it in five minutes.
00:20:15,00:20:18,I once took both sides of an opposing argument
00:20:18,00:20:21,over the course of an evening and lost the argument both times.
00:20:21,00:20:22,No.
00:20:22,00:20:23,"Alex, you've got to get some more mates."
00:20:23,00:20:24,"Yeah, no."
00:20:24,00:20:28,"You're alone in a pub, just talking about one chance in the next."
00:20:28,00:20:30,Do you know that thing that chess players often do
00:20:30,00:20:32,where they play multiple games of chess?
00:20:32,00:20:35,But what they do is they play the moves that one person's
00:20:35,00:20:37,playing against them against the other person.
00:20:37,00:20:39,So they always win at least half of the game.
00:20:39,00:20:39,Darren rounded that.
00:20:39,00:20:44,"If 54, not to spoil Darren Brown's one of Darren Brown's"
00:20:44,00:20:47,"specials, but he did that, wouldn't beat all these chess."
00:20:47,00:20:49,I was thinking you could do that in your arguments.
00:20:49,00:20:51,You could just run to the other bit of the pub
00:20:51,00:20:52,and then just use the arguments to be used against it.
00:20:52,00:20:53,"Well, that's what I tried."
00:20:53,00:20:54,I tried doing that.
00:20:54,00:20:56,Because someone made a really good argument.
00:20:56,00:20:57,"I was like, you know what, you've convinced me."
00:20:57,00:20:59,And then I had the argument later on the evening
00:20:59,00:21:03,"with my new convinced opinion, and they got cream."
00:21:03,00:21:05,"I've got chess facts, actually, about this fact,"
00:21:05,00:21:08,"which is the Walsy, you know, cardinal Walsy,"
00:21:08,00:21:11,who was Henry VIII's right-hand man at the start.
00:21:11,00:21:13,The three killed him.
00:21:13,00:21:14,Served.
00:21:14,00:21:15,The spiderwelless.
00:21:15,00:21:15,The spiderwelless.
00:21:15,00:21:18,Once served an entire chess set made of Marsy Pan
00:21:18,00:21:20,"as a dessert, which is quite impressive."
00:21:20,00:21:22,He served it to the French ambassadors when they visited.
00:21:22,00:21:24,That's a lot of heels.
00:21:24,00:21:29,I've always wanted to have a cheese chess sport game
00:21:29,00:21:31,where all the pieces are made of different kinds of cheese.
00:21:31,00:21:34,"And when you take an opponent's piece, you get to eat it."
00:21:34,00:21:36,That's only one word away from chess board and cheese board.
00:21:36,00:21:38,Exactly.
00:21:38,00:21:40,So I think this is a big commercial opportunity
00:21:40,00:21:43,that I'm throwing away now by saying it on a podcast.
00:21:43,00:21:45,"What would be your king, cheese?"
00:21:45,00:21:48,"You know, the ultimate that you're going for."
00:21:48,00:21:49,It's got to be a baby bell.
00:21:49,00:21:50,It's got to be a baby bell.
00:21:50,00:21:53,"No, that's crazy."
00:21:53,00:21:54,That's cheese.
00:21:54,00:21:55,That's crazy.
00:21:55,00:21:56,That's crazy.
00:21:56,00:21:57,It's smoked gouda.
00:21:57,00:21:59,Nice.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"I think it's going to be a hard cheese, doesn't it?"
00:22:01,00:22:02,"Like, for the king."
00:22:02,00:22:05,It's quite hard to have a player made of bread.
00:22:05,00:22:07,"I would say, depending on the temperature of the room,"
00:22:07,00:22:08,you're playing again.
00:22:08,00:22:10,You might be playing really fast.
00:22:10,00:22:12,It's pretty so hard to carve.
00:22:12,00:22:13,No.
00:22:13,00:22:15,You don't see brie sculptures.
00:22:15,00:22:17,But they just have an extraordinary number of courses
00:22:17,00:22:19,at the Tudor Dining Table.
00:22:19,00:22:22,So if there were these laws about how many you could have
00:22:22,00:22:25,"and it depended on your status, as I was saying."
00:22:25,00:22:28,"So if you were a cardinal, you could have seven to nine courses."
00:22:28,00:22:29,Seven to nine dishes.
00:22:29,00:22:30,So that isn't it?
00:22:30,00:22:31,It's enough.
00:22:31,00:22:34,"If you were, let's say, a member of the Gentry class,"
00:22:34,00:22:36,you're only about three dishes.
00:22:36,00:22:38,And so you have to know what equals a dish.
00:22:38,00:22:40,And it would be a specific number of certain things.
00:22:40,00:22:42,"So if you're having a swan, you only got one swan."
00:22:42,00:22:43,And that's a full dish.
00:22:43,00:22:45,"If you're having chicken, you get six chickens."
00:22:45,00:22:47,"If you're eating a lock, you get 12 locks."
00:22:47,00:22:49,For one person.
00:22:49,00:22:51,It's a family bucket.
00:22:51,00:22:53,"I think it's for the table, yeah."
00:22:53,00:22:56,"Because they have a, they had systems of trenches."
00:22:56,00:22:58,"You know, they'd have a big sort of central plate"
00:22:58,00:23:00,with all the food served in that and you'd take in that.
00:23:00,00:23:03,You allow to have half a swan and maybe just six locks.
00:23:03,00:23:05,"I don't, I didn't actually read into the law that much."
00:23:05,00:23:08,But I'm sure you can negotiate with your authorities if they check.
00:23:08,00:23:10,So Mark Wahlberg published his routine this week.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"Did any, did either of you guys see that?"
00:23:12,00:23:14,Mark Wahlberg put his routine online.
00:23:14,00:23:16,"This is, I don't want to bore you with the details."
00:23:16,00:23:19,But how about I just entertain you with the details?
00:23:19,00:23:21,Mark wakes up at 2.30 a.m.
00:23:21,00:23:24,Then he prays for half an hour and any better pray.
00:23:24,00:23:26,Because from 3.4 to 5.15 he's working out.
00:23:26,00:23:28,It's not as last work out of the day.
00:23:28,00:23:29,Then he showers.
00:23:29,00:23:32,It is his last shower of the day.
00:23:32,00:23:34,The shower is an hour and a half long.
00:23:34,00:23:37,Then he has his first of three snacks.
00:23:37,00:23:39,The snack only takes half an hour.
00:23:39,00:23:42,"And you might be like, only, yeah, because snack number two"
00:23:42,00:23:43,is from 8 to 9.30.
00:23:43,00:23:45,So that's an hour and a half for a snack.
00:23:45,00:23:48,And he would save a whole hour and a half if he just ate it in the shower.
00:23:48,00:23:52,"So breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all in the schedule."
00:23:52,00:23:54,But they're not part of snack.
00:23:54,00:23:57,Mark Wahlberg spends two and a half hours of his day just eating snacks.
00:23:57,00:23:58,Wow.
00:23:58,00:24:02,"By the way, my favorite detail, he does half an hour of golf during the day."
00:24:02,00:24:05,"And I just like, I know, I just like to imagine him doing 18 holes"
00:24:05,00:24:06,and half an hour.
00:24:06,00:24:10,"He's like a golf cart 60 miles an hour, not a fairway."
00:24:10,00:24:11,"Just like, can I play through?"
00:24:11,00:24:15,I have one minute and 44 seconds to play this all of a sudden.
00:24:15,00:24:16,Here's what Mark Wahlberg eats.
00:24:16,00:24:19,"I start out with steel oats, blueberries, and peanut butter for breakfast."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"Then I have a protein shake, three turkey burgers, five pieces of sweet potato,"
00:24:22,00:24:24,and then it's 5.30 in the morning.
00:24:24,00:24:27,"At 8 o'clock, I have 10 turkey meatballs."
00:24:27,00:24:30,"At 10.30 a.m., I have a grilled chicken salad with two hard boiled eggs,"
00:24:30,00:24:33,"olives, avocado, cucumber, tomato, and lettuce."
00:24:33,00:24:35,"Then at 1 o'clock, I have a New York steak with green peppers at 3.30,"
00:24:35,00:24:37,I have a grilled chicken with bok choy.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"At 5.30, six o'clock, I have a beautiful piece of halibut,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,or cod or a sea bass with some vegetables.
00:24:41,00:24:43,Maybe some saute potatoes in bok choy.
00:24:43,00:24:48,"Then I have a lot of aqua hydrate during the day, and then he goes, ""That's it."""
00:24:48,00:24:51,It sounds like he's a two to nobleman.
00:24:51,00:24:53,"Yeah, it really does give him an opportunity."
00:24:53,00:24:54,The amount of protein he has.
00:24:54,00:24:59,"By the way, nowhere during his schedule that he's published are there any bathroom bricks?"
00:24:59,00:25:00,So that digestive system.
00:25:00,00:25:01,He probably does that in the shell.
00:25:01,00:25:03,"Yeah, it's an hour and a half shower."
00:25:03,00:25:07,"That's why he's thinking, ""Or he leans out the side of the golf guard going 70,000 hours."""
00:25:07,00:25:09,With a very stressed-out caddy.
00:25:09,00:25:11,"He was like, ""What are you doing?"""
00:25:11,00:25:16,"By the way, nowhere in Marguerite's schedule was there any time allocated for work and acting,"
00:25:16,00:25:17,which I found very interesting.
00:25:17,00:25:19,I think that makes sense.
00:25:19,00:25:28,So it's time for fact number three that is Andes.
00:25:28,00:25:33,My fact is that dolphins in the wild have been teaching each other how to moonwalk.
00:25:33,00:25:35,Pretty cool.
00:25:35,00:25:39,"To Michael Jackson's songs, or like why are they doing that?"
00:25:39,00:25:41,"Not to Michael Jackson's, just the fun."
00:25:41,00:25:43,In the wilders.
00:25:43,00:25:44,In the wild.
00:25:44,00:25:48,"So there was a pod of dolphins in Australia, and they are wild."
00:25:48,00:25:51,But there was one who joined them whose name was Billy.
00:25:51,00:25:52,Don't know whether.
00:25:52,00:25:53,Billy Jean?
00:25:53,00:25:54,Maybe.
00:25:54,00:25:57,He's just a fish who thinks that I am one.
00:25:57,00:26:00,"Sorry, if he's a wild dolphin, why has he got a name?"
00:26:00,00:26:01,"Okay, so this is the thing."
00:26:01,00:26:03,"Billy, I think Billy was a she."
00:26:03,00:26:05,Like Milly Piper.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Like Billy Jean.
00:26:06,00:26:09,Like Billy Jean.
00:26:09,00:26:15,And so Billy was rescued from a polluted harbour and kept an adolfinarium for several weeks.
00:26:15,00:26:19,"And while there, she observed other dolphins doing this moonwalking trick,"
00:26:19,00:26:23,which is where you kind of stand on your tail and you swish back and forth really hard.
00:26:23,00:26:26,So you move backwards through the water like a moonwalk.
00:26:26,00:26:27,She wasn't taught to do it.
00:26:27,00:26:29,She just observed and started doing it herself.
00:26:29,00:26:34,"And then when she was released in the wild, she was spotted seven years later in her pod"
00:26:34,00:26:37,and loads of them were moonwalking and loads of them were really good at it.
00:26:37,00:26:40,And others in the pod and 11 of them were spotted doing this trick.
00:26:40,00:26:43,"And why I really love about it because this was actually about 10 years ago,"
00:26:43,00:26:44,this happened.
00:26:44,00:26:48,But why it's in the news at the moment is because the new generation has just stopped doing it.
00:26:48,00:26:49,Yeah.
00:26:49,00:26:51,So it's kind of something that their parents do.
00:26:51,00:26:52,These are kids.
00:26:52,00:26:54,All these dolphins are now flushing now.
00:26:54,00:26:57,"They're just like, but they don't do it anymore."
00:26:57,00:26:58,The dolphins are deembarious.
00:26:58,00:27:01,"You're like, my dad's always moonwalking."
00:27:01,00:27:05,"It's not funny when you send it through at first, I was trying to conceive of how they're doing."
00:27:05,00:27:07,"I'm like, where do they get the shoes?"
00:27:07,00:27:11,"There was a news about a dolphin this year, a Randy Dolphin, wasn't there?"
00:27:11,00:27:16,That I think came just slightly too late to get into our book of the year.
00:27:16,00:27:18,What's that book of the year?
00:27:18,00:27:22,"It's just a disdain little project we've been working on, the book of the year 2018."
00:27:22,00:27:27,"But yeah, there was news this year about a Randy Dolphin who shut down an entire beach."
00:27:27,00:27:30,"This was in Brittany in August, so Brittany in France."
00:27:30,00:27:33,"And it was a beach in the Bay of Breast, fittingly."
00:27:33,00:27:38,"And there's this dolphin called Zafar, with a zed, if you're wondering."
00:27:38,00:27:42,"And people would go to the beach and swim with him, and they could hold onto his fin."
00:27:42,00:27:44,"And he'd sort of bound around, he's very friendly."
00:27:44,00:27:46,But he wanted something in a time.
00:27:46,00:27:47,He wanted something.
00:27:47,00:27:49,And he started trying to have sex with people all the time.
00:27:49,00:27:53,There was one woman who he picked up and lifted out of the water and wouldn't let her back down.
00:27:53,00:27:56,He would rub up sexually against kayaks and other small boats.
00:27:56,00:27:58,Maybe he wanted to do some canoeodle.
00:27:58,00:28:02,So they shut down the entire beach.
00:28:02,00:28:05,They shut down the beach and not allow within 50 metres of him.
00:28:05,00:28:06,"I mean, not allowed to go in the water with them."
00:28:06,00:28:08,"People have really learned from jaws, haven't they?"
00:28:08,00:28:10,"And that, they didn't shut down the beach for ages."
00:28:10,00:28:12,And there was a shark eating people.
00:28:12,00:28:15,"Well, yeah, it was tourist season on Air Mini Island."
00:28:15,00:28:17,"It's part of the industry. What's wrong with you, Andy?"
00:28:17,00:28:22,"People always go after this marriage, just trying to keep his community afloat."
00:28:22,00:28:24,It's the economics of the thing.
00:28:24,00:28:31,"Quite impressively, monkeys and macaques can teach their offspring to floss."
00:28:31,00:28:34,"So on animal teaching, it's not the dance."
00:28:34,00:28:36,"I don't think, although I didn't check it."
00:28:36,00:28:38,The first thing that's part of mine.
00:28:38,00:28:40,"Well, they're flossing with human hair."
00:28:40,00:28:42,Does the dance involve human hair?
00:28:42,00:28:45,I think it might just be average tooth flossing.
00:28:45,00:28:47,"But yeah, I didn't even know they really flossed."
00:28:47,00:28:50,But this was first spotted in 2009 in Thailand.
00:28:50,00:28:54,And female monkeys were nicking hair of human heads or of human clothes.
00:28:54,00:28:56,And then flossing their teeth with it.
00:28:56,00:28:58,And they found they spent double the amount of time flossing
00:28:58,00:29:01,"if they were doing it in front of their children, in front of youths,"
00:29:01,00:29:03,to show them how to do it.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"If my dancers said, ""Do you floss?"""
00:29:05,00:29:08,"And I say, ""No,"" and he said, ""Well, monkeys do dickhead."""
00:29:08,00:29:10,And I think I might do it. I think I might do it well.
00:29:10,00:29:13,I think you should change your dancers.
00:29:13,00:29:15,This is a cool thing.
00:29:15,00:29:18,"Killer whales, they teach their young, you know how that move"
00:29:18,00:29:21,when they surge onto a beach and they grab a seal.
00:29:21,00:29:25,So killer whale mothers will practice with their calves.
00:29:25,00:29:28,But they first practice by surging onto a really steep beach
00:29:28,00:29:30,so the calf can get back really easily.
00:29:30,00:29:32,And also one where there are no seals.
00:29:32,00:29:34,"So it's like a driving lesson, basically."
00:29:34,00:29:35,That's so cool.
00:29:35,00:29:36,"Yeah, and they do that."
00:29:36,00:29:39,And then the practice may be a slightly shallow a beach
00:29:39,00:29:41,and it gets gradually harder.
00:29:41,00:29:43,But it's sort of the opposite of when humans are willing to drive
00:29:43,00:29:45,because you wouldn't do the very steep hill start
00:29:45,00:29:49,and feel quite lay on in your lessons.
00:29:49,00:29:52,"Just on dolphins, they have a language."
00:29:52,00:29:54,So they talk to each other.
00:29:54,00:29:56,It's German. German.
00:29:56,00:29:57,Nice to meet you.
00:29:57,00:29:59,"Click noises, isn't it?"
00:29:59,00:30:01,And noises that we can't really hear.
00:30:01,00:30:04,But the way that we know that it's a language and not random noise
00:30:04,00:30:10,"is they did studies on something called zips law, that z-i-p-f."
00:30:10,00:30:14,And what it is is the most common words in any language occur
00:30:14,00:30:17,"about 10 times more than the second most common,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,which occur 10 times more than the third most common.
00:30:19,00:30:22,"It's not 10 times, but it's a logarithmic scale."
00:30:22,00:30:25,And they checked all of these noises that dolphins were making
00:30:25,00:30:27,"and they found that in dolphin languages,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,they have exactly the same laws as all human languages.
00:30:29,00:30:33,So the most common clicks that they make are
00:30:33,00:30:36,a certain percentage more than the second most common.
00:30:36,00:30:39,"And by doing all of this study and working that out,"
00:30:39,00:30:41,they reckon that they're going to use it to work out
00:30:41,00:30:44,if aliens are trying to contact us.
00:30:44,00:30:46,"Because if we get any kind of signals from space,"
00:30:46,00:30:48,we won't know it's a language or it just could be random.
00:30:48,00:30:50,"But if we can work it out like dolphins,"
00:30:50,00:30:52,then it has this kind of zips law.
00:30:52,00:30:53,That's very good.
00:30:53,00:30:54,Wow.
00:30:54,00:30:57,So does that mean that you can spot the really pretentious dolphin?
00:30:57,00:31:00,So we're just using the extremely rare.
00:31:00,00:31:04,This word only came up once in 20 years
00:31:04,00:31:07,and it was the dolphin and glasses over there.
00:31:07,00:31:09,"Another thing about dolphins,"
00:31:09,00:31:12,my favorite dolphin is Kelly the Dolphin.
00:31:12,00:31:15,And what they did was they taught these dolphins
00:31:15,00:31:18,"that if any grubbish got into their pool,"
00:31:18,00:31:20,then they could collect it and give it to their keeper
00:31:20,00:31:22,and they would get a treat.
00:31:22,00:31:25,"So whenever any tourist dropped in a piece of paper,"
00:31:25,00:31:28,"they pick it up, give it to their keeper and they get a treat."
00:31:28,00:31:31,"So what Kelly did was whenever someone drops in some paper,"
00:31:31,00:31:34,she would hide it at the bottom of the pool under a stone
00:31:34,00:31:36,and then she would rip off a little bit
00:31:36,00:31:38,and give it to her keeper and get a treat.
00:31:38,00:31:39,"And then once she's got the treat,"
00:31:39,00:31:41,she'd go down and rip another little piece off
00:31:41,00:31:43,and get loads of treats for one bit.
00:31:43,00:31:44,Oh my god.
00:31:44,00:31:46,"That's smart, isn't it?"
00:31:46,00:31:48,That's nauseous what that is.
00:31:48,00:31:53,It's illegal in Boston unless it's Sunday or the 4th of July.
00:31:53,00:31:54,That's what that is.
00:31:54,00:31:57,I'm desperate to know the limits of like an animal.
00:31:57,00:31:59,Like an animal's...
00:31:59,00:32:02,"Like there were always fights about what to do with cocoa, the gorilla."
00:32:02,00:32:05,"Because so cocoa, the gorilla was a gorilla"
00:32:05,00:32:07,who could communicate with people with sign language.
00:32:07,00:32:08,Yeah.
00:32:08,00:32:10,"Someone wanted cocoa to write a novel and they were like,"
00:32:10,00:32:11,"""No!"""
00:32:11,00:32:12,"""No!"""
00:32:12,00:32:14,"Who was like, ""No."""
00:32:14,00:32:15,"The agent, the puppet."
00:32:15,00:32:17,"Coco died this year, didn't she?"
00:32:17,00:32:21,"Yeah, Coco died shortly before the Edinburgh French Festival."
00:32:21,00:32:23,And I have a joke about Coco and my show
00:32:23,00:32:24,and I lived in fear every day.
00:32:24,00:32:26,"Because I would go, ""Coco's a gorilla."""
00:32:26,00:32:29,"And every day I lived in fear of someone going,"
00:32:29,00:32:31,"""Not anymore."""
00:32:31,00:32:33,She's an ex gorilla.
00:32:33,00:32:35,"Yeah, luckily I didn't go to Edinburgh this year."
00:32:35,00:32:37,I had to watch a show otherwise I'd have been straight there on the front door.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"No, no, you definitely would have been it."
00:32:39,00:32:41,The joke is about Coco meeting Robin Williams.
00:32:41,00:32:45,"And Bob Kekolthwaiter is really good friends with Robin Williams,"
00:32:45,00:32:48,"a comedian, Sami, do the joke, and said to me afterwards,"
00:32:48,00:32:51,"""You know, Coco tried to have sex with Robin Williams."""
00:32:51,00:32:52,Really?
00:32:52,00:32:53,Yes.
00:32:53,00:32:54,And Coco and Robin met twice.
00:32:54,00:32:56,"And the second time, Coco made a sign."
00:32:56,00:32:59,"And apparently, Robin was said to the handlers."
00:32:59,00:33:00,"Like, ""What did Coco go to say?"""
00:33:00,00:33:04,"And they're like, ""Uh, Robin, let's get you like slowly moving towards the end."""
00:33:04,00:33:07,"So, can we get you over here?"
00:33:07,00:33:11,"So, that's a bit of a hot goss that you probably can include,"
00:33:11,00:33:15,"'cause I've seen Bob Kekolthwaiter say it on stage, so that's really good."
00:33:15,00:33:22,"Okay, moving on to our final fact."
00:33:22,00:33:24,And that is from Alex.
00:33:24,00:33:25,All right.
00:33:25,00:33:28,"In medieval Germany, the funniest joke anyone had ever heard"
00:33:28,00:33:31,involved replacing a flower with a poo.
00:33:31,00:33:34,It still looks.
00:33:34,00:33:35,Still a little funny.
00:33:35,00:33:36,Haven't even had the full version.
00:33:36,00:33:37,All right.
00:33:37,00:33:38,"So, how would it go?"
00:33:38,00:33:40,"So, there's a poet named Nighthart, who is walking along,"
00:33:40,00:33:42,"and he finds the first violet of spring,"
00:33:42,00:33:45,and he puts his cap over the flower to mark the spot.
00:33:45,00:33:48,"And when he's gone, this guy happens by a bit of a prankster,"
00:33:48,00:33:51,"and he lifts up the cap, and he picks the flower,"
00:33:51,00:33:54,and we'll say he squats down to leave his own souvenir.
00:33:54,00:33:59,"And Nighthart comes back with an entire court,"
00:33:59,00:34:01,including the King Queen.
00:34:01,00:34:03,"There's this big celebratory dance around the cap,"
00:34:03,00:34:06,and then with great ceremony and a plum removes it
00:34:06,00:34:09,"to reveal a fresh, steaming pile of human shit."
00:34:09,00:34:13,"And it was so funny, in medieval Germany,"
00:34:13,00:34:16,"that the book by Ken Jennings called Planet Funny,"
00:34:16,00:34:18,"which talks about it, says,"
00:34:18,00:34:20,"""And variations on the story were recycled"
00:34:20,00:34:22,"in song, dance, prose, and drama, and art."""
00:34:22,00:34:25,"And then in italics, he writes, ""For decades."""
00:34:25,00:34:29,"For a time, it was fashionable for people to replace the portraits"
00:34:29,00:34:33,"of the saints in their homes, with paintings of the violet trick,"
00:34:33,00:34:37,which made the church really unhappy.
00:34:37,00:34:41,"And yeah, it was a huge, it was a huge, huge joke that,"
00:34:41,00:34:44,"and it just totally resonated,"
00:34:44,00:34:46,because maybe because we were so impressed.
00:34:46,00:34:49,Resonated. We've all been there.
00:34:49,00:34:51,"It's classic, observational comedy."
00:34:51,00:34:54,Michael Mackenzie will be proud of that material.
00:34:54,00:34:57,"So people's homes used to have portraits of feces,"
00:34:57,00:34:59,just all over the walls for a time.
00:34:59,00:35:02,"Not feces, it would be night heart, pulling his cap up,"
00:35:02,00:35:04,"and then there'd be the feces in it,"
00:35:04,00:35:07,"and like, you know, court people with their hands over their faces,"
00:35:07,00:35:09,"and stuff like that, I assume."
00:35:09,00:35:10,"Yeah, that's right."
00:35:10,00:35:11,Was turned into a play.
00:35:11,00:35:12,"Yeah, is it?"
00:35:12,00:35:13,Was turned into a full-on play.
00:35:13,00:35:14,Wow.
00:35:14,00:35:17,"Yeah, this was, I think it's the earliest non-religious drama"
00:35:17,00:35:20,"of the Middle Ages that we have surviving today, this play."
00:35:20,00:35:21,No.
00:35:21,00:35:24,"But it gets a bit more serious in the play, because it's a contest"
00:35:24,00:35:26,"to find the first violinist to bring in the play,"
00:35:26,00:35:30,and there's a fanfare of trumpet as the cap is lifted up.
00:35:30,00:35:32,"But when it's revealed, the villagers,"
00:35:32,00:35:34,"they're all teasing night heart,"
00:35:34,00:35:35,who is a knight in the story.
00:35:35,00:35:37,"They take the violet and the turd,"
00:35:37,00:35:40,"and they hoisted on a pole, and they dance around it."
00:35:40,00:35:42,"And night heart doesn't see the funny side,"
00:35:42,00:35:45,and he cuts off the left legs of 32 of the villagers.
00:35:45,00:35:48,So they had to lean on the pole.
00:35:48,00:35:49,Wow.
00:35:49,00:35:51,"Yeah, it's not taking a joke very well."
00:35:51,00:35:54,"Imagine if at the Edinburgh Festival,"
00:35:54,00:35:57,you had that response when you told a bad joke.
00:35:57,00:36:01,I think there would be a higher bar to people entering within there.
00:36:01,00:36:03,But they were quite into this.
00:36:03,00:36:06,"So in the 15th century, I also read about a poem"
00:36:06,00:36:08,"by a guy called Heinz de Kellner,"
00:36:08,00:36:11,who baked beans were named after.
00:36:11,00:36:15,"No, they weren't, but he wrote a poem about a peasant"
00:36:15,00:36:18,who outwitted a princess in this verbal duel.
00:36:18,00:36:20,And so they were having this verbal duel
00:36:20,00:36:21,"with a bantering back and forth,"
00:36:21,00:36:22,"which sounds quite funny anyway,"
00:36:22,00:36:24,and they're trying to outwit each other.
00:36:24,00:36:27,"And then she says that his material is utter shit,"
00:36:27,00:36:31,and he lifts up his hat to reveal an actual poo underneath it
00:36:31,00:36:34,"on his head, which apparently proved she was correct"
00:36:34,00:36:36,and meant that she had to marry him.
00:36:36,00:36:37,"Oh, he had to marry him."
00:36:37,00:36:39,So that's a variation I'm...
00:36:39,00:36:40,That's a variation.
00:36:40,00:36:43,"Yeah, what a relief for him"
00:36:43,00:36:45,that she said your material is utter shit.
00:36:45,00:36:47,Because she never says it.
00:36:47,00:36:50,"But he probably, his whole life, he had this poo on his head,"
00:36:50,00:36:52,and he was just waiting for that one moment.
00:36:52,00:36:53,Right?
00:36:53,00:36:55,Very old poo by that point.
00:36:55,00:36:57,And she had to marry him.
00:36:57,00:37:00,"I think this never say to any comedian,"
00:37:00,00:37:02,especially while wearing a hat.
00:37:02,00:37:04,"The material shit, because you might..."
00:37:04,00:37:06,"I don't have any to marry them, I think."
00:37:06,00:37:07,"Oh my god, that's..."
00:37:07,00:37:08,"Yeah, how do you do me?"
00:37:08,00:37:10,You're not going to like this.
00:37:12,00:37:16,That I was just looking up sort of other German comedy
00:37:16,00:37:17,from the Middle Ages.
00:37:17,00:37:21,"So there was a play called ""Dull Cityus"","
00:37:21,00:37:23,"which is an adaptation of a Roman play,"
00:37:23,00:37:27,and it involves a governor who's got three virgins locked
00:37:27,00:37:31,"in a pantry, and he wants to kind of caress them."
00:37:31,00:37:33,"But he goes in the pantry, and it's all dark in there,"
00:37:33,00:37:36,"and he keeps on molesting various kitchen utensils,"
00:37:36,00:37:38,"thinking that they're the young women,"
00:37:38,00:37:41,thinking implausibly that they're the young women who...
00:37:41,00:37:44,One of these do sound kind of funny.
00:37:44,00:37:46,They're kind of not really funny.
00:37:46,00:37:48,I think a lot of this stuff that...
00:37:48,00:37:51,"Fad comedy, or comedy fads,"
00:37:51,00:37:53,they're all mechanisms to relieve tension.
00:37:53,00:37:54,"Like, this is probably so funny,"
00:37:54,00:37:58,"because of the dour culture around, you know,"
00:37:58,00:38:01,being alive in 14th century Germany
00:38:01,00:38:03,didn't encourage this kind of irreverence.
00:38:03,00:38:07,"And like, I got a really funny joke from this joke,"
00:38:07,00:38:10,absolutely swept through 1968 Egypt.
00:38:10,00:38:13,"Which was, a man narrowly misses a bus,"
00:38:13,00:38:15,takes off down the street in pursuit.
00:38:15,00:38:16,He's so fast that he catches up with the bus
00:38:16,00:38:18,at the end of the Block-and-Homp subordinate.
00:38:18,00:38:20,"The conductor, seeing his feet,"
00:38:20,00:38:22,only charges him half-fair.
00:38:22,00:38:25,"So, here's what you need to know, apparently."
00:38:25,00:38:27,"In 1967, I didn't get the joke."
00:38:27,00:38:28,I loved it if you're ready for set.
00:38:28,00:38:29,"Yes, I love it."
00:38:29,00:38:30,I love the joke.
00:38:30,00:38:31,It's not gone well this year.
00:38:31,00:38:33,I didn't love the joke with an afterwards.
00:38:33,00:38:36,"Well, I guess these things were all contextual."
00:38:36,00:38:38,They all killed contextually.
00:38:38,00:38:40,"So, Egyptian military personnel"
00:38:40,00:38:43,got 50% off on buses on public transport.
00:38:43,00:38:46,And they had just been beaten in the '67 war
00:38:46,00:38:49,"in a way that was so bad that even in their own country,"
00:38:49,00:38:52,they sort of had like a reputation for retreating.
00:38:52,00:38:54,That was like sort of not unlike the way
00:38:54,00:38:57,"that we think about the French in like today,"
00:38:57,00:38:58,in terms of comedy.
00:38:58,00:39:00,"Oh, so the bus driver sees this guy running."
00:39:00,00:39:03,And he thinks this guy is running so fast
00:39:03,00:39:05,that the only way he could be running this fast
00:39:05,00:39:07,is if he's a soldier in retreat.
00:39:07,00:39:11,"So therefore, he gets 50% off on the bus."
00:39:11,00:39:15,"But some jokes are, some jokes do seem to be quite timeless."
00:39:15,00:39:19,"So that one, very specific to 1968, I guess, in Egypt."
00:39:19,00:39:23,But how about this one from the 5th century BC?
00:39:23,00:39:25,This is from ancient Roman joke books.
00:39:25,00:39:28,So it was told it was recounted a bit later.
00:39:28,00:39:30,But it's based on the 5th century BC
00:39:30,00:39:34,"and a Macedonian king was asked by his barber,"
00:39:34,00:39:35,"""How should I cut your hair?"""
00:39:35,00:39:37,So the Macedonian king was Archelaus.
00:39:37,00:39:40,"And the barber asked him, ""How should I cut your hair?"""
00:39:40,00:39:43,And Archelaus replied in silence.
00:39:43,00:39:45,"That's attributed to Churchill, I've seen that."
00:39:45,00:39:47,And to Enoch Powell.
00:39:47,00:39:48,Oh.
00:39:48,00:39:50,"But nicking it, all these classes is."
00:39:50,00:39:52,And nicking it from the Macedonian king.
00:39:52,00:39:53,Wow.
00:39:53,00:39:55,He probably nicks it from someone else.
00:39:55,00:39:56,So right.
00:39:56,00:39:58,"Researching this, the thing that I found the most interesting"
00:39:58,00:40:02,"was like things, I guess, comedy fads throughout history"
00:40:02,00:40:05,that had their moment and then just totally disappeared.
00:40:05,00:40:07,"Like, sorry to read again."
00:40:07,00:40:09,"But I do want to give credit to Ken Jennings,"
00:40:09,00:40:12,"who by the way, he's written this book called Planet Funny."
00:40:12,00:40:15,And it is really funny and a really good history of comedy.
00:40:15,00:40:18,"And Ken, trivia wise, could give anyone on the planet"
00:40:18,00:40:22,"to run for their money because he won 74 episodes of Jeopardy in a row,"
00:40:22,00:40:24,which is $2.1 million.
00:40:24,00:40:26,But so Abraham Lincoln gathered his cabinet
00:40:26,00:40:31,"to the White House early on September 22nd, 1862."
00:40:31,00:40:34,And his Secretary of War was really annoyed
00:40:34,00:40:36,"because he had a lot of this plate at the time,"
00:40:36,00:40:38,because it was the Civil War.
00:40:38,00:40:42,And the president was reading very popular series of books
00:40:42,00:40:45,"from a really popular book by Artemis Ward,"
00:40:45,00:40:47,who was a country-fried humorist
00:40:47,00:40:49,that sort of explored American comedy
00:40:49,00:40:51,to London in the 1860s.
00:40:51,00:40:54,And it was sort of like the president doing anchor man quotes.
00:40:54,00:40:56,"Like it was very, very popular."
00:40:56,00:40:58,And sort of hack.
00:40:58,00:41:02,And he was reading a sketch called the High-Handed Outrage at Utica
00:41:02,00:41:05,about a traveling salesman trying to impress upstate New Yorkers
00:41:05,00:41:08,with wax figurines of the 12 apostles.
00:41:08,00:41:11,And a local ruffian ruins his trip
00:41:11,00:41:13,by pounding his Judas stash you all the hell
00:41:13,00:41:15,and the fit of religious forever.
00:41:15,00:41:17,And he was laughing really loudly
00:41:17,00:41:18,by the time he got to the end.
00:41:18,00:41:22,"And Stanton says, without a single member of the cabinet joining in."
00:41:22,00:41:27,"Undeterred the president, proceed to read a second chapter."
00:41:27,00:41:31,And Stanton said he was about to walk out when the president declared
00:41:31,00:41:34,an end to the open mic night and got to the business at hand.
00:41:34,00:41:36,"Pulling a paper from his trademark hat,"
00:41:36,00:41:38,he read to them a document he had just finished rising
00:41:38,00:41:41,and it decided to issue the Emancipation Proclamation
00:41:41,00:41:43,freeing every slave in the Confederacy.
00:41:43,00:41:44,Whoa.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"But so he loved, so Lincoln loves."
00:41:46,00:41:47,It's amazing.
00:41:47,00:41:50,Loved Frontier humor because everyone loved Frontier humor
00:41:50,00:41:52,but it wasn't something that people bragged about.
00:41:52,00:41:54,"When Lincoln was campaigning against opponents,"
00:41:54,00:41:56,they always tried to portray him
00:41:56,00:41:58,as someone who enjoyed jokes.
00:41:58,00:42:01,"So the image of Lincoln as a Frontier'sman,"
00:42:01,00:42:03,"which became its own genre of comedy,"
00:42:03,00:42:06,"was actually something he spent so much of his life trying to get away from,"
00:42:06,00:42:08,"like a Frontier comedy thing,"
00:42:08,00:42:11,was something that Lincoln really hated his entire life
00:42:11,00:42:14,because it was a real political stab at him.
00:42:14,00:42:19,But he had the misfortune he said of being part of this cultural phase
00:42:19,00:42:23,"of like corny comedy, literally coming from the word corny"
00:42:23,00:42:26,and came from like this idea of people who liked these jokes
00:42:26,00:42:27,as cornfed picks.
00:42:27,00:42:28,Really?
00:42:28,00:42:29,Yeah.
00:42:29,00:42:33,"And so comedy fads throughout history are like very, very interesting."
00:42:33,00:42:34,"Yeah, really interesting."
00:42:34,00:42:37,And just back onto what's he called night heart?
00:42:37,00:42:38,Night heart.
00:42:38,00:42:42,"Yeah, so he was basically the biggest poet of his age."
00:42:42,00:42:47,"Before that, there was a lot of poetry and a lot of stories about nights"
00:42:47,00:42:48,and stuff like that.
00:42:48,00:42:51,But he was the first one who talked about villages
00:42:51,00:42:54,and that's why he had all this kind of scatological humour.
00:42:54,00:42:56,Is the scatological element?
00:42:56,00:42:58,"The smell, is that a big part of the comedy?"
00:42:58,00:42:59,It was a big part of their lives.
00:42:59,00:43:00,Yeah.
00:43:00,00:43:02,But Farts have always been funny as well.
00:43:02,00:43:04,"You look back through over the centuries,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,people are always making fart jokes.
00:43:06,00:43:11,There was a really cool series of Japanese scrolls
00:43:11,00:43:14,"that were discovered about 20 years ago, I think,"
00:43:14,00:43:18,and they're from the 17th and 19th century from the Edo period.
00:43:18,00:43:21,And they are just literally pictured after picture of people having fart battles.
00:43:21,00:43:24,"And no one knows why, but people drop their trousers"
00:43:24,00:43:27,and they're blasting these massive farts at each other.
00:43:27,00:43:30,And it shows the farts knocking people over and uprooting trees.
00:43:30,00:43:34,It shows someone sitting cross-legged on the top of two massive farts
00:43:34,00:43:36,being tossed up at him.
00:43:36,00:43:37,"It's bizarre, we don't know why."
00:43:37,00:43:39,"We think that it's probably metaphorical,"
00:43:39,00:43:41,as opposed to they had incredible flashes.
00:43:41,00:43:43,"Oh, nobody knows."
00:43:43,00:43:51,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts."
00:43:51,00:43:52,Thanks so much for listening.

00:44:51,00:44:55,We're not doing it.
