00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.520
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's show

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.440
 which was recorded live in the wonderful city

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.420
 of Christchurch, the furthest away

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.860
 that we have ever been from home.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.140
 Unfortunately, Andrew Hunter Murray was not here

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.260
 for this show, he was unexpectedly called back

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.580
 to the UK for personal reasons, but in his place,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.580
 we had the unbelievably brilliant Josh Thompson.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.860
 Now, those of you who like a New Zealand comedy

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.120
 like I do will know all about Josh.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.700
 He has been on New Zealand Taskmaster,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.480
 he's been on the Guy Montgomery/Guymont spelling bee,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.980
 which by the way, if you've never seen that,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.180
 you have to go into YouTube and look for episodes of that

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.540
 'cause it's a brilliant show.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.940
 He's also been in the New Zealand version of The Office,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.980
 but in this show, he came on and was absolutely brilliant,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.000
 told us a whole load of facts that we didn't know

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.840
 about New Zealand.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.860
 I'm really sure you're gonna love this show.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.140
 It's the last one of our talk, can you believe it?

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.980
 We'll be back to normal programming in a couple of weeks' time,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.620
 but anyway, I really hope you enjoy the show with Josh.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.060
 And what else is there to say,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.500
 apart from on with the podcast.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.080
 (upbeat music)

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.660
 (upbeat music)

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:23.160
 (audience cheers)

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.420
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.920
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.780
 this week coming to you live from Christchurch.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.780
 (audience cheers)

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.380
 My name is Dan Schuyler.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.460
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.700
 James Harkin, and Josh Thompson.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.060
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.920
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.380
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.820
 Starting with fact number one,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.040
 and that is Josh.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.040
 - Well, my fact is that the first people

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.720
 to achieve powered flight were not actually

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.640
 the American Wright brothers.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.480
 (audience cheers)

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.640
 They know it well here, we're not the Wright brothers,

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.400
 but actually a lone eccentric New Zealand farmer

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.340
 called Cranky Dick Pierce.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.840
 (audience laughs)

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.000
 - Somebody tells me that the people of Christchurch

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.280
 might have come across this guy before.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.700
 - Yeah, well, there's an airport about two hours from here

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.720
 in a town called Temeru, where I was born, yes.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.080
 (audience cheers)

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.700
 And that is named Richard Pierce Airport,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.740
 after he flew about two hours drive away from here.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.100
 - Wow, amazing.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.540
 - So the Wright brothers flew in Kitty Hawk in America

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.180
 in December, 1903, but Richard Pierce actually flew

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.780
 in March, 1903.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.380
 - 'Cause there's a lot of conflicting accounts,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.220
 and you should--

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.200
 - I'm so totally sure.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.720
 - The ocean, yeah.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.480
 - Here's the only problem, right, is that,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.960
 and I see where Anna's coming from,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.560
 the Wright brothers, when they did it,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.680
 they have a photo and they had lots of people who saw it.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.680
 The issue with old Cranky Dick is that we have nothing.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.640
 We have bits of the plane and full bits of the plane,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.240
 but the original one, no one took a photo

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.620
 and no one saw it happen.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.460
 And--

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.300
 - What, loads of people saw it happen?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.300
 - Sorry, loads of people saw it happen,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.020
 but by the time they were properly interviewed about it,

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.780
 most of them were dead.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.580
 - I heard that there were some photos,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.340
 but they got destroyed in a flood.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.140
 - Yeah, there were a lot of convenient destruction

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.140
 of photos.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.980
 (audience laughs)

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.780
 But the real, I think the main thing Richard Pierce

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.060
 had working against him was that he was a New Zealander,

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.540
 and in New Zealand, we don't like to show off, so.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.380
 - Yeah.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.980
 - So while the Wright brothers had your movies

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.340
 and your photos of the event,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.820
 Richard Pierce had a handful of farmers watching,

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.120
 and he had a bit of trouble getting the plane started,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.800
 actually, which happens to the best of us.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.500
 And after a while, right guys?

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.280
 (audience laughs)

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.640
 If there's a lot of farmers watching,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.880
 but they're all pointing and giving instructions.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.400
 After a while, after a while, a lot of the farmers left,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.200
 so there was only a really small handful of people.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.520
 He got the plane going,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.160
 but then he didn't want to gloat about it.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.520
 So he knew the farmers would be like,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.480
 "Oh, okay, I saw your little bicycle plane fly,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.680
 "mate, calm down."

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.920
 (audience laughs)

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.120
 But yeah, he just didn't keep any journals.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.260
 - So was it like a bicycle?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.660
 - No, it was pretty amazing, really.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.900
 He built the entire thing himself.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.340
 So the Wright brothers had a lot of money.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.940
 They sort of connected to the Vanderbilt family,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.260
 and they were commissioning engine parts

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.100
 and stuff like that.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.540
 Richard Pierce built the entire thing himself.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.460
 I've seen the engine.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.540
 Like, the pistons are made from irrigation pipes.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.820
 The cylinders are made from tobacco cans.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.660
 And when you look at it,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.980
 it looks like it's made from tins and cans.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.820
 - Wow.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.580
 - A bunch of baked bean cans

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.080
 stacked together for a high school production.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.000
 (audience laughs)

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.880
 - And the frame was made out of bamboo, right?

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.720
 - Yes, that's right, yes.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.560
 - And so he was also known as bamboo dick.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.400
 - Yes, yes.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.240
 - Yeah.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.480
 - Which grew as famously fast.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.360
 - It's the fastest growing plant on earth.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.880
 Just be careful googling that.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.720
 I had a bit of a--

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.480
 (audience laughs)

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.240
 - Not proud of it, but you know.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.320
 - They did a replica of it to see if it would fly.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.600
 And this was in the 1970s,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.160
 and they made a documentary about it.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.740
 And while they were doing the filming,

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.740
 they attached it to a horse.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.460
 A loud noise happened and the horse bolted.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.700
 And as it ran, the speed that it went at,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.100
 which it pulled the plane into the air.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.940
 - Oh wow.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.420
 - And all the crew saw it flying.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.140
 They went, oh my God, it's flying.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.260
 It actually worked.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.820
 And then it crash-landed.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.260
 And they went, did you get that?

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.540
 And no one was filming.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.100
 - Oh yeah.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.260
 How convenient.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.020
 Why did they tie it to a horse?

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.860
 - I had no idea.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.760
 - That's such a Timaru thing to do.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.160
 (audience laughs)

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.400
 Everything, if you ever go down there,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.440
 everything's tied to a horse, man.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.960
 - Well, Timaru, so not only have you got

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.720
 Richard Pierce airport down there,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.080
 and it is where you are from, where you were born.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.120
 Also, another notable character from there

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.800
 is Farlap, a horse.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.520
 - Yes, yeah, I can't believe it.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.800
 - Farlap was sired there and the father of Farlap

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.960
 was called, what was he called, Night Raid.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.400
 And Night Raid had a bunch of award-winning horses.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.400
 Farlap, which was the biggest,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.860
 there was one called Lady Graceful, Pillow Fight,

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.620
 and one called Peter Jackson.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.460
 - Wow.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.300
 (audience laughs)

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.140
 - Really?

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.480
 - Yeah, for incidents.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.800
 - It is weird.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.340
 Do you know how big a deal they make of him in Australia?

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.340
 It's mad.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.740
 And he's from New Zealand.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.760
 I was astonished.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.140
 It's so odd that they've spread Farlap

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.580
 over three different locations in Australia.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.980
 Like, would you do that to someone you love?

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.580
 They worship this horse for non-Australian-New Zealand

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.420
 listeners.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.140
 Farlap is the biggest celebrity in Australian history.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.600
 (audience laughs)

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.760
 Incredible race horse from the first half of the 20th century.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.600
 It was a very sweet story because a trainer

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.600
 persuaded a businessman to buy him from New Zealand.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.000
 And then he turned up and his face was all covered in warts.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.600
 And so the businessman went, that's disgusting.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.440
 That's a horrible horse.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.840
 No, I'm not gonna pay to train it.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.520
 So the guy trained it for free.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.520
 And yeah, it won all the races there were for ages.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.240
 And then there was an assassination attempt

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.680
 and everything.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.640
 But then when he died,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.300
 they couldn't decide where to keep bits of him.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.220
 So his hide is in Melbourne Museum.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.980
 Skeleton in the, actually a skeleton is in New Zealand,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.820
 I think.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.660
 Oh yeah.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.480
 Yeah?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.320
 That's actually the best bit.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.140
 And I think it's heart.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.980
 I totally, yeah.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.820
 (laughs)

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.140
 You want the bones, mate.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.980
 (laughs)

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.060
 And his heart is in the National Museum of Australia.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.420
 So yeah, you've got the skeleton.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.260
 That's good.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.100
 Farlap.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.940
 Is that a New Zealand thing?

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.780
 Is that what's gonna happen with you, Josh?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.620
 When you go?

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.460
 Yeah, I hope so.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.300
 (audience laughs)

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.300
 It's gonna take a while to get the hide off,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.140
 to be honest.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.180
 (audience laughs)

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.580
 We'll keep the bones at home.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.420
 Yeah.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.680
 Actually, there was a session at the National Museum.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.560
 Farlap was hit by the mob.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.400
 Right?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.240
 Yes.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.640
 This was by shooting, which didn't get him,

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.680
 and he went on to win a race that day.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.840
 The mob, did you say?

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.680
 Yeah.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.380
 Did they leave a human head in his bed?

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.220
 (audience laughs)

00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:01.480
 I think we should really emphasise just quickly,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.840
 going back to this first powered flight,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.920
 which appears how humble he genuinely was.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.700
 When he was interviewed, he refused to take credit almost.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.580
 He misremembered it, so most of the evidence,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.620
 and most people who've researched it,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.860
 agree now that he was the first powered flight.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.660
 It was nine to 18 months before the Wright brothers.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.620
 But when he was asked to remember it,

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.540
 he said, "I don't think I did anything practical with it

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.140
 until 1904," incorrect.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.820
 He was doing it in 1903 or 1902,

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.300
 'cause they interviewed all these sort of

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.500
 80, 90-year-olds in the '70s and '80s, I think,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.780
 who all remembered sort of when in their lives

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.460
 it had happened, they could place it historically,

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.360
 so they could put the event in context.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.040
 But he just said, "You know, know the Wright brothers,

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.520
 they have fair cop, they should get the credit.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.160
 I'm just, you know, no invention is really

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.760
 invented by a single person, it's just all inevitable

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.560
 that someone will come up with it."

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.880
 It was just bizarre.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.800
 The other thing is, the Wright brothers,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.440
 they send it up with a catapult or something.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.280
 It was like--

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.120
 It was down a big rail slide.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.960
 Yeah.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.200
 Yeah, like a sort of water slide, but without water.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.120
 And his one.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.960
 Yeah.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.360
 (audience laughs)

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.720
 Yeah.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.960
 To describe it for you, you might not understand.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.800
 I got it.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.340
 His one was much more like modern planes, right?

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.180
 Yeah.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.020
 Yeah, that's right.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.420
 What's really amazing about it is that he left

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.140
 zero research, and because of that,

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.540
 he had zero impact on the aircraft industry,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.060
 'cause no one knew he existed, no one knew what he did.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.100
 Yet, the Wright brothers had a biplane,

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.940
 they had an engine mounted behind them,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.820
 they had skids instead of wheels,

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.740
 and yet planes evolved to be more like Richard Pierce's

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.780
 plane, which had wheels, a variable-pitch propeller,

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.040
 single-plane engine mounted in front,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.000
 propeller on a center crankshaft.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.080
 So really, bamboo dick was right.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.920
 Yeah.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.760
 (audience laughs)

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.960
 And all on his own, he built the engine on his own.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.200
 He just went to someone, the only other person in New Zealand

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.120
 who knew what an engine was basically at that time.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.960
 He was so fresh, that's not a knock.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.560
 Like 10 years before his flight was the first time

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.560
 that there was a recorded hot air balloon flight

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.400
 in New Zealand.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.240
 Really?

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.080
 Yeah, in 1903.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.840
 So we're talking about, like, there's a lot of tech

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.680
 that wasn't yet here.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.080
 So this guy taught him how to make a machine.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.180
 He then gets on his bicycle to go and collect

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.860
 all the bamboo that he needs for the plane itself.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.940
 So he's just riding in and out of town,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.860
 building this eccentric thing that no one's ever seen before,

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.220
 'cause it doesn't exist, and yeah, and then he does it.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.860
 The guy he worked with, who was the engineer,

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.580
 just had a build on his, you know,

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.940
 everyone works together on this,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.660
 was a huge deal in his own right.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.780
 The engineer who was the guy called Cecil Walkden Wood,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.860
 I don't know how one only is here,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.140
 but he sounded very cool.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.740
 So he made New Zealand's first motorbike

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.740
 and probably first motor car, I think, around 1901,

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.680
 and he powered it with gunpowder.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.520
 Yeah.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.360
 (audience laughs)

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.200
 And he got...

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.540
 (laughs)

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.820
 It goes very fast over a very short time.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.680
 But he bought his gunpowder from a local chemist

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.240
 who was called William Gunn.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.320
 (audience laughs)

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.640
 Brilliant, yeah, the chances, yeah.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.640
 That's great.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.960
 So Richard Pierce's engine that he made himself,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.600
 a Model T Ford engine has 20 horsepower

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.580
 and weighed about 136 kg.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.720
 Richard Pierce's homemade engine out of baked bean cans

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.940
 had 25 horsepower and weighed about 57 kg.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.180
 So, more power and about less than half the weight.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.940
 And the Wright Brothers engine had 12 horsepower and 82 kg.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.540
 I mean, how embarrassing.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.260
 (audience laughs)

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
 Although he did keep crashing it.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.100
 I'm just...

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.300
 One thing I thought, there were like three separate counts

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.940
 of it crashing into a bush.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.540
 It crashed into a bush again.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.380
 Another bush.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.700
 He had a lot of bush.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.240
 (audience laughs)

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.480
 He was a very bad farmer.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.680
 Like apparently his animals were starving.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.960
 He's terrible.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.360
 He didn't care, he didn't care.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.680
 There's only a few instances in which the media

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.120
 had any kind of interest in him whatsoever

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.280
 during his lifetime.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.280
 One happened in 1909.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.640
 At this point, he's a really kind of dishevelled

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.120
 reclusive in his house.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.080
 And they come to him because they wanna interview him

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.960
 about the fact that between June and August of 1909,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.920
 lots and lots of New Zealanders thought

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.740
 that aliens were invading because they kept seeing stuff

00:11:58.740 --> 00:11:59.580
 in the sky.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.460
 People were going, we think either aliens

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.540
 or Germans are invading, we're not sure.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.620
 And they were reporting it to the police.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.540
 There were multiple counts of kids in school,

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.540
 grounds seeing an object land and fly off again.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.860
 And it's gone down in the sort of annals

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.660
 of like UFO cannon of sort of like legit encounters.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.700
 But they went to him at that point and said,

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.500
 "Didn't you try and build one of those things

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.740
 "that was going up?"

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.740
 And that's one of the only interviews that we have

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.120
 during his lifetime, yeah.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.100
 - And what was that point?

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.840
 It was like, are you an alien?

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.680
 - Well, they were.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.520
 - Yeah.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.360
 - What did they think?

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.200
 - No, they were like.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.040
 - Can we go up and get them?

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.880
 Can we use that?

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.400
 - Yeah, or is it possible that we are being visited

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.580
 by you know, Americans who are flying planes

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.320
 who they just haven't told us and like they're going

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.680
 from city to city and so on.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.080
 - You also invented a bike that you don't pedal cyclically.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.080
 You pump up and down with your feet.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:48.920
 - Oh.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.840
 - And it was like a piston bike and it wrote,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.160
 but it also had tires that inflated as you rode.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.000
 - Oh, that's amazing.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.160
 - Which must have been so hard to make.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.820
 I would suggest making better tires in the first place.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.660
 - Yeah.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.780
 - But it was like, these bloody tires keep getting flat.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.700
 But I've seen the picture of that bike

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.460
 and the tires are flat.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.300
 - Really?

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.760
 - So maybe, maybe he was right.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.340
 - Well, 'cause you do, well, if you're not a cyclist,

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.020
 you don't want to waste air.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:12.860
 You know?

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.560
 (laughing)

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560
 I think that's fair enough.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.900
 I think that's a good point.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.240
 - Yeah, eco-friendly.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.140
 - I thought I'd look at a few more local achievements

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.280
 as soon as we're in Christchurch.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.380
 So I went on the Guinness World Records

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.980
 and I found out that the largest ever game of leapfrog

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.820
 was in Christchurch.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.820
 It involved 1,348 participants.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.660
 - Okay.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.060
 - Which I think, by coincidence,

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.020
 is the exact number of people in this building right now.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.220
 (laughing)

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.940
 If you include all the staff and us four,

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.900
 I think it's excited.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.340
 So we could do that.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.180
 - Okay.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.000
 - All right.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.180
 - Slightly messes with the format of the show, but yeah.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.760
 And the most teabags thrown into mugs in 30 seconds

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.120
 for it, for a team of two,

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.440
 (laughing)

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.960
 that was broken in Christchurch in 2021.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.620
 - Wow.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.980
 - It was 11.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.720
 (laughing)

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.600
 - Final thing.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.400
 - The most teabags thrown into mugs in 30 seconds

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.740
 by a team of one is 13.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.480
 (laughing)

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.320
 - Yeah.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.440
 - And one final thing in Christchurch,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.140
 the greatest distance ever run on a treadmill

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.500
 in 48 hours by a female.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.580
 Can you guess how far she ran?

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.740
 - Well, you don't get anywhere, do you?

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.900
 - Yeah, zero miles.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.580
 (laughing)

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.860
 But she thought she'd run 340 kilometers.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.700
 - Okay.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.540
 - Okay.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.380
 - How long is that?

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.220
 - Well, the days when we missed the plane

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.060
 are quite a long way back, aren't they?

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:37.900
 (laughing)

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.260
 - Yeah, I tried to see if there were sort of

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.220
 any notable stories that came out of Timurut,

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.860
 you know, just like any great news stories.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.800
 The only thing I could find was that the

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.760
 Timurut District Council were trying to investigate

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.180
 a missing $5,000 toilet unit.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.060
 They basically just nicked this giant outdoor toilet.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.900
 And yeah, and just, I mean,

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.620
 it doesn't get any more interesting except--

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.540
 - Well, I mean, look, I've dealt with these allegations

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.380
 in the past.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.460
 (laughing)

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.620
 - To be honest, I'm sick of them.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.740
 It's time to move on.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.380
 - Maybe someone tied a horse to it, and they just--

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.620
 (laughing)

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.620
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.940
 Shout out to the journalists, by the way,

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.060
 who ends the piece by saying, "Police are investigating,"

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.380
 but still have nothing to go on.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.220
 - Oh my God.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.840
 (laughing)

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.680
 - Come on.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.960
 - Decisions were made.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.540
 (upbeat music)

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:29.420
 - It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.920
 - My fact this week is that in the 1940s,

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.200
 a law was passed that meant wherever the Dutch princess

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.740
 stood, didn't count as a country.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.680
 - What?

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.900
 - So cool and weird.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.760
 I can't find out another time this has happened,

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.560
 but this is amazing, and I read this in a book,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.660
 which is so fun, and I would recommend.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.260
 I found it on my bookshelves recently.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.220
 It's called Atlas of Extinct Countries by Gideon Defoe,

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.420
 and it's about all sorts of weird nationality quirks.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.380
 And this story, so this is in 1940,

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.940
 Germany invades the Netherlands.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.460
 The Dutch royal family flees, mostly goes to Britain,

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:09.460
 but the princess, crown princess Juliana, went to Ottawa,

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.700
 and she went with her two daughters to Ottawa,

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.780
 while Germany was occupying the Netherlands,

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.160
 and while there, she got herself knocked up,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
 and there was a problem with that,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.400
 because the law in the Netherlands was that no one

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.840
 could be in the line of succession

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.560
 if they were born on the soil of a foreign country,

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.240
 and she only had two daughters at the time,

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.640
 so if she'd had a son,

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.760
 that would have meant he would be presumptive,

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.600
 but he couldn't be 'cause he'd be born in Canada,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.600
 so they had to do something about this,

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.120
 so the government got together with a bunch of lawyers,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.920
 and they concocted a new law,

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.380
 which basically said, wherever this pregnant lady is,

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.020
 isn't Canada, because in case she gives birth,

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.860
 it can't be on Canadian soil.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.380
 - And did the Canadians agree with this?

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.820
 - I think, you know, it's only a small bit of their soil,

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.540
 it's not like you're stealing an acre of land.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.020
 - Well, it depends where she walks, though.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.220
 If she gave birth, sort of, I don't know,

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.000
 in the prime minister's chair or something,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.420
 and then to boot, like.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.580
 - He was probably very careful not to lend him

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.420
 her chair at that time.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.580
 - But was it the case that it was technically

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.320
 born in the Netherlands, or was it just no,

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.480
 it didn't belong to any?

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.480
 - It was weirdly nothing.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.880
 I think maybe making it in the Netherlands

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.040
 would have been even harder,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.320
 and the law was that as long as it's not another country,

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.280
 you're okay, so it was just an extra-territorial zone,

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.120
 basically. - Right.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.240
 - The thing is, if she'd have been born in Canada

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.240
 under normal rules, then she would have been British,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.200
 because anyone who was born in Canada

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.600
 on those days was British,

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.480
 because it was a farm of British colony.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.520
 Although, because she was a Protestant descendant

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.360
 of Sophia of Hanover by British law,

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.520
 she's British anyway.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.360
 - Right.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.080
 - It's one of the weirdest ways to get citizenship

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.580
 of any country, I think.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.900
 But you know, you have to do the tests

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.260
 when you go to different places.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.380
 To be British, all you really have to do

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.380
 is to be a Protestant descendant of Sophia of Hanover,

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.360
 and you're straight in.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.580
 - Really?

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.340
 You know, if you're Dutch and you're in Canada at the time,

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.460
 you know when you see in movies,

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.740
 sometimes someone's running towards an embassy

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.700
 so that they don't get caught.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.580
 Could, if they'd hopped on her shoulders

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.140
 for like a shoulder ride, would they?

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.720
 (audience laughing)

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.680
 - Yeah?

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.800
 - Yeah, but you then have to stay

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.280
 on her shoulders the whole time.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.680
 And as soon as the baby's out, it's Canada again.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.660
 - Yeah, but you make her walk to an embassy.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.960
 - I see, I see, yeah.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.040
 It's probably easier to leg it to the embassy.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.000
 I don't know if you've tried climbing

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.120
 on the shoulders of a nine month pregnant woman, but.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.840
 (audience laughing)

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.680
 Very easy.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.940
 - My wife and I have some really weird kinks.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.640
 (audience laughing)

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.160
 So was this Princess Juliana?

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.000
 - Yes.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.960
 Now, I was unaware of the pregnant thing.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.360
 But I do know that after the war,

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.740
 she gave Canada 100,000 tulip bulbs to say thank you.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.780
 - Gee, that's cool.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.280
 - And I just think 100,000 is too much.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.540
 (audience laughing)

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.440
 Like, you know when, it's just too much, Edmund.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440
 Like, you know when you go to,

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.860
 someone gives you like a bag of tomatoes

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.940
 during tomato season, you go,

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.040
 "Oh, okay, well now I've got to deal with all these tomatoes.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.260
 This fruit flies everywhere."

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.060
 You know, like, they've got to plant

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.340
 100,000 tulip bulbs somewhere.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.800
 They've got to feed them, they've got to keep them alive.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.040
 And you know, when she comes to visit,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.520
 she's going to be like, "Where's my 100,000 tulips?"

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.760
 - I know, you can't hide it.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.680
 - It's not even just that.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.160
 It didn't stop at 100,000.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.080
 She then went on to give them 20,000 more

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.080
 as an extra thanks to the maternity ward

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.860
 in the hospital that she gave birth in,

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.920
 so they could be planted in the grounds.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.600
 And then it became an annual thing.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.240
 She would send them tens of thousands of bulbs

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.400
 every year for her entire reign.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.520
 - To me, it sounds like she's got a lot of tulips

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.400
 hanging around her, she's trying to get rid of them.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.080
 - It sounds like big tulip to me.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.480
 (all laughing)

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.880
 - That's the case of the bulb industry,

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.880
 reaching its claw over the world again.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.860
 (all laughing)

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.960
 - All of Canada's mates always getting tulips

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.920
 as presents, constantly re-gifted.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.120
 That's who they don't know her.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.400
 - This kind of thing did happen

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.440
 in a few other places around that time.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.320
 So in 1945, the British government ceded

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.280
 suite 212 at Claridge's to Yugoslavia.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.400
 So the room, 212, they said,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.280
 "This is now a part of Yugoslavia,

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.120
 "so that the air to Yugoslav throne could be born

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.560
 "on Slavic soil."

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.720
 - So does that mean like the house, like the maids,

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.000
 did they have to go through customs

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.160
 and like paint the room or what?

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.240
 (all laughing)

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.200
 - I guess so.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.360
 According to the story, they got a spade full of soil

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.160
 from Yugoslavia and put it underneath the bed.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.000
 So that not just was it technically Slavic soil,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.320
 it was literally Slavic soil.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.160
 - Yes.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.280
 - I'm not sure if that's true.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.840
 - 'Cause yeah, there's rumors of that kind of stuff

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.200
 with George Washington, there was a statue in London.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.240
 They said that the soil that the statue was placed on

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.120
 was American soil that was imported,

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.160
 so that Washington wasn't technically on British soil.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.720
 But I think that was the tourist guide to tell you that.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.400
 I think that might have been false.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.520
 - It's pretty easy to fake soil.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.960
 (all laughing)

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.360
 I wrote a pretty tight record down in the South Island.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.200
 (all laughing)

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.360
 - Yeah, but on the other hand,

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.400
 having come into New Zealand and Australia,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.400
 it's not that easy to bring soil in, is it?

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.520
 (all laughing)

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.360
 - That's right.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.080
 - He just keeps handing his golf shoes over every time

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.920
 we come into--

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.040
 - This is a great tip, by the way.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.400
 So if you play golf and you bring golf shoes in,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.760
 you have to declare them because they might have soil on them.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.640
 But when you declare them, they clean them for you.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.760
 - Lovely.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.840
 - It's amazing, I've never had such clean golf shoes.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.040
 - It's a very expensive way to get your golf shoes cleaned

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.000
 by a ticket to Australia or New Zealand

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.360
 every time you need it done.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.560
 (all laughing)

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.560
 - I was actually reading a few of the other fun

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.560
 weird nationality examples in this book,

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.120
 "The Atlas of Extinct Countries."

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.400
 One of my favorites is something called

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.600
 "The Republic of Goose," which is a village.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.240
 It's in the mountains of Southwestern France.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.240
 It's a little hamlet, but it's this weird thing

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.960
 happened in the 19th century where this rumor spread

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.920
 that it was its own independent republic.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.120
 It's quite hard to work out where it came from.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.400
 I think an MP referred to it as a republic in 1827.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.640
 And you go back through newspaper archives

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.840
 and there'll be stories in the American newspaper saying,

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.880
 "Well, of course, there's this tiny village of Goose,"

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.520
 which is its own independent republic in France.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.040
 It had no legal basis, but two things I like about it.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.240
 One is that according to an 1896 article

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.960
 from an American tourist who went there,

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.760
 the women there remained beautiful, well into middle life

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.960
 in striking contrast to the lowland women of France.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.800
 (all laughing)

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.920
 That's interesting.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.400
 And the other thing is lowland women,

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.880
 because Goose was on the top of a hill,

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.240
 the other cool thing about it is that

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.360
 it was at least an hour's hike to get down

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.480
 to the bottom of the hill to get anywhere else.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.640
 And when someone dies in Goose, that's a faff.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.840
 So they created a chute out of timber

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.440
 and they just got their corpses whenever anyone died.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.520
 - Like a water slide, but with no water.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.100
 (all laughing)

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:47.720
 - That's absolutely right.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.640
 - Wow, that's very cool.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.200
 - The body just, what a wonderful way to end your life,

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.600
 or to begin death as a little prayer at the top.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.740
 Tip them over the edge,

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.580
 slid them down to the town at the bottom,

00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.420
 which presumably was like,

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.400
 "Stop sliding your dead bodies down here."

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.180
 (all laughing)

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.920
 - That's so funny.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.340
 I got a riddle for you.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.180
 - Okay.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.720
 - Okay, so in 2009, a girl was born in China.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.640
 Her father was a Canadian citizen born in Libya

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.200
 and her mother was a Chinese citizen.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.160
 What was her nationality?

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.600
 - You can have this.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.440
 - So she was born in China.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.280
 - I'd say Chinese.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.100
 - She was born in China.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.220
 Her father was Canadian, but he was born in Libya.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.540
 Her mother was Chinese.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.120
 Now, you would think Chinese,

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.580
 but because the two parents were not married,

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.500
 according to Chinese law,

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.260
 he goes on what the father's nationality was,

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.540
 so she couldn't be Chinese.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.880
 - Okay.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.560
 The daughter was the force.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.140
 (all laughing)

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.260
 - Okay, so.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.760
 (all laughing)

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.600
 - Or.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.300
 - Let's pretend he never said that.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.300
 - Or Libyan.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.460
 - So he didn't have his Libyan citizenship anymore

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.020
 'cause he'd renounced that 'cause he'd moved to Canada.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.920
 But according to Canadian law,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.420
 you could only be Canadian if you were born in Canada

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.260
 or if one of your parents was born in Canada

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.860
 and he wasn't born in Canada.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.780
 - Oh my gosh, she didn't, she had nothing.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.020
 - Well, the answer is she was Irish.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.220
 (all laughing)

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.660
 So I'm quite surprised she didn't get that, Josh, actually.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.700
 - No, I was gonna say Scottish, which is different.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.020
 It's different, but it's Indonesian,

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.780
 and I was pretty close mentally.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.300
 Mentally, that was pretty close.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.540
 - Why?

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.180
 - It turned out that the father's father was born in Ireland

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.820
 and you can get Irish citizenship

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.340
 if your grandparents are from there.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.060
 So since she couldn't get any of the others,

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.900
 they gave her Irish citizenship.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:38.740
 - Very good, good old Ireland.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.540
 - And then eventually it got in the news and stuff

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.660
 and the Canadians went,

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.780
 "Oh yeah, we should probably give her Canadian citizenship."

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.740
 So she did get that in the end, but yeah.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.860
 - Oh, Ireland is always sort of scooping up the rejects

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.700
 from the rest of the world.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.780
 It's so nice.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.100
 - And in a very nice way.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.180
 I remember when we were in the EU

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.580
 and sort of everyone found a very, very distant

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.820
 bit of Irish ancestry about it.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.700
 Yeah, we'll have you.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.380
 Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.220
 Come on in.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.060
 (all laughing)

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.820
 - Well, I went, I mean, I'm loving all this stuff,

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.380
 but I really dug deep on the tulip buzz.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.300
 (all laughing)

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.020
 And I went down quite a rabbit hole

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.220
 of terrible gifts from royal families.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.060
 - Really nice.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.540
 - And in 1851, Queen Victoria

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.620
 sent American president of the United States.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.220
 (all laughing)

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.220
 You see, the Queen Victoria sent the president,

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.580
 Millard Fillmore, a 1,000 pound block of cheddar cheese.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.420
 - Wow.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.340
 - That's 450 KGs, it's nearly half a tonne of cheddar.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.300
 - Wow, so like a week's supply almost.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.620
 (all laughing)

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.860
 - Well, apparently it's quite hard to transport

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.700
 and became quite smelly.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.140
 So, I think it was meant to cement

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.380
 American-British relations, but it just stank.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.700
 So.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.300
 And in the 1860s, Napoleon III of France

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.340
 sent Emperor Maximilian of Mexico

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.940
 a stuffed alligator wearing a crown.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.660
 (all laughing)

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.180
 Again, to celebrate the French-backed emperor's rule

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.580
 over Mexico, but everyone thought it was just a bit weird.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.940
 - Yeah, tacky, it's tacky.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.180
 It goes in the guest room, that.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.020
 - And there's a more recent one.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:12.860
 You guys might know about this.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.940
 I don't know if this is controversial,

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.820
 but Prince Charles, who was Prince at the time.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.900
 (all laughing)

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.540
 Guys, I've got a lot of facts.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.860
 (all laughing)

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.820
 He visited Haiti as they were recovering from an earthquake

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.820
 and he gifted them a jar of sand from the Dead Sea.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:28.660
 - Wow. - And it was seen

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.140
 as not particularly helpful.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.940
 (all laughing)

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.220
 If anything, the last thing you want after an earthquake

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.260
 is more dirt.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.100
 (all laughing)

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.940
 - We've got to move on in a sec, guys.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.100
 - There's sort of about diplomatic quirks

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.620
 and I kind of love all the weird diplomatic quirks

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.260
 and immunities there are.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.220
 I think actually my favorite example

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.180
 of like a diplomatic rule that's made,

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.500
 it was in 1917.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.900
 I don't think we've talked about Lenin's train trip

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.300
 back to the Russian Revolution,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.220
 which was the thing that triggered the Russian Revolution.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.180
 So in 1917, Lenin was taken in a secret sealed train,

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.820
 which was kind of officially given Russian embassy status.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.660
 He was taken from Zurich to Petersburg,

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.740
 sort of so that he could start the revolution.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.060
 It was arranged by Germany

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.380
 because Germany wanted to weaken the Russian war effort

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.580
 at the time and it thought the best way to do this

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.140
 is to get this crazy revolutionary

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.940
 to go and start a revolution there.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.140
 So the Germans sort of sent Lenin back.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.460
 So it was quite awkward because Germany and Russia are at war,

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.620
 but they're sharing a train together

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.660
 and helping each other out.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.340
 So they drew a chalk line

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.260
 down the middle of the train carriage

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.860
 and all the German sort of soldiers and guards

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.460
 stood on one side and Lenin and his mates stood on the other.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.980
 And it's such a conflicted journey.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.980
 They had to swap carriages about four times.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.580
 So they always had to get off, get on, redraw the line.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.780
 Say, you're not allowed to cross over.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.060
 But the thing I actually love most about this,

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.420
 because it's such a nice insight into Lenin's mind,

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.780
 is he also organized a bathroom rotor?

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.860
 So on this train,

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.700
 there was one bathroom between 34 people,

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.580
 half Russians, half Germans.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.340
 Lenin had forbidden anyone to smoke on the train

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.060
 except in the bathroom.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:07.940
 This caused a problem

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.980
 because everyone kept hogging the bathroom.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.220
 So he started issuing passes.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.300
 He's on his way to start the greatest revolution

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.540
 of the 20th century.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.340
 He was issuing bathroom passes

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.260
 and you got a second-class pass

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.700
 if you needed to have a cigarette

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.260
 and you got a first-class pass

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.700
 if you needed, you know, to...

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.420
 - And number two, go on. - Have a number two.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.620
 Or a number one, you know?

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.780
 He didn't distinguish between those in the pass system.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.420
 So you could.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.340
 There's Lenin like, you want a week?

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.020
 Yes, there's a first-class pass

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.260
 and that gave you priority

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.700
 and you got to bang on the door and say,

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.020
 "Oi, smoker, get out."

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.900
 - Amazing. - And that's, um...

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.260
 Just... That's... I find that really entertaining.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.060
 LAUGHTER

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.660
 - What's that? - Good old Lenin.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.660
 - Good old Lenin. - Good old Lenin, you know?

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.700
 Not enough people talk about that side of him.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.420
 - That's the answer. - The bathroom monitor side.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:29:03.140
 It is time for fact number three,

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.460
 and that is my fact.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.860
 My fact this week is that the Marine snail,

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.820
 Litorina saxotillus,

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.060
 is otherwise known as the most

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.620
 misidentified creature in the world.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.380
 It has been wrongly identified as a new species

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.340
 over 113 times

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.580
 and was first described in 1792.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.220
 - This is astonishing. - That's crazy.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.660
 - It's crazy. - 'Cause it just looks like a little snail.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.500
 Yeah, it's a little rough periwinkle,

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.220
 is the kind of snail.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.420
 And, yeah, it's a snail that just comes in different shapes,

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.140
 different sizes, different colours.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.260
 Yeah, and so as a result, people keep finding it and going,

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.260
 "Wow, this is new," and giving it a new name,

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.580
 and then people eventually just go,

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.780
 "Sorry, that is the periwinkle.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.660
 "We need to bring that back to the old name."

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.980
 As far as I could tell,

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.660
 'cause it's a bit hard to get the full list,

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.980
 but I have seen a list, sometimes it's been named six times

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.060
 as a new species by the same people.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.860
 LAUGHTER

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.700
 - Which is wild. - That's so funny.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.980
 It's like every new human you met thinking there were different species

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.860
 'cause they're wearing different clothes, basically.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.940
 - Yes. - 'Cause they do have this real variety.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.900
 I don't know how people do it who are naming these things.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.180
 The problem with them is that they adapt incredibly quickly.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.620
 They're amazing, so if they find themselves in a different situation suddenly,

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.020
 some are a bit cold, some are a bit scary,

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.660
 some are a bit rocky and exposed,

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.180
 they'll exploit the genes within them,

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.740
 'cause they've got huge genetic variation,

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.660
 they'll exploit the genes within them that make them turn bright red

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.460
 or make them go really small or make them get a really thicker shell.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.340
 So that's why every single one that's completely different.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.460
 - Yeah, and this isn't just with this particular species.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.100
 So there's a big group we're called the World Register of Marine Species,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.020
 or Worms, and they have been going through, exhaustively,

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.660
 the giant list that we have of all the names of all the species out there,

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:55.260
 and they've discovered that they've had to reassess 190,400 of them

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.660
 because they're duplicates and they need to be taken away.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:03.380
 So yeah, we have 228,450 accepted species,

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.900
 as it stands, that number is growing all the time.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.500
 - It's almost half, they went back and looked at the list and were like,

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.180
 "Half of these are shit, they're just that guy in a hat."

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.820
 - I just don't know how you could misidentify,

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.020
 I'm not a "Guess Your Pod" mollusk guy,

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.180
 I'm more on a bi-valve buzz,

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:26.340
 but if I got a trial to draw a picture of something they found at the beach,

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.540
 it would be this, it's the most common thing I've ever seen.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:33.820
 - I've got to say, I'm not actually sure if that's the tale we're talking about.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.180
 - And I've just got to say that people listening at home

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.900
 don't know what we're pointing at, so as far as that concerned,

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.180
 this is exactly what it is.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.020
 - That's right.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.460
 - It could go the other way, of course,

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:48.460
 there's a lot of things that look identical and turn out to be completely different.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.780
 So, for instance, there were some researchers looked at the DNA

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.380
 of 643 bird species in North America,

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.820
 and they found 15 new species that looked identical to other things,

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.300
 but when they checked the DNA, it turned out they were completely different,

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.660
 because they just looked like little brown birds.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.260
 - It's so weird, I always wonder with taxonomy,

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.260
 there must come a point where you think, "Why are we doing this? Why does it..."

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:15.500
 Is it that this bird doesn't care that it's a slightly different type of bird to this bird?

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.140
 Why do I care?

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.100
 - I guess we would know if things go extinct, if we put them in big databases.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.820
 - Yeah, I know, but that's the thing, if it's very similar to this thing,

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.500
 then I know this is a very controversial thing to say, though,

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.620
 in the age of climate change, I'm going to back out.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.900
 But I think one thing that epitomizes it is the giraffe problem, right?

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:39.380
 So, I think, we thought for many hundreds of years that there's one species of giraffe,

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.980
 and then very recently it's been thought that actually giraffes are split into four different species,

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:50.660
 and that means that giraffes suddenly go from being a bit of a worry to very endangered,

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.020
 because now that there are four species, each species has far fewer members.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:54.620
 - Oh, yeah.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:59.420
 - And it seems like there's such a weird categorization that we put on stuff to say to this giraffe,

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.700
 "Hey, mate, did you know yesterday that you were fine, but today you're in serious trouble?"

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.780
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:04.660
 - What?

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.660
 - Oh, that is interesting.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:12.540
 It's as well, the worms, that unit, they've made estimates about what there is out there still to find,

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:17.180
 and they think there are still 10,000 new marine species waiting to be found

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:21.620
 that are sitting exclusively in the back rooms of museums that have been collected.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:25.260
 And actually, that is a big thing in the world of curation with museums.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:30.380
 A lot of new species are discovered in the boxes that they have there as opposed to in the field.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.020
 We went behind the scenes at the Natural History Museum in London.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:39.460
 There are still boxes that Darwin collected from the beagle that have not been properly studied yet.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.260
 - It's incredible.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:40.740
 - Yeah.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:46.060
 - There was one person at University College London who left the job, I think they retired,

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.140
 and they left a bottle of homemade plum brandy in the drawer.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:55.700
 And then when they actually looked at it, they found out that it wasn't a macerated plum in the brandy.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.580
 It was actually a testicle, Brackett's Species Unknown.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.180
 And they've added it to the collection.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:04.820
 - Really?

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.460
 - Hopefully one day we'll find out what kind of testicle that was.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.980
 It was a good job they didn't drink it.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.100
 - Yeah.

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.220
 You know, that reminds me of a great New Zealand invention.

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.100
 We talked about that earlier in the show.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.900
 Is that New Zealand innovated the glory hole that doctors use.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.300
 - No, no, no, no, no.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.260
 - No, this is...

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.660
 - Those pervert doctors.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.460
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:31.500
 - This is specifically for doctors and for people who are too embarrassed to have their testicles checked.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.020
 So what you do is you go in a booth.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.900
 It's kind of like going to Confession and Cheritry.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.540
 - Right?

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.460
 - Actually, it's very similar to my childhood.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.540
 So what you do is you go in and you pull your trousers down

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.940
 and a little door opens with the hole and a hand comes through

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.460
 and it just plays with your testicles and then...

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.060
 - And goes, "Ten Hail Berries!"

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.980
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.140
 - And then just gives you a thumbs up and gets out of there.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:58.740
 Yeah.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.580
 - Is that the thing where you look to your left and cough?

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:02.660
 - I don't know.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.180
 I'm pretty sure he was a doctor.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.500
 - Isn't that a thing where it was in the ward?

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.740
 Like, you...

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.060
 - That is the thing where they get you to cough.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.380
 It feels like they're weighing...

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.020
 - I don't know.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.460
 - One of them jumps up a bit.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.700
 - This really sounds made up.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.020
 - Does it?

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.220
 - Yeah, one of them, like, "Guys, go home tonight

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.020
 "and give a little cup and look to the left and cough."

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.140
 And I think one of them jumps up and I think that is...

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.220
 - Oh, yeah!

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.060
 - Wash your hands.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.140
 - I don't think any of you has been seeing a real doctor.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.980
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.580
 - Wow.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.980
 - That's very funny.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:45.660
 This rough periwinkle, by the way, since we're on "Sexy Facts,"

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.940
 they are famous for basically attempting to mate

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.020
 with any shell that they encounter.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.340
 So they'll find a mucus track and they'll follow it,

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.020
 hoping that there'll be a female at the end of it.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.740
 But whenever they get to anything,

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.700
 whether it's a male, a female, just a shell,

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.100
 doesn't matter what it is, they'll try and have sex with it.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.940
 And the females, on the other hand, are really quite passive.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.420
 If they don't really, they don't try and fight him off

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.540
 or anything like that, they just let him get on with it.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.940
 - It's the first way to do it.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.820
 - She doesn't seem to encourage the male.

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.620
 She just barely even knows.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:24.380
 Sometimes she'll just carry on walking down the road

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.580
 with him on the back, humping away.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.060
 - And yet, they are officially the females,

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.420
 the most promiscuous animal on earth, I think, aren't they?

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.180
 Because they're so passive and the lads are so randy.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.500
 And it's quite extraordinary.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.700
 They don't have an egg-based system.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.980
 They get inseminated internally

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.180
 and then they've got a uterus equivalent,

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.580
 which is very unusual in something like a little snail.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.500
 And so the males will mate with them

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.980
 and I think this little snail penis comes in through her side.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:58.100
 But she can have hundreds of embryos in her uterus

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.780
 that are at various different stages of maturation

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.180
 from loads of different male snails.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:09.260
 And they did a study of four female versions of these snails

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.100
 and they found that over 2.5 months,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.860
 each one had about 70 offspring

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.780
 and on average, they'd have 19 fathers between them.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.460
 - Wow. - So you're storing

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.020
 19 fathers' worth of offspring

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.500
 and when you go into labor, it's fine.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.380
 If you're feeling sorry for them

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.620
 because they're giving birth constantly,

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.180
 sometimes multiple times a day,

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.900
 it doesn't take any effort from them

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.740
 because if they pushed, then all the snails would come out,

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.140
 like if they're not ready ones.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.820
 So the snails themselves crawl out

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.020
 and their little baby snails are known as crawler ways

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.260
 because they literally, they're just like,

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.340
 "I'm ready to go now, got my shell,

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.820
 crawl out and just disappear into the world."

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.620
 - Oh, they come out with a shell on.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.300
 - They come out with a shell on. - Oh!

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.900
 - That's true. - Oh, my God.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.860
 - The bunch of barnacles crawling out.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.660
 I think I might have been on the same website because I...

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.620
 - Oh, I don't think so. - I was looking into conch sex

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:04.220
 and conches are massive sea snails

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.580
 and they are in trouble in Florida

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.940
 because when the water gets too warm,

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.580
 they become sort of sexually lethargic.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.940
 I mean, it happens to the best of us.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.620
 And so there's a team of scientists in Florida

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.940
 because the water's getting hotter

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.140
 who have to go and pick up the conches from the warm areas

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.700
 and take them out into the cooler areas to mate

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.460
 and to encourage them to mate and have sex.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.500
 And I don't know how that...

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.420
 I got uncomfortable searching at that point,

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.620
 but I think that's a lot of sexy talk and a lot of Marvin Gaye music.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.300
 - That's so embarrassing, though.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.860
 They need a human helper, a human fluffer to help them.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:42.380
 - Hey, just while we're talking about sea slugs,

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:47.700
 one thing that I read about is Spongebob Squarepants,

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.940
 the creator, was a marine biologist.

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.260
 And I had no idea about that.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.860
 Yeah, he was called Stephen Hillenberg.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.300
 He sadly passed away in 2018.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.060
 But he's the one who came up with the concept for it.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.220
 He was a marine biologist.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.580
 He was working for the Orange County Marine Institute.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.820
 And while he was there, he created a comic book

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.620
 to explain into title zones.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.140
 So, like, all the pools that you get,

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.020
 where you go and see what's going on in there.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.340
 So he just laid out a bunch of facts in there.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.700
 One of the facts is that one species of sea slug

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.460
 can lay one million eggs in one sitting, right?

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.100
 And that was in there, and he gave it around,

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.660
 and someone saw that and went,

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.900
 "This would be a really good cartoon for kids."

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.540
 And so Spongebob Squarepants is based on a fact book

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.580
 that he did for students at a marine biology place.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.980
 But I don't remember Spongebob giving birth

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.860
 to a million offspring in one sitting.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.420
 That was the pilot they said, "It's great.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.540
 "We have a few tweaks, just a couple of tweaks.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:45.900
 "The barnacle vagina exit is a bit strong.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.420
 "And let's get his pants back on."

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:51.180
 All right, I found a lot of animals that are out there

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.820
 that are just called completely the wrong thing.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.980
 You may be aware of the mantis shrimp.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.620
 They've got a very powerful claw strike.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.300
 It's a very explosive, it can kill.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.380
 It just basically punches a prey to death.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:05.220
 But the mantis shrimp is neither a mantis or shrimp.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.260
 The binterong, commonly known as the bear cat,

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.020
 is neither a bear or a cat.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.740
 And the honey badger is neither a badger or a jar of honey.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.980
 (laughing)

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.580
 - Wow. - Just be careful out there.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.420
 That's all I'm saying.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.260
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.540
 Don't put a honey badger on your toast

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.540
 'cause it will tear you apart.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.700
 (laughing)

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.660
 - There is a, there's a type of frog

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:30.660
 called alabati's niputidia that was described in 2007.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.180
 And it's like a little brown, jobby thing.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.820
 Like, it doesn't really, it's not very impressive.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.260
 And it turns out that it's named after

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.860
 the Spanish phrase niputa idea,

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.020
 meaning I have no fucking idea.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.260
 (laughing)

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.100
 - Brilliant.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:51.140
 - I think that, like, texomonists get things wrong a lot,

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.060
 but also the general public.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.100
 I mean, it's not really their fault,

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.140
 but apparently there's a BBC rescue shelter.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.780
 Sorry, I'm English.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.260
 Sorry, a British rescue shelter.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.740
 - We are, we're all the BBC.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.860
 We all work for the BBC, everyone in the UK.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.340
 - Sorry, sorry.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.980
 - Well, it's like the Conservatives' nightmare.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.420
 You just go, say, "Britain has become the BBC."

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.660
 (laughing)

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.940
 - There was a rescue shelter in Guernsey.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.980
 And the BBC reported that this shelter

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.780
 has been taken a dead cat,

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.220
 which turned out to not be a dead cat,

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.660
 but actually a cuddly dog puppet.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.500
 - What?

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.220
 - Oh, it was just a sock puppet.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.460
 They also got alerted about a sick seal on a beach

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.980
 which turned out to be a duvet.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.820
 (laughing)

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.420
 And an injured bird on the beach,

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.660
 which was basically just a blonde wig.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.740
 - I just, how far are the rescue shelters getting?

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.260
 Is it like the seal's been in there for six days?

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.220
 They've gone, "It's not easy, anything."

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.460
 (laughing)

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.040
 (upbeat music)

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:57.020
 - It is time for our final fact of the show,

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.860
 and that is James.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:03.140
 - Okay, my fact this week is that during World War I,

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.980
 a popular conspiracy theory was that German blackmailers

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:11.980
 had drawn up a list of 47,000 highly placed English perverts.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.700
 (laughing)

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.140
 - A list of 47,000 highly placed English perverts?

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:19.980
 - Yep.

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.220
 - It's like the original Ipsing list.

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.900
 (laughing)

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.700
 - Yeah, it's now known as the BBC.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.940
 (laughing)

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:32.820
 So this is an article in the London review of books

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.100
 that I read about a book called "MI5 and the Great War"

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.660
 by Nigel West.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.900
 And it's basically about the enormous amount

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.620
 of anti-German mania that was going on in Britain,

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:47.780
 especially in America as well in the First World War.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.460
 And there was just these conspiracy theories everywhere

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.420
 that Germany was infiltrating Britain,

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.740
 it was infiltrating America.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.940
 Every German person that you saw in the street

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.460
 might be a spy.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.020
 And there was a guy called Noel Pemberton Billing,

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.900
 who was an MP, and he produced a list

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.100
 of these so-called highly placed British perverts

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.540
 that he said were being blackmailed

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.740
 by the German secret service.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.580
 And that they would basically,

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:15.300
 if they'd infiltrated the upper echelons

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.780
 of British society.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.180
 And once the war started, that was gonna be,

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.380
 we were gonna get taken over.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:22.860
 - And it's quite hard to work out

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.940
 how they thought they planned this to happen.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.180
 So the idea is that the reason that there are these

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:31.780
 47,000 highly placed perverts that they've identified

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.260
 is that the Germans can come over, chat to the perverts,

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.580
 say, "Hello, can you seduce all these other people?"

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.420
 And gradually will remove the manhood of Britain, I think.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.900
 And this guy, what was he called?

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.220
 Pemberton?

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.420
 - Noel Pemberton Billing.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.500
 He said that the Germans are propagating evils

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.540
 which all decent men thought had perished

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.180
 in Sodom and Lesbian.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.300
 And there was a lot of homophobia there.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.660
 So there was lots of, you know,

00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.180
 they would find loads of gay people.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.820
 They'll seduce loads of other people into being gay.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.660
 And the whole of Britain will lose the war because of that.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:07.620
 It's so hard to work out what we thought the plan was.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.940
 - No, I think that's the thing.

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.580
 The thing about conspiracy theories is,

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.220
 they do tend to fall down quite early now.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.020
 I think the thing for me is, like,

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.500
 how do you define what a pervert is?

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.820
 Like, but also, how do you define

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.940
 what a German thinks a pervert is?

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.380
 - Yes. - Oh, that's true.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.620
 - On my moderate online research,

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:33.620
 the Germans enjoy a wide spectrum of night-time activities.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.580
 Like, how do you know what they think is perverse?

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.740
 - Well, I mean, of course,

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.900
 the British royal family is German in heritage,

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.660
 and I wouldn't say any of those guys are perverts.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.500
 (laughter)

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.540
 I don't think any of us would.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.340
 - But basically, I think, I mean,

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.340
 there was a lot of homophobia there for certain,

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.460
 but they were quite nebulous in their definitions.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.940
 And for instance, when Pemberton Billing was sued for libel,

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.900
 he immediately added the name of the judge

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.580
 to his list of perverts.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.860
 - Yeah, it's...

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.380
 - He just kind of added anyone that he didn't like in there.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.220
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.740
 - There were a few stars of his claims weren't there.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:13.740
 So there was one star who was called Maude Allen,

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.500
 who was a real focus of his, and she was an actress,

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.740
 and she'd been in a performance of Oscar Wilde's Salome,

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.420
 which had to be a private performance

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.740
 because it was still banned at that time.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:27.220
 And he wrote lots of articles,

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.180
 or he had lots of articles that were propagated

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.540
 about how she was spreading the cult of the clitoris.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.020
 And there were all these suggestions

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.820
 that Maude Allen was a lesbian

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:40.060
 and somehow this conflated with having German sympathies.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.500
 And there were lots of rumors also

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.740
 that she was having an affair with Margot Asquith,

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:46.580
 who was the wife of Herbert Asquith,

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:48.140
 who'd been the prime minister.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.580
 But anyway... - I think that might have been true

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.900
 as well, actually. - Were they true?

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.380
 I just wonder. - Well, it's not...

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.100
 We don't know for sure, but for sure,

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.220
 Margot Asquith paid for her apartment for 20 years

00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:59.500
 after they first met.

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:00.820
 - Well, I take back everything I've said,

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.060
 I think that's true entirely.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:06.300
 But she sued Maude Allen for defamation, basically,

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.020
 because this MP was accusing her of all these things.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.940
 And one of the people who appeared in court

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:14.940
 in Pemberton Billings' defense,

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.860
 so against Maude Allen saying, "Yes, she's a homosexual,

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.340
 "she's in need with the Germans,

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.540
 "she's having an affair with the ex-PM's wife,"

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.980
 was Alfred Douglas, otherwise known as Bozy.

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.660
 - Oh, Bozy. - Bozy,

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.940
 like Oscar Wilde's old boyfriend.

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.500
 - Yeah, wow. - He turned tail, turn-coated.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.140
 - Yeah, that was weird. - He went that way a bit, Bozy.

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:33.580
 - He did, right at the end, yeah.

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.980
 This whole thing was part of the weird paranoia.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:37.820
 Well, it wasn't weird.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.900
 There was war looming in the distance.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.780
 People were thinking the Germans were coming in,

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:43.740
 they were sussing it out, they were laying spies in there.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.660
 So there's this big push to try and out the spies.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.020
 And one guy, Richard Haldane, set up a committee,

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.460
 the Secret Service Bureau,

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.140
 which was a forerunner to MI5 and MI6.

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.540
 In fact, the people who ran it were

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.420
 Commander Mansfield Cumming and Captain Vernon Kell.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.700
 Both of them did go on to be the front people,

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.940
 the heads of MI5 and MI6.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.340
 What's amazing is that was basically set up,

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.580
 MI5 and MI6, because the two of them didn't get on

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:11.740
 and they couldn't work together

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.100
 in the original Secret Service, yeah.

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.220
 So he was like, you guys are terrible at working together,

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.740
 but you're great, you do six and you do five,

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.380
 and that's why we have MI5 and MI6.

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.140
 - Is that right? - It's an argument, yeah.

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.420
 But also, you look at it, and there's a lot of Germans

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.580
 that were just a bit incompetent who came over anyway.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.580
 You didn't need to be vigilant, they were outing themselves.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:32.340
 There's a guy called Paul Buchwald,

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:35.700
 who adopted the alias Sherlock Holmes when he arrived.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:36.860
 (audience laughing)

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.580
 - Good and dark, Sherlock Holmes, that's like...

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.620
 - That's like me going to America undercover

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.020
 as Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.020
 (audience laughing)

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.140
 - Yeah, I love the paranoia the German paranoia so much,

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:54.540
 because I read that if you encountered a German waiter

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.540
 at a cafe, you were entitled to say no to their service,

00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.780
 and if they said that they were Swiss,

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.620
 you had to be very careful and asked to see their passport.

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.860
 But the head of the Met's Criminal Investigation Department,

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.860
 Basil Thompson, recorded that it was positively dangerous

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:11.140
 to be seen in conversation with the pigeon.

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.820
 - Yes! (audience laughing)

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:14.700
 - And a foreigner walking in one of the parks

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.260
 was actually arrested and sentenced to imprisonment

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.420
 because a pigeon was seen to fly from the place

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.300
 where he was standing, and it was supposed

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.660
 that he had liberated it.

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.500
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.420
 - Wow. - I thought it was a woman's wig.

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.660
 (audience laughing)

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:29.940
 - Brian Pemberton.

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.060
 Cumberbatch, what's his name?

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Pemberton Pemberton.

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.220
 - Joel Pemberton-Billy.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.140
 - No, yes, yes, him.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.260
 (audience laughing)

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.660
 Apparently he had a monocle,

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:41.940
 and the only thing that I could find out about him

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:46.180
 is he had like a piece of flesh inserted into his cheek

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.580
 to keep the monocle in place.

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:48.740
 - Oh! - Oh!

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.820
 - But also just one cheek, like get both done,

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.180
 otherwise you're all gonna be askew.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Wow!

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.020
 - I quite like that idea though,

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.940
 because I have a very small nose,

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:01.140
 and whenever I wear sunglasses, it just keeps falling down,

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.220
 and I'd love a little ledge on there.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.060
 (audience laughing)

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.940
 - Whereas I've got a huge ledge on my nose,

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.580
 I never need glasses if we could do some sort of a swap,

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.100
 like an organ donation.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.620
 - Let's chat after the show.

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:13.700
 - Great.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:14.900
 - I'm happy to donate some flesh

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:16.860
 to anybody who wants to donate,

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.840
 but leave us bones, they're for the kids.

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.660
 (audience laughing)

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.700
 - In America, there was a worry that the Germans

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.220
 were coming over poisoning all the livestock,

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.500
 and this was really, everyone thought this was the case,

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.500
 basically, that all their beef and their animals

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.220
 were getting sick, and it must have been

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.220
 because the Germans were sending over bacteria and stuff.

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.860
 It turned out that the reason was,

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.700
 there was a war happening in Europe,

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.740
 America was shipping out loads and loads of animals over,

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.180
 and they were doing lots of intensive farming,

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.860
 and obviously when you do intensive farming,

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.060
 and you move animals around, they make each other sick,

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.700
 that's what was happening.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.780
 But it turned out that the Germans

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.520
 were trying to make them sick,

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.260
 but they were just failing all the time.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.620
 (audience laughing)

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.620
 - And there was a group of Germans

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:05.300
 who were in a laboratory in Chevy Chase in Maryland,

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.340
 and they were cultivating lots of bacteria

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.340
 that they were gonna put onto these animals,

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.100
 but they just never managed to get it to work,

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.380
 but it didn't matter 'cause the animals would get sick anyway.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.460
 - How did Chevy Chase feel about it, Ernest?

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.500
 (audience laughing)

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.780
 It's a weird subplot to your story there.

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.260
 (audience laughing)

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.900
 - Chevy Chase is a place, as we've said before,

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.700
 where the battle of Chevy Chase was.

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:26.980
 - That's right, yes.

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:29.340
 - And then there was a ballad of the battle of Chevy Chase,

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.660
 and then Chevy Chase, the actor,

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:32.940
 was named after the ballad of the battle

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:35.540
 of the place of Chevy Chase.

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.460
 - There you go.

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.140
 Don't you wish you'd never asked Ernest?

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:41.140
 (audience laughing)

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:47.100
 - We're gonna have to wrap up very soon, guys.

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:48.300
 Anything before we do?

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.260
 - The paranoia went the other way as well,

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.620
 so in Germany, they were very paranoid

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:56.180
 that there might be British spies or American spies there,

00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:00.900
 and at one stage, there was a lady's maid who was on a train,

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.140
 and she was strip searched in Germany,

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:05.740
 and they found secret writing on her bottom,

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:09.860
 and they photographed her bum,

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.300
 and they sent it to German military intelligence

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.740
 and put her in prison,

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.300
 and it turned out that what she'd done

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.500
 is 'cause she was worried

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.500
 that the train toilet would be dirty,

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.620
 she'd covered the seat with her newspaper,

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.220
 (audience laughing)

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:27.140
 and it was backwards writing from the Frankfurter Z-Tung

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.620
 newspaper. - Right.

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.740
 It sounds like classic pervert behavior today.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.020
 (audience laughing)

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.580
 I think there's some writing on your bum.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:34.740
 I better take a photo.

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.380
 (audience laughing)

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.620
 We've all tried that, but...

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.660
 - But presumably the newspaper headlines

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.100
 would have read things like, you know,

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:44.540
 Germans about to invade, and so...

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.180
 - You know, Lenin's knocking on the door.

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.300
 Have you got the talk in?

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.540
 (audience laughing)

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:49.860
 Not your turn!

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.620
 (audience laughing)

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.200
 (upbeat music)

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.780
 - That is it.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:58.860
 That is all of our facts.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.860
 Thank you so much to Josh.

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.980
 Thank you so much, Christchurch.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.540
 It's absolutely, that's the end of our tour.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.700
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

 We'll see you then.

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.980
 Good-bye!

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.980

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.980
