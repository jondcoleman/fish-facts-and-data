1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,520
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's show

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,440
 which was recorded live in the wonderful city

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,420
 of Christchurch, the furthest away

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,860
 that we have ever been from home.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,140
 Unfortunately, Andrew Hunter Murray was not here

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,260
 for this show, he was unexpectedly called back

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,580
 to the UK for personal reasons, but in his place,

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,580
 we had the unbelievably brilliant Josh Thompson.

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,860
 Now, those of you who like a New Zealand comedy

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,120
 like I do will know all about Josh.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,700
 He has been on New Zealand Taskmaster,

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,480
 he's been on the Guy Montgomery/Guymont spelling bee,

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,980
 which by the way, if you've never seen that,

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,180
 you have to go into YouTube and look for episodes of that

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,540
 'cause it's a brilliant show.

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,940
 He's also been in the New Zealand version of The Office,

18
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,980
 but in this show, he came on and was absolutely brilliant,

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,000
 told us a whole load of facts that we didn't know

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,840
 about New Zealand.

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,860
 I'm really sure you're gonna love this show.

22
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,140
 It's the last one of our talk, can you believe it?

23
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,980
 We'll be back to normal programming in a couple of weeks' time,

24
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,620
 but anyway, I really hope you enjoy the show with Josh.

25
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,060
 And what else is there to say,

26
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,500
 apart from on with the podcast.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,080
 (upbeat music)

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,660
 (upbeat music)

29
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:23,160
 (audience cheers)

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,420
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,920
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,780
 this week coming to you live from Christchurch.

33
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,780
 (audience cheers)

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,380
 My name is Dan Schuyler.

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,460
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

36
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,700
 James Harkin, and Josh Thompson.

37
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,060
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,920
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,380
 and in no particular order, here we go.

40
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,820
 Starting with fact number one,

41
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,040
 and that is Josh.

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,040
 - Well, my fact is that the first people

43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,720
 to achieve powered flight were not actually

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,640
 the American Wright brothers.

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,480
 (audience cheers)

46
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,640
 They know it well here, we're not the Wright brothers,

47
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,400
 but actually a lone eccentric New Zealand farmer

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,340
 called Cranky Dick Pierce.

49
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,840
 (audience laughs)

50
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,000
 - Somebody tells me that the people of Christchurch

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,280
 might have come across this guy before.

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,700
 - Yeah, well, there's an airport about two hours from here

53
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,720
 in a town called Temeru, where I was born, yes.

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,080
 (audience cheers)

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,700
 And that is named Richard Pierce Airport,

56
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,740
 after he flew about two hours drive away from here.

57
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,100
 - Wow, amazing.

58
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,540
 - So the Wright brothers flew in Kitty Hawk in America

59
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,180
 in December, 1903, but Richard Pierce actually flew

60
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,780
 in March, 1903.

61
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,380
 - 'Cause there's a lot of conflicting accounts,

62
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,220
 and you should--

63
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,200
 - I'm so totally sure.

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,720
 - The ocean, yeah.

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,480
 - Here's the only problem, right, is that,

66
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
 and I see where Anna's coming from,

67
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,560
 the Wright brothers, when they did it,

68
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,680
 they have a photo and they had lots of people who saw it.

69
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,680
 The issue with old Cranky Dick is that we have nothing.

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,640
 We have bits of the plane and full bits of the plane,

71
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,240
 but the original one, no one took a photo

72
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,620
 and no one saw it happen.

73
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,460
 And--

74
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,300
 - What, loads of people saw it happen?

75
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
 - Sorry, loads of people saw it happen,

76
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,020
 but by the time they were properly interviewed about it,

77
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,780
 most of them were dead.

78
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,580
 - I heard that there were some photos,

79
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,340
 but they got destroyed in a flood.

80
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,140
 - Yeah, there were a lot of convenient destruction

81
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,140
 of photos.

82
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,980
 (audience laughs)

83
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,780
 But the real, I think the main thing Richard Pierce

84
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,060
 had working against him was that he was a New Zealander,

85
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,540
 and in New Zealand, we don't like to show off, so.

86
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,380
 - Yeah.

87
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,980
 - So while the Wright brothers had your movies

88
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,340
 and your photos of the event,

89
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,820
 Richard Pierce had a handful of farmers watching,

90
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,120
 and he had a bit of trouble getting the plane started,

91
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,800
 actually, which happens to the best of us.

92
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,500
 And after a while, right guys?

93
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,280
 (audience laughs)

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,640
 If there's a lot of farmers watching,

95
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,880
 but they're all pointing and giving instructions.

96
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,400
 After a while, after a while, a lot of the farmers left,

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,200
 so there was only a really small handful of people.

98
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,520
 He got the plane going,

99
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,160
 but then he didn't want to gloat about it.

100
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,520
 So he knew the farmers would be like,

101
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,480
 "Oh, okay, I saw your little bicycle plane fly,

102
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,680
 "mate, calm down."

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,920
 (audience laughs)

104
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,120
 But yeah, he just didn't keep any journals.

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,260
 - So was it like a bicycle?

106
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,660
 - No, it was pretty amazing, really.

107
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,900
 He built the entire thing himself.

108
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,340
 So the Wright brothers had a lot of money.

109
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,940
 They sort of connected to the Vanderbilt family,

110
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,260
 and they were commissioning engine parts

111
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,100
 and stuff like that.

112
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,540
 Richard Pierce built the entire thing himself.

113
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,460
 I've seen the engine.

114
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,540
 Like, the pistons are made from irrigation pipes.

115
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,820
 The cylinders are made from tobacco cans.

116
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,660
 And when you look at it,

117
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,980
 it looks like it's made from tins and cans.

118
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,820
 - Wow.

119
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,580
 - A bunch of baked bean cans

120
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,080
 stacked together for a high school production.

121
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,000
 (audience laughs)

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,880
 - And the frame was made out of bamboo, right?

123
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
 - Yes, that's right, yes.

124
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,560
 - And so he was also known as bamboo dick.

125
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,400
 - Yes, yes.

126
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,240
 - Yeah.

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,480
 - Which grew as famously fast.

128
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,360
 - It's the fastest growing plant on earth.

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

130
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,880
 Just be careful googling that.

131
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,720
 I had a bit of a--

132
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,480
 (audience laughs)

133
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,240
 - Not proud of it, but you know.

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,320
 - They did a replica of it to see if it would fly.

135
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,600
 And this was in the 1970s,

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,160
 and they made a documentary about it.

137
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,740
 And while they were doing the filming,

138
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,740
 they attached it to a horse.

139
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,460
 A loud noise happened and the horse bolted.

140
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,700
 And as it ran, the speed that it went at,

141
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,100
 which it pulled the plane into the air.

142
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,940
 - Oh wow.

143
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,420
 - And all the crew saw it flying.

144
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,140
 They went, oh my God, it's flying.

145
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,260
 It actually worked.

146
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,820
 And then it crash-landed.

147
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,260
 And they went, did you get that?

148
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,540
 And no one was filming.

149
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,100
 - Oh yeah.

150
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,260
 How convenient.

151
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,020
 Why did they tie it to a horse?

152
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,860
 - I had no idea.

153
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,760
 - That's such a Timaru thing to do.

154
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,160
 (audience laughs)

155
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,400
 Everything, if you ever go down there,

156
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,440
 everything's tied to a horse, man.

157
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,960
 - Well, Timaru, so not only have you got

158
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,720
 Richard Pierce airport down there,

159
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,080
 and it is where you are from, where you were born.

160
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,120
 Also, another notable character from there

161
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,800
 is Farlap, a horse.

162
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,520
 - Yes, yeah, I can't believe it.

163
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,800
 - Farlap was sired there and the father of Farlap

164
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,960
 was called, what was he called, Night Raid.

165
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,400
 And Night Raid had a bunch of award-winning horses.

166
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
 Farlap, which was the biggest,

167
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,860
 there was one called Lady Graceful, Pillow Fight,

168
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,620
 and one called Peter Jackson.

169
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,460
 - Wow.

170
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,300
 (audience laughs)

171
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,140
 - Really?

172
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,480
 - Yeah, for incidents.

173
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,800
 - It is weird.

174
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,340
 Do you know how big a deal they make of him in Australia?

175
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
 It's mad.

176
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,740
 And he's from New Zealand.

177
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,760
 I was astonished.

178
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,140
 It's so odd that they've spread Farlap

179
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,580
 over three different locations in Australia.

180
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,980
 Like, would you do that to someone you love?

181
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,580
 They worship this horse for non-Australian-New Zealand

182
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,420
 listeners.

183
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,140
 Farlap is the biggest celebrity in Australian history.

184
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,600
 (audience laughs)

185
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,760
 Incredible race horse from the first half of the 20th century.

186
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,600
 It was a very sweet story because a trainer

187
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
 persuaded a businessman to buy him from New Zealand.

188
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,000
 And then he turned up and his face was all covered in warts.

189
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,600
 And so the businessman went, that's disgusting.

190
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,440
 That's a horrible horse.

191
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,840
 No, I'm not gonna pay to train it.

192
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,520
 So the guy trained it for free.

193
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,520
 And yeah, it won all the races there were for ages.

194
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,240
 And then there was an assassination attempt

195
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
 and everything.

196
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,640
 But then when he died,

197
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,300
 they couldn't decide where to keep bits of him.

198
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,220
 So his hide is in Melbourne Museum.

199
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,980
 Skeleton in the, actually a skeleton is in New Zealand,

200
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,820
 I think.

201
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,660
 Oh yeah.

202
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,480
 Yeah?

203
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
 That's actually the best bit.

204
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,140
 And I think it's heart.

205
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,980
 I totally, yeah.

206
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,820
 (laughs)

207
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,140
 You want the bones, mate.

208
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,980
 (laughs)

209
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,060
 And his heart is in the National Museum of Australia.

210
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,420
 So yeah, you've got the skeleton.

211
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,260
 That's good.

212
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,100
 Farlap.

213
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,940
 Is that a New Zealand thing?

214
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,780
 Is that what's gonna happen with you, Josh?

215
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,620
 When you go?

216
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,460
 Yeah, I hope so.

217
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,300
 (audience laughs)

218
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,300
 It's gonna take a while to get the hide off,

219
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,140
 to be honest.

220
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,180
 (audience laughs)

221
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,580
 We'll keep the bones at home.

222
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,420
 Yeah.

223
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,680
 Actually, there was a session at the National Museum.

224
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,560
 Farlap was hit by the mob.

225
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,400
 Right?

226
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,240
 Yes.

227
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,640
 This was by shooting, which didn't get him,

228
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,680
 and he went on to win a race that day.

229
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,840
 The mob, did you say?

230
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,680
 Yeah.

231
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,380
 Did they leave a human head in his bed?

232
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,220
 (audience laughs)

233
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:01,480
 I think we should really emphasise just quickly,

234
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,840
 going back to this first powered flight,

235
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,920
 which appears how humble he genuinely was.

236
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,700
 When he was interviewed, he refused to take credit almost.

237
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,580
 He misremembered it, so most of the evidence,

238
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,620
 and most people who've researched it,

239
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,860
 agree now that he was the first powered flight.

240
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,660
 It was nine to 18 months before the Wright brothers.

241
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,620
 But when he was asked to remember it,

242
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,540
 he said, "I don't think I did anything practical with it

243
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,140
 until 1904," incorrect.

244
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,820
 He was doing it in 1903 or 1902,

245
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,300
 'cause they interviewed all these sort of

246
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,500
 80, 90-year-olds in the '70s and '80s, I think,

247
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,780
 who all remembered sort of when in their lives

248
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,460
 it had happened, they could place it historically,

249
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,360
 so they could put the event in context.

250
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,040
 But he just said, "You know, know the Wright brothers,

251
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,520
 they have fair cop, they should get the credit.

252
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,160
 I'm just, you know, no invention is really

253
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,760
 invented by a single person, it's just all inevitable

254
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,560
 that someone will come up with it."

255
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,880
 It was just bizarre.

256
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
 The other thing is, the Wright brothers,

257
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,440
 they send it up with a catapult or something.

258
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,280
 It was like--

259
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,120
 It was down a big rail slide.

260
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,960
 Yeah.

261
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,200
 Yeah, like a sort of water slide, but without water.

262
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,120
 And his one.

263
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,960
 Yeah.

264
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,360
 (audience laughs)

265
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
 Yeah.

266
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,960
 To describe it for you, you might not understand.

267
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,800
 I got it.

268
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,340
 His one was much more like modern planes, right?

269
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,180
 Yeah.

270
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,020
 Yeah, that's right.

271
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,420
 What's really amazing about it is that he left

272
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,140
 zero research, and because of that,

273
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,540
 he had zero impact on the aircraft industry,

274
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,060
 'cause no one knew he existed, no one knew what he did.

275
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,100
 Yet, the Wright brothers had a biplane,

276
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,940
 they had an engine mounted behind them,

277
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,820
 they had skids instead of wheels,

278
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,740
 and yet planes evolved to be more like Richard Pierce's

279
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,780
 plane, which had wheels, a variable-pitch propeller,

280
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,040
 single-plane engine mounted in front,

281
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,000
 propeller on a center crankshaft.

282
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,080
 So really, bamboo dick was right.

283
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,920
 Yeah.

284
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,760
 (audience laughs)

285
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,960
 And all on his own, he built the engine on his own.

286
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,200
 He just went to someone, the only other person in New Zealand

287
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,120
 who knew what an engine was basically at that time.

288
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,960
 He was so fresh, that's not a knock.

289
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,560
 Like 10 years before his flight was the first time

290
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
 that there was a recorded hot air balloon flight

291
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,400
 in New Zealand.

292
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,240
 Really?

293
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,080
 Yeah, in 1903.

294
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,840
 So we're talking about, like, there's a lot of tech

295
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,680
 that wasn't yet here.

296
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,080
 So this guy taught him how to make a machine.

297
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,180
 He then gets on his bicycle to go and collect

298
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,860
 all the bamboo that he needs for the plane itself.

299
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,940
 So he's just riding in and out of town,

300
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,860
 building this eccentric thing that no one's ever seen before,

301
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,220
 'cause it doesn't exist, and yeah, and then he does it.

302
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,860
 The guy he worked with, who was the engineer,

303
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,580
 just had a build on his, you know,

304
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,940
 everyone works together on this,

305
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,660
 was a huge deal in his own right.

306
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,780
 The engineer who was the guy called Cecil Walkden Wood,

307
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,860
 I don't know how one only is here,

308
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,140
 but he sounded very cool.

309
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,740
 So he made New Zealand's first motorbike

310
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,740
 and probably first motor car, I think, around 1901,

311
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,680
 and he powered it with gunpowder.

312
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,520
 Yeah.

313
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,360
 (audience laughs)

314
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,200
 And he got...

315
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,540
 (laughs)

316
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,820
 It goes very fast over a very short time.

317
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,680
 But he bought his gunpowder from a local chemist

318
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,240
 who was called William Gunn.

319
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,320
 (audience laughs)

320
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,640
 Brilliant, yeah, the chances, yeah.

321
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
 That's great.

322
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,960
 So Richard Pierce's engine that he made himself,

323
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,600
 a Model T Ford engine has 20 horsepower

324
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,580
 and weighed about 136 kg.

325
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,720
 Richard Pierce's homemade engine out of baked bean cans

326
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,940
 had 25 horsepower and weighed about 57 kg.

327
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,180
 So, more power and about less than half the weight.

328
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,940
 And the Wright Brothers engine had 12 horsepower and 82 kg.

329
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,540
 I mean, how embarrassing.

330
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,260
 (audience laughs)

331
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,260
 Although he did keep crashing it.

332
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,100
 I'm just...

333
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,300
 One thing I thought, there were like three separate counts

334
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,940
 of it crashing into a bush.

335
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,540
 It crashed into a bush again.

336
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,380
 Another bush.

337
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,700
 He had a lot of bush.

338
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,240
 (audience laughs)

339
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,480
 He was a very bad farmer.

340
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,680
 Like apparently his animals were starving.

341
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,960
 He's terrible.

342
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,360
 He didn't care, he didn't care.

343
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,680
 There's only a few instances in which the media

344
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,120
 had any kind of interest in him whatsoever

345
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,280
 during his lifetime.

346
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
 One happened in 1909.

347
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,640
 At this point, he's a really kind of dishevelled

348
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,120
 reclusive in his house.

349
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,080
 And they come to him because they wanna interview him

350
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,960
 about the fact that between June and August of 1909,

351
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,920
 lots and lots of New Zealanders thought

352
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,740
 that aliens were invading because they kept seeing stuff

353
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,580
 in the sky.

354
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,460
 People were going, we think either aliens

355
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,540
 or Germans are invading, we're not sure.

356
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,620
 And they were reporting it to the police.

357
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,540
 There were multiple counts of kids in school,

358
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,540
 grounds seeing an object land and fly off again.

359
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,860
 And it's gone down in the sort of annals

360
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,660
 of like UFO cannon of sort of like legit encounters.

361
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,700
 But they went to him at that point and said,

362
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,500
 "Didn't you try and build one of those things

363
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,740
 "that was going up?"

364
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
 And that's one of the only interviews that we have

365
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,120
 during his lifetime, yeah.

366
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,100
 - And what was that point?

367
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,840
 It was like, are you an alien?

368
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,680
 - Well, they were.

369
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,520
 - Yeah.

370
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,360
 - What did they think?

371
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,200
 - No, they were like.

372
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,040
 - Can we go up and get them?

373
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,880
 Can we use that?

374
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,400
 - Yeah, or is it possible that we are being visited

375
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,580
 by you know, Americans who are flying planes

376
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,320
 who they just haven't told us and like they're going

377
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,680
 from city to city and so on.

378
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,080
 - You also invented a bike that you don't pedal cyclically.

379
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,080
 You pump up and down with your feet.

380
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,920
 - Oh.

381
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,840
 - And it was like a piston bike and it wrote,

382
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,160
 but it also had tires that inflated as you rode.

383
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,000
 - Oh, that's amazing.

384
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,160
 - Which must have been so hard to make.

385
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,820
 I would suggest making better tires in the first place.

386
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,660
 - Yeah.

387
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,780
 - But it was like, these bloody tires keep getting flat.

388
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,700
 But I've seen the picture of that bike

389
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,460
 and the tires are flat.

390
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,300
 - Really?

391
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,760
 - So maybe, maybe he was right.

392
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,340
 - Well, 'cause you do, well, if you're not a cyclist,

393
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,020
 you don't want to waste air.

394
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,860
 You know?

395
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,560
 (laughing)

396
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
 I think that's fair enough.

397
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,900
 I think that's a good point.

398
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,240
 - Yeah, eco-friendly.

399
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,140
 - I thought I'd look at a few more local achievements

400
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,280
 as soon as we're in Christchurch.

401
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,380
 So I went on the Guinness World Records

402
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,980
 and I found out that the largest ever game of leapfrog

403
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,820
 was in Christchurch.

404
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,820
 It involved 1,348 participants.

405
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,660
 - Okay.

406
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,060
 - Which I think, by coincidence,

407
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,020
 is the exact number of people in this building right now.

408
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,220
 (laughing)

409
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,940
 If you include all the staff and us four,

410
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,900
 I think it's excited.

411
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,340
 So we could do that.

412
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,180
 - Okay.

413
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,000
 - All right.

414
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,180
 - Slightly messes with the format of the show, but yeah.

415
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,760
 And the most teabags thrown into mugs in 30 seconds

416
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,120
 for it, for a team of two,

417
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,440
 (laughing)

418
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,960
 that was broken in Christchurch in 2021.

419
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,620
 - Wow.

420
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,980
 - It was 11.

421
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,720
 (laughing)

422
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,600
 - Final thing.

423
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,400
 - The most teabags thrown into mugs in 30 seconds

424
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,740
 by a team of one is 13.

425
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,480
 (laughing)

426
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,320
 - Yeah.

427
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,440
 - And one final thing in Christchurch,

428
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,140
 the greatest distance ever run on a treadmill

429
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,500
 in 48 hours by a female.

430
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,580
 Can you guess how far she ran?

431
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,740
 - Well, you don't get anywhere, do you?

432
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,900
 - Yeah, zero miles.

433
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,580
 (laughing)

434
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,860
 But she thought she'd run 340 kilometers.

435
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,700
 - Okay.

436
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,540
 - Okay.

437
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,380
 - How long is that?

438
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,220
 - Well, the days when we missed the plane

439
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,060
 are quite a long way back, aren't they?

440
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,900
 (laughing)

441
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,260
 - Yeah, I tried to see if there were sort of

442
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,220
 any notable stories that came out of Timurut,

443
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,860
 you know, just like any great news stories.

444
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,800
 The only thing I could find was that the

445
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,760
 Timurut District Council were trying to investigate

446
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,180
 a missing $5,000 toilet unit.

447
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,060
 They basically just nicked this giant outdoor toilet.

448
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,900
 And yeah, and just, I mean,

449
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,620
 it doesn't get any more interesting except--

450
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,540
 - Well, I mean, look, I've dealt with these allegations

451
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,380
 in the past.

452
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,460
 (laughing)

453
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,620
 - To be honest, I'm sick of them.

454
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,740
 It's time to move on.

455
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,380
 - Maybe someone tied a horse to it, and they just--

456
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,620
 (laughing)

457
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,620
 - Yeah, that's true.

458
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,940
 Shout out to the journalists, by the way,

459
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,060
 who ends the piece by saying, "Police are investigating,"

460
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,380
 but still have nothing to go on.

461
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,220
 - Oh my God.

462
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,840
 (laughing)

463
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,680
 - Come on.

464
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,960
 - Decisions were made.

465
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,540
 (upbeat music)

466
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:29,420
 - It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

467
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,920
 - My fact this week is that in the 1940s,

468
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,200
 a law was passed that meant wherever the Dutch princess

469
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,740
 stood, didn't count as a country.

470
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,680
 - What?

471
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,900
 - So cool and weird.

472
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,760
 I can't find out another time this has happened,

473
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,560
 but this is amazing, and I read this in a book,

474
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,660
 which is so fun, and I would recommend.

475
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,260
 I found it on my bookshelves recently.

476
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,220
 It's called Atlas of Extinct Countries by Gideon Defoe,

477
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,420
 and it's about all sorts of weird nationality quirks.

478
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,380
 And this story, so this is in 1940,

479
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,940
 Germany invades the Netherlands.

480
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,460
 The Dutch royal family flees, mostly goes to Britain,

481
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,460
 but the princess, crown princess Juliana, went to Ottawa,

482
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,700
 and she went with her two daughters to Ottawa,

483
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,780
 while Germany was occupying the Netherlands,

484
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,160
 and while there, she got herself knocked up,

485
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,160
 and there was a problem with that,

486
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,400
 because the law in the Netherlands was that no one

487
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,840
 could be in the line of succession

488
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,560
 if they were born on the soil of a foreign country,

489
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,240
 and she only had two daughters at the time,

490
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,640
 so if she'd had a son,

491
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,760
 that would have meant he would be presumptive,

492
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,600
 but he couldn't be 'cause he'd be born in Canada,

493
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
 so they had to do something about this,

494
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,120
 so the government got together with a bunch of lawyers,

495
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,920
 and they concocted a new law,

496
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,380
 which basically said, wherever this pregnant lady is,

497
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,020
 isn't Canada, because in case she gives birth,

498
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,860
 it can't be on Canadian soil.

499
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,380
 - And did the Canadians agree with this?

500
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,820
 - I think, you know, it's only a small bit of their soil,

501
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,540
 it's not like you're stealing an acre of land.

502
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,020
 - Well, it depends where she walks, though.

503
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,220
 If she gave birth, sort of, I don't know,

504
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,000
 in the prime minister's chair or something,

505
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,420
 and then to boot, like.

506
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,580
 - He was probably very careful not to lend him

507
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,420
 her chair at that time.

508
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,580
 - But was it the case that it was technically

509
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,320
 born in the Netherlands, or was it just no,

510
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,480
 it didn't belong to any?

511
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
 - It was weirdly nothing.

512
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,880
 I think maybe making it in the Netherlands

513
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,040
 would have been even harder,

514
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,320
 and the law was that as long as it's not another country,

515
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,280
 you're okay, so it was just an extra-territorial zone,

516
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,120
 basically. - Right.

517
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,240
 - The thing is, if she'd have been born in Canada

518
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,240
 under normal rules, then she would have been British,

519
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,200
 because anyone who was born in Canada

520
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,600
 on those days was British,

521
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,480
 because it was a farm of British colony.

522
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,520
 Although, because she was a Protestant descendant

523
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,360
 of Sophia of Hanover by British law,

524
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,520
 she's British anyway.

525
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,360
 - Right.

526
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,080
 - It's one of the weirdest ways to get citizenship

527
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,580
 of any country, I think.

528
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,900
 But you know, you have to do the tests

529
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,260
 when you go to different places.

530
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,380
 To be British, all you really have to do

531
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,380
 is to be a Protestant descendant of Sophia of Hanover,

532
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,360
 and you're straight in.

533
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,580
 - Really?

534
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,340
 You know, if you're Dutch and you're in Canada at the time,

535
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,460
 you know when you see in movies,

536
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,740
 sometimes someone's running towards an embassy

537
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,700
 so that they don't get caught.

538
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,580
 Could, if they'd hopped on her shoulders

539
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,140
 for like a shoulder ride, would they?

540
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,720
 (audience laughing)

541
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,680
 - Yeah?

542
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,800
 - Yeah, but you then have to stay

543
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,280
 on her shoulders the whole time.

544
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,680
 And as soon as the baby's out, it's Canada again.

545
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,660
 - Yeah, but you make her walk to an embassy.

546
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,960
 - I see, I see, yeah.

547
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,040
 It's probably easier to leg it to the embassy.

548
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,000
 I don't know if you've tried climbing

549
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,120
 on the shoulders of a nine month pregnant woman, but.

550
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,840
 (audience laughing)

551
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,680
 Very easy.

552
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,940
 - My wife and I have some really weird kinks.

553
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,640
 (audience laughing)

554
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,160
 So was this Princess Juliana?

555
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,000
 - Yes.

556
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,960
 Now, I was unaware of the pregnant thing.

557
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,360
 But I do know that after the war,

558
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,740
 she gave Canada 100,000 tulip bulbs to say thank you.

559
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,780
 - Gee, that's cool.

560
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,280
 - And I just think 100,000 is too much.

561
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,540
 (audience laughing)

562
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,440
 Like, you know when, it's just too much, Edmund.

563
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
 Like, you know when you go to,

564
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,860
 someone gives you like a bag of tomatoes

565
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,940
 during tomato season, you go,

566
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,040
 "Oh, okay, well now I've got to deal with all these tomatoes.

567
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,260
 This fruit flies everywhere."

568
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,060
 You know, like, they've got to plant

569
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,340
 100,000 tulip bulbs somewhere.

570
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,800
 They've got to feed them, they've got to keep them alive.

571
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,040
 And you know, when she comes to visit,

572
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,520
 she's going to be like, "Where's my 100,000 tulips?"

573
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
 - I know, you can't hide it.

574
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,680
 - It's not even just that.

575
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,160
 It didn't stop at 100,000.

576
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,080
 She then went on to give them 20,000 more

577
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
 as an extra thanks to the maternity ward

578
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,860
 in the hospital that she gave birth in,

579
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,920
 so they could be planted in the grounds.

580
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,600
 And then it became an annual thing.

581
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,240
 She would send them tens of thousands of bulbs

582
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,400
 every year for her entire reign.

583
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,520
 - To me, it sounds like she's got a lot of tulips

584
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,400
 hanging around her, she's trying to get rid of them.

585
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,080
 - It sounds like big tulip to me.

586
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,480
 (all laughing)

587
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,880
 - That's the case of the bulb industry,

588
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
 reaching its claw over the world again.

589
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,860
 (all laughing)

590
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,960
 - All of Canada's mates always getting tulips

591
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,920
 as presents, constantly re-gifted.

592
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,120
 That's who they don't know her.

593
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,400
 - This kind of thing did happen

594
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,440
 in a few other places around that time.

595
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,320
 So in 1945, the British government ceded

596
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,280
 suite 212 at Claridge's to Yugoslavia.

597
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,400
 So the room, 212, they said,

598
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,280
 "This is now a part of Yugoslavia,

599
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,120
 "so that the air to Yugoslav throne could be born

600
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,560
 "on Slavic soil."

601
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,720
 - So does that mean like the house, like the maids,

602
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,000
 did they have to go through customs

603
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,160
 and like paint the room or what?

604
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,240
 (all laughing)

605
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,200
 - I guess so.

606
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,360
 According to the story, they got a spade full of soil

607
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,160
 from Yugoslavia and put it underneath the bed.

608
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,000
 So that not just was it technically Slavic soil,

609
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,320
 it was literally Slavic soil.

610
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,160
 - Yes.

611
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,280
 - I'm not sure if that's true.

612
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,840
 - 'Cause yeah, there's rumors of that kind of stuff

613
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,200
 with George Washington, there was a statue in London.

614
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,240
 They said that the soil that the statue was placed on

615
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,120
 was American soil that was imported,

616
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,160
 so that Washington wasn't technically on British soil.

617
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,720
 But I think that was the tourist guide to tell you that.

618
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,400
 I think that might have been false.

619
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,520
 - It's pretty easy to fake soil.

620
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,960
 (all laughing)

621
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,360
 I wrote a pretty tight record down in the South Island.

622
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,200
 (all laughing)

623
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,360
 - Yeah, but on the other hand,

624
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,400
 having come into New Zealand and Australia,

625
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 it's not that easy to bring soil in, is it?

626
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,520
 (all laughing)

627
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,360
 - That's right.

628
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,080
 - He just keeps handing his golf shoes over every time

629
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,920
 we come into--

630
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,040
 - This is a great tip, by the way.

631
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,400
 So if you play golf and you bring golf shoes in,

632
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,760
 you have to declare them because they might have soil on them.

633
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,640
 But when you declare them, they clean them for you.

634
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,760
 - Lovely.

635
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,840
 - It's amazing, I've never had such clean golf shoes.

636
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,040
 - It's a very expensive way to get your golf shoes cleaned

637
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,000
 by a ticket to Australia or New Zealand

638
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,360
 every time you need it done.

639
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,560
 (all laughing)

640
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,560
 - I was actually reading a few of the other fun

641
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,560
 weird nationality examples in this book,

642
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,120
 "The Atlas of Extinct Countries."

643
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,400
 One of my favorites is something called

644
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,600
 "The Republic of Goose," which is a village.

645
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,240
 It's in the mountains of Southwestern France.

646
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
 It's a little hamlet, but it's this weird thing

647
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,960
 happened in the 19th century where this rumor spread

648
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,920
 that it was its own independent republic.

649
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,120
 It's quite hard to work out where it came from.

650
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,400
 I think an MP referred to it as a republic in 1827.

651
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
 And you go back through newspaper archives

652
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,840
 and there'll be stories in the American newspaper saying,

653
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,880
 "Well, of course, there's this tiny village of Goose,"

654
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,520
 which is its own independent republic in France.

655
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,040
 It had no legal basis, but two things I like about it.

656
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,240
 One is that according to an 1896 article

657
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,960
 from an American tourist who went there,

658
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,760
 the women there remained beautiful, well into middle life

659
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,960
 in striking contrast to the lowland women of France.

660
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,800
 (all laughing)

661
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,920
 That's interesting.

662
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,400
 And the other thing is lowland women,

663
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,880
 because Goose was on the top of a hill,

664
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,240
 the other cool thing about it is that

665
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,360
 it was at least an hour's hike to get down

666
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,480
 to the bottom of the hill to get anywhere else.

667
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,640
 And when someone dies in Goose, that's a faff.

668
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,840
 So they created a chute out of timber

669
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,440
 and they just got their corpses whenever anyone died.

670
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,520
 - Like a water slide, but with no water.

671
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,100
 (all laughing)

672
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,720
 - That's absolutely right.

673
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,640
 - Wow, that's very cool.

674
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,200
 - The body just, what a wonderful way to end your life,

675
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,600
 or to begin death as a little prayer at the top.

676
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,740
 Tip them over the edge,

677
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,580
 slid them down to the town at the bottom,

678
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,420
 which presumably was like,

679
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,400
 "Stop sliding your dead bodies down here."

680
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,180
 (all laughing)

681
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,920
 - That's so funny.

682
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,340
 I got a riddle for you.

683
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,180
 - Okay.

684
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,720
 - Okay, so in 2009, a girl was born in China.

685
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,640
 Her father was a Canadian citizen born in Libya

686
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,200
 and her mother was a Chinese citizen.

687
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,160
 What was her nationality?

688
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,600
 - You can have this.

689
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,440
 - So she was born in China.

690
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,280
 - I'd say Chinese.

691
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,100
 - She was born in China.

692
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,220
 Her father was Canadian, but he was born in Libya.

693
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,540
 Her mother was Chinese.

694
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,120
 Now, you would think Chinese,

695
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,580
 but because the two parents were not married,

696
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,500
 according to Chinese law,

697
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,260
 he goes on what the father's nationality was,

698
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,540
 so she couldn't be Chinese.

699
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,880
 - Okay.

700
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,560
 The daughter was the force.

701
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,140
 (all laughing)

702
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,260
 - Okay, so.

703
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,760
 (all laughing)

704
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,600
 - Or.

705
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,300
 - Let's pretend he never said that.

706
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
 - Or Libyan.

707
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,460
 - So he didn't have his Libyan citizenship anymore

708
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,020
 'cause he'd renounced that 'cause he'd moved to Canada.

709
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,920
 But according to Canadian law,

710
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,420
 you could only be Canadian if you were born in Canada

711
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,260
 or if one of your parents was born in Canada

712
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,860
 and he wasn't born in Canada.

713
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,780
 - Oh my gosh, she didn't, she had nothing.

714
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,020
 - Well, the answer is she was Irish.

715
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,220
 (all laughing)

716
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,660
 So I'm quite surprised she didn't get that, Josh, actually.

717
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,700
 - No, I was gonna say Scottish, which is different.

718
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,020
 It's different, but it's Indonesian,

719
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,780
 and I was pretty close mentally.

720
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,300
 Mentally, that was pretty close.

721
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,540
 - Why?

722
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,180
 - It turned out that the father's father was born in Ireland

723
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,820
 and you can get Irish citizenship

724
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,340
 if your grandparents are from there.

725
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,060
 So since she couldn't get any of the others,

726
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,900
 they gave her Irish citizenship.

727
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,740
 - Very good, good old Ireland.

728
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,540
 - And then eventually it got in the news and stuff

729
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,660
 and the Canadians went,

730
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,780
 "Oh yeah, we should probably give her Canadian citizenship."

731
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,740
 So she did get that in the end, but yeah.

732
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,860
 - Oh, Ireland is always sort of scooping up the rejects

733
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,700
 from the rest of the world.

734
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,780
 It's so nice.

735
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,100
 - And in a very nice way.

736
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,180
 I remember when we were in the EU

737
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,580
 and sort of everyone found a very, very distant

738
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,820
 bit of Irish ancestry about it.

739
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,700
 Yeah, we'll have you.

740
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,380
 Yeah, yeah, sure.

741
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,220
 Come on in.

742
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,060
 (all laughing)

743
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,820
 - Well, I went, I mean, I'm loving all this stuff,

744
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,380
 but I really dug deep on the tulip buzz.

745
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,300
 (all laughing)

746
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,020
 And I went down quite a rabbit hole

747
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,220
 of terrible gifts from royal families.

748
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,060
 - Really nice.

749
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,540
 - And in 1851, Queen Victoria

750
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,620
 sent American president of the United States.

751
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,220
 (all laughing)

752
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,220
 You see, the Queen Victoria sent the president,

753
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,580
 Millard Fillmore, a 1,000 pound block of cheddar cheese.

754
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,420
 - Wow.

755
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,340
 - That's 450 KGs, it's nearly half a tonne of cheddar.

756
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,300
 - Wow, so like a week's supply almost.

757
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,620
 (all laughing)

758
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,860
 - Well, apparently it's quite hard to transport

759
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,700
 and became quite smelly.

760
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,140
 So, I think it was meant to cement

761
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,380
 American-British relations, but it just stank.

762
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,700
 So.

763
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,300
 And in the 1860s, Napoleon III of France

764
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,340
 sent Emperor Maximilian of Mexico

765
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,940
 a stuffed alligator wearing a crown.

766
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,660
 (all laughing)

767
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,180
 Again, to celebrate the French-backed emperor's rule

768
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,580
 over Mexico, but everyone thought it was just a bit weird.

769
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,940
 - Yeah, tacky, it's tacky.

770
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,180
 It goes in the guest room, that.

771
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,020
 - And there's a more recent one.

772
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,860
 You guys might know about this.

773
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,940
 I don't know if this is controversial,

774
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,820
 but Prince Charles, who was Prince at the time.

775
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,900
 (all laughing)

776
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,540
 Guys, I've got a lot of facts.

777
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,860
 (all laughing)

778
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,820
 He visited Haiti as they were recovering from an earthquake

779
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,820
 and he gifted them a jar of sand from the Dead Sea.

780
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,660
 - Wow. - And it was seen

781
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,140
 as not particularly helpful.

782
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,940
 (all laughing)

783
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,220
 If anything, the last thing you want after an earthquake

784
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,260
 is more dirt.

785
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,100
 (all laughing)

786
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,940
 - We've got to move on in a sec, guys.

787
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,100
 - There's sort of about diplomatic quirks

788
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,620
 and I kind of love all the weird diplomatic quirks

789
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,260
 and immunities there are.

790
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,220
 I think actually my favorite example

791
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,180
 of like a diplomatic rule that's made,

792
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,500
 it was in 1917.

793
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,900
 I don't think we've talked about Lenin's train trip

794
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,300
 back to the Russian Revolution,

795
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,220
 which was the thing that triggered the Russian Revolution.

796
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,180
 So in 1917, Lenin was taken in a secret sealed train,

797
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,820
 which was kind of officially given Russian embassy status.

798
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,660
 He was taken from Zurich to Petersburg,

799
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,740
 sort of so that he could start the revolution.

800
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,060
 It was arranged by Germany

801
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,380
 because Germany wanted to weaken the Russian war effort

802
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,580
 at the time and it thought the best way to do this

803
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,140
 is to get this crazy revolutionary

804
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,940
 to go and start a revolution there.

805
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,140
 So the Germans sort of sent Lenin back.

806
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,460
 So it was quite awkward because Germany and Russia are at war,

807
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,620
 but they're sharing a train together

808
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,660
 and helping each other out.

809
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,340
 So they drew a chalk line

810
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,260
 down the middle of the train carriage

811
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,860
 and all the German sort of soldiers and guards

812
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,460
 stood on one side and Lenin and his mates stood on the other.

813
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,980
 And it's such a conflicted journey.

814
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,980
 They had to swap carriages about four times.

815
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,580
 So they always had to get off, get on, redraw the line.

816
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,780
 Say, you're not allowed to cross over.

817
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,060
 But the thing I actually love most about this,

818
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,420
 because it's such a nice insight into Lenin's mind,

819
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,780
 is he also organized a bathroom rotor?

820
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,860
 So on this train,

821
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,700
 there was one bathroom between 34 people,

822
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,580
 half Russians, half Germans.

823
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,340
 Lenin had forbidden anyone to smoke on the train

824
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,060
 except in the bathroom.

825
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,940
 This caused a problem

826
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,980
 because everyone kept hogging the bathroom.

827
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,220
 So he started issuing passes.

828
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,300
 He's on his way to start the greatest revolution

829
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,540
 of the 20th century.

830
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,340
 He was issuing bathroom passes

831
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,260
 and you got a second-class pass

832
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,700
 if you needed to have a cigarette

833
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,260
 and you got a first-class pass

834
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,700
 if you needed, you know, to...

835
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,420
 - And number two, go on. - Have a number two.

836
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,620
 Or a number one, you know?

837
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,780
 He didn't distinguish between those in the pass system.

838
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,420
 So you could.

839
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,340
 There's Lenin like, you want a week?

840
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,020
 Yes, there's a first-class pass

841
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,260
 and that gave you priority

842
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,700
 and you got to bang on the door and say,

843
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,020
 "Oi, smoker, get out."

844
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,900
 - Amazing. - And that's, um...

845
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,260
 Just... That's... I find that really entertaining.

846
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,060
 LAUGHTER

847
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,660
 - What's that? - Good old Lenin.

848
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,660
 - Good old Lenin. - Good old Lenin, you know?

849
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,700
 Not enough people talk about that side of him.

850
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,420
 - That's the answer. - The bathroom monitor side.

851
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:03,140
 It is time for fact number three,

852
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,460
 and that is my fact.

853
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,860
 My fact this week is that the Marine snail,

854
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,820
 Litorina saxotillus,

855
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,060
 is otherwise known as the most

856
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,620
 misidentified creature in the world.

857
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,380
 It has been wrongly identified as a new species

858
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,340
 over 113 times

859
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,580
 and was first described in 1792.

860
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,220
 - This is astonishing. - That's crazy.

861
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,660
 - It's crazy. - 'Cause it just looks like a little snail.

862
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,500
 Yeah, it's a little rough periwinkle,

863
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,220
 is the kind of snail.

864
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,420
 And, yeah, it's a snail that just comes in different shapes,

865
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,140
 different sizes, different colours.

866
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,260
 Yeah, and so as a result, people keep finding it and going,

867
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,260
 "Wow, this is new," and giving it a new name,

868
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,580
 and then people eventually just go,

869
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,780
 "Sorry, that is the periwinkle.

870
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,660
 "We need to bring that back to the old name."

871
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,980
 As far as I could tell,

872
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,660
 'cause it's a bit hard to get the full list,

873
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,980
 but I have seen a list, sometimes it's been named six times

874
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,060
 as a new species by the same people.

875
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,860
 LAUGHTER

876
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,700
 - Which is wild. - That's so funny.

877
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,980
 It's like every new human you met thinking there were different species

878
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,860
 'cause they're wearing different clothes, basically.

879
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,940
 - Yes. - 'Cause they do have this real variety.

880
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,900
 I don't know how people do it who are naming these things.

881
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,180
 The problem with them is that they adapt incredibly quickly.

882
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,620
 They're amazing, so if they find themselves in a different situation suddenly,

883
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,020
 some are a bit cold, some are a bit scary,

884
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,660
 some are a bit rocky and exposed,

885
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,180
 they'll exploit the genes within them,

886
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,740
 'cause they've got huge genetic variation,

887
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,660
 they'll exploit the genes within them that make them turn bright red

888
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,460
 or make them go really small or make them get a really thicker shell.

889
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,340
 So that's why every single one that's completely different.

890
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,460
 - Yeah, and this isn't just with this particular species.

891
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,100
 So there's a big group we're called the World Register of Marine Species,

892
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,020
 or Worms, and they have been going through, exhaustively,

893
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,660
 the giant list that we have of all the names of all the species out there,

894
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,260
 and they've discovered that they've had to reassess 190,400 of them

895
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,660
 because they're duplicates and they need to be taken away.

896
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:03,380
 So yeah, we have 228,450 accepted species,

897
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,900
 as it stands, that number is growing all the time.

898
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,500
 - It's almost half, they went back and looked at the list and were like,

899
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,180
 "Half of these are shit, they're just that guy in a hat."

900
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,820
 - I just don't know how you could misidentify,

901
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,020
 I'm not a "Guess Your Pod" mollusk guy,

902
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,180
 I'm more on a bi-valve buzz,

903
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:26,340
 but if I got a trial to draw a picture of something they found at the beach,

904
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,540
 it would be this, it's the most common thing I've ever seen.

905
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,820
 - I've got to say, I'm not actually sure if that's the tale we're talking about.

906
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,180
 - And I've just got to say that people listening at home

907
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,900
 don't know what we're pointing at, so as far as that concerned,

908
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,180
 this is exactly what it is.

909
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,020
 - That's right.

910
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,460
 - It could go the other way, of course,

911
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,460
 there's a lot of things that look identical and turn out to be completely different.

912
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,780
 So, for instance, there were some researchers looked at the DNA

913
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,380
 of 643 bird species in North America,

914
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,820
 and they found 15 new species that looked identical to other things,

915
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,300
 but when they checked the DNA, it turned out they were completely different,

916
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,660
 because they just looked like little brown birds.

917
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,260
 - It's so weird, I always wonder with taxonomy,

918
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,260
 there must come a point where you think, "Why are we doing this? Why does it..."

919
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,500
 Is it that this bird doesn't care that it's a slightly different type of bird to this bird?

920
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,140
 Why do I care?

921
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,100
 - I guess we would know if things go extinct, if we put them in big databases.

922
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,820
 - Yeah, I know, but that's the thing, if it's very similar to this thing,

923
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,500
 then I know this is a very controversial thing to say, though,

924
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,620
 in the age of climate change, I'm going to back out.

925
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,900
 But I think one thing that epitomizes it is the giraffe problem, right?

926
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:39,380
 So, I think, we thought for many hundreds of years that there's one species of giraffe,

927
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,980
 and then very recently it's been thought that actually giraffes are split into four different species,

928
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,660
 and that means that giraffes suddenly go from being a bit of a worry to very endangered,

929
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,020
 because now that there are four species, each species has far fewer members.

930
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,620
 - Oh, yeah.

931
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,420
 - And it seems like there's such a weird categorization that we put on stuff to say to this giraffe,

932
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,700
 "Hey, mate, did you know yesterday that you were fine, but today you're in serious trouble?"

933
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,780
 - Yeah, yeah.

934
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,660
 - What?

935
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
 - Oh, that is interesting.

936
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:12,540
 It's as well, the worms, that unit, they've made estimates about what there is out there still to find,

937
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:17,180
 and they think there are still 10,000 new marine species waiting to be found

938
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:21,620
 that are sitting exclusively in the back rooms of museums that have been collected.

939
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,260
 And actually, that is a big thing in the world of curation with museums.

940
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:30,380
 A lot of new species are discovered in the boxes that they have there as opposed to in the field.

941
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,020
 We went behind the scenes at the Natural History Museum in London.

942
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:39,460
 There are still boxes that Darwin collected from the beagle that have not been properly studied yet.

943
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,260
 - It's incredible.

944
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,740
 - Yeah.

945
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,060
 - There was one person at University College London who left the job, I think they retired,

946
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,140
 and they left a bottle of homemade plum brandy in the drawer.

947
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:55,700
 And then when they actually looked at it, they found out that it wasn't a macerated plum in the brandy.

948
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,580
 It was actually a testicle, Brackett's Species Unknown.

949
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,420
 [LAUGHTER]

950
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,180
 And they've added it to the collection.

951
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:04,820
 - Really?

952
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,460
 - Hopefully one day we'll find out what kind of testicle that was.

953
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,980
 It was a good job they didn't drink it.

954
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,100
 - Yeah.

955
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,220
 You know, that reminds me of a great New Zealand invention.

956
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,100
 We talked about that earlier in the show.

957
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,900
 Is that New Zealand innovated the glory hole that doctors use.

958
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,300
 - No, no, no, no, no.

959
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,260
 - No, this is...

960
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,660
 - Those pervert doctors.

961
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,460
 [LAUGHTER]

962
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,500
 - This is specifically for doctors and for people who are too embarrassed to have their testicles checked.

963
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,020
 So what you do is you go in a booth.

964
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,900
 It's kind of like going to Confession and Cheritry.

965
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
 [LAUGHTER]

966
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,540
 - Right?

967
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,460
 - Actually, it's very similar to my childhood.

968
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,740
 [LAUGHTER]

969
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,540
 So what you do is you go in and you pull your trousers down

970
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,940
 and a little door opens with the hole and a hand comes through

971
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,460
 and it just plays with your testicles and then...

972
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,060
 - And goes, "Ten Hail Berries!"

973
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,980
 [LAUGHTER]

974
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,140
 - And then just gives you a thumbs up and gets out of there.

975
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,740
 Yeah.

976
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,580
 - Is that the thing where you look to your left and cough?

977
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,660
 - I don't know.

978
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,180
 I'm pretty sure he was a doctor.

979
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,820
 [LAUGHTER]

980
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,500
 - Isn't that a thing where it was in the ward?

981
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,740
 Like, you...

982
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,060
 - That is the thing where they get you to cough.

983
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,380
 It feels like they're weighing...

984
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,020
 - I don't know.

985
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,460
 - One of them jumps up a bit.

986
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,700
 - This really sounds made up.

987
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,020
 - Does it?

988
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,220
 - Yeah, one of them, like, "Guys, go home tonight

989
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,020
 "and give a little cup and look to the left and cough."

990
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,140
 And I think one of them jumps up and I think that is...

991
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,220
 - Oh, yeah!

992
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,140
 [LAUGHTER]

993
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,060
 - Wash your hands.

994
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,900
 [LAUGHTER]

995
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,140
 - I don't think any of you has been seeing a real doctor.

996
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,980
 [LAUGHTER]

997
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,580
 - Wow.

998
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,980
 - That's very funny.

999
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,660
 This rough periwinkle, by the way, since we're on "Sexy Facts,"

1000
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,940
 they are famous for basically attempting to mate

1001
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,020
 with any shell that they encounter.

1002
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,340
 So they'll find a mucus track and they'll follow it,

1003
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,020
 hoping that there'll be a female at the end of it.

1004
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,740
 But whenever they get to anything,

1005
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,700
 whether it's a male, a female, just a shell,

1006
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,100
 doesn't matter what it is, they'll try and have sex with it.

1007
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,940
 And the females, on the other hand, are really quite passive.

1008
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,420
 If they don't really, they don't try and fight him off

1009
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,540
 or anything like that, they just let him get on with it.

1010
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,940
 - It's the first way to do it.

1011
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,540
 [LAUGHTER]

1012
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,820
 - She doesn't seem to encourage the male.

1013
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,620
 She just barely even knows.

1014
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,380
 Sometimes she'll just carry on walking down the road

1015
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,580
 with him on the back, humping away.

1016
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,060
 - And yet, they are officially the females,

1017
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,420
 the most promiscuous animal on earth, I think, aren't they?

1018
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,180
 Because they're so passive and the lads are so randy.

1019
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,500
 And it's quite extraordinary.

1020
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,700
 They don't have an egg-based system.

1021
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,980
 They get inseminated internally

1022
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,180
 and then they've got a uterus equivalent,

1023
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,580
 which is very unusual in something like a little snail.

1024
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,500
 And so the males will mate with them

1025
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,980
 and I think this little snail penis comes in through her side.

1026
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,100
 But she can have hundreds of embryos in her uterus

1027
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,780
 that are at various different stages of maturation

1028
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,180
 from loads of different male snails.

1029
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:09,260
 And they did a study of four female versions of these snails

1030
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,100
 and they found that over 2.5 months,

1031
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,860
 each one had about 70 offspring

1032
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,780
 and on average, they'd have 19 fathers between them.

1033
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,460
 - Wow. - So you're storing

1034
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,020
 19 fathers' worth of offspring

1035
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,500
 and when you go into labor, it's fine.

1036
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,380
 If you're feeling sorry for them

1037
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,620
 because they're giving birth constantly,

1038
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,180
 sometimes multiple times a day,

1039
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,900
 it doesn't take any effort from them

1040
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,740
 because if they pushed, then all the snails would come out,

1041
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,140
 like if they're not ready ones.

1042
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,820
 So the snails themselves crawl out

1043
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,020
 and their little baby snails are known as crawler ways

1044
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,260
 because they literally, they're just like,

1045
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,340
 "I'm ready to go now, got my shell,

1046
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,820
 crawl out and just disappear into the world."

1047
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,620
 - Oh, they come out with a shell on.

1048
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,300
 - They come out with a shell on. - Oh!

1049
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,900
 - That's true. - Oh, my God.

1050
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,860
 - The bunch of barnacles crawling out.

1051
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,660
 I think I might have been on the same website because I...

1052
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,620
 - Oh, I don't think so. - I was looking into conch sex

1053
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,220
 and conches are massive sea snails

1054
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,580
 and they are in trouble in Florida

1055
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,940
 because when the water gets too warm,

1056
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,580
 they become sort of sexually lethargic.

1057
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,940
 I mean, it happens to the best of us.

1058
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,620
 And so there's a team of scientists in Florida

1059
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,940
 because the water's getting hotter

1060
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,140
 who have to go and pick up the conches from the warm areas

1061
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,700
 and take them out into the cooler areas to mate

1062
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,460
 and to encourage them to mate and have sex.

1063
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,500
 And I don't know how that...

1064
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,420
 I got uncomfortable searching at that point,

1065
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,620
 but I think that's a lot of sexy talk and a lot of Marvin Gaye music.

1066
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,300
 - That's so embarrassing, though.

1067
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,860
 They need a human helper, a human fluffer to help them.

1068
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:42,380
 - Hey, just while we're talking about sea slugs,

1069
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,700
 one thing that I read about is Spongebob Squarepants,

1070
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,940
 the creator, was a marine biologist.

1071
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,260
 And I had no idea about that.

1072
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,860
 Yeah, he was called Stephen Hillenberg.

1073
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,300
 He sadly passed away in 2018.

1074
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,060
 But he's the one who came up with the concept for it.

1075
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,220
 He was a marine biologist.

1076
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,580
 He was working for the Orange County Marine Institute.

1077
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,820
 And while he was there, he created a comic book

1078
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,620
 to explain into title zones.

1079
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,140
 So, like, all the pools that you get,

1080
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,020
 where you go and see what's going on in there.

1081
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,340
 So he just laid out a bunch of facts in there.

1082
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,700
 One of the facts is that one species of sea slug

1083
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,460
 can lay one million eggs in one sitting, right?

1084
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,100
 And that was in there, and he gave it around,

1085
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,660
 and someone saw that and went,

1086
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,900
 "This would be a really good cartoon for kids."

1087
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,540
 And so Spongebob Squarepants is based on a fact book

1088
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,580
 that he did for students at a marine biology place.

1089
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,980
 But I don't remember Spongebob giving birth

1090
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,860
 to a million offspring in one sitting.

1091
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,420
 That was the pilot they said, "It's great.

1092
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,540
 "We have a few tweaks, just a couple of tweaks.

1093
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,900
 "The barnacle vagina exit is a bit strong.

1094
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,420
 "And let's get his pants back on."

1095
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,180
 All right, I found a lot of animals that are out there

1096
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,820
 that are just called completely the wrong thing.

1097
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,980
 You may be aware of the mantis shrimp.

1098
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,620
 They've got a very powerful claw strike.

1099
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,300
 It's a very explosive, it can kill.

1100
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,380
 It just basically punches a prey to death.

1101
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,220
 But the mantis shrimp is neither a mantis or shrimp.

1102
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,260
 The binterong, commonly known as the bear cat,

1103
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,020
 is neither a bear or a cat.

1104
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,740
 And the honey badger is neither a badger or a jar of honey.

1105
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,980
 (laughing)

1106
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,580
 - Wow. - Just be careful out there.

1107
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,420
 That's all I'm saying.

1108
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,260
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1109
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,540
 Don't put a honey badger on your toast

1110
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
 'cause it will tear you apart.

1111
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,700
 (laughing)

1112
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,660
 - There is a, there's a type of frog

1113
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,660
 called alabati's niputidia that was described in 2007.

1114
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,180
 And it's like a little brown, jobby thing.

1115
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,820
 Like, it doesn't really, it's not very impressive.

1116
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,260
 And it turns out that it's named after

1117
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,860
 the Spanish phrase niputa idea,

1118
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,020
 meaning I have no fucking idea.

1119
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,260
 (laughing)

1120
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,100
 - Brilliant.

1121
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,140
 - I think that, like, texomonists get things wrong a lot,

1122
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,060
 but also the general public.

1123
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,100
 I mean, it's not really their fault,

1124
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,140
 but apparently there's a BBC rescue shelter.

1125
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,780
 Sorry, I'm English.

1126
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,260
 Sorry, a British rescue shelter.

1127
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,740
 - We are, we're all the BBC.

1128
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,860
 We all work for the BBC, everyone in the UK.

1129
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,340
 - Sorry, sorry.

1130
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,980
 - Well, it's like the Conservatives' nightmare.

1131
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,420
 You just go, say, "Britain has become the BBC."

1132
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,660
 (laughing)

1133
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,940
 - There was a rescue shelter in Guernsey.

1134
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,980
 And the BBC reported that this shelter

1135
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,780
 has been taken a dead cat,

1136
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,220
 which turned out to not be a dead cat,

1137
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,660
 but actually a cuddly dog puppet.

1138
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,500
 - What?

1139
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,220
 - Oh, it was just a sock puppet.

1140
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,460
 They also got alerted about a sick seal on a beach

1141
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,980
 which turned out to be a duvet.

1142
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,820
 (laughing)

1143
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,420
 And an injured bird on the beach,

1144
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,660
 which was basically just a blonde wig.

1145
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,740
 - I just, how far are the rescue shelters getting?

1146
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,260
 Is it like the seal's been in there for six days?

1147
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,220
 They've gone, "It's not easy, anything."

1148
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,460
 (laughing)

1149
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,040
 (upbeat music)

1150
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,020
 - It is time for our final fact of the show,

1151
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,860
 and that is James.

1152
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:03,140
 - Okay, my fact this week is that during World War I,

1153
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,980
 a popular conspiracy theory was that German blackmailers

1154
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,980
 had drawn up a list of 47,000 highly placed English perverts.

1155
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,700
 (laughing)

1156
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,140
 - A list of 47,000 highly placed English perverts?

1157
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,980
 - Yep.

1158
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,220
 - It's like the original Ipsing list.

1159
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,900
 (laughing)

1160
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,700
 - Yeah, it's now known as the BBC.

1161
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,940
 (laughing)

1162
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:32,820
 So this is an article in the London review of books

1163
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,100
 that I read about a book called "MI5 and the Great War"

1164
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,660
 by Nigel West.

1165
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,900
 And it's basically about the enormous amount

1166
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,620
 of anti-German mania that was going on in Britain,

1167
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,780
 especially in America as well in the First World War.

1168
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,460
 And there was just these conspiracy theories everywhere

1169
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,420
 that Germany was infiltrating Britain,

1170
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,740
 it was infiltrating America.

1171
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,940
 Every German person that you saw in the street

1172
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,460
 might be a spy.

1173
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,020
 And there was a guy called Noel Pemberton Billing,

1174
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,900
 who was an MP, and he produced a list

1175
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,100
 of these so-called highly placed British perverts

1176
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,540
 that he said were being blackmailed

1177
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,740
 by the German secret service.

1178
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,580
 And that they would basically,

1179
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,300
 if they'd infiltrated the upper echelons

1180
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,780
 of British society.

1181
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,180
 And once the war started, that was gonna be,

1182
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,380
 we were gonna get taken over.

1183
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,860
 - And it's quite hard to work out

1184
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,940
 how they thought they planned this to happen.

1185
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,180
 So the idea is that the reason that there are these

1186
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,780
 47,000 highly placed perverts that they've identified

1187
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,260
 is that the Germans can come over, chat to the perverts,

1188
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,580
 say, "Hello, can you seduce all these other people?"

1189
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,420
 And gradually will remove the manhood of Britain, I think.

1190
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,900
 And this guy, what was he called?

1191
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,220
 Pemberton?

1192
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,420
 - Noel Pemberton Billing.

1193
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,500
 He said that the Germans are propagating evils

1194
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,540
 which all decent men thought had perished

1195
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,180
 in Sodom and Lesbian.

1196
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,300
 And there was a lot of homophobia there.

1197
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,660
 So there was lots of, you know,

1198
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,180
 they would find loads of gay people.

1199
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,820
 They'll seduce loads of other people into being gay.

1200
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,660
 And the whole of Britain will lose the war because of that.

1201
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,620
 It's so hard to work out what we thought the plan was.

1202
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,940
 - No, I think that's the thing.

1203
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,580
 The thing about conspiracy theories is,

1204
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,220
 they do tend to fall down quite early now.

1205
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,020
 I think the thing for me is, like,

1206
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,500
 how do you define what a pervert is?

1207
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,820
 Like, but also, how do you define

1208
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,940
 what a German thinks a pervert is?

1209
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,380
 - Yes. - Oh, that's true.

1210
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,620
 - On my moderate online research,

1211
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:33,620
 the Germans enjoy a wide spectrum of night-time activities.

1212
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,580
 Like, how do you know what they think is perverse?

1213
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,740
 - Well, I mean, of course,

1214
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,900
 the British royal family is German in heritage,

1215
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,660
 and I wouldn't say any of those guys are perverts.

1216
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,500
 (laughter)

1217
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,540
 I don't think any of us would.

1218
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,340
 - But basically, I think, I mean,

1219
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,340
 there was a lot of homophobia there for certain,

1220
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,460
 but they were quite nebulous in their definitions.

1221
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,940
 And for instance, when Pemberton Billing was sued for libel,

1222
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,900
 he immediately added the name of the judge

1223
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,580
 to his list of perverts.

1224
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,860
 - Yeah, it's...

1225
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,380
 - He just kind of added anyone that he didn't like in there.

1226
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,220
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1227
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,740
 - There were a few stars of his claims weren't there.

1228
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,740
 So there was one star who was called Maude Allen,

1229
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,500
 who was a real focus of his, and she was an actress,

1230
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,740
 and she'd been in a performance of Oscar Wilde's Salome,

1231
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,420
 which had to be a private performance

1232
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,740
 because it was still banned at that time.

1233
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,220
 And he wrote lots of articles,

1234
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,180
 or he had lots of articles that were propagated

1235
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,540
 about how she was spreading the cult of the clitoris.

1236
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,020
 And there were all these suggestions

1237
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,820
 that Maude Allen was a lesbian

1238
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,060
 and somehow this conflated with having German sympathies.

1239
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,500
 And there were lots of rumors also

1240
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,740
 that she was having an affair with Margot Asquith,

1241
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,580
 who was the wife of Herbert Asquith,

1242
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,140
 who'd been the prime minister.

1243
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,580
 But anyway... - I think that might have been true

1244
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,900
 as well, actually. - Were they true?

1245
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,380
 I just wonder. - Well, it's not...

1246
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,100
 We don't know for sure, but for sure,

1247
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,220
 Margot Asquith paid for her apartment for 20 years

1248
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,500
 after they first met.

1249
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,820
 - Well, I take back everything I've said,

1250
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,060
 I think that's true entirely.

1251
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,300
 But she sued Maude Allen for defamation, basically,

1252
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,020
 because this MP was accusing her of all these things.

1253
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,940
 And one of the people who appeared in court

1254
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,940
 in Pemberton Billings' defense,

1255
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,860
 so against Maude Allen saying, "Yes, she's a homosexual,

1256
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,340
 "she's in need with the Germans,

1257
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,540
 "she's having an affair with the ex-PM's wife,"

1258
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,980
 was Alfred Douglas, otherwise known as Bozy.

1259
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,660
 - Oh, Bozy. - Bozy,

1260
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,940
 like Oscar Wilde's old boyfriend.

1261
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,500
 - Yeah, wow. - He turned tail, turn-coated.

1262
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,140
 - Yeah, that was weird. - He went that way a bit, Bozy.

1263
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,580
 - He did, right at the end, yeah.

1264
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,980
 This whole thing was part of the weird paranoia.

1265
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,820
 Well, it wasn't weird.

1266
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,900
 There was war looming in the distance.

1267
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,780
 People were thinking the Germans were coming in,

1268
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,740
 they were sussing it out, they were laying spies in there.

1269
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,660
 So there's this big push to try and out the spies.

1270
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,020
 And one guy, Richard Haldane, set up a committee,

1271
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,460
 the Secret Service Bureau,

1272
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,140
 which was a forerunner to MI5 and MI6.

1273
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,540
 In fact, the people who ran it were

1274
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,420
 Commander Mansfield Cumming and Captain Vernon Kell.

1275
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,700
 Both of them did go on to be the front people,

1276
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,940
 the heads of MI5 and MI6.

1277
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,340
 What's amazing is that was basically set up,

1278
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,580
 MI5 and MI6, because the two of them didn't get on

1279
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,740
 and they couldn't work together

1280
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,100
 in the original Secret Service, yeah.

1281
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,220
 So he was like, you guys are terrible at working together,

1282
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,740
 but you're great, you do six and you do five,

1283
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,380
 and that's why we have MI5 and MI6.

1284
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,140
 - Is that right? - It's an argument, yeah.

1285
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,420
 But also, you look at it, and there's a lot of Germans

1286
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,580
 that were just a bit incompetent who came over anyway.

1287
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,580
 You didn't need to be vigilant, they were outing themselves.

1288
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,340
 There's a guy called Paul Buchwald,

1289
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,700
 who adopted the alias Sherlock Holmes when he arrived.

1290
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,860
 (audience laughing)

1291
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,580
 - Good and dark, Sherlock Holmes, that's like...

1292
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,620
 - That's like me going to America undercover

1293
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,020
 as Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

1294
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,020
 (audience laughing)

1295
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:50,140
 - Yeah, I love the paranoia the German paranoia so much,

1296
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,540
 because I read that if you encountered a German waiter

1297
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,540
 at a cafe, you were entitled to say no to their service,

1298
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,780
 and if they said that they were Swiss,

1299
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,620
 you had to be very careful and asked to see their passport.

1300
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,860
 But the head of the Met's Criminal Investigation Department,

1301
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,860
 Basil Thompson, recorded that it was positively dangerous

1302
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:11,140
 to be seen in conversation with the pigeon.

1303
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,820
 - Yes! (audience laughing)

1304
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,700
 - And a foreigner walking in one of the parks

1305
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,260
 was actually arrested and sentenced to imprisonment

1306
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,420
 because a pigeon was seen to fly from the place

1307
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,300
 where he was standing, and it was supposed

1308
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,660
 that he had liberated it.

1309
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,500
 - Wow. - Yeah.

1310
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,420
 - Wow. - I thought it was a woman's wig.

1311
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,660
 (audience laughing)

1312
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,940
 - Brian Pemberton.

1313
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,060
 Cumberbatch, what's his name?

1314
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Pemberton Pemberton.

1315
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,220
 - Joel Pemberton-Billy.

1316
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,140
 - No, yes, yes, him.

1317
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,260
 (audience laughing)

1318
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,660
 Apparently he had a monocle,

1319
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,940
 and the only thing that I could find out about him

1320
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,180
 is he had like a piece of flesh inserted into his cheek

1321
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,580
 to keep the monocle in place.

1322
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,740
 - Oh! - Oh!

1323
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,820
 - But also just one cheek, like get both done,

1324
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,180
 otherwise you're all gonna be askew.

1325
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Wow!

1326
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,020
 - I quite like that idea though,

1327
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,940
 because I have a very small nose,

1328
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,140
 and whenever I wear sunglasses, it just keeps falling down,

1329
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,220
 and I'd love a little ledge on there.

1330
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,060
 (audience laughing)

1331
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,940
 - Whereas I've got a huge ledge on my nose,

1332
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,580
 I never need glasses if we could do some sort of a swap,

1333
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,100
 like an organ donation.

1334
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,620
 - Let's chat after the show.

1335
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,700
 - Great.

1336
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,900
 - I'm happy to donate some flesh

1337
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,860
 to anybody who wants to donate,

1338
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,840
 but leave us bones, they're for the kids.

1339
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,660
 (audience laughing)

1340
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,700
 - In America, there was a worry that the Germans

1341
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,220
 were coming over poisoning all the livestock,

1342
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,500
 and this was really, everyone thought this was the case,

1343
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,500
 basically, that all their beef and their animals

1344
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,220
 were getting sick, and it must have been

1345
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,220
 because the Germans were sending over bacteria and stuff.

1346
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,860
 It turned out that the reason was,

1347
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,700
 there was a war happening in Europe,

1348
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,740
 America was shipping out loads and loads of animals over,

1349
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,180
 and they were doing lots of intensive farming,

1350
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,860
 and obviously when you do intensive farming,

1351
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,060
 and you move animals around, they make each other sick,

1352
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,700
 that's what was happening.

1353
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,780
 But it turned out that the Germans

1354
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,520
 were trying to make them sick,

1355
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,260
 but they were just failing all the time.

1356
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,620
 (audience laughing)

1357
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,620
 - And there was a group of Germans

1358
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,300
 who were in a laboratory in Chevy Chase in Maryland,

1359
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,340
 and they were cultivating lots of bacteria

1360
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,340
 that they were gonna put onto these animals,

1361
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,100
 but they just never managed to get it to work,

1362
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,380
 but it didn't matter 'cause the animals would get sick anyway.

1363
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,460
 - How did Chevy Chase feel about it, Ernest?

1364
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,500
 (audience laughing)

1365
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,780
 It's a weird subplot to your story there.

1366
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,260
 (audience laughing)

1367
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,900
 - Chevy Chase is a place, as we've said before,

1368
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,700
 where the battle of Chevy Chase was.

1369
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,980
 - That's right, yes.

1370
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,340
 - And then there was a ballad of the battle of Chevy Chase,

1371
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,660
 and then Chevy Chase, the actor,

1372
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,940
 was named after the ballad of the battle

1373
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,540
 of the place of Chevy Chase.

1374
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,460
 - There you go.

1375
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,140
 Don't you wish you'd never asked Ernest?

1376
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:41,140
 (audience laughing)

1377
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:47,100
 - We're gonna have to wrap up very soon, guys.

1378
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,300
 Anything before we do?

1379
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,260
 - The paranoia went the other way as well,

1380
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,620
 so in Germany, they were very paranoid

1381
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,180
 that there might be British spies or American spies there,

1382
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,900
 and at one stage, there was a lady's maid who was on a train,

1383
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,140
 and she was strip searched in Germany,

1384
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,740
 and they found secret writing on her bottom,

1385
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:09,860
 and they photographed her bum,

1386
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,300
 and they sent it to German military intelligence

1387
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,740
 and put her in prison,

1388
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,300
 and it turned out that what she'd done

1389
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,500
 is 'cause she was worried

1390
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,500
 that the train toilet would be dirty,

1391
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,620
 she'd covered the seat with her newspaper,

1392
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,220
 (audience laughing)

1393
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:27,140
 and it was backwards writing from the Frankfurter Z-Tung

1394
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,620
 newspaper. - Right.

1395
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,740
 It sounds like classic pervert behavior today.

1396
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,020
 (audience laughing)

1397
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,580
 I think there's some writing on your bum.

1398
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,740
 I better take a photo.

1399
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,380
 (audience laughing)

1400
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,620
 We've all tried that, but...

1401
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,660
 - But presumably the newspaper headlines

1402
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,100
 would have read things like, you know,

1403
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,540
 Germans about to invade, and so...

1404
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,180
 - You know, Lenin's knocking on the door.

1405
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,300
 Have you got the talk in?

1406
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,540
 (audience laughing)

1407
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,860
 Not your turn!

1408
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,620
 (audience laughing)

1409
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,200
 (upbeat music)

1410
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,780
 - That is it.

1411
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,860
 That is all of our facts.

1412
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,860
 Thank you so much to Josh.

1413
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,980
 Thank you so much, Christchurch.

1414
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,540
 It's absolutely, that's the end of our tour.

1415
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,700
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

1416
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,660
 We'll see you then.

1417
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,980
 Good-bye!

1418
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,980
 (audience cheering)

1419
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,400
 (upbeat music)

1420
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,980
 (upbeat music)
