00:00:02,00:00:05,"- Hi everyone, welcome to this week's show"
00:00:05,00:00:08,which was recorded live in the wonderful city
00:00:08,00:00:11,"of Christchurch, the furthest away"
00:00:11,00:00:13,that we have ever been from home.
00:00:13,00:00:16,"Unfortunately, Andrew Hunter Murray was not here"
00:00:16,00:00:18,"for this show, he was unexpectedly called back"
00:00:18,00:00:21,"to the UK for personal reasons, but in his place,"
00:00:21,00:00:25,we had the unbelievably brilliant Josh Thompson.
00:00:25,00:00:27,"Now, those of you who like a New Zealand comedy"
00:00:27,00:00:30,like I do will know all about Josh.
00:00:30,00:00:32,"He has been on New Zealand Taskmaster,"
00:00:32,00:00:35,"he's been on the Guy Montgomery/Guymont spelling bee,"
00:00:35,00:00:36,"which by the way, if you've never seen that,"
00:00:36,00:00:39,you have to go into YouTube and look for episodes of that
00:00:39,00:00:40,'cause it's a brilliant show.
00:00:40,00:00:43,"He's also been in the New Zealand version of The Office,"
00:00:43,00:00:46,"but in this show, he came on and was absolutely brilliant,"
00:00:46,00:00:49,told us a whole load of facts that we didn't know
00:00:49,00:00:49,about New Zealand.
00:00:49,00:00:51,I'm really sure you're gonna love this show.
00:00:51,00:00:54,"It's the last one of our talk, can you believe it?"
00:00:54,00:00:57,"We'll be back to normal programming in a couple of weeks' time,"
00:00:57,00:01:00,"but anyway, I really hope you enjoy the show with Josh."
00:01:00,00:01:02,"And what else is there to say,"
00:01:02,00:01:04,apart from on with the podcast.
00:01:04,00:01:07,(upbeat music)
00:01:07,00:01:12,(upbeat music)
00:01:12,00:01:23,(audience cheers)
00:01:23,00:01:27,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:01:27,00:01:30,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:01:30,00:01:33,this week coming to you live from Christchurch.
00:01:33,00:01:36,(audience cheers)
00:01:36,00:01:38,My name is Dan Schuyler.
00:01:38,00:01:40,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:01:40,00:01:42,"James Harkin, and Josh Thompson."
00:01:42,00:01:45,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:45,00:01:47,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:01:47,00:01:51,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:51,00:01:52,"Starting with fact number one,"
00:01:52,00:01:55,and that is Josh.
00:01:55,00:01:58,"- Well, my fact is that the first people"
00:01:58,00:02:00,to achieve powered flight were not actually
00:02:00,00:02:02,the American Wright brothers.
00:02:02,00:02:05,(audience cheers)
00:02:05,00:02:09,"They know it well here, we're not the Wright brothers,"
00:02:09,00:02:12,but actually a lone eccentric New Zealand farmer
00:02:12,00:02:14,called Cranky Dick Pierce.
00:02:14,00:02:16,(audience laughs)
00:02:16,00:02:19,- Somebody tells me that the people of Christchurch
00:02:19,00:02:21,might have come across this guy before.
00:02:21,00:02:24,"- Yeah, well, there's an airport about two hours from here"
00:02:24,00:02:27,"in a town called Temeru, where I was born, yes."
00:02:27,00:02:30,(audience cheers)
00:02:30,00:02:31,"And that is named Richard Pierce Airport,"
00:02:31,00:02:35,after he flew about two hours drive away from here.
00:02:35,00:02:37,"- Wow, amazing."
00:02:37,00:02:40,- So the Wright brothers flew in Kitty Hawk in America
00:02:40,00:02:44,"in December, 1903, but Richard Pierce actually flew"
00:02:44,00:02:45,"in March, 1903."
00:02:45,00:02:50,"- 'Cause there's a lot of conflicting accounts,"
00:02:50,00:02:51,and you should--
00:02:51,00:02:53,- I'm so totally sure.
00:02:53,00:02:54,"- The ocean, yeah."
00:02:54,00:02:57,"- Here's the only problem, right, is that,"
00:02:57,00:02:58,"and I see where Anna's coming from,"
00:02:58,00:03:01,"the Wright brothers, when they did it,"
00:03:01,00:03:04,they have a photo and they had lots of people who saw it.
00:03:04,00:03:09,The issue with old Cranky Dick is that we have nothing.
00:03:09,00:03:16,"We have bits of the plane and full bits of the plane,"
00:03:16,00:03:19,"but the original one, no one took a photo"
00:03:19,00:03:20,and no one saw it happen.
00:03:20,00:03:21,And--
00:03:21,00:03:22,"- What, loads of people saw it happen?"
00:03:22,00:03:23,"- Sorry, loads of people saw it happen,"
00:03:23,00:03:25,"but by the time they were properly interviewed about it,"
00:03:25,00:03:26,most of them were dead.
00:03:26,00:03:28,"- I heard that there were some photos,"
00:03:28,00:03:30,but they got destroyed in a flood.
00:03:30,00:03:32,"- Yeah, there were a lot of convenient destruction"
00:03:32,00:03:33,of photos.
00:03:33,00:03:33,(audience laughs)
00:03:33,00:03:36,"But the real, I think the main thing Richard Pierce"
00:03:36,00:03:39,"had working against him was that he was a New Zealander,"
00:03:39,00:03:41,"and in New Zealand, we don't like to show off, so."
00:03:41,00:03:42,- Yeah.
00:03:42,00:03:43,- So while the Wright brothers had your movies
00:03:43,00:03:45,"and your photos of the event,"
00:03:45,00:03:47,"Richard Pierce had a handful of farmers watching,"
00:03:47,00:03:50,"and he had a bit of trouble getting the plane started,"
00:03:50,00:03:51,"actually, which happens to the best of us."
00:03:51,00:03:55,"And after a while, right guys?"
00:03:55,00:03:57,(audience laughs)
00:03:57,00:03:58,"If there's a lot of farmers watching,"
00:03:58,00:04:01,but they're all pointing and giving instructions.
00:04:01,00:04:04,"After a while, after a while, a lot of the farmers left,"
00:04:04,00:04:06,so there was only a really small handful of people.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"He got the plane going,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,but then he didn't want to gloat about it.
00:04:09,00:04:10,"So he knew the farmers would be like,"
00:04:10,00:04:12,"""Oh, okay, I saw your little bicycle plane fly,"
00:04:12,00:04:13,"""mate, calm down."""
00:04:13,00:04:14,(audience laughs)
00:04:14,00:04:17,"But yeah, he just didn't keep any journals."
00:04:17,00:04:19,- So was it like a bicycle?
00:04:19,00:04:21,"- No, it was pretty amazing, really."
00:04:21,00:04:22,He built the entire thing himself.
00:04:22,00:04:24,So the Wright brothers had a lot of money.
00:04:24,00:04:26,"They sort of connected to the Vanderbilt family,"
00:04:26,00:04:29,and they were commissioning engine parts
00:04:29,00:04:30,and stuff like that.
00:04:30,00:04:31,Richard Pierce built the entire thing himself.
00:04:31,00:04:33,I've seen the engine.
00:04:33,00:04:36,"Like, the pistons are made from irrigation pipes."
00:04:36,00:04:38,The cylinders are made from tobacco cans.
00:04:38,00:04:39,"And when you look at it,"
00:04:39,00:04:41,it looks like it's made from tins and cans.
00:04:41,00:04:42,- Wow.
00:04:42,00:04:44,- A bunch of baked bean cans
00:04:44,00:04:47,stacked together for a high school production.
00:04:47,00:04:48,(audience laughs)
00:04:48,00:04:49,"- And the frame was made out of bamboo, right?"
00:04:49,00:04:50,"- Yes, that's right, yes."
00:04:50,00:04:53,- And so he was also known as bamboo dick.
00:04:53,00:04:55,"- Yes, yes."
00:04:55,00:04:56,- Yeah.
00:04:56,00:04:57,- Which grew as famously fast.
00:04:57,00:04:59,- It's the fastest growing plant on earth.
00:04:59,00:05:00,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:00,00:05:01,Just be careful googling that.
00:05:01,00:05:02,I had a bit of a--
00:05:02,00:05:04,(audience laughs)
00:05:04,00:05:06,"- Not proud of it, but you know."
00:05:06,00:05:09,- They did a replica of it to see if it would fly.
00:05:09,00:05:11,"And this was in the 1970s,"
00:05:11,00:05:13,and they made a documentary about it.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"And while they were doing the filming,"
00:05:15,00:05:17,they attached it to a horse.
00:05:17,00:05:20,A loud noise happened and the horse bolted.
00:05:20,00:05:22,"And as it ran, the speed that it went at,"
00:05:22,00:05:25,which it pulled the plane into the air.
00:05:25,00:05:25,- Oh wow.
00:05:25,00:05:27,- And all the crew saw it flying.
00:05:27,00:05:29,"They went, oh my God, it's flying."
00:05:29,00:05:30,It actually worked.
00:05:30,00:05:31,And then it crash-landed.
00:05:31,00:05:33,"And they went, did you get that?"
00:05:33,00:05:34,And no one was filming.
00:05:34,00:05:36,- Oh yeah.
00:05:36,00:05:38,How convenient.
00:05:38,00:05:40,Why did they tie it to a horse?
00:05:40,00:05:40,- I had no idea.
00:05:40,00:05:42,- That's such a Timaru thing to do.
00:05:42,00:05:44,(audience laughs)
00:05:44,00:05:45,"Everything, if you ever go down there,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"everything's tied to a horse, man."
00:05:47,00:05:49,"- Well, Timaru, so not only have you got"
00:05:49,00:05:51,"Richard Pierce airport down there,"
00:05:51,00:05:54,"and it is where you are from, where you were born."
00:05:54,00:05:56,"Also, another notable character from there"
00:05:56,00:05:57,"is Farlap, a horse."
00:05:57,00:05:59,"- Yes, yeah, I can't believe it."
00:05:59,00:06:02,- Farlap was sired there and the father of Farlap
00:06:02,00:06:04,"was called, what was he called, Night Raid."
00:06:04,00:06:07,And Night Raid had a bunch of award-winning horses.
00:06:07,00:06:08,"Farlap, which was the biggest,"
00:06:08,00:06:10,"there was one called Lady Graceful, Pillow Fight,"
00:06:10,00:06:12,and one called Peter Jackson.
00:06:12,00:06:13,- Wow.
00:06:13,00:06:14,(audience laughs)
00:06:14,00:06:15,- Really?
00:06:15,00:06:16,"- Yeah, for incidents."
00:06:16,00:06:17,- It is weird.
00:06:17,00:06:20,Do you know how big a deal they make of him in Australia?
00:06:20,00:06:21,It's mad.
00:06:21,00:06:22,And he's from New Zealand.
00:06:22,00:06:23,I was astonished.
00:06:23,00:06:26,It's so odd that they've spread Farlap
00:06:26,00:06:28,over three different locations in Australia.
00:06:28,00:06:29,"Like, would you do that to someone you love?"
00:06:29,00:06:32,They worship this horse for non-Australian-New Zealand
00:06:32,00:06:33,listeners.
00:06:33,00:06:36,Farlap is the biggest celebrity in Australian history.
00:06:36,00:06:37,(audience laughs)
00:06:37,00:06:40,Incredible race horse from the first half of the 20th century.
00:06:40,00:06:43,It was a very sweet story because a trainer
00:06:43,00:06:46,persuaded a businessman to buy him from New Zealand.
00:06:46,00:06:50,And then he turned up and his face was all covered in warts.
00:06:50,00:06:52,"And so the businessman went, that's disgusting."
00:06:52,00:06:53,That's a horrible horse.
00:06:53,00:06:54,"No, I'm not gonna pay to train it."
00:06:54,00:06:56,So the guy trained it for free.
00:06:56,00:07:00,"And yeah, it won all the races there were for ages."
00:07:00,00:07:02,And then there was an assassination attempt
00:07:02,00:07:03,and everything.
00:07:03,00:07:05,"But then when he died,"
00:07:05,00:07:07,they couldn't decide where to keep bits of him.
00:07:07,00:07:09,So his hide is in Melbourne Museum.
00:07:09,00:07:11,"Skeleton in the, actually a skeleton is in New Zealand,"
00:07:11,00:07:12,I think.
00:07:12,00:07:13,Oh yeah.
00:07:13,00:07:14,Yeah?
00:07:14,00:07:15,That's actually the best bit.
00:07:15,00:07:16,And I think it's heart.
00:07:16,00:07:16,"I totally, yeah."
00:07:16,00:07:17,(laughs)
00:07:17,00:07:19,"You want the bones, mate."
00:07:19,00:07:19,(laughs)
00:07:19,00:07:22,And his heart is in the National Museum of Australia.
00:07:22,00:07:23,"So yeah, you've got the skeleton."
00:07:23,00:07:24,That's good.
00:07:24,00:07:25,Farlap.
00:07:25,00:07:25,Is that a New Zealand thing?
00:07:25,00:07:26,"Is that what's gonna happen with you, Josh?"
00:07:26,00:07:27,When you go?
00:07:27,00:07:28,"Yeah, I hope so."
00:07:28,00:07:29,(audience laughs)
00:07:29,00:07:30,"It's gonna take a while to get the hide off,"
00:07:30,00:07:31,to be honest.
00:07:31,00:07:33,(audience laughs)
00:07:33,00:07:34,We'll keep the bones at home.
00:07:34,00:07:35,Yeah.
00:07:35,00:07:38,"Actually, there was a session at the National Museum."
00:07:38,00:07:41,Farlap was hit by the mob.
00:07:41,00:07:42,Right?
00:07:42,00:07:43,Yes.
00:07:43,00:07:45,"This was by shooting, which didn't get him,"
00:07:45,00:07:47,and he went on to win a race that day.
00:07:47,00:07:48,"The mob, did you say?"
00:07:48,00:07:49,Yeah.
00:07:49,00:07:51,Did they leave a human head in his bed?
00:07:51,00:07:54,(audience laughs)
00:07:54,00:08:01,"I think we should really emphasise just quickly,"
00:08:01,00:08:02,"going back to this first powered flight,"
00:08:02,00:08:04,which appears how humble he genuinely was.
00:08:04,00:08:08,"When he was interviewed, he refused to take credit almost."
00:08:08,00:08:11,"He misremembered it, so most of the evidence,"
00:08:11,00:08:12,"and most people who've researched it,"
00:08:12,00:08:14,agree now that he was the first powered flight.
00:08:14,00:08:17,It was nine to 18 months before the Wright brothers.
00:08:17,00:08:18,"But when he was asked to remember it,"
00:08:18,00:08:20,"he said, ""I don't think I did anything practical with it"
00:08:20,00:08:23,"until 1904,"" incorrect."
00:08:23,00:08:24,"He was doing it in 1903 or 1902,"
00:08:24,00:08:26,'cause they interviewed all these sort of
00:08:26,00:08:29,"80, 90-year-olds in the '70s and '80s, I think,"
00:08:29,00:08:31,who all remembered sort of when in their lives
00:08:31,00:08:33,"it had happened, they could place it historically,"
00:08:33,00:08:35,so they could put the event in context.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"But he just said, ""You know, know the Wright brothers,"
00:08:38,00:08:41,"they have fair cop, they should get the credit."
00:08:41,00:08:43,"I'm just, you know, no invention is really"
00:08:43,00:08:45,"invented by a single person, it's just all inevitable"
00:08:45,00:08:47,"that someone will come up with it."""
00:08:47,00:08:48,It was just bizarre.
00:08:48,00:08:50,"The other thing is, the Wright brothers,"
00:08:50,00:08:53,they send it up with a catapult or something.
00:08:53,00:08:54,It was like--
00:08:54,00:08:55,It was down a big rail slide.
00:08:55,00:08:55,Yeah.
00:08:55,00:08:57,"Yeah, like a sort of water slide, but without water."
00:08:57,00:08:58,And his one.
00:08:58,00:08:58,Yeah.
00:08:58,00:09:01,(audience laughs)
00:09:01,00:09:02,Yeah.
00:09:02,00:09:04,"To describe it for you, you might not understand."
00:09:04,00:09:05,I got it.
00:09:05,00:09:09,"His one was much more like modern planes, right?"
00:09:09,00:09:10,Yeah.
00:09:10,00:09:11,"Yeah, that's right."
00:09:11,00:09:12,What's really amazing about it is that he left
00:09:12,00:09:14,"zero research, and because of that,"
00:09:14,00:09:16,"he had zero impact on the aircraft industry,"
00:09:16,00:09:19,"'cause no one knew he existed, no one knew what he did."
00:09:19,00:09:21,"Yet, the Wright brothers had a biplane,"
00:09:21,00:09:22,"they had an engine mounted behind them,"
00:09:22,00:09:24,"they had skids instead of wheels,"
00:09:24,00:09:27,and yet planes evolved to be more like Richard Pierce's
00:09:27,00:09:30,"plane, which had wheels, a variable-pitch propeller,"
00:09:30,00:09:33,"single-plane engine mounted in front,"
00:09:33,00:09:35,propeller on a center crankshaft.
00:09:35,00:09:37,"So really, bamboo dick was right."
00:09:37,00:09:37,Yeah.
00:09:37,00:09:38,(audience laughs)
00:09:38,00:09:41,"And all on his own, he built the engine on his own."
00:09:41,00:09:45,"He just went to someone, the only other person in New Zealand"
00:09:45,00:09:48,who knew what an engine was basically at that time.
00:09:48,00:09:49,"He was so fresh, that's not a knock."
00:09:49,00:09:52,Like 10 years before his flight was the first time
00:09:52,00:09:54,that there was a recorded hot air balloon flight
00:09:54,00:09:55,in New Zealand.
00:09:55,00:09:56,Really?
00:09:56,00:09:57,"Yeah, in 1903."
00:09:57,00:09:58,"So we're talking about, like, there's a lot of tech"
00:09:58,00:09:59,that wasn't yet here.
00:09:59,00:10:02,So this guy taught him how to make a machine.
00:10:02,00:10:04,He then gets on his bicycle to go and collect
00:10:04,00:10:06,all the bamboo that he needs for the plane itself.
00:10:06,00:10:08,"So he's just riding in and out of town,"
00:10:08,00:10:11,"building this eccentric thing that no one's ever seen before,"
00:10:11,00:10:15,"'cause it doesn't exist, and yeah, and then he does it."
00:10:15,00:10:16,"The guy he worked with, who was the engineer,"
00:10:16,00:10:18,"just had a build on his, you know,"
00:10:18,00:10:19,"everyone works together on this,"
00:10:19,00:10:21,was a huge deal in his own right.
00:10:21,00:10:24,"The engineer who was the guy called Cecil Walkden Wood,"
00:10:24,00:10:25,"I don't know how one only is here,"
00:10:25,00:10:27,but he sounded very cool.
00:10:27,00:10:28,So he made New Zealand's first motorbike
00:10:28,00:10:33,"and probably first motor car, I think, around 1901,"
00:10:33,00:10:35,and he powered it with gunpowder.
00:10:35,00:10:36,Yeah.
00:10:36,00:10:37,(audience laughs)
00:10:37,00:10:38,And he got...
00:10:38,00:10:40,(laughs)
00:10:40,00:10:42,It goes very fast over a very short time.
00:10:42,00:10:47,But he bought his gunpowder from a local chemist
00:10:47,00:10:49,who was called William Gunn.
00:10:49,00:10:50,(audience laughs)
00:10:50,00:10:51,"Brilliant, yeah, the chances, yeah."
00:10:51,00:10:52,That's great.
00:10:52,00:10:54,"So Richard Pierce's engine that he made himself,"
00:10:54,00:10:57,a Model T Ford engine has 20 horsepower
00:10:57,00:10:59,and weighed about 136 kg.
00:10:59,00:11:02,Richard Pierce's homemade engine out of baked bean cans
00:11:02,00:11:06,had 25 horsepower and weighed about 57 kg.
00:11:06,00:11:10,"So, more power and about less than half the weight."
00:11:10,00:11:13,And the Wright Brothers engine had 12 horsepower and 82 kg.
00:11:13,00:11:15,"I mean, how embarrassing."
00:11:15,00:11:17,(audience laughs)
00:11:17,00:11:19,Although he did keep crashing it.
00:11:19,00:11:20,I'm just...
00:11:20,00:11:23,"One thing I thought, there were like three separate counts"
00:11:23,00:11:24,of it crashing into a bush.
00:11:24,00:11:26,It crashed into a bush again.
00:11:26,00:11:27,Another bush.
00:11:27,00:11:28,He had a lot of bush.
00:11:28,00:11:30,(audience laughs)
00:11:30,00:11:31,He was a very bad farmer.
00:11:31,00:11:33,Like apparently his animals were starving.
00:11:33,00:11:34,He's terrible.
00:11:34,00:11:36,"He didn't care, he didn't care."
00:11:36,00:11:38,There's only a few instances in which the media
00:11:38,00:11:41,had any kind of interest in him whatsoever
00:11:41,00:11:42,during his lifetime.
00:11:42,00:11:44,One happened in 1909.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"At this point, he's a really kind of dishevelled"
00:11:46,00:11:48,reclusive in his house.
00:11:48,00:11:50,And they come to him because they wanna interview him
00:11:50,00:11:53,"about the fact that between June and August of 1909,"
00:11:53,00:11:55,lots and lots of New Zealanders thought
00:11:55,00:11:58,that aliens were invading because they kept seeing stuff
00:11:58,00:11:59,in the sky.
00:11:59,00:12:01,"People were going, we think either aliens"
00:12:01,00:12:04,"or Germans are invading, we're not sure."
00:12:04,00:12:06,And they were reporting it to the police.
00:12:06,00:12:08,"There were multiple counts of kids in school,"
00:12:08,00:12:11,grounds seeing an object land and fly off again.
00:12:11,00:12:13,And it's gone down in the sort of annals
00:12:13,00:12:17,of like UFO cannon of sort of like legit encounters.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"But they went to him at that point and said,"
00:12:19,00:12:21,"""Didn't you try and build one of those things"
00:12:21,00:12:22,"""that was going up?"""
00:12:22,00:12:24,And that's one of the only interviews that we have
00:12:24,00:12:26,"during his lifetime, yeah."
00:12:26,00:12:27,- And what was that point?
00:12:27,00:12:28,"It was like, are you an alien?"
00:12:28,00:12:29,"- Well, they were."
00:12:29,00:12:30,- Yeah.
00:12:30,00:12:31,- What did they think?
00:12:31,00:12:32,"- No, they were like."
00:12:32,00:12:33,- Can we go up and get them?
00:12:33,00:12:33,Can we use that?
00:12:33,00:12:36,"- Yeah, or is it possible that we are being visited"
00:12:36,00:12:38,"by you know, Americans who are flying planes"
00:12:38,00:12:40,who they just haven't told us and like they're going
00:12:40,00:12:41,from city to city and so on.
00:12:41,00:12:46,- You also invented a bike that you don't pedal cyclically.
00:12:46,00:12:48,You pump up and down with your feet.
00:12:48,00:12:48,- Oh.
00:12:48,00:12:49,"- And it was like a piston bike and it wrote,"
00:12:49,00:12:54,but it also had tires that inflated as you rode.
00:12:54,00:12:55,"- Oh, that's amazing."
00:12:55,00:12:56,- Which must have been so hard to make.
00:12:56,00:12:58,I would suggest making better tires in the first place.
00:12:58,00:12:59,- Yeah.
00:12:59,00:13:01,"- But it was like, these bloody tires keep getting flat."
00:13:01,00:13:03,But I've seen the picture of that bike
00:13:03,00:13:05,and the tires are flat.
00:13:05,00:13:06,- Really?
00:13:06,00:13:08,"- So maybe, maybe he was right."
00:13:08,00:13:10,"- Well, 'cause you do, well, if you're not a cyclist,"
00:13:10,00:13:12,you don't want to waste air.
00:13:12,00:13:12,You know?
00:13:12,00:13:14,(laughing)
00:13:14,00:13:15,I think that's fair enough.
00:13:15,00:13:16,I think that's a good point.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"- Yeah, eco-friendly."
00:13:18,00:13:21,- I thought I'd look at a few more local achievements
00:13:21,00:13:22,as soon as we're in Christchurch.
00:13:22,00:13:24,So I went on the Guinness World Records
00:13:24,00:13:27,and I found out that the largest ever game of leapfrog
00:13:27,00:13:29,was in Christchurch.
00:13:29,00:13:33,"It involved 1,348 participants."
00:13:33,00:13:34,- Okay.
00:13:34,00:13:37,"- Which I think, by coincidence,"
00:13:37,00:13:40,is the exact number of people in this building right now.
00:13:40,00:13:41,(laughing)
00:13:41,00:13:43,"If you include all the staff and us four,"
00:13:43,00:13:44,I think it's excited.
00:13:44,00:13:46,So we could do that.
00:13:46,00:13:47,- Okay.
00:13:47,00:13:48,- All right.
00:13:48,00:13:50,"- Slightly messes with the format of the show, but yeah."
00:13:50,00:13:53,And the most teabags thrown into mugs in 30 seconds
00:13:53,00:13:57,"for it, for a team of two,"
00:13:57,00:13:58,(laughing)
00:13:58,00:14:00,that was broken in Christchurch in 2021.
00:14:00,00:14:02,- Wow.
00:14:02,00:14:03,- It was 11.
00:14:03,00:14:06,(laughing)
00:14:06,00:14:07,- Final thing.
00:14:07,00:14:10,- The most teabags thrown into mugs in 30 seconds
00:14:10,00:14:12,by a team of one is 13.
00:14:12,00:14:15,(laughing)
00:14:15,00:14:16,- Yeah.
00:14:16,00:14:18,"- And one final thing in Christchurch,"
00:14:18,00:14:21,the greatest distance ever run on a treadmill
00:14:21,00:14:23,in 48 hours by a female.
00:14:23,00:14:25,Can you guess how far she ran?
00:14:25,00:14:26,"- Well, you don't get anywhere, do you?"
00:14:26,00:14:27,"- Yeah, zero miles."
00:14:27,00:14:29,(laughing)
00:14:29,00:14:32,But she thought she'd run 340 kilometers.
00:14:32,00:14:33,- Okay.
00:14:33,00:14:34,- Okay.
00:14:34,00:14:35,- How long is that?
00:14:35,00:14:36,"- Well, the days when we missed the plane"
00:14:36,00:14:37,"are quite a long way back, aren't they?"
00:14:37,00:14:37,(laughing)
00:14:37,00:14:39,"- Yeah, I tried to see if there were sort of"
00:14:39,00:14:41,"any notable stories that came out of Timurut,"
00:14:41,00:14:42,"you know, just like any great news stories."
00:14:42,00:14:44,The only thing I could find was that the
00:14:44,00:14:47,Timurut District Council were trying to investigate
00:14:47,00:14:50,"a missing $5,000 toilet unit."
00:14:50,00:14:53,They basically just nicked this giant outdoor toilet.
00:14:53,00:14:55,"And yeah, and just, I mean,"
00:14:55,00:14:57,it doesn't get any more interesting except--
00:14:57,00:14:59,"- Well, I mean, look, I've dealt with these allegations"
00:14:59,00:15:00,in the past.
00:15:00,00:15:01,(laughing)
00:15:01,00:15:02,"- To be honest, I'm sick of them."
00:15:02,00:15:03,It's time to move on.
00:15:03,00:15:06,"- Maybe someone tied a horse to it, and they just--"
00:15:06,00:15:08,(laughing)
00:15:08,00:15:10,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:15:10,00:15:11,"Shout out to the journalists, by the way,"
00:15:11,00:15:14,"who ends the piece by saying, ""Police are investigating,"""
00:15:14,00:15:15,but still have nothing to go on.
00:15:15,00:15:16,- Oh my God.
00:15:16,00:15:17,(laughing)
00:15:17,00:15:18,- Come on.
00:15:18,00:15:19,- Decisions were made.
00:15:19,00:15:22,(upbeat music)
00:15:22,00:15:29,"- It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:15:29,00:15:31,"- My fact this week is that in the 1940s,"
00:15:31,00:15:35,a law was passed that meant wherever the Dutch princess
00:15:35,00:15:37,"stood, didn't count as a country."
00:15:37,00:15:39,- What?
00:15:39,00:15:41,- So cool and weird.
00:15:41,00:15:43,"I can't find out another time this has happened,"
00:15:43,00:15:45,"but this is amazing, and I read this in a book,"
00:15:45,00:15:47,"which is so fun, and I would recommend."
00:15:47,00:15:49,I found it on my bookshelves recently.
00:15:49,00:15:53,"It's called Atlas of Extinct Countries by Gideon Defoe,"
00:15:53,00:15:56,and it's about all sorts of weird nationality quirks.
00:15:56,00:15:59,"And this story, so this is in 1940,"
00:15:59,00:16:00,Germany invades the Netherlands.
00:16:00,00:16:04,"The Dutch royal family flees, mostly goes to Britain,"
00:16:04,00:16:09,"but the princess, crown princess Juliana, went to Ottawa,"
00:16:09,00:16:11,"and she went with her two daughters to Ottawa,"
00:16:11,00:16:13,"while Germany was occupying the Netherlands,"
00:16:13,00:16:17,"and while there, she got herself knocked up,"
00:16:17,00:16:19,"and there was a problem with that,"
00:16:19,00:16:22,because the law in the Netherlands was that no one
00:16:22,00:16:23,could be in the line of succession
00:16:23,00:16:26,"if they were born on the soil of a foreign country,"
00:16:26,00:16:28,"and she only had two daughters at the time,"
00:16:28,00:16:29,"so if she'd had a son,"
00:16:29,00:16:32,"that would have meant he would be presumptive,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,"but he couldn't be 'cause he'd be born in Canada,"
00:16:34,00:16:36,"so they had to do something about this,"
00:16:36,00:16:39,"so the government got together with a bunch of lawyers,"
00:16:39,00:16:40,"and they concocted a new law,"
00:16:40,00:16:44,"which basically said, wherever this pregnant lady is,"
00:16:44,00:16:48,"isn't Canada, because in case she gives birth,"
00:16:48,00:16:49,it can't be on Canadian soil.
00:16:49,00:16:52,- And did the Canadians agree with this?
00:16:52,00:16:54,"- I think, you know, it's only a small bit of their soil,"
00:16:54,00:16:56,it's not like you're stealing an acre of land.
00:16:56,00:16:58,"- Well, it depends where she walks, though."
00:16:58,00:17:00,"If she gave birth, sort of, I don't know,"
00:17:00,00:17:02,"in the prime minister's chair or something,"
00:17:02,00:17:04,"and then to boot, like."
00:17:04,00:17:06,- He was probably very careful not to lend him
00:17:06,00:17:08,her chair at that time.
00:17:08,00:17:10,- But was it the case that it was technically
00:17:10,00:17:12,"born in the Netherlands, or was it just no,"
00:17:12,00:17:13,it didn't belong to any?
00:17:13,00:17:14,- It was weirdly nothing.
00:17:14,00:17:15,I think maybe making it in the Netherlands
00:17:15,00:17:17,"would have been even harder,"
00:17:17,00:17:19,"and the law was that as long as it's not another country,"
00:17:19,00:17:22,"you're okay, so it was just an extra-territorial zone,"
00:17:22,00:17:23,basically. - Right.
00:17:23,00:17:25,"- The thing is, if she'd have been born in Canada"
00:17:25,00:17:29,"under normal rules, then she would have been British,"
00:17:29,00:17:31,because anyone who was born in Canada
00:17:31,00:17:32,"on those days was British,"
00:17:32,00:17:34,because it was a farm of British colony.
00:17:34,00:17:37,"Although, because she was a Protestant descendant"
00:17:37,00:17:40,"of Sophia of Hanover by British law,"
00:17:40,00:17:41,she's British anyway.
00:17:41,00:17:42,- Right.
00:17:42,00:17:46,- It's one of the weirdest ways to get citizenship
00:17:46,00:17:47,"of any country, I think."
00:17:47,00:17:48,"But you know, you have to do the tests"
00:17:48,00:17:50,when you go to different places.
00:17:50,00:17:52,"To be British, all you really have to do"
00:17:52,00:17:55,"is to be a Protestant descendant of Sophia of Hanover,"
00:17:55,00:17:56,and you're straight in.
00:17:56,00:17:57,- Really?
00:17:57,00:18:00,"You know, if you're Dutch and you're in Canada at the time,"
00:18:00,00:18:01,"you know when you see in movies,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,sometimes someone's running towards an embassy
00:18:03,00:18:05,so that they don't get caught.
00:18:05,00:18:07,"Could, if they'd hopped on her shoulders"
00:18:07,00:18:09,"for like a shoulder ride, would they?"
00:18:09,00:18:10,(audience laughing)
00:18:10,00:18:11,- Yeah?
00:18:11,00:18:12,"- Yeah, but you then have to stay"
00:18:12,00:18:14,on her shoulders the whole time.
00:18:14,00:18:16,"And as soon as the baby's out, it's Canada again."
00:18:16,00:18:18,"- Yeah, but you make her walk to an embassy."
00:18:18,00:18:19,"- I see, I see, yeah."
00:18:19,00:18:23,It's probably easier to leg it to the embassy.
00:18:23,00:18:24,I don't know if you've tried climbing
00:18:24,00:18:26,"on the shoulders of a nine month pregnant woman, but."
00:18:26,00:18:27,(audience laughing)
00:18:27,00:18:28,Very easy.
00:18:28,00:18:30,- My wife and I have some really weird kinks.
00:18:30,00:18:33,(audience laughing)
00:18:33,00:18:35,So was this Princess Juliana?
00:18:35,00:18:36,- Yes.
00:18:36,00:18:38,"Now, I was unaware of the pregnant thing."
00:18:38,00:18:42,"But I do know that after the war,"
00:18:42,00:18:46,"she gave Canada 100,000 tulip bulbs to say thank you."
00:18:46,00:18:47,"- Gee, that's cool."
00:18:47,00:18:50,"- And I just think 100,000 is too much."
00:18:50,00:18:51,(audience laughing)
00:18:51,00:18:53,"Like, you know when, it's just too much, Edmund."
00:18:53,00:18:54,"Like, you know when you go to,"
00:18:54,00:18:55,someone gives you like a bag of tomatoes
00:18:55,00:18:56,"during tomato season, you go,"
00:18:56,00:18:59,"""Oh, okay, well now I've got to deal with all these tomatoes."
00:18:59,00:19:00,"This fruit flies everywhere."""
00:19:00,00:19:02,"You know, like, they've got to plant"
00:19:02,00:19:04,"100,000 tulip bulbs somewhere."
00:19:04,00:19:05,"They've got to feed them, they've got to keep them alive."
00:19:05,00:19:07,"And you know, when she comes to visit,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,"she's going to be like, ""Where's my 100,000 tulips?"""
00:19:09,00:19:11,"- I know, you can't hide it."
00:19:11,00:19:12,- It's not even just that.
00:19:12,00:19:14,"It didn't stop at 100,000."
00:19:14,00:19:17,"She then went on to give them 20,000 more"
00:19:17,00:19:19,as an extra thanks to the maternity ward
00:19:19,00:19:20,"in the hospital that she gave birth in,"
00:19:20,00:19:22,so they could be planted in the grounds.
00:19:22,00:19:24,And then it became an annual thing.
00:19:24,00:19:27,She would send them tens of thousands of bulbs
00:19:27,00:19:29,every year for her entire reign.
00:19:29,00:19:31,"- To me, it sounds like she's got a lot of tulips"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"hanging around her, she's trying to get rid of them."
00:19:33,00:19:35,- It sounds like big tulip to me.
00:19:35,00:19:36,(all laughing)
00:19:36,00:19:37,"- That's the case of the bulb industry,"
00:19:37,00:19:39,reaching its claw over the world again.
00:19:39,00:19:40,(all laughing)
00:19:40,00:19:42,- All of Canada's mates always getting tulips
00:19:42,00:19:45,"as presents, constantly re-gifted."
00:19:45,00:19:47,That's who they don't know her.
00:19:47,00:19:48,- This kind of thing did happen
00:19:48,00:19:50,in a few other places around that time.
00:19:50,00:19:54,"So in 1945, the British government ceded"
00:19:54,00:19:58,suite 212 at Claridge's to Yugoslavia.
00:19:58,00:20:00,"So the room, 212, they said,"
00:20:00,00:20:02,"""This is now a part of Yugoslavia,"
00:20:02,00:20:05,"""so that the air to Yugoslav throne could be born"
00:20:05,00:20:06,"""on Slavic soil."""
00:20:06,00:20:09,"- So does that mean like the house, like the maids,"
00:20:09,00:20:11,did they have to go through customs
00:20:11,00:20:12,and like paint the room or what?
00:20:12,00:20:13,(all laughing)
00:20:13,00:20:14,- I guess so.
00:20:14,00:20:18,"According to the story, they got a spade full of soil"
00:20:18,00:20:21,from Yugoslavia and put it underneath the bed.
00:20:21,00:20:24,"So that not just was it technically Slavic soil,"
00:20:24,00:20:25,it was literally Slavic soil.
00:20:25,00:20:26,- Yes.
00:20:26,00:20:27,- I'm not sure if that's true.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"- 'Cause yeah, there's rumors of that kind of stuff"
00:20:28,00:20:31,"with George Washington, there was a statue in London."
00:20:31,00:20:34,They said that the soil that the statue was placed on
00:20:34,00:20:36,"was American soil that was imported,"
00:20:36,00:20:39,so that Washington wasn't technically on British soil.
00:20:39,00:20:41,But I think that was the tourist guide to tell you that.
00:20:41,00:20:43,I think that might have been false.
00:20:43,00:20:45,- It's pretty easy to fake soil.
00:20:45,00:20:47,(all laughing)
00:20:47,00:20:50,I wrote a pretty tight record down in the South Island.
00:20:50,00:20:51,(all laughing)
00:20:51,00:20:52,"- Yeah, but on the other hand,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,"having come into New Zealand and Australia,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,"it's not that easy to bring soil in, is it?"
00:20:56,00:20:58,(all laughing)
00:20:58,00:20:59,- That's right.
00:20:59,00:21:02,- He just keeps handing his golf shoes over every time
00:21:02,00:21:02,we come into--
00:21:02,00:21:04,"- This is a great tip, by the way."
00:21:04,00:21:08,"So if you play golf and you bring golf shoes in,"
00:21:08,00:21:11,you have to declare them because they might have soil on them.
00:21:11,00:21:14,"But when you declare them, they clean them for you."
00:21:14,00:21:15,- Lovely.
00:21:15,00:21:18,"- It's amazing, I've never had such clean golf shoes."
00:21:18,00:21:21,- It's a very expensive way to get your golf shoes cleaned
00:21:21,00:21:23,by a ticket to Australia or New Zealand
00:21:23,00:21:24,every time you need it done.
00:21:24,00:21:25,(all laughing)
00:21:25,00:21:28,- I was actually reading a few of the other fun
00:21:28,00:21:31,"weird nationality examples in this book,"
00:21:31,00:21:33,"""The Atlas of Extinct Countries."""
00:21:33,00:21:34,One of my favorites is something called
00:21:34,00:21:37,"""The Republic of Goose,"" which is a village."
00:21:37,00:21:40,It's in the mountains of Southwestern France.
00:21:40,00:21:42,"It's a little hamlet, but it's this weird thing"
00:21:42,00:21:44,happened in the 19th century where this rumor spread
00:21:44,00:21:46,that it was its own independent republic.
00:21:46,00:21:49,It's quite hard to work out where it came from.
00:21:49,00:21:52,I think an MP referred to it as a republic in 1827.
00:21:52,00:21:54,And you go back through newspaper archives
00:21:54,00:21:56,"and there'll be stories in the American newspaper saying,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,"""Well, of course, there's this tiny village of Goose,"""
00:21:58,00:22:01,which is its own independent republic in France.
00:22:01,00:22:06,"It had no legal basis, but two things I like about it."
00:22:06,00:22:09,One is that according to an 1896 article
00:22:09,00:22:10,"from an American tourist who went there,"
00:22:10,00:22:13,"the women there remained beautiful, well into middle life"
00:22:13,00:22:16,in striking contrast to the lowland women of France.
00:22:16,00:22:18,(all laughing)
00:22:18,00:22:19,That's interesting.
00:22:19,00:22:21,"And the other thing is lowland women,"
00:22:21,00:22:23,"because Goose was on the top of a hill,"
00:22:23,00:22:26,the other cool thing about it is that
00:22:26,00:22:28,it was at least an hour's hike to get down
00:22:28,00:22:30,to the bottom of the hill to get anywhere else.
00:22:30,00:22:32,"And when someone dies in Goose, that's a faff."
00:22:32,00:22:35,So they created a chute out of timber
00:22:35,00:22:38,and they just got their corpses whenever anyone died.
00:22:38,00:22:40,"- Like a water slide, but with no water."
00:22:40,00:22:43,(all laughing)
00:22:43,00:22:47,- That's absolutely right.
00:22:47,00:22:49,"- Wow, that's very cool."
00:22:49,00:22:52,"- The body just, what a wonderful way to end your life,"
00:22:52,00:22:55,or to begin death as a little prayer at the top.
00:22:55,00:22:56,"Tip them over the edge,"
00:22:56,00:22:58,"slid them down to the town at the bottom,"
00:22:58,00:22:59,"which presumably was like,"
00:22:59,00:23:01,"""Stop sliding your dead bodies down here."""
00:23:01,00:23:03,(all laughing)
00:23:03,00:23:04,- That's so funny.
00:23:04,00:23:06,I got a riddle for you.
00:23:06,00:23:07,- Okay.
00:23:07,00:23:10,"- Okay, so in 2009, a girl was born in China."
00:23:10,00:23:14,Her father was a Canadian citizen born in Libya
00:23:14,00:23:17,and her mother was a Chinese citizen.
00:23:17,00:23:19,What was her nationality?
00:23:19,00:23:21,- You can have this.
00:23:21,00:23:22,- So she was born in China.
00:23:22,00:23:23,- I'd say Chinese.
00:23:23,00:23:24,- She was born in China.
00:23:24,00:23:27,"Her father was Canadian, but he was born in Libya."
00:23:27,00:23:28,Her mother was Chinese.
00:23:28,00:23:30,"Now, you would think Chinese,"
00:23:30,00:23:33,"but because the two parents were not married,"
00:23:33,00:23:34,"according to Chinese law,"
00:23:34,00:23:36,"he goes on what the father's nationality was,"
00:23:36,00:23:37,so she couldn't be Chinese.
00:23:37,00:23:38,- Okay.
00:23:38,00:23:40,The daughter was the force.
00:23:40,00:23:43,(all laughing)
00:23:43,00:23:47,"- Okay, so."
00:23:47,00:23:48,(all laughing)
00:23:48,00:23:49,- Or.
00:23:49,00:23:52,- Let's pretend he never said that.
00:23:52,00:23:53,- Or Libyan.
00:23:53,00:23:56,- So he didn't have his Libyan citizenship anymore
00:23:56,00:23:59,'cause he'd renounced that 'cause he'd moved to Canada.
00:23:59,00:24:00,"But according to Canadian law,"
00:24:00,00:24:03,you could only be Canadian if you were born in Canada
00:24:03,00:24:06,or if one of your parents was born in Canada
00:24:06,00:24:07,and he wasn't born in Canada.
00:24:07,00:24:09,"- Oh my gosh, she didn't, she had nothing."
00:24:09,00:24:12,"- Well, the answer is she was Irish."
00:24:12,00:24:14,(all laughing)
00:24:14,00:24:16,"So I'm quite surprised she didn't get that, Josh, actually."
00:24:16,00:24:19,"- No, I was gonna say Scottish, which is different."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"It's different, but it's Indonesian,"
00:24:22,00:24:24,and I was pretty close mentally.
00:24:24,00:24:26,"Mentally, that was pretty close."
00:24:26,00:24:27,- Why?
00:24:27,00:24:31,- It turned out that the father's father was born in Ireland
00:24:31,00:24:32,and you can get Irish citizenship
00:24:32,00:24:34,if your grandparents are from there.
00:24:34,00:24:36,"So since she couldn't get any of the others,"
00:24:36,00:24:37,they gave her Irish citizenship.
00:24:37,00:24:38,"- Very good, good old Ireland."
00:24:38,00:24:40,- And then eventually it got in the news and stuff
00:24:40,00:24:41,"and the Canadians went,"
00:24:41,00:24:43,"""Oh yeah, we should probably give her Canadian citizenship."""
00:24:43,00:24:45,"So she did get that in the end, but yeah."
00:24:45,00:24:48,"- Oh, Ireland is always sort of scooping up the rejects"
00:24:48,00:24:49,from the rest of the world.
00:24:49,00:24:50,It's so nice.
00:24:50,00:24:52,- And in a very nice way.
00:24:52,00:24:55,I remember when we were in the EU
00:24:55,00:24:57,"and sort of everyone found a very, very distant"
00:24:57,00:24:59,bit of Irish ancestry about it.
00:24:59,00:25:00,"Yeah, we'll have you."
00:25:00,00:25:02,"Yeah, yeah, sure."
00:25:02,00:25:03,Come on in.
00:25:03,00:25:04,(all laughing)
00:25:04,00:25:06,"- Well, I went, I mean, I'm loving all this stuff,"
00:25:06,00:25:09,but I really dug deep on the tulip buzz.
00:25:09,00:25:11,(all laughing)
00:25:11,00:25:13,And I went down quite a rabbit hole
00:25:13,00:25:15,of terrible gifts from royal families.
00:25:15,00:25:16,- Really nice.
00:25:16,00:25:18,"- And in 1851, Queen Victoria"
00:25:18,00:25:21,sent American president of the United States.
00:25:21,00:25:24,(all laughing)
00:25:24,00:25:28,"You see, the Queen Victoria sent the president,"
00:25:28,00:25:32,"Millard Fillmore, a 1,000 pound block of cheddar cheese."
00:25:32,00:25:33,- Wow.
00:25:33,00:25:36,"- That's 450 KGs, it's nearly half a tonne of cheddar."
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- Wow, so like a week's supply almost."
00:25:38,00:25:41,(all laughing)
00:25:41,00:25:43,"- Well, apparently it's quite hard to transport"
00:25:43,00:25:45,and became quite smelly.
00:25:45,00:25:48,"So, I think it was meant to cement"
00:25:48,00:25:51,"American-British relations, but it just stank."
00:25:51,00:25:52,So.
00:25:52,00:25:56,"And in the 1860s, Napoleon III of France"
00:25:56,00:25:58,sent Emperor Maximilian of Mexico
00:25:58,00:26:00,a stuffed alligator wearing a crown.
00:26:00,00:26:02,(all laughing)
00:26:02,00:26:05,"Again, to celebrate the French-backed emperor's rule"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"over Mexico, but everyone thought it was just a bit weird."
00:26:07,00:26:09,"- Yeah, tacky, it's tacky."
00:26:09,00:26:11,"It goes in the guest room, that."
00:26:11,00:26:12,- And there's a more recent one.
00:26:12,00:26:12,You guys might know about this.
00:26:12,00:26:13,"I don't know if this is controversial,"
00:26:13,00:26:16,"but Prince Charles, who was Prince at the time."
00:26:16,00:26:18,(all laughing)
00:26:18,00:26:20,"Guys, I've got a lot of facts."
00:26:20,00:26:21,(all laughing)
00:26:21,00:26:24,He visited Haiti as they were recovering from an earthquake
00:26:24,00:26:27,and he gifted them a jar of sand from the Dead Sea.
00:26:27,00:26:28,- Wow. - And it was seen
00:26:28,00:26:30,as not particularly helpful.
00:26:30,00:26:31,(all laughing)
00:26:31,00:26:34,"If anything, the last thing you want after an earthquake"
00:26:34,00:26:35,is more dirt.
00:26:35,00:26:37,(all laughing)
00:26:37,00:26:38,"- We've got to move on in a sec, guys."
00:26:38,00:26:42,- There's sort of about diplomatic quirks
00:26:42,00:26:44,and I kind of love all the weird diplomatic quirks
00:26:44,00:26:46,and immunities there are.
00:26:46,00:26:48,I think actually my favorite example
00:26:48,00:26:50,"of like a diplomatic rule that's made,"
00:26:50,00:26:51,it was in 1917.
00:26:51,00:26:54,I don't think we've talked about Lenin's train trip
00:26:54,00:26:56,"back to the Russian Revolution,"
00:26:56,00:26:58,which was the thing that triggered the Russian Revolution.
00:26:58,00:27:02,"So in 1917, Lenin was taken in a secret sealed train,"
00:27:02,00:27:05,which was kind of officially given Russian embassy status.
00:27:05,00:27:07,"He was taken from Zurich to Petersburg,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,sort of so that he could start the revolution.
00:27:09,00:27:12,It was arranged by Germany
00:27:12,00:27:15,because Germany wanted to weaken the Russian war effort
00:27:15,00:27:17,at the time and it thought the best way to do this
00:27:17,00:27:19,is to get this crazy revolutionary
00:27:19,00:27:20,to go and start a revolution there.
00:27:20,00:27:23,So the Germans sort of sent Lenin back.
00:27:23,00:27:26,"So it was quite awkward because Germany and Russia are at war,"
00:27:26,00:27:28,but they're sharing a train together
00:27:28,00:27:29,and helping each other out.
00:27:29,00:27:31,So they drew a chalk line
00:27:31,00:27:33,down the middle of the train carriage
00:27:33,00:27:35,and all the German sort of soldiers and guards
00:27:35,00:27:38,stood on one side and Lenin and his mates stood on the other.
00:27:38,00:27:39,And it's such a conflicted journey.
00:27:39,00:27:41,They had to swap carriages about four times.
00:27:41,00:27:45,"So they always had to get off, get on, redraw the line."
00:27:45,00:27:48,"Say, you're not allowed to cross over."
00:27:48,00:27:51,"But the thing I actually love most about this,"
00:27:51,00:27:53,"because it's such a nice insight into Lenin's mind,"
00:27:53,00:27:55,is he also organized a bathroom rotor?
00:27:55,00:27:57,"So on this train,"
00:27:57,00:28:00,"there was one bathroom between 34 people,"
00:28:00,00:28:02,"half Russians, half Germans."
00:28:02,00:28:05,Lenin had forbidden anyone to smoke on the train
00:28:05,00:28:07,except in the bathroom.
00:28:07,00:28:07,This caused a problem
00:28:07,00:28:09,because everyone kept hogging the bathroom.
00:28:09,00:28:12,So he started issuing passes.
00:28:12,00:28:14,He's on his way to start the greatest revolution
00:28:14,00:28:15,of the 20th century.
00:28:15,00:28:18,He was issuing bathroom passes
00:28:18,00:28:20,and you got a second-class pass
00:28:20,00:28:21,if you needed to have a cigarette
00:28:21,00:28:23,and you got a first-class pass
00:28:23,00:28:25,"if you needed, you know, to..."
00:28:25,00:28:27,"- And number two, go on. - Have a number two."
00:28:27,00:28:28,"Or a number one, you know?"
00:28:28,00:28:30,He didn't distinguish between those in the pass system.
00:28:30,00:28:32,So you could.
00:28:32,00:28:34,"There's Lenin like, you want a week?"
00:28:34,00:28:36,"Yes, there's a first-class pass"
00:28:36,00:28:37,and that gave you priority
00:28:37,00:28:38,"and you got to bang on the door and say,"
00:28:38,00:28:40,"""Oi, smoker, get out."""
00:28:40,00:28:41,"- Amazing. - And that's, um..."
00:28:41,00:28:44,Just... That's... I find that really entertaining.
00:28:44,00:28:46,LAUGHTER
00:28:46,00:28:47,- What's that? - Good old Lenin.
00:28:47,00:28:49,"- Good old Lenin. - Good old Lenin, you know?"
00:28:49,00:28:51,Not enough people talk about that side of him.
00:28:51,00:28:54,- That's the answer. - The bathroom monitor side.
00:28:54,00:29:03,"It is time for fact number three,"
00:29:03,00:29:04,and that is my fact.
00:29:04,00:29:07,"My fact this week is that the Marine snail,"
00:29:07,00:29:09,"Litorina saxotillus,"
00:29:09,00:29:12,is otherwise known as the most
00:29:12,00:29:14,misidentified creature in the world.
00:29:14,00:29:17,It has been wrongly identified as a new species
00:29:17,00:29:20,over 113 times
00:29:20,00:29:23,and was first described in 1792.
00:29:23,00:29:25,- This is astonishing. - That's crazy.
00:29:25,00:29:27,- It's crazy. - 'Cause it just looks like a little snail.
00:29:27,00:29:30,"Yeah, it's a little rough periwinkle,"
00:29:30,00:29:32,is the kind of snail.
00:29:32,00:29:36,"And, yeah, it's a snail that just comes in different shapes,"
00:29:36,00:29:38,"different sizes, different colours."
00:29:38,00:29:41,"Yeah, and so as a result, people keep finding it and going,"
00:29:41,00:29:43,"""Wow, this is new,"" and giving it a new name,"
00:29:43,00:29:44,"and then people eventually just go,"
00:29:44,00:29:46,"""Sorry, that is the periwinkle."
00:29:46,00:29:48,"""We need to bring that back to the old name."""
00:29:48,00:29:49,"As far as I could tell,"
00:29:49,00:29:51,"'cause it's a bit hard to get the full list,"
00:29:51,00:29:54,"but I have seen a list, sometimes it's been named six times"
00:29:54,00:29:57,as a new species by the same people.
00:29:57,00:29:58,LAUGHTER
00:29:58,00:30:00,- Which is wild. - That's so funny.
00:30:00,00:30:04,It's like every new human you met thinking there were different species
00:30:04,00:30:06,"'cause they're wearing different clothes, basically."
00:30:06,00:30:09,- Yes. - 'Cause they do have this real variety.
00:30:09,00:30:12,I don't know how people do it who are naming these things.
00:30:12,00:30:16,The problem with them is that they adapt incredibly quickly.
00:30:16,00:30:19,"They're amazing, so if they find themselves in a different situation suddenly,"
00:30:19,00:30:22,"some are a bit cold, some are a bit scary,"
00:30:22,00:30:23,"some are a bit rocky and exposed,"
00:30:23,00:30:26,"they'll exploit the genes within them,"
00:30:26,00:30:27,"'cause they've got huge genetic variation,"
00:30:27,00:30:30,they'll exploit the genes within them that make them turn bright red
00:30:30,00:30:33,or make them go really small or make them get a really thicker shell.
00:30:33,00:30:36,So that's why every single one that's completely different.
00:30:36,00:30:39,"- Yeah, and this isn't just with this particular species."
00:30:39,00:30:43,"So there's a big group we're called the World Register of Marine Species,"
00:30:43,00:30:47,"or Worms, and they have been going through, exhaustively,"
00:30:47,00:30:50,"the giant list that we have of all the names of all the species out there,"
00:30:50,00:30:55,"and they've discovered that they've had to reassess 190,400 of them"
00:30:55,00:30:58,because they're duplicates and they need to be taken away.
00:30:58,00:31:03,"So yeah, we have 228,450 accepted species,"
00:31:03,00:31:05,"as it stands, that number is growing all the time."
00:31:05,00:31:08,"- It's almost half, they went back and looked at the list and were like,"
00:31:08,00:31:12,"""Half of these are shit, they're just that guy in a hat."""
00:31:12,00:31:14,"- I just don't know how you could misidentify,"
00:31:14,00:31:18,"I'm not a ""Guess Your Pod"" mollusk guy,"
00:31:18,00:31:20,"I'm more on a bi-valve buzz,"
00:31:20,00:31:26,"but if I got a trial to draw a picture of something they found at the beach,"
00:31:26,00:31:29,"it would be this, it's the most common thing I've ever seen."
00:31:29,00:31:33,"- I've got to say, I'm not actually sure if that's the tale we're talking about."
00:31:33,00:31:36,- And I've just got to say that people listening at home
00:31:36,00:31:38,"don't know what we're pointing at, so as far as that concerned,"
00:31:38,00:31:41,this is exactly what it is.
00:31:41,00:31:42,- That's right.
00:31:42,00:31:43,"- It could go the other way, of course,"
00:31:43,00:31:48,there's a lot of things that look identical and turn out to be completely different.
00:31:48,00:31:51,"So, for instance, there were some researchers looked at the DNA"
00:31:51,00:31:55,"of 643 bird species in North America,"
00:31:55,00:31:59,"and they found 15 new species that looked identical to other things,"
00:31:59,00:32:02,"but when they checked the DNA, it turned out they were completely different,"
00:32:02,00:32:04,because they just looked like little brown birds.
00:32:04,00:32:07,"- It's so weird, I always wonder with taxonomy,"
00:32:07,00:32:11,"there must come a point where you think, ""Why are we doing this? Why does it..."""
00:32:11,00:32:15,Is it that this bird doesn't care that it's a slightly different type of bird to this bird?
00:32:15,00:32:16,Why do I care?
00:32:16,00:32:20,"- I guess we would know if things go extinct, if we put them in big databases."
00:32:20,00:32:23,"- Yeah, I know, but that's the thing, if it's very similar to this thing,"
00:32:23,00:32:25,"then I know this is a very controversial thing to say, though,"
00:32:25,00:32:29,"in the age of climate change, I'm going to back out."
00:32:29,00:32:33,"But I think one thing that epitomizes it is the giraffe problem, right?"
00:32:33,00:32:39,"So, I think, we thought for many hundreds of years that there's one species of giraffe,"
00:32:39,00:32:44,"and then very recently it's been thought that actually giraffes are split into four different species,"
00:32:44,00:32:50,"and that means that giraffes suddenly go from being a bit of a worry to very endangered,"
00:32:50,00:32:54,"because now that there are four species, each species has far fewer members."
00:32:54,00:32:54,"- Oh, yeah."
00:32:54,00:32:59,"- And it seems like there's such a weird categorization that we put on stuff to say to this giraffe,"
00:32:59,00:33:02,"""Hey, mate, did you know yesterday that you were fine, but today you're in serious trouble?"""
00:33:02,00:33:03,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:33:03,00:33:04,- What?
00:33:04,00:33:05,"- Oh, that is interesting."
00:33:05,00:33:12,"It's as well, the worms, that unit, they've made estimates about what there is out there still to find,"
00:33:12,00:33:17,"and they think there are still 10,000 new marine species waiting to be found"
00:33:17,00:33:21,that are sitting exclusively in the back rooms of museums that have been collected.
00:33:21,00:33:25,"And actually, that is a big thing in the world of curation with museums."
00:33:25,00:33:30,A lot of new species are discovered in the boxes that they have there as opposed to in the field.
00:33:30,00:33:33,We went behind the scenes at the Natural History Museum in London.
00:33:33,00:33:39,There are still boxes that Darwin collected from the beagle that have not been properly studied yet.
00:33:39,00:33:40,- It's incredible.
00:33:40,00:33:40,- Yeah.
00:33:40,00:33:46,"- There was one person at University College London who left the job, I think they retired,"
00:33:46,00:33:50,and they left a bottle of homemade plum brandy in the drawer.
00:33:50,00:33:55,"And then when they actually looked at it, they found out that it wasn't a macerated plum in the brandy."
00:33:55,00:33:59,"It was actually a testicle, Brackett's Species Unknown."
00:33:59,00:34:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:01,00:34:04,And they've added it to the collection.
00:34:04,00:34:04,- Really?
00:34:04,00:34:08,- Hopefully one day we'll find out what kind of testicle that was.
00:34:08,00:34:09,It was a good job they didn't drink it.
00:34:09,00:34:11,- Yeah.
00:34:11,00:34:14,"You know, that reminds me of a great New Zealand invention."
00:34:14,00:34:16,We talked about that earlier in the show.
00:34:16,00:34:20,Is that New Zealand innovated the glory hole that doctors use.
00:34:20,00:34:22,"- No, no, no, no, no."
00:34:22,00:34:23,"- No, this is..."
00:34:23,00:34:24,- Those pervert doctors.
00:34:24,00:34:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:26,00:34:31,- This is specifically for doctors and for people who are too embarrassed to have their testicles checked.
00:34:31,00:34:33,So what you do is you go in a booth.
00:34:33,00:34:35,It's kind of like going to Confession and Cheritry.
00:34:35,00:34:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:37,00:34:38,- Right?
00:34:38,00:34:40,"- Actually, it's very similar to my childhood."
00:34:40,00:34:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:42,00:34:45,So what you do is you go in and you pull your trousers down
00:34:45,00:34:48,and a little door opens with the hole and a hand comes through
00:34:48,00:34:52,and it just plays with your testicles and then...
00:34:52,00:34:54,"- And goes, ""Ten Hail Berries!"""
00:34:54,00:34:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:55,00:34:58,- And then just gives you a thumbs up and gets out of there.
00:34:58,00:34:58,Yeah.
00:34:58,00:35:01,- Is that the thing where you look to your left and cough?
00:35:01,00:35:02,- I don't know.
00:35:02,00:35:04,I'm pretty sure he was a doctor.
00:35:04,00:35:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:05,00:35:07,- Isn't that a thing where it was in the ward?
00:35:07,00:35:08,"Like, you..."
00:35:08,00:35:11,- That is the thing where they get you to cough.
00:35:11,00:35:12,It feels like they're weighing...
00:35:12,00:35:13,- I don't know.
00:35:13,00:35:14,- One of them jumps up a bit.
00:35:14,00:35:15,- This really sounds made up.
00:35:15,00:35:17,- Does it?
00:35:17,00:35:20,"- Yeah, one of them, like, ""Guys, go home tonight"
00:35:20,00:35:23,"""and give a little cup and look to the left and cough."""
00:35:23,00:35:25,And I think one of them jumps up and I think that is...
00:35:25,00:35:26,"- Oh, yeah!"
00:35:26,00:35:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:30,00:35:31,- Wash your hands.
00:35:31,00:35:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:32,00:35:35,- I don't think any of you has been seeing a real doctor.
00:35:35,00:35:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:37,00:35:38,- Wow.
00:35:38,00:35:39,- That's very funny.
00:35:39,00:35:45,"This rough periwinkle, by the way, since we're on ""Sexy Facts,"""
00:35:45,00:35:48,they are famous for basically attempting to mate
00:35:48,00:35:52,with any shell that they encounter.
00:35:52,00:35:56,"So they'll find a mucus track and they'll follow it,"
00:35:56,00:35:59,hoping that there'll be a female at the end of it.
00:35:59,00:36:00,"But whenever they get to anything,"
00:36:00,00:36:03,"whether it's a male, a female, just a shell,"
00:36:03,00:36:06,"doesn't matter what it is, they'll try and have sex with it."
00:36:06,00:36:08,"And the females, on the other hand, are really quite passive."
00:36:08,00:36:11,"If they don't really, they don't try and fight him off"
00:36:11,00:36:14,"or anything like that, they just let him get on with it."
00:36:14,00:36:15,- It's the first way to do it.
00:36:15,00:36:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:17,00:36:19,- She doesn't seem to encourage the male.
00:36:19,00:36:21,She just barely even knows.
00:36:21,00:36:24,Sometimes she'll just carry on walking down the road
00:36:24,00:36:26,"with him on the back, humping away."
00:36:26,00:36:30,"- And yet, they are officially the females,"
00:36:30,00:36:33,"the most promiscuous animal on earth, I think, aren't they?"
00:36:33,00:36:37,Because they're so passive and the lads are so randy.
00:36:37,00:36:38,And it's quite extraordinary.
00:36:38,00:36:40,They don't have an egg-based system.
00:36:40,00:36:43,They get inseminated internally
00:36:43,00:36:46,"and then they've got a uterus equivalent,"
00:36:46,00:36:48,which is very unusual in something like a little snail.
00:36:48,00:36:50,And so the males will mate with them
00:36:50,00:36:53,and I think this little snail penis comes in through her side.
00:36:53,00:36:58,But she can have hundreds of embryos in her uterus
00:36:58,00:37:00,that are at various different stages of maturation
00:37:00,00:37:03,from loads of different male snails.
00:37:03,00:37:09,And they did a study of four female versions of these snails
00:37:09,00:37:11,"and they found that over 2.5 months,"
00:37:11,00:37:12,each one had about 70 offspring
00:37:12,00:37:15,"and on average, they'd have 19 fathers between them."
00:37:15,00:37:17,- Wow. - So you're storing
00:37:17,00:37:20,19 fathers' worth of offspring
00:37:20,00:37:21,"and when you go into labor, it's fine."
00:37:21,00:37:22,If you're feeling sorry for them
00:37:22,00:37:23,"because they're giving birth constantly,"
00:37:23,00:37:25,"sometimes multiple times a day,"
00:37:25,00:37:26,it doesn't take any effort from them
00:37:26,00:37:30,"because if they pushed, then all the snails would come out,"
00:37:30,00:37:32,like if they're not ready ones.
00:37:32,00:37:34,So the snails themselves crawl out
00:37:34,00:37:38,and their little baby snails are known as crawler ways
00:37:38,00:37:39,"because they literally, they're just like,"
00:37:39,00:37:42,"""I'm ready to go now, got my shell,"
00:37:42,00:37:44,"crawl out and just disappear into the world."""
00:37:44,00:37:46,"- Oh, they come out with a shell on."
00:37:46,00:37:48,- They come out with a shell on. - Oh!
00:37:48,00:37:50,"- That's true. - Oh, my God."
00:37:50,00:37:53,- The bunch of barnacles crawling out.
00:37:53,00:37:57,I think I might have been on the same website because I...
00:37:57,00:38:00,"- Oh, I don't think so. - I was looking into conch sex"
00:38:00,00:38:04,and conches are massive sea snails
00:38:04,00:38:05,and they are in trouble in Florida
00:38:05,00:38:07,"because when the water gets too warm,"
00:38:07,00:38:11,they become sort of sexually lethargic.
00:38:11,00:38:13,"I mean, it happens to the best of us."
00:38:13,00:38:15,And so there's a team of scientists in Florida
00:38:15,00:38:16,because the water's getting hotter
00:38:16,00:38:20,who have to go and pick up the conches from the warm areas
00:38:20,00:38:22,and take them out into the cooler areas to mate
00:38:22,00:38:25,and to encourage them to mate and have sex.
00:38:25,00:38:26,And I don't know how that...
00:38:26,00:38:28,"I got uncomfortable searching at that point,"
00:38:28,00:38:32,but I think that's a lot of sexy talk and a lot of Marvin Gaye music.
00:38:32,00:38:34,"- That's so embarrassing, though."
00:38:34,00:38:37,"They need a human helper, a human fluffer to help them."
00:38:37,00:38:42,"- Hey, just while we're talking about sea slugs,"
00:38:42,00:38:47,"one thing that I read about is Spongebob Squarepants,"
00:38:47,00:38:49,"the creator, was a marine biologist."
00:38:49,00:38:51,And I had no idea about that.
00:38:51,00:38:52,"Yeah, he was called Stephen Hillenberg."
00:38:52,00:38:55,He sadly passed away in 2018.
00:38:55,00:38:57,But he's the one who came up with the concept for it.
00:38:57,00:38:58,He was a marine biologist.
00:38:58,00:39:00,He was working for the Orange County Marine Institute.
00:39:00,00:39:02,"And while he was there, he created a comic book"
00:39:02,00:39:04,to explain into title zones.
00:39:04,00:39:06,"So, like, all the pools that you get,"
00:39:06,00:39:08,where you go and see what's going on in there.
00:39:08,00:39:10,So he just laid out a bunch of facts in there.
00:39:10,00:39:13,One of the facts is that one species of sea slug
00:39:13,00:39:17,"can lay one million eggs in one sitting, right?"
00:39:17,00:39:19,"And that was in there, and he gave it around,"
00:39:19,00:39:20,"and someone saw that and went,"
00:39:20,00:39:22,"""This would be a really good cartoon for kids."""
00:39:22,00:39:26,And so Spongebob Squarepants is based on a fact book
00:39:26,00:39:29,that he did for students at a marine biology place.
00:39:29,00:39:31,But I don't remember Spongebob giving birth
00:39:31,00:39:34,to a million offspring in one sitting.
00:39:34,00:39:37,"That was the pilot they said, ""It's great."
00:39:37,00:39:41,"""We have a few tweaks, just a couple of tweaks."
00:39:41,00:39:45,"""The barnacle vagina exit is a bit strong."
00:39:45,00:39:47,"""And let's get his pants back on."""
00:39:47,00:39:51,"All right, I found a lot of animals that are out there"
00:39:51,00:39:53,that are just called completely the wrong thing.
00:39:53,00:39:55,You may be aware of the mantis shrimp.
00:39:55,00:39:57,They've got a very powerful claw strike.
00:39:57,00:39:59,"It's a very explosive, it can kill."
00:39:59,00:40:01,It just basically punches a prey to death.
00:40:01,00:40:05,But the mantis shrimp is neither a mantis or shrimp.
00:40:05,00:40:07,"The binterong, commonly known as the bear cat,"
00:40:07,00:40:09,is neither a bear or a cat.
00:40:09,00:40:12,And the honey badger is neither a badger or a jar of honey.
00:40:12,00:40:14,(laughing)
00:40:14,00:40:18,- Wow. - Just be careful out there.
00:40:18,00:40:19,That's all I'm saying.
00:40:19,00:40:20,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:20,00:40:21,Don't put a honey badger on your toast
00:40:21,00:40:22,'cause it will tear you apart.
00:40:22,00:40:23,(laughing)
00:40:23,00:40:25,"- There is a, there's a type of frog"
00:40:25,00:40:30,called alabati's niputidia that was described in 2007.
00:40:30,00:40:34,"And it's like a little brown, jobby thing."
00:40:34,00:40:36,"Like, it doesn't really, it's not very impressive."
00:40:36,00:40:39,And it turns out that it's named after
00:40:39,00:40:41,"the Spanish phrase niputa idea,"
00:40:41,00:40:44,meaning I have no fucking idea.
00:40:44,00:40:46,(laughing)
00:40:46,00:40:47,- Brilliant.
00:40:47,00:40:51,"- I think that, like, texomonists get things wrong a lot,"
00:40:51,00:40:52,but also the general public.
00:40:52,00:40:53,"I mean, it's not really their fault,"
00:40:53,00:40:56,but apparently there's a BBC rescue shelter.
00:40:56,00:40:57,"Sorry, I'm English."
00:40:57,00:41:00,"Sorry, a British rescue shelter."
00:41:00,00:41:01,"- We are, we're all the BBC."
00:41:01,00:41:04,"We all work for the BBC, everyone in the UK."
00:41:04,00:41:07,"- Sorry, sorry."
00:41:07,00:41:08,"- Well, it's like the Conservatives' nightmare."
00:41:08,00:41:12,"You just go, say, ""Britain has become the BBC."""
00:41:12,00:41:13,(laughing)
00:41:13,00:41:16,- There was a rescue shelter in Guernsey.
00:41:16,00:41:19,And the BBC reported that this shelter
00:41:19,00:41:22,"has been taken a dead cat,"
00:41:22,00:41:24,"which turned out to not be a dead cat,"
00:41:24,00:41:26,but actually a cuddly dog puppet.
00:41:26,00:41:27,- What?
00:41:27,00:41:29,"- Oh, it was just a sock puppet."
00:41:29,00:41:31,They also got alerted about a sick seal on a beach
00:41:31,00:41:32,which turned out to be a duvet.
00:41:32,00:41:35,(laughing)
00:41:35,00:41:37,"And an injured bird on the beach,"
00:41:37,00:41:39,which was basically just a blonde wig.
00:41:39,00:41:42,"- I just, how far are the rescue shelters getting?"
00:41:42,00:41:45,Is it like the seal's been in there for six days?
00:41:45,00:41:47,"They've gone, ""It's not easy, anything."""
00:41:47,00:41:49,(laughing)
00:41:49,00:41:52,(upbeat music)
00:41:52,00:41:57,"- It is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:41:57,00:41:58,and that is James.
00:41:58,00:42:03,"- Okay, my fact this week is that during World War I,"
00:42:03,00:42:06,a popular conspiracy theory was that German blackmailers
00:42:06,00:42:11,"had drawn up a list of 47,000 highly placed English perverts."
00:42:11,00:42:15,(laughing)
00:42:15,00:42:19,"- A list of 47,000 highly placed English perverts?"
00:42:19,00:42:19,- Yep.
00:42:19,00:42:21,- It's like the original Ipsing list.
00:42:21,00:42:22,(laughing)
00:42:22,00:42:24,"- Yeah, it's now known as the BBC."
00:42:24,00:42:26,(laughing)
00:42:26,00:42:32,So this is an article in the London review of books
00:42:32,00:42:36,"that I read about a book called ""MI5 and the Great War"""
00:42:36,00:42:37,by Nigel West.
00:42:37,00:42:40,And it's basically about the enormous amount
00:42:40,00:42:44,"of anti-German mania that was going on in Britain,"
00:42:44,00:42:47,especially in America as well in the First World War.
00:42:47,00:42:50,And there was just these conspiracy theories everywhere
00:42:50,00:42:53,"that Germany was infiltrating Britain,"
00:42:53,00:42:54,it was infiltrating America.
00:42:54,00:42:56,Every German person that you saw in the street
00:42:56,00:42:58,might be a spy.
00:42:58,00:43:01,"And there was a guy called Noel Pemberton Billing,"
00:43:01,00:43:03,"who was an MP, and he produced a list"
00:43:03,00:43:07,of these so-called highly placed British perverts
00:43:07,00:43:08,that he said were being blackmailed
00:43:08,00:43:10,by the German secret service.
00:43:10,00:43:12,"And that they would basically,"
00:43:12,00:43:15,if they'd infiltrated the upper echelons
00:43:15,00:43:16,of British society.
00:43:16,00:43:20,"And once the war started, that was gonna be,"
00:43:20,00:43:21,we were gonna get taken over.
00:43:21,00:43:22,- And it's quite hard to work out
00:43:22,00:43:25,how they thought they planned this to happen.
00:43:25,00:43:28,So the idea is that the reason that there are these
00:43:28,00:43:31,"47,000 highly placed perverts that they've identified"
00:43:31,00:43:35,"is that the Germans can come over, chat to the perverts,"
00:43:35,00:43:38,"say, ""Hello, can you seduce all these other people?"""
00:43:38,00:43:42,"And gradually will remove the manhood of Britain, I think."
00:43:42,00:43:44,"And this guy, what was he called?"
00:43:44,00:43:46,Pemberton?
00:43:46,00:43:47,- Noel Pemberton Billing.
00:43:47,00:43:50,He said that the Germans are propagating evils
00:43:50,00:43:52,which all decent men thought had perished
00:43:52,00:43:54,in Sodom and Lesbian.
00:43:54,00:43:56,And there was a lot of homophobia there.
00:43:56,00:43:57,"So there was lots of, you know,"
00:43:57,00:43:59,they would find loads of gay people.
00:43:59,00:44:00,They'll seduce loads of other people into being gay.
00:44:00,00:44:03,And the whole of Britain will lose the war because of that.
00:44:03,00:44:07,It's so hard to work out what we thought the plan was.
00:44:07,00:44:09,"- No, I think that's the thing."
00:44:09,00:44:11,"The thing about conspiracy theories is,"
00:44:11,00:44:14,they do tend to fall down quite early now.
00:44:15,00:44:17,"I think the thing for me is, like,"
00:44:17,00:44:19,how do you define what a pervert is?
00:44:19,00:44:20,"Like, but also, how do you define"
00:44:20,00:44:22,what a German thinks a pervert is?
00:44:22,00:44:24,"- Yes. - Oh, that's true."
00:44:24,00:44:26,"- On my moderate online research,"
00:44:26,00:44:33,the Germans enjoy a wide spectrum of night-time activities.
00:44:33,00:44:36,"Like, how do you know what they think is perverse?"
00:44:36,00:44:38,"- Well, I mean, of course,"
00:44:38,00:44:41,"the British royal family is German in heritage,"
00:44:41,00:44:44,and I wouldn't say any of those guys are perverts.
00:44:45,00:44:47,(laughter)
00:44:47,00:44:49,I don't think any of us would.
00:44:49,00:44:51,"- But basically, I think, I mean,"
00:44:51,00:44:53,"there was a lot of homophobia there for certain,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,but they were quite nebulous in their definitions.
00:44:55,00:44:58,"And for instance, when Pemberton Billing was sued for libel,"
00:44:58,00:45:00,he immediately added the name of the judge
00:45:00,00:45:02,to his list of perverts.
00:45:02,00:45:03,"- Yeah, it's..."
00:45:03,00:45:06,- He just kind of added anyone that he didn't like in there.
00:45:06,00:45:07,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:45:07,00:45:09,- There were a few stars of his claims weren't there.
00:45:09,00:45:13,"So there was one star who was called Maude Allen,"
00:45:13,00:45:16,"who was a real focus of his, and she was an actress,"
00:45:16,00:45:19,"and she'd been in a performance of Oscar Wilde's Salome,"
00:45:19,00:45:21,which had to be a private performance
00:45:21,00:45:23,because it was still banned at that time.
00:45:23,00:45:27,"And he wrote lots of articles,"
00:45:27,00:45:29,or he had lots of articles that were propagated
00:45:29,00:45:32,about how she was spreading the cult of the clitoris.
00:45:32,00:45:34,And there were all these suggestions
00:45:34,00:45:36,that Maude Allen was a lesbian
00:45:36,00:45:40,and somehow this conflated with having German sympathies.
00:45:40,00:45:42,And there were lots of rumors also
00:45:42,00:45:44,"that she was having an affair with Margot Asquith,"
00:45:44,00:45:46,"who was the wife of Herbert Asquith,"
00:45:46,00:45:48,who'd been the prime minister.
00:45:48,00:45:49,But anyway... - I think that might have been true
00:45:49,00:45:50,"as well, actually. - Were they true?"
00:45:50,00:45:52,"I just wonder. - Well, it's not..."
00:45:52,00:45:54,"We don't know for sure, but for sure,"
00:45:54,00:45:58,Margot Asquith paid for her apartment for 20 years
00:45:58,00:45:59,after they first met.
00:45:59,00:46:00,"- Well, I take back everything I've said,"
00:46:00,00:46:03,I think that's true entirely.
00:46:03,00:46:06,"But she sued Maude Allen for defamation, basically,"
00:46:06,00:46:10,because this MP was accusing her of all these things.
00:46:10,00:46:12,And one of the people who appeared in court
00:46:12,00:46:14,"in Pemberton Billings' defense,"
00:46:14,00:46:17,"so against Maude Allen saying, ""Yes, she's a homosexual,"
00:46:17,00:46:19,"""she's in need with the Germans,"
00:46:19,00:46:21,"""she's having an affair with the ex-PM's wife,"""
00:46:21,00:46:23,"was Alfred Douglas, otherwise known as Bozy."
00:46:23,00:46:25,"- Oh, Bozy. - Bozy,"
00:46:25,00:46:27,like Oscar Wilde's old boyfriend.
00:46:27,00:46:30,"- Yeah, wow. - He turned tail, turn-coated."
00:46:30,00:46:32,"- Yeah, that was weird. - He went that way a bit, Bozy."
00:46:32,00:46:33,"- He did, right at the end, yeah."
00:46:33,00:46:36,This whole thing was part of the weird paranoia.
00:46:36,00:46:37,"Well, it wasn't weird."
00:46:37,00:46:39,There was war looming in the distance.
00:46:39,00:46:41,"People were thinking the Germans were coming in,"
00:46:41,00:46:43,"they were sussing it out, they were laying spies in there."
00:46:43,00:46:46,So there's this big push to try and out the spies.
00:46:46,00:46:50,"And one guy, Richard Haldane, set up a committee,"
00:46:50,00:46:51,"the Secret Service Bureau,"
00:46:51,00:46:54,which was a forerunner to MI5 and MI6.
00:46:54,00:46:55,"In fact, the people who ran it were"
00:46:55,00:46:59,Commander Mansfield Cumming and Captain Vernon Kell.
00:46:59,00:47:02,"Both of them did go on to be the front people,"
00:47:02,00:47:04,the heads of MI5 and MI6.
00:47:04,00:47:07,"What's amazing is that was basically set up,"
00:47:07,00:47:10,"MI5 and MI6, because the two of them didn't get on"
00:47:10,00:47:11,and they couldn't work together
00:47:11,00:47:14,"in the original Secret Service, yeah."
00:47:14,00:47:16,"So he was like, you guys are terrible at working together,"
00:47:16,00:47:18,"but you're great, you do six and you do five,"
00:47:18,00:47:21,and that's why we have MI5 and MI6.
00:47:21,00:47:23,"- Is that right? - It's an argument, yeah."
00:47:23,00:47:25,"But also, you look at it, and there's a lot of Germans"
00:47:25,00:47:27,that were just a bit incompetent who came over anyway.
00:47:27,00:47:30,"You didn't need to be vigilant, they were outing themselves."
00:47:30,00:47:32,"There's a guy called Paul Buchwald,"
00:47:32,00:47:35,who adopted the alias Sherlock Holmes when he arrived.
00:47:35,00:47:36,(audience laughing)
00:47:36,00:47:39,"- Good and dark, Sherlock Holmes, that's like..."
00:47:39,00:47:41,- That's like me going to America undercover
00:47:41,00:47:43,"as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson."
00:47:43,00:47:46,(audience laughing)
00:47:46,00:47:50,"- Yeah, I love the paranoia the German paranoia so much,"
00:47:50,00:47:54,because I read that if you encountered a German waiter
00:47:54,00:47:57,"at a cafe, you were entitled to say no to their service,"
00:47:57,00:47:58,"and if they said that they were Swiss,"
00:47:58,00:48:01,you had to be very careful and asked to see their passport.
00:48:01,00:48:04,"But the head of the Met's Criminal Investigation Department,"
00:48:04,00:48:07,"Basil Thompson, recorded that it was positively dangerous"
00:48:07,00:48:11,to be seen in conversation with the pigeon.
00:48:11,00:48:12,- Yes! (audience laughing)
00:48:12,00:48:14,- And a foreigner walking in one of the parks
00:48:14,00:48:17,was actually arrested and sentenced to imprisonment
00:48:17,00:48:19,because a pigeon was seen to fly from the place
00:48:19,00:48:21,"where he was standing, and it was supposed"
00:48:21,00:48:22,that he had liberated it.
00:48:22,00:48:23,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:48:23,00:48:25,- Wow. - I thought it was a woman's wig.
00:48:25,00:48:28,(audience laughing)
00:48:28,00:48:29,- Brian Pemberton.
00:48:29,00:48:31,"Cumberbatch, what's his name?"
00:48:31,00:48:33,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, Pemberton Pemberton."
00:48:33,00:48:34,- Joel Pemberton-Billy.
00:48:34,00:48:36,"- No, yes, yes, him."
00:48:36,00:48:38,(audience laughing)
00:48:38,00:48:40,"Apparently he had a monocle,"
00:48:40,00:48:41,and the only thing that I could find out about him
00:48:41,00:48:46,is he had like a piece of flesh inserted into his cheek
00:48:46,00:48:47,to keep the monocle in place.
00:48:47,00:48:48,- Oh! - Oh!
00:48:48,00:48:51,"- But also just one cheek, like get both done,"
00:48:51,00:48:53,otherwise you're all gonna be askew.
00:48:53,00:48:54,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Wow!"
00:48:54,00:48:56,"- I quite like that idea though,"
00:48:56,00:48:57,"because I have a very small nose,"
00:48:57,00:49:01,"and whenever I wear sunglasses, it just keeps falling down,"
00:49:01,00:49:03,and I'd love a little ledge on there.
00:49:03,00:49:05,(audience laughing)
00:49:05,00:49:06,"- Whereas I've got a huge ledge on my nose,"
00:49:06,00:49:09,"I never need glasses if we could do some sort of a swap,"
00:49:09,00:49:11,like an organ donation.
00:49:11,00:49:12,- Let's chat after the show.
00:49:12,00:49:13,- Great.
00:49:13,00:49:14,- I'm happy to donate some flesh
00:49:14,00:49:16,"to anybody who wants to donate,"
00:49:16,00:49:19,"but leave us bones, they're for the kids."
00:49:19,00:49:21,(audience laughing)
00:49:21,00:49:24,"- In America, there was a worry that the Germans"
00:49:24,00:49:27,"were coming over poisoning all the livestock,"
00:49:27,00:49:29,"and this was really, everyone thought this was the case,"
00:49:29,00:49:33,"basically, that all their beef and their animals"
00:49:33,00:49:35,"were getting sick, and it must have been"
00:49:35,00:49:38,because the Germans were sending over bacteria and stuff.
00:49:38,00:49:39,"It turned out that the reason was,"
00:49:39,00:49:41,"there was a war happening in Europe,"
00:49:41,00:49:44,"America was shipping out loads and loads of animals over,"
00:49:44,00:49:47,"and they were doing lots of intensive farming,"
00:49:47,00:49:48,"and obviously when you do intensive farming,"
00:49:48,00:49:51,"and you move animals around, they make each other sick,"
00:49:51,00:49:52,that's what was happening.
00:49:52,00:49:54,But it turned out that the Germans
00:49:54,00:49:56,"were trying to make them sick,"
00:49:56,00:49:58,but they were just failing all the time.
00:49:58,00:49:59,(audience laughing)
00:49:59,00:50:01,- And there was a group of Germans
00:50:01,00:50:05,"who were in a laboratory in Chevy Chase in Maryland,"
00:50:05,00:50:07,and they were cultivating lots of bacteria
00:50:07,00:50:09,"that they were gonna put onto these animals,"
00:50:09,00:50:11,"but they just never managed to get it to work,"
00:50:11,00:50:13,but it didn't matter 'cause the animals would get sick anyway.
00:50:13,00:50:15,"- How did Chevy Chase feel about it, Ernest?"
00:50:15,00:50:16,(audience laughing)
00:50:16,00:50:18,It's a weird subplot to your story there.
00:50:18,00:50:21,(audience laughing)
00:50:21,00:50:23,"- Chevy Chase is a place, as we've said before,"
00:50:23,00:50:25,where the battle of Chevy Chase was.
00:50:25,00:50:26,"- That's right, yes."
00:50:26,00:50:29,"- And then there was a ballad of the battle of Chevy Chase,"
00:50:29,00:50:30,"and then Chevy Chase, the actor,"
00:50:30,00:50:32,was named after the ballad of the battle
00:50:32,00:50:35,of the place of Chevy Chase.
00:50:35,00:50:36,- There you go.
00:50:36,00:50:38,Don't you wish you'd never asked Ernest?
00:50:38,00:50:41,(audience laughing)
00:50:41,00:50:47,"- We're gonna have to wrap up very soon, guys."
00:50:47,00:50:48,Anything before we do?
00:50:48,00:50:50,"- The paranoia went the other way as well,"
00:50:50,00:50:52,"so in Germany, they were very paranoid"
00:50:52,00:50:56,"that there might be British spies or American spies there,"
00:50:56,00:51:00,"and at one stage, there was a lady's maid who was on a train,"
00:51:00,00:51:03,"and she was strip searched in Germany,"
00:51:03,00:51:05,"and they found secret writing on her bottom,"
00:51:05,00:51:09,"and they photographed her bum,"
00:51:09,00:51:12,and they sent it to German military intelligence
00:51:12,00:51:13,"and put her in prison,"
00:51:13,00:51:15,and it turned out that what she'd done
00:51:15,00:51:16,is 'cause she was worried
00:51:16,00:51:18,"that the train toilet would be dirty,"
00:51:18,00:51:20,"she'd covered the seat with her newspaper,"
00:51:20,00:51:23,(audience laughing)
00:51:23,00:51:27,and it was backwards writing from the Frankfurter Z-Tung
00:51:27,00:51:28,newspaper. - Right.
00:51:28,00:51:30,It sounds like classic pervert behavior today.
00:51:30,00:51:32,(audience laughing)
00:51:32,00:51:33,I think there's some writing on your bum.
00:51:33,00:51:34,I better take a photo.
00:51:34,00:51:36,(audience laughing)
00:51:36,00:51:37,"We've all tried that, but..."
00:51:37,00:51:39,- But presumably the newspaper headlines
00:51:39,00:51:41,"would have read things like, you know,"
00:51:41,00:51:44,"Germans about to invade, and so..."
00:51:44,00:51:46,"- You know, Lenin's knocking on the door."
00:51:46,00:51:47,Have you got the talk in?
00:51:47,00:51:48,(audience laughing)
00:51:48,00:51:49,Not your turn!
00:51:49,00:51:51,(audience laughing)
00:51:51,00:51:54,(upbeat music)
00:51:54,00:51:57,- That is it.
00:51:57,00:51:58,That is all of our facts.
00:51:58,00:52:00,Thank you so much to Josh.
00:52:00,00:52:02,"Thank you so much, Christchurch."
00:52:02,00:52:05,"It's absolutely, that's the end of our tour."
00:52:05,00:52:07,We'll be back again next week with another episode.
00:52:07,00:52:08,We'll see you then.
00:52:08,00:52:09,Good-bye!
00:52:09,00:52:12,(audience cheering)
00:52:13,00:52:16,(upbeat music)
00:52:16,00:52:18,(upbeat music)
