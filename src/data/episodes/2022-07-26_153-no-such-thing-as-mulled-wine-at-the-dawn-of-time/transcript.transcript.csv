00:00:00,00:00:02,"- Hey everyone, before we begin this week's show,"
00:00:02,00:00:04,we just have a quick request.
00:00:04,00:00:07,We are doing a live show on the 28th of February.
00:00:07,00:00:08,It's our third birthday party.
00:00:08,00:00:11,And we were hoping that we could ask you
00:00:11,00:00:14,"to submit a bunch of questions, interesting thoughts,"
00:00:14,00:00:18,"ideas, whatever it is you want for us to read out on stage."
00:00:18,00:00:20,"- Yeah, make them funny, make them snappy,"
00:00:20,00:00:24,"make them cool, make them worthy of being aired,"
00:00:24,00:00:26,"and they will be podcast at qi.com,"
00:00:26,00:00:28,email us your questions.
00:00:28,00:00:29,You could even tweet it to us as well
00:00:29,00:00:31,on our @qipodcast account.
00:00:31,00:00:34,Please do before this coming Tuesday.
00:00:34,00:00:35,And if we see it and it's short enough
00:00:35,00:00:37,"and funny enough and intelligent enough,"
00:00:37,00:00:39,we will read it on stage.
00:00:39,00:00:41,"Okay, on with the show."
00:00:41,00:00:43,(blues music)
00:00:55,00:00:58,- Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing
00:00:58,00:01:01,"as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:01,00:01:03,from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:01:03,00:01:06,My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here
00:01:06,00:01:08,"with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:01:08,00:01:09,and Anna Chazinski.
00:01:09,00:01:12,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:12,00:01:15,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:01:15,00:01:17,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:17,00:01:19,"Starting with you, Andy Murray."
00:01:19,00:01:21,- My fact this week is that the smallest football league
00:01:21,00:01:24,in the world consists of two teams
00:01:24,00:01:26,who play each other 22 times every season.
00:01:26,00:01:29,- Where is it?
00:01:29,00:01:31,"- It's on the Isles of Silly,"
00:01:31,00:01:33,"which is just off Cornwall,"
00:01:33,00:01:35,which is the southwest tip of Britain
00:01:35,00:01:37,for anyone who's not from Britain listening.
00:01:37,00:01:39,And they're called the Woolpack Wanderers
00:01:39,00:01:40,and the Garrison Gunners.
00:01:40,00:01:42,And they used to be called the Rangers and the Rovers
00:01:42,00:01:43,and then they thought that was a bit boring
00:01:43,00:01:46,so they could make it more interesting.
00:01:46,00:01:47,- And it's weird that they did that
00:01:47,00:01:49,because you can only really call yourself the Gunners
00:01:49,00:01:51,if you've got a historical connection
00:01:51,00:01:54,to like an Arsenal's case and armaments factory
00:01:54,00:01:55,and the Wanderers.
00:01:55,00:01:57,People are called that when they don't have a permanent stadium
00:01:57,00:01:58,which I assume they always have
00:01:58,00:02:00,because there aren't any other teams in this place.
00:02:00,00:02:01,- Yes.
00:02:01,00:02:02,- So their names are lies.
00:02:02,00:02:06,"- I mean, they've been playing since World War I, I believe."
00:02:06,00:02:08,"- Well, they must be knackered."
00:02:08,00:02:09,(laughing)
00:02:09,00:02:12,"They've got, he forgot to match how long the matches are."
00:02:12,00:02:14,Half-time's coming up next year.
00:02:14,00:02:18,"No, so maybe there is a connection potentially for the Gunners."
00:02:18,00:02:19,"- Well, they're called the Garrison Gunners"
00:02:19,00:02:22,so is it not to do with some kind of Garrison?
00:02:22,00:02:24,"- Yeah, I'm sure they're the Garrison on the Elves of Cili."
00:02:24,00:02:25,"I don't know, I don't have the facts."
00:02:25,00:02:26,- Do you know what I really like?
00:02:26,00:02:29,They play on the same football pitch every time
00:02:29,00:02:32,but they swap for being a home and a way team
00:02:32,00:02:33,so they're changing rooms.
00:02:33,00:02:36,They change to say a way for the way team that way
00:02:36,00:02:38,and then home on the next match.
00:02:38,00:02:40,- But that means they're the exact opposite
00:02:40,00:02:43,of what you would expect a Wanderers team to be then.
00:02:43,00:02:43,- It's true.
00:02:43,00:02:46,- Because not only have they always played on the same pitch
00:02:46,00:02:49,they even play all their away games on the same pitch as well.
00:02:49,00:02:50,(laughing)
00:02:50,00:02:51,- It's very true.
00:02:51,00:02:54,- The Wikipedia on them is unbelievably cautious.
00:02:54,00:02:57,"It says, ""The league is reportedly the smallest in the world."""
00:02:57,00:03:01,I do not believe there's a one team league anywhere in the world.
00:03:01,00:03:02,- You know how they pick the teams?
00:03:02,00:03:04,"They pick them by every year, a few weeks before the season,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,the captains of the two teams.
00:03:06,00:03:09,"They meet up in the pub and they basically, they take turns."
00:03:09,00:03:10,- No. - Yes.
00:03:10,00:03:11,- Oh my god. - Oh my god.
00:03:11,00:03:12,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:03:12,00:03:14,So they try and make it so the teams
00:03:14,00:03:16,are roughly equal in ability.
00:03:16,00:03:17,- I was reading an interview with them though
00:03:17,00:03:19,and they don't seem to even know which team they play for.
00:03:19,00:03:21,One of them was us.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"One of them was us whose team he was on and he said,"
00:03:23,00:03:25,"""Oh, I'm wearing red, which team is that?"""
00:03:25,00:03:28,(laughing)
00:03:28,00:03:32,- Just the Isle of Silly for the people overseas
00:03:32,00:03:34,"who haven't heard of it, it's incredibly small"
00:03:34,00:03:38,and it's population size as of 2001.
00:03:38,00:03:40,That's the last update I've seen that I could find
00:03:40,00:03:42,"2,153 people."
00:03:42,00:03:44,So it's a very tiny population
00:03:44,00:03:47,but they've worked out that 32% of the population participate
00:03:47,00:03:51,"at least three times a week in 30 minutes more sport,"
00:03:51,00:03:53,way greater than any other bit of Britain.
00:03:53,00:03:56,- But then 1% of the population are in one of these football teams
00:03:56,00:03:57,presumably.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"- Yeah, that's amazing."
00:03:59,00:04:00,"- Yeah, that's really good."
00:04:00,00:04:02,That must be the highest anywhere.
00:04:02,00:04:04,- Highest proportion of football players anywhere.
00:04:04,00:04:05,- Yeah.
00:04:05,00:04:06,- Professionals.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"- And also on their teams, I really like this,"
00:04:07,00:04:11,there's a huge gap of the age bracket of who plays
00:04:11,00:04:15,where they're majorotively missing 16 to 25 year olds
00:04:15,00:04:18,and the reason is because the schools in the Isle of Silly
00:04:18,00:04:21,only go up to six form.
00:04:21,00:04:23,"So when you're 16, you have to go to the mainland"
00:04:23,00:04:24,to finish off your schooling.
00:04:24,00:04:26,And so they end up just staying on the mainland
00:04:26,00:04:28,when they come over rather than going back.
00:04:28,00:04:29,"- Basically on holiday, there is a kid."
00:04:29,00:04:32,"It's so lovely, amazing bird watching."
00:04:32,00:04:33,- Oh really?
00:04:33,00:04:34,- Amazing birds.
00:04:34,00:04:36,- Did you ever see the Silly Bee?
00:04:36,00:04:39,(laughing)
00:04:39,00:04:39,- No.
00:04:39,00:04:42,"- Silly Bee is, yeah, it's a kind of bee"
00:04:42,00:04:44,that you find on the Silly Islands.
00:04:44,00:04:44,- That's great.
00:04:44,00:04:46,- Is it good even in a Silly Bee?
00:04:46,00:04:48,(laughing)
00:04:48,00:04:50,- It never collects any pollen.
00:04:50,00:04:52,It only collects twiglets and things like that.
00:04:52,00:04:54,It's such a Silly Bee.
00:04:54,00:04:55,"- It just collects anecdotes, yeah."
00:04:55,00:04:58,(laughing)
00:04:58,00:05:00,"- Yeah, it's actually quite endangered,"
00:05:00,00:05:03,"but they, someone took a photo of one in 2012"
00:05:03,00:05:06,because people thought they might have even got extinct.
00:05:06,00:05:09,So that was big news in the Silly Islands.
00:05:09,00:05:12,- You did a really good job of transferring really quickly
00:05:12,00:05:14,"from a laughter voice to the very solemn,"
00:05:14,00:05:16,it's quite endangered voice.
00:05:16,00:05:17,- Quite endangered.
00:05:17,00:05:19,There's a serious side to the Silly Bee.
00:05:19,00:05:21,(laughing)
00:05:21,00:05:23,- Have you seen the Silly Police Force
00:05:23,00:05:25,is quite famous around the world?
00:05:25,00:05:29,"- Oh yeah, sorry, now everything sounds like Silly."
00:05:29,00:05:31,It's that they've only got two officers
00:05:31,00:05:33,and I think they're one thing saying
00:05:33,00:05:35,they're only posted for a certain number of years
00:05:35,00:05:37,so they don't get too close to the local population.
00:05:37,00:05:38,"- They are, it's five years."
00:05:38,00:05:39,"- Five years, yeah."
00:05:39,00:05:40,"- Well, I know, but the last sergeant,"
00:05:40,00:05:43,he wrote the thing saying he'd been there for seven years.
00:05:43,00:05:44,So I don't know.
00:05:44,00:05:45,- Maybe no one liked it.
00:05:45,00:05:47,(laughing)
00:05:47,00:05:49,- He had to borrow a child's bike once
00:05:49,00:05:51,to pursue a drunk driver.
00:05:51,00:05:52,- And this is a Silly policeman
00:05:52,00:05:53,you're talking about.
00:05:53,00:05:55,- He's a Silly policeman.
00:05:55,00:05:56,"- I think it's a very good policeman,"
00:05:56,00:06:00,"but one of the other cases that he dealt with was,"
00:06:00,00:06:01,"and I'm quoting here,"
00:06:01,00:06:03,"a shed door was forced open at a football club,"
00:06:03,00:06:06,but one of the only clues available was a fried egg.
00:06:06,00:06:09,- This is fried egg on the ground next to the shed.
00:06:09,00:06:11,- Is there any resolution to that story?
00:06:11,00:06:13,Do we know the case of the fried egg?
00:06:13,00:06:15,"- If there is, I don't have it."
00:06:15,00:06:16,- Sorry.
00:06:16,00:06:17,- And escape chicken.
00:06:17,00:06:18,(laughing)
00:06:18,00:06:20,"- No, they don't fry their eggs today."
00:06:20,00:06:21,That's what he says.
00:06:21,00:06:23,(laughing)
00:06:23,00:06:27,"- I was reading, so the teams actually do team up as well"
00:06:27,00:06:30,to play against the mainland.
00:06:30,00:06:31,There's a team.
00:06:31,00:06:33,- Which is a massively uneven contest to be fair.
00:06:33,00:06:34,(laughing)
00:06:34,00:06:35,"- So they play the England football team,"
00:06:35,00:06:39,"they play, who are they called?"
00:06:39,00:06:41,- It's dynamo chuff in hands and hands.
00:06:41,00:06:43,"- Yeah, and so they play them together."
00:06:43,00:06:45,"And they have a trophy that they use,"
00:06:45,00:06:46,the Lioness Cup.
00:06:46,00:06:50,And the Lioness Cup trophy is the smallest trophy in the world.
00:06:50,00:06:52,"- In size, you mean?"
00:06:52,00:06:54,"- Yeah, in size, it's very tiny."
00:06:54,00:06:56,"I think it's in the FIFA museum, isn't it?"
00:06:56,00:06:58,- They took it for the FIFA museum for a year.
00:06:58,00:07:00,It's six millimeters tall.
00:07:00,00:07:01,- Whoa.
00:07:01,00:07:01,- That's very sweet.
00:07:01,00:07:03,- That's smaller than a silly bee.
00:07:03,00:07:04,(laughing)
00:07:04,00:07:08,- It was made by a carpenter from dynamo truffs and his wife.
00:07:08,00:07:09,I think they're artists.
00:07:09,00:07:11,- So is it made out of wood then?
00:07:11,00:07:13,- I think it's made of wood and metal.
00:07:13,00:07:14,"You know, the oldest player in the football league retired"
00:07:14,00:07:16,last year at the age of 70.
00:07:16,00:07:20,"- 70, but I read the way that they play."
00:07:20,00:07:23,It doesn't sound overly competitive.
00:07:23,00:07:26,"In that, there's a journalist who is gonna play"
00:07:26,00:07:28,for the sake of writing an article
00:07:28,00:07:32,and he just kept missing every time
00:07:32,00:07:34,and he missed it like 16 times.
00:07:34,00:07:36,"But every time he missed it, everyone was really encouraging"
00:07:36,00:07:38,and apparently that's the whole thing it's just about.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"So this 70 year old guy, I bet he's shit."
00:07:41,00:07:44,"But it doesn't matter, 'cause they're really listening"
00:07:44,00:07:45,to this podcast.
00:07:45,00:07:46,He didn't really say it.
00:07:46,00:07:49,Looking at an empty six millimeter high spot
00:07:49,00:07:50,on his mantel piece.
00:07:50,00:07:52,"I think, no, I've only been better."
00:07:52,00:07:54,(laughing)
00:07:54,00:07:55,It's like a bee.
00:07:55,00:07:59,"- Well, all of the haters is 70 play against, you know,"
00:07:59,00:08:01,"ages, that don't include 16 to 20 pie,"
00:08:01,00:08:06,"but everything that happens, he might be outplayed for his age."
00:08:06,00:08:07,Maybe not.
00:08:07,00:08:09,- The silly isles signed a piece treaty
00:08:09,00:08:13,with the Netherlands a few years ago to end formally
00:08:13,00:08:16,the 335 years war between the two countries.
00:08:16,00:08:17,- Oh wow.
00:08:17,00:08:18,- Even though no one actually knows
00:08:18,00:08:22,if the 335 years war ever actually happened.
00:08:22,00:08:23,- Whoa.
00:08:23,00:08:26,- So there have been rumors since the 1600s.
00:08:26,00:08:28,The war was declared between the Netherlands
00:08:28,00:08:30,and the silly isles and then other people say
00:08:30,00:08:31,"it can't even have been declared,"
00:08:31,00:08:33,"'cause they're not a nation and no one really knows,"
00:08:33,00:08:35,but the sources go back that far.
00:08:35,00:08:37,"And eventually, at some point, the silly isles"
00:08:37,00:08:38,"wrote to the Netherlands and said,"
00:08:38,00:08:40,"look, can we just acknowledge"
00:08:40,00:08:41,that there's never been a war between us?
00:08:41,00:08:43,And the Netherlands said we can't actually verify that.
00:08:43,00:08:45,I think we're probably still at war.
00:08:45,00:08:48,"So the silly isles said, okay, well, can we end the war piece?"
00:08:48,00:08:49,(laughing)
00:08:49,00:08:52,"And so yeah, they visited each other"
00:08:52,00:08:54,and they signed a treaty saying we're at peace.
00:08:54,00:08:55,- It was amazing.
00:08:55,00:08:57,The ambassador came over in a helicopter
00:08:57,00:09:00,with a scroll to sign the piece.
00:09:00,00:09:04,"- But the admiral who declared war on the silly isles,"
00:09:04,00:09:06,the Dutch one was called Trump.
00:09:06,00:09:07,"- Oh, I see."
00:09:07,00:09:08,- 10 Trump.
00:09:08,00:09:09,- I know.
00:09:09,00:09:11,So we don't know if he's any relation.
00:09:11,00:09:13,"- That's a long helicopter ride, isn't it?"
00:09:13,00:09:14,- 300 years.
00:09:14,00:09:17,(laughing)
00:09:17,00:09:19,- We said that the ambassador got there by helicopter.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"- It will have been from the mainland UK, yes."
00:09:22,00:09:23,- The mainland UK.
00:09:23,00:09:24,"- You have to, yeah."
00:09:24,00:09:25,"- No, I was just only thinking, can you go over the channel"
00:09:25,00:09:27,and how far can you go on a helicopter?
00:09:27,00:09:28,- You can go over the channel.
00:09:28,00:09:30,- How bad do you think helicopters are?
00:09:30,00:09:31,- Do you think you just threw them
00:09:31,00:09:32,and then they go as far as you can toss it?
00:09:32,00:09:35,"- No, they just don't look like they have much fuel."
00:09:35,00:09:36,"- They could go about 300 miles,"
00:09:36,00:09:39,like just a small helicopter and then the big ones could go.
00:09:39,00:09:40,- How far's that?
00:09:40,00:09:43,- You just asked how far 300 miles is.
00:09:43,00:09:45,"- So you know a mile, yeah."
00:09:45,00:09:47,It's 300 of those.
00:09:47,00:09:49,- We can't reduce it further than that.
00:09:49,00:09:50,(laughing)
00:09:50,00:09:51,And the Netherlands is very close.
00:09:51,00:09:54,- You used to always get a helicopter over.
00:09:54,00:09:55,"I think they've cancelled it now,"
00:09:55,00:09:56,"but when I used to go as a kid,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,it was the only way that you'd go over
00:09:58,00:10:00,except for the ferry crossing.
00:10:00,00:10:01,- I think they might be gonna bring it back.
00:10:01,00:10:02,- Oh really?
00:10:02,00:10:03,- Either they're gonna bring it back
00:10:03,00:10:04,or just have brought it back.
00:10:04,00:10:06,Or they said they were going to and haven't done it.
00:10:06,00:10:07,(laughing)
00:10:07,00:10:09,- One of those kind of options there.
00:10:09,00:10:10,- Great facts from James Ollion.
00:10:10,00:10:13,(laughing)
00:10:13,00:10:15,- I do have a fact about the longest
00:10:15,00:10:17,"and shortest things in the world,"
00:10:17,00:10:20,'cause there's about the world's smallest league of football.
00:10:20,00:10:21,- Yep.
00:10:21,00:10:24,- But I'm afraid it's about the world's largest penis.
00:10:24,00:10:25,- Oh God.
00:10:25,00:10:29,- The world's largest penis is only two inches shorter
00:10:29,00:10:31,than the world's smallest man.
00:10:31,00:10:33,- Wow.
00:10:33,00:10:34,(laughing)
00:10:34,00:10:35,- Are they on the same person?
00:10:35,00:10:36,"- Yeah, no."
00:10:36,00:10:39,(laughing)
00:10:39,00:10:41,- This is a man called Roberto Esquivel Cabrera
00:10:41,00:10:45,who says his penis is 19 inches long.
00:10:45,00:10:47,- It's not hard to verify that.
00:10:47,00:10:50,"- Well, how long is 19 inches?"
00:10:50,00:10:52,(laughing)
00:10:52,00:10:52,- You know what I'm saying?
00:10:52,00:10:55,- It's a short helicopter journey.
00:10:55,00:10:55,- I'll say that.
00:10:55,00:10:56,(laughing)
00:10:56,00:10:59,(upbeat music)
00:10:59,00:11:04,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two"
00:11:04,00:11:07,and that is Chazinski.
00:11:07,00:11:10,"- My fact this week is that in the 1940s in America,"
00:11:10,00:11:13,if you wanted to play a recording of a band song
00:11:13,00:11:16,"on the radio, the entire band had to be present"
00:11:16,00:11:18,in the studio while you played it.
00:11:18,00:11:20,(laughing)
00:11:20,00:11:23,This is about a musician strike in America
00:11:23,00:11:27,between 1941 and 1943 about the fact that recorded music
00:11:27,00:11:28,was being played on the radio.
00:11:28,00:11:30,And so musicians thought they were gonna go out of business
00:11:30,00:11:34,because they were no longer being paid to play live music.
00:11:34,00:11:37,And so they went on strike and one of their demands
00:11:37,00:11:39,was that every time a recording was played
00:11:39,00:11:41,so the musicians didn't lose out.
00:11:41,00:11:44,Every single person involved in making that recording
00:11:44,00:11:47,had to turn up in the studio and then be paid the fee
00:11:47,00:11:48,that they would be paid for.
00:11:48,00:11:49,- That's amazing.
00:11:49,00:11:49,- That's incredible.
00:11:49,00:11:51,Why would they then still just play the recording
00:11:51,00:11:52,and not have the band play?
00:11:52,00:11:55,- Maybe it's more effort to get your studio set up
00:11:55,00:11:56,and get the sound all sorted.
00:11:56,00:11:57,"- Yeah, I guess so, yeah."
00:11:57,00:11:58,"- If anyone's listening to this podcast,"
00:11:58,00:12:00,we will be turning up in your house.
00:12:00,00:12:03,(laughing)
00:12:03,00:12:05,"- I've got, I'm gonna have to meet that 70-year-old man."
00:12:05,00:12:08,(laughing)
00:12:08,00:12:10,- I'm gonna have to meet him in the open moment.
00:12:10,00:12:11,"- I'm gonna have to meet the long penis, bloke."
00:12:11,00:12:14,(laughing)
00:12:14,00:12:16,"- Just speaking of recreations,"
00:12:16,00:12:18,that was another thing that was very popular
00:12:18,00:12:20,in the 1940s going back to the 20s
00:12:20,00:12:23,"and as late as the '50s, where they would recreate"
00:12:23,00:12:26,sport events because it was too hard to get live recording.
00:12:26,00:12:29,"So if there was a baseball match that was going on,"
00:12:29,00:12:30,"while the baseball match was going on,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,they would relay the information
00:12:32,00:12:35,about how the game was going back to a studio
00:12:35,00:12:37,and the commentator would commentate
00:12:37,00:12:38,as if it was live match.
00:12:38,00:12:39,- Whoa.
00:12:39,00:12:42,- But he would have a bat that was hanging next
00:12:42,00:12:45,"to his microphone, which he would hit anytime there was a hit"
00:12:45,00:12:48,and they would have crowd noise played in and so on
00:12:48,00:12:49,and they would commentate live.
00:12:49,00:12:50,- No.
00:12:50,00:12:51,- Yeah.
00:12:51,00:12:53,- It was all a recreation because it was too expensive
00:12:53,00:12:57,to get the lines to mic up an entire stadium.
00:12:57,00:12:59,- Did they have all the sports equipment
00:12:59,00:13:01,"hanging in the studio 'cause they must've had to,"
00:13:01,00:13:02,depending on what sport they've had to...
00:13:02,00:13:03,(laughing)
00:13:03,00:13:05,- They had the coconuts of the horse racing.
00:13:05,00:13:06,(laughing)
00:13:06,00:13:09,- And one of the sports announcers was Ronald Reagan
00:13:09,00:13:12,in his early days when he was an actor.
00:13:12,00:13:12,- Wow.
00:13:12,00:13:14,- That is so funny.
00:13:14,00:13:14,- That's really funny.
00:13:14,00:13:15,- Amazing.
00:13:15,00:13:17,"James, you had a fact about darts, didn't you?"
00:13:17,00:13:18,- About darts.
00:13:18,00:13:20,"- Yeah, they used to, in the old days,"
00:13:20,00:13:22,they used to have darts on the radio
00:13:22,00:13:25,and the way they would do it is you'd get a darts player
00:13:25,00:13:27,and he would throw the darts at a board
00:13:27,00:13:29,"and then the guy would say, tell you what he got"
00:13:29,00:13:31,and then there'd be silence while you were allowed
00:13:31,00:13:33,to throw your own darts and then you would be like
00:13:33,00:13:34,playing against the guy.
00:13:34,00:13:35,"- Oh, it's so cool."
00:13:35,00:13:36,- Whoa.
00:13:36,00:13:37,- It's so good.
00:13:37,00:13:39,- Why don't we do that kind of stuff anymore?
00:13:39,00:13:41,"- Well, I think it's because we have play stations."
00:13:41,00:13:44,(laughing)
00:13:44,00:13:45,- It's a very good point.
00:13:45,00:13:46,- Yeah.
00:13:46,00:13:50,"- So, you know, old recording studios were really cramped"
00:13:50,00:13:52,and also they didn't have very good technology
00:13:52,00:13:53,to do the recording.
00:13:53,00:13:58,"So, for example, you had maybe one recording horn, right?"
00:13:58,00:14:01,"And you had to, which was soaking up all the sound."
00:14:01,00:14:03,And you had to get the band positioned around it
00:14:03,00:14:06,"in exactly the right way that when they played,"
00:14:06,00:14:08,instruments wouldn't drown each other out.
00:14:08,00:14:09,- Yeah.
00:14:09,00:14:10,"- And sorry, and by horn you mean something"
00:14:10,00:14:11,that takes in the sound.
00:14:11,00:14:12,You don't mean that.
00:14:12,00:14:14,"- Sorry, I don't mean a French horn which gives out the sound."
00:14:14,00:14:18,"- Yeah, or a clown car horn as James just brilliantly"
00:14:18,00:14:20,did the sound effect for him.
00:14:20,00:14:21,- Or the horn.
00:14:21,00:14:25,- Or being sexually aroused.
00:14:25,00:14:28,"- Yeah, no one had an erection in the through me that."
00:14:28,00:14:30,"- Okay, can you guarantee that?"
00:14:30,00:14:31,- Can you guarantee that?
00:14:31,00:14:31,(laughing)
00:14:31,00:14:34,"- So anyway, basically singers had the worst time of all"
00:14:34,00:14:37,because they had to move towards the horn
00:14:37,00:14:39,when they were singing quietly.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"And when they had a loud bit coming off in the song,"
00:14:41,00:14:42,they had to lean away from the recording horn
00:14:42,00:14:45,so that they didn't drown everybody out.
00:14:45,00:14:47,But in experienced soloists got pushed back and forth
00:14:47,00:14:49,on a trolley by an assistant.
00:14:49,00:14:51,(laughing)
00:14:51,00:14:53,- That's amazing.
00:14:53,00:14:54,- Wow.
00:14:54,00:14:55,- How hard is it to lean towards that?
00:14:55,00:14:57,(laughing)
00:14:57,00:14:59,- Probably people who complained about the sound quality
00:14:59,00:15:01,"on this podcast are thinking,"
00:15:01,00:15:02,you guys could do with doing that.
00:15:02,00:15:03,- Yeah.
00:15:03,00:15:04,(laughing)
00:15:04,00:15:05,"- Yes, we're all on a trolley at the moment."
00:15:05,00:15:06,That's the problem.
00:15:06,00:15:07,(laughing)
00:15:07,00:15:08,- I'll wheelie chairs with Alex Bell
00:15:08,00:15:10,running around because she is in an hour.
00:15:10,00:15:12,(laughing)
00:15:12,00:15:13,So how long did the strike go on?
00:15:13,00:15:15,"- Yeah, I'll just talk about the strike a little bit more."
00:15:15,00:15:17,So it went on for two years.
00:15:17,00:15:19,It's the longest ever strike in Hollywood
00:15:19,00:15:21,entertainment industry history.
00:15:21,00:15:23,And some other weird things about it.
00:15:23,00:15:26,So the guy who led it was this guy called Petrillo.
00:15:26,00:15:27,One of the things that Petrillo said
00:15:27,00:15:29,"that radio stations would have to do,"
00:15:29,00:15:30,"one of the demands he made,"
00:15:30,00:15:32,"and I'm not sure if he ever got around to enforcing it,"
00:15:32,00:15:35,"was that as soon as any station had played a record,"
00:15:35,00:15:37,they had to immediately destroy that record.
00:15:37,00:15:40,(laughing)
00:15:40,00:15:43,"- Oh, that's so nice, that's cool."
00:15:43,00:15:46,"- But one thing that happened in the end was,"
00:15:46,00:15:49,it led to the decline of the big bands.
00:15:49,00:15:52,And then it just became more about the singers
00:15:52,00:15:53,than the bands.
00:15:53,00:15:53,- Yeah.
00:15:53,00:15:55,"- So it didn't have the intended effect long-term,"
00:15:55,00:15:56,didn't it?
00:15:56,00:15:58,"- Not at all, almost the opposite, in fact."
00:15:58,00:16:00,- I find it amazing that this was all going on
00:16:00,00:16:02,from when did you say 1942 to '44?
00:16:02,00:16:03,- Yes.
00:16:03,00:16:07,- During a period of total war around the world.
00:16:07,00:16:10,This was the main thing that was eating a load of people.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"- Right, it feels weird, the music is like,"
00:16:11,00:16:14,"we're going on strike, it's not the time, mate."
00:16:14,00:16:16,- I thought I'd have a look at some of the songs
00:16:16,00:16:19,that were in the charts in the '40s.
00:16:19,00:16:22,"So one famous one was 'White Christmas',"
00:16:22,00:16:25,which was number one for 11 weeks in 1942.
00:16:25,00:16:26,- Is this American or British?
00:16:26,00:16:28,"- This is the Billbar American chart, yeah."
00:16:28,00:16:30,"So 'White Christmas' was number one for 11 weeks,"
00:16:30,00:16:32,"and I was quite surprised, it first got to number one"
00:16:32,00:16:34,in October that year.
00:16:34,00:16:35,"- Oh, really?"
00:16:35,00:16:36,"- Yeah, that's kind of interesting."
00:16:36,00:16:38,"- So all this whining about Christmas starting too early,"
00:16:38,00:16:40,"actually, it's always done it."
00:16:40,00:16:43,"- And in 1941, so a bit before this strike,"
00:16:43,00:16:46,"there was things like Chattanooga Chuchu as number one,"
00:16:46,00:16:49,"songs like 'Blue Champagne', my sister and I,"
00:16:49,00:16:54,"but on October the 4th of 1941, for eight weeks,"
00:16:54,00:16:57,the number one song in America was 'Piano Concerto'
00:16:57,00:17:00,number one in 'Be Flat Minor' by Chikovsky.
00:17:00,00:17:02,That was top of the charts.
00:17:02,00:17:04,"- Wow, I thought he was around where earlier."
00:17:04,00:17:07,- In 1940s.
00:17:07,00:17:08,- You know.
00:17:08,00:17:12,"- But they had to have his body in the studio,"
00:17:12,00:17:13,whenever they played it.
00:17:13,00:17:16,- Gossily exhuming.
00:17:16,00:17:21,I should say that I got this fact from a website called Timeline.
00:17:21,00:17:23,"It's Timeline.com, and it's such a good website,"
00:17:23,00:17:27,"and it basically tells you in-depth stories sort of from history,"
00:17:27,00:17:30,sort of related to stuff that happens in the news.
00:17:30,00:17:33,"But it's brilliant website, and they got this from a podcast"
00:17:33,00:17:36,"I've just discovered called the Pessamist's Archive,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,"which is also great, and the idea of this podcast is,"
00:17:38,00:17:40,"it's about stuff throughout history,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,"people have been terrified of change,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,and they've always said this is going to destroy it.
00:17:44,00:17:45,"- Oh, cool."
00:17:45,00:17:46,- And they have loads of examples of that.
00:17:46,00:17:50,"So, you know, trains thought buses were going to destroy them."
00:17:50,00:17:52,"Horses and carts campaigned against trains,"
00:17:52,00:17:53,"because they thought trains were going to destroy them,"
00:17:53,00:17:54,which they did.
00:17:54,00:17:57,People thought the radio was really damaging for your ears
00:17:57,00:17:57,and for kids.
00:17:57,00:17:59,People thought Walkman should be banned.
00:17:59,00:18:00,"It's so, it's really interesting."
00:18:00,00:18:04,"Pessamist's Archive is, I would recommend."
00:18:04,00:18:06,"- Yeah, I wonder how many bits and new technology"
00:18:06,00:18:10,have just been outright accepted as the right way forward.
00:18:10,00:18:12,"Like airplanes, they thought would never."
00:18:12,00:18:14,"- Yeah, never thought they'd take off."
00:18:14,00:18:16,(laughing)
00:18:16,00:18:20,- Do you know they played music on Apollo 11?
00:18:20,00:18:22,"- Really? - Oh, hardly."
00:18:22,00:18:26,"Like in the lift, when you were waiting to take off."
00:18:26,00:18:27,- While they were going.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"- While they were going, to keep them calm."
00:18:29,00:18:30,- That's amazing.
00:18:30,00:18:31,"- Waiting, what, during take off?"
00:18:31,00:18:33,- Apparently. - Wow.
00:18:33,00:18:36,- Did they also have buttons like in a lift
00:18:36,00:18:38,"and one of them said, ""Moon."""
00:18:38,00:18:40,(laughing)
00:18:40,00:18:41,- Jupiter.
00:18:41,00:18:41,- Yeah.
00:18:41,00:18:44,(upbeat music)
00:18:44,00:18:49,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:18:49,00:18:50,and that is my fact.
00:18:50,00:18:53,My fact this week is that the British Library
00:18:53,00:18:56,has a collection of over 60 million newspapers
00:18:56,00:18:58,and none of them can catch fire.
00:18:58,00:19:00,You cannot light any of them on fire.
00:19:00,00:19:03,"- Give us a go, I've got a flamethrower."
00:19:03,00:19:04,(laughing)
00:19:04,00:19:07,- Are they kept in water?
00:19:07,00:19:08,- Are they kept in a vacuum?
00:19:08,00:19:11,"- Yeah, no, it's, so the British Library,"
00:19:11,00:19:14,obviously ginormous archive.
00:19:14,00:19:16,Too big to even fit in one place in London
00:19:16,00:19:18,in St. Pancras where the British Library is.
00:19:18,00:19:21,"So they have a warehouse out in a place called Boston Spa,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,which is out in the countryside of England.
00:19:23,00:19:26,"And in there, they house all of the newspaper archive."
00:19:26,00:19:28,"This goes back some three centuries,"
00:19:28,00:19:30,and it's a collection of 60 million.
00:19:30,00:19:33,So what they've done in there is that they've reduced
00:19:33,00:19:36,"the oxygen level to a lower percentage,"
00:19:36,00:19:39,which means it's impossible to light a flame inside
00:19:39,00:19:40,that you cannot light a match.
00:19:40,00:19:42,You cannot make your lighter produce a flame.
00:19:42,00:19:45,"Therefore, you are unable to light any of the newspapers"
00:19:45,00:19:46,in there.
00:19:46,00:19:47,It's very clever.
00:19:47,00:19:48,- So cool.
00:19:48,00:19:49,"- Yeah, you can't actually work in that building"
00:19:49,00:19:52,for too long because you go a bit loopy.
00:19:52,00:19:54,Employees don't actually really need to be down there
00:19:54,00:19:57,for long because the whole thing is operated by robots.
00:19:57,00:19:58,- Amazing.
00:19:58,00:20:00,- Amazing department.
00:20:00,00:20:03,"But when they do go in, they're only allowed in for so long"
00:20:03,00:20:04,because the oxygen level is so low.
00:20:04,00:20:08,- It's the same amount of oxygen as is in a pressurised
00:20:08,00:20:10,air cabin in a narrow plane.
00:20:10,00:20:12,I didn't quite realise how much the oxygen levels
00:20:12,00:20:15,"are reduced when an aircraft cabin is pressurised,"
00:20:15,00:20:20,but they're reduced by 25% just because of the pressurisation.
00:20:20,00:20:23,And reducing it by 25% ends up with it being the equivalent
00:20:23,00:20:27,"of 15% oxygen concentration at sea level,"
00:20:27,00:20:28,which is about the same.
00:20:28,00:20:29,And the only reason we don't really notice it
00:20:29,00:20:30,is because you don't really do anything on a plane.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"But if you try to run a marathon up and down that corridor,"
00:20:33,00:20:36,you'd be in trouble for a number of reasons.
00:20:36,00:20:39,- A marathon is 26 and a bit miles done.
00:20:39,00:20:40,- And how long is that?
00:20:40,00:20:43,- It's a medium length helicopter ride.
00:20:43,00:20:44,- Yeah.
00:20:44,00:20:46,"- Yeah, and also it's all in the dark this warehouse"
00:20:46,00:20:48,because robots don't need lights.
00:20:48,00:20:51,- I think it's a bit harsh that these robots have to work
00:20:51,00:20:52,in the dark.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"- I know they're robots, but just feels like,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,"you know, give them a light, give them..."
00:20:56,00:20:58,"- They hate light, they're like vampires."
00:20:58,00:21:00,- How they meant to read in there?
00:21:00,00:21:02,- Maybe it's to stop them from reading.
00:21:02,00:21:03,"- That's right, they're going to be doing their job, yeah."
00:21:03,00:21:05,- If you're a member of the British Library
00:21:05,00:21:08,"and you request one, the robot goes to the shelf,"
00:21:08,00:21:12,it gets down the thing and then it goes to an airlock
00:21:12,00:21:13,and it passes the thing through the airlock
00:21:13,00:21:15,to a human on the other side
00:21:15,00:21:17,so that it preserves the oxygen levels in the room.
00:21:17,00:21:18,How cool is that?
00:21:18,00:21:19,"- Yeah, and then in most cases,"
00:21:19,00:21:21,"they do have a reading room there,"
00:21:21,00:21:25,but a lot of it is ordered from the central London library.
00:21:25,00:21:27,So it gets in a van and they just bring it over.
00:21:27,00:21:29,"It's bringing these, it's a lot of effort"
00:21:29,00:21:30,to read a newspaper.
00:21:30,00:21:30,"- It's amazing, yeah."
00:21:30,00:21:32,"- Although you can, most of it's digitised, I think."
00:21:32,00:21:34,So the British Library has pet up
00:21:34,00:21:35,"with the British newspaper archive,"
00:21:35,00:21:36,"which I think I can't really mention,"
00:21:36,00:21:39,and they're digitising most of their newspapers on that.
00:21:39,00:21:41,And I think you're only allowed to extract something
00:21:41,00:21:43,from this place in Boston Spa
00:21:43,00:21:45,if it's not available digitally.
00:21:45,00:21:46,- Right.
00:21:46,00:21:48,"- A way thing about Boston Spa, it's very small place"
00:21:48,00:21:50,"in New Yorkshire, it's got a Wikipedia page,"
00:21:50,00:21:51,very short.
00:21:51,00:21:53,No word is a mention on its Wikipedia page
00:21:53,00:21:56,that it constitutes the entire British Library
00:21:56,00:21:57,newspaper archive.
00:21:57,00:21:59,I think someone needs to add that in.
00:21:59,00:22:03,"- The first library in Britain, Manchester Free Library,"
00:22:03,00:22:06,"which opened in 1852 in Manchester,"
00:22:06,00:22:09,"and it had 18,000 bucks."
00:22:09,00:22:10,And it was so popular in its first week
00:22:10,00:22:12,that a police officer was assigned to control
00:22:12,00:22:15,the crowd around the borrowing desk.
00:22:15,00:22:16,- Wow.
00:22:16,00:22:19,- And the first librarian was called Edward Edwards.
00:22:19,00:22:22,(all laughing)
00:22:22,00:22:26,"- I was reading a thing about so libraries keep shutting down,"
00:22:26,00:22:28,and one of the things as well that happens
00:22:28,00:22:32,"in a lot of libraries is if a book doesn't get borrowed,"
00:22:32,00:22:35,then they get taken off the library shelf.
00:22:35,00:22:37,And what that means is that if the library actually
00:22:37,00:22:39,"wants to keep the book, they end up having to buy the book"
00:22:39,00:22:42,"back to put on their shelf, so it costs them a lot of money."
00:22:42,00:22:45,So there is a library in Orlando
00:22:45,00:22:50,"where they found a guy who checked out 2,361 books"
00:22:50,00:22:53,in the span of nine months.
00:22:53,00:22:55,And it turned out it was the librarian there
00:22:55,00:22:57,who created a false library card.
00:22:57,00:23:01,"And the idea was is that now that he borrowed it,"
00:23:01,00:23:04,it was in circulation and you get paid for circulation
00:23:04,00:23:06,as well it brings in funds.
00:23:06,00:23:08,But he got in serious trouble because it's very legal
00:23:08,00:23:12,to fake of being a library borrower.
00:23:12,00:23:13,"- That's a shame, 'cause that is a brilliant idea."
00:23:13,00:23:18,"- Yeah, he was saying that he was saving money technically"
00:23:18,00:23:21,because they would just buy the books back anyway.
00:23:21,00:23:24,So it was just him trying to be a bit cheeky
00:23:24,00:23:26,"about keeping the books without it, costing the library"
00:23:26,00:23:28,"anything, but unfortunately it was seen as illegal."
00:23:28,00:23:30,And he's now in jail for life.
00:23:30,00:23:31,- What?
00:23:31,00:23:33,(all laughing)
00:23:33,00:23:39,- It's no wonder that is totally plausible
00:23:39,00:23:41,about the American justice system.
00:23:41,00:23:43,He was placed on paid suspension.
00:23:43,00:23:44,"- Oh, okay."
00:23:44,00:23:46,- It does sound a bit like playing your own songs
00:23:46,00:23:48,on Spotify nonstop.
00:23:48,00:23:49,"- Yes, that kind of thing."
00:23:49,00:23:51,- That's a good idea.
00:23:51,00:23:52,"- People do it, don't they?"
00:23:52,00:23:53,- Do they?
00:23:53,00:23:54,"- I mean, there was a band who did that."
00:23:54,00:23:56,"- We spoke about on the podcast ages ago,"
00:23:56,00:23:58,I think they're called Wolfpack or something like that.
00:23:58,00:23:59,- Good memory.
00:23:59,00:24:03,"- Yeah, what they did was they streamed their album"
00:24:03,00:24:07,"and told everyone to stream it because if it went enough,"
00:24:07,00:24:08,"so they said when you go to bed,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,"just stream it over and over, put on repeat"
00:24:10,00:24:11,but put it on low volume or no volume.
00:24:11,00:24:12,"- Oh, wasn't a silent album, though."
00:24:12,00:24:13,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:13,00:24:15,"Sorry, so the volume thing was nothing."
00:24:15,00:24:16,"Yeah, and they did make a lot of money"
00:24:16,00:24:18,"which funded their tour,"
00:24:18,00:24:20,but they got caught out by Spotify.
00:24:20,00:24:21,- And they're all in prison.
00:24:21,00:24:22,"- Yeah, for life."
00:24:22,00:24:24,(all laughing)
00:24:24,00:24:27,- There is an archive called the London Metropolitan Archives
00:24:27,00:24:31,"and they have a whole collection of old London records,"
00:24:31,00:24:34,sort of parish records and city records and things like that.
00:24:34,00:24:37,But many of them are unbelievably badly burned
00:24:37,00:24:41,from a fire that happened in 1786.
00:24:41,00:24:42,And then why haven't I was after the fire?
00:24:42,00:24:45,They said we should preserve these records just in case.
00:24:45,00:24:48,"And now, 200 and something years later,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,"what that's nearly 240 years later,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,they are becoming able to read them.
00:24:52,00:24:53,- How do you mean?
00:24:53,00:24:55,- What they've been doing is they've been preserving
00:24:55,00:24:56,the pages very carefully in boxes
00:24:56,00:24:59,and then they increase the humidity
00:24:59,00:25:01,and they sort of puff them out and then they scan them
00:25:01,00:25:03,and then they can digitally flatten the pages.
00:25:03,00:25:05,- So you kind of unburn them a little bit.
00:25:05,00:25:06,"Basically, yeah."
00:25:06,00:25:09,"- Hang on, you can unburn something by getting it wet."
00:25:09,00:25:10,"- And no, you increase the humidity."
00:25:10,00:25:11,I don't know if that is--
00:25:11,00:25:12,- It is wetness.
00:25:12,00:25:13,"- Yeah, okay, good point."
00:25:13,00:25:15,"And then, oh yeah, and they use magnets"
00:25:15,00:25:17,to hold the page flat while they're scanning it
00:25:17,00:25:18,or as flat as they can.
00:25:18,00:25:19,"I mean, it's unbelievably clever,"
00:25:19,00:25:22,but basically it's meaning that they can suddenly read
00:25:22,00:25:22,all these things.
00:25:22,00:25:25,- But all that we find out is that Mr. Jones
00:25:25,00:25:26,lived on high-holbin.
00:25:26,00:25:28,- There could be clues in here.
00:25:28,00:25:30,There could be important clues to how we say everything.
00:25:30,00:25:31,- All I'm saying is it's a lot of effort
00:25:31,00:25:34,to just learn the list of names
00:25:34,00:25:36,of people getting married and stuff.
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- You love reading long lists of information, James."
00:25:38,00:25:39,This is right up your street.
00:25:39,00:25:43,- But just the vision of keeping these things for 200 years
00:25:43,00:25:43,is amazing.
00:25:43,00:25:45,- Just in case we change our own technology.
00:25:45,00:25:46,"- Yeah, read them again."
00:25:46,00:25:47,- I kind of think that's incredibly admirable.
00:25:47,00:25:48,- Yeah.
00:25:48,00:25:49,"- Yeah, that's great."
00:25:49,00:25:50,"- James thinks it's absolutely worthless, but--"
00:25:50,00:25:51,"- I like it, yeah."
00:25:51,00:25:52,(all laughing)
00:25:52,00:25:55,- I think the money could be spent better elsewhere.
00:25:55,00:25:55,- Yep.
00:25:55,00:25:56,- They'll give you more libraries.
00:25:56,00:25:57,(all laughing)
00:25:57,00:26:00,- And then take thousands of books out of the better time.
00:26:00,00:26:01,(all laughing)
00:26:01,00:26:03,(upbeat music)
00:26:03,00:26:09,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:26:09,00:26:11,and that is James.
00:26:11,00:26:14,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the man who invented"
00:26:14,00:26:18,Muldwine also invented an Aphrodisiac sorbet.
00:26:18,00:26:20,- Muldwine.
00:26:20,00:26:22,"- Well, yes, he did."
00:26:22,00:26:24,"Well, Amanda, both of those things."
00:26:24,00:26:26,(all laughing)
00:26:26,00:26:29,"Muldwine is kind of pretty old, pretty ancient,"
00:26:29,00:26:32,"but Blue Van, which is the German version of it,"
00:26:32,00:26:36,has a guy who is often called the inventor of it.
00:26:36,00:26:40,He's called August Joseph Ludwig von Wachibath.
00:26:40,00:26:41,(all laughing)
00:26:41,00:26:42,- Which is a pretty strong name.
00:26:42,00:26:43,(all laughing)
00:26:43,00:26:46,And he is the author of the oldest extant recipe.
00:26:46,00:26:49,"So in Germany, they call him the father of Muldwine."
00:26:49,00:26:53,"And quite recently, some historians found some writings"
00:26:53,00:26:56,of his of a recipe for Aphrodisiac sorbet.
00:26:56,00:26:57,- Mmm.
00:26:57,00:27:02,"- And the sorbet is made with the delicious whites of two eggs,"
00:27:02,00:27:05,"the juice of two lemons, two pounds of sugar,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,a few grains of ambergris.
00:27:07,00:27:08,"- Hold on, it's done writing this down."
00:27:08,00:27:11,(all laughing)
00:27:11,00:27:12,- It's done just to whip it down his pen
00:27:12,00:27:14,and start scrolling notes on his page.
00:27:14,00:27:17,- So done two eggs.
00:27:17,00:27:17,- Two eggs.
00:27:17,00:27:20,"- Yeah, two lemons, two pounds of sugar,"
00:27:20,00:27:23,"some ambergris, and delicious lozenges"
00:27:23,00:27:25,from the pharmacy four ounces of.
00:27:25,00:27:26,"- Oh, great."
00:27:26,00:27:27,- It's just strepsils.
00:27:27,00:27:30,- But we don't know what's in the lozenges.
00:27:30,00:27:31,"That's a problem, you see."
00:27:31,00:27:32,That might be the magic ingredient.
00:27:32,00:27:36,And all we've said is one pound of sugar per egg.
00:27:36,00:27:37,"I mean, that's quite a sugary recipe."
00:27:37,00:27:40,- But also it has an incredibly expensive recipe in there
00:27:40,00:27:41,because it's using ambergris in there.
00:27:41,00:27:43,"- Yeah, which you start at least slipped in,"
00:27:43,00:27:45,"like just some sugars and milk, some solid diamond,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,and it's gonna be a flower.
00:27:47,00:27:48,- So we've told on it.
00:27:48,00:27:49,- Yeah.
00:27:49,00:27:50,"- But if you don't have that,"
00:27:50,00:27:53,you can use the glandulous secretions of a musk rat.
00:27:53,00:27:54,- Oh good.
00:27:54,00:27:55,(all laughing)
00:27:55,00:27:56,"- Well, we got a lot of that."
00:27:56,00:27:58,(all laughing)
00:27:58,00:28:00,"No, what I was writing down was he's called"
00:28:00,00:28:02,the father of Muldwine.
00:28:02,00:28:04,I was wondering if that he was called that
00:28:04,00:28:07,because that's just way easier to say than his actual name.
00:28:07,00:28:09,(all laughing)
00:28:09,00:28:12,"- Oh, Gustjo's if Ludwig Wagner-Vacabar."
00:28:12,00:28:13,What's hard about that?
00:28:13,00:28:14,"- Oh, you're right."
00:28:14,00:28:15,I'm afraid.
00:28:15,00:28:16,"- He seemed, it's a shame."
00:28:16,00:28:19,"A lot of the articles on him online,"
00:28:19,00:28:20,"there's a lot of results when he put his name in,"
00:28:20,00:28:21,but they're all in German.
00:28:21,00:28:25,"And I really want to read more about this guy,"
00:28:25,00:28:26,but I didn't have time today.
00:28:26,00:28:27,- You didn't have time to learn German.
00:28:27,00:28:29,(all laughing)
00:28:29,00:28:31,- When are you gonna get that done over the weekend?
00:28:31,00:28:32,"- Yeah, I'll say."
00:28:32,00:28:33,- Yeah.
00:28:33,00:28:35,"He's, as a wild claim, isn't it?"
00:28:35,00:28:37,This father of Muldwine because people have been drinking.
00:28:37,00:28:40,He's been up wine and alcoholic drinks
00:28:40,00:28:41,since the dawn of time.
00:28:41,00:28:43,So I think peeps talks about drinking it.
00:28:43,00:28:44,- Right.
00:28:44,00:28:46,- And- - The ancient Greeks as well.
00:28:46,00:28:47,- The ancient Greeks drinking it.
00:28:47,00:28:49,- Even before the time of Samuel Peep.
00:28:49,00:28:50,(all laughing)
00:28:50,00:28:51,"- Well, you said dawn of time,"
00:28:51,00:28:53,"which is, I think, a bit far back."
00:28:53,00:28:56,"- So I said, I said from when we've been drinking-"
00:28:56,00:28:56,- You said the dawn of time.
00:28:56,00:28:57,- I said the dawn of time.
00:28:57,00:28:58,"- Yeah, the dawn of time."
00:28:58,00:29:00,"- The dinosaurs actually had a very,"
00:29:00,00:29:02,the first thing's made in the Big Bang.
00:29:02,00:29:03,- Yeah.
00:29:03,00:29:07,- It was a hydrogen helium and Muldwine.
00:29:07,00:29:08,- And gloves.
00:29:08,00:29:10,(all laughing)
00:29:10,00:29:12,- Do you know how they used to heat it?
00:29:12,00:29:14,And I think they still do heat it.
00:29:14,00:29:16,- Over a flame?
00:29:16,00:29:17,No. - No.
00:29:17,00:29:18,- Not over a flame.
00:29:18,00:29:19,"- Oh, in a microwave."
00:29:19,00:29:20,"- Yeah, that's right."
00:29:20,00:29:21,That's why Samuel peeps did it.
00:29:21,00:29:22,- In some dung.
00:29:22,00:29:23,"- Oh, peeps things up."
00:29:23,00:29:25,"- No, maybe they, maybe some of them did that."
00:29:25,00:29:27,- Cutting open the body of a horse
00:29:27,00:29:28,and putting it in there.
00:29:28,00:29:29,- And pouring it into there
00:29:29,00:29:31,and then you drink it from the orifice.
00:29:31,00:29:34,- By taking the latent heat of the early universe.
00:29:34,00:29:36,(all laughing)
00:29:36,00:29:39,- It's just the Big Bang was a hot time.
00:29:39,00:29:41,"It was actually, it was a drink question."
00:29:41,00:29:43,(all laughing)
00:29:43,00:29:44,"- It's still a war, we're calling that."
00:29:44,00:29:46,(all laughing)
00:29:46,00:29:48,- All Muldwine gets here from comments.
00:29:48,00:29:52,"No, well, peeps records how they would get a polka"
00:29:52,00:29:54,"really, really hot over the fire."
00:29:54,00:29:55,So you'd hold a polka over the fire
00:29:55,00:29:57,"and then you'd have a huge vat of beer,"
00:29:57,00:29:59,"which I often was in those days, or wine."
00:29:59,00:30:01,And then you'd stir it with a hot polka.
00:30:01,00:30:03,So you'd stir it in a barrel of beer with a polka.
00:30:03,00:30:04,- That's really clever.
00:30:04,00:30:05,- Yeah.
00:30:05,00:30:06,- That's cool.
00:30:06,00:30:07,- Does that work?
00:30:07,00:30:08,"- Really well, or would work."
00:30:08,00:30:09,- I think it did seem to be.
00:30:09,00:30:10,"- Would work, of course."
00:30:10,00:30:11,"- So like if I wanted to make a tea,"
00:30:11,00:30:12,but I didn't have a...
00:30:12,00:30:14,"- If you had a cup, you didn't have a kettle,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,but you didn't have a red hot polka.
00:30:16,00:30:17,(all laughing)
00:30:17,00:30:18,"- Yeah, would that work?"
00:30:18,00:30:18,- I guess.
00:30:18,00:30:20,- Could you get the water boiling hot?
00:30:20,00:30:22,"- Yeah, you could, I suppose."
00:30:22,00:30:22,"- Yeah, maybe."
00:30:22,00:30:24,"- 'Cause you know, you need it quite hot"
00:30:24,00:30:25,so you make a really good cup of tea.
00:30:25,00:30:26,- Yeah.
00:30:26,00:30:27,"- But I mean, the cup's not that big, is it?"
00:30:27,00:30:30,"So I imagine the mould wine, that's a pot."
00:30:30,00:30:32,"- Yeah, you don't want to damage the cup"
00:30:32,00:30:33,"that you're making a tea, and either,"
00:30:33,00:30:35,"and if you're wiggling around a red hot polka net,"
00:30:35,00:30:36,you might.
00:30:36,00:30:38,(all laughing)
00:30:38,00:30:40,"So the Victorian television of mould wine,"
00:30:40,00:30:41,which they called Smoking Bishop.
00:30:41,00:30:42,- That's a thing.
00:30:42,00:30:43,"- Yeah, that was a thing."
00:30:43,00:30:46,"It was port, it was port fruit and spices,"
00:30:46,00:30:50,"but they had also Smoking Archbishop,"
00:30:50,00:30:52,which was with Claret and Smoking Pope.
00:30:52,00:30:54,"And in a Christmas carol,"
00:30:54,00:30:57,"screwed promises Bob Cratchett, some Smoking Bishop."
00:30:57,00:30:58,- We'll see.
00:30:58,00:30:59,- Yeah.
00:30:59,00:31:00,"You could have quite a fun night, if you were a bishop,"
00:31:00,00:31:02,"with some Smoking Bishop,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,"and then you could eat some Stinking Bishop, the cheese."
00:31:04,00:31:04,- Yeah.
00:31:04,00:31:05,- Oh yeah.
00:31:05,00:31:06,"- If there are any bishops listening,"
00:31:06,00:31:08,who want to know how to party.
00:31:08,00:31:11,(all laughing)
00:31:11,00:31:14,"- But wait, it wasn't just bishops who were allowed"
00:31:14,00:31:15,"to drink it, right?"
00:31:15,00:31:16,"- No, it was everyone who was allowed to drink it."
00:31:16,00:31:17,It was just a name.
00:31:17,00:31:19,- So you don't have to be a bishop who knows how to party.
00:31:19,00:31:20,You can be anyone who knows how to party.
00:31:20,00:31:21,"- That's true, yeah."
00:31:21,00:31:23,- Could we do some Aprodisiac stuff?
00:31:23,00:31:24,- Yeah.
00:31:24,00:31:25,"- Okay, no, sorry."
00:31:25,00:31:26,"- No, what I was going to say is,"
00:31:26,00:31:29,"they did an experiment with some rats,"
00:31:29,00:31:31,"where they took out one of the ingredients,"
00:31:31,00:31:33,"famigree switches, Ambrian."
00:31:33,00:31:36,"So it's like a type of compound,"
00:31:36,00:31:38,"and they gave it to the rats,"
00:31:38,00:31:42,and it produced an increase of a no genital
00:31:42,00:31:44,investigatory behavior.
00:31:44,00:31:46,- So let's unpack that a second.
00:31:46,00:31:48,A no genital investigatory.
00:31:48,00:31:49,"Okay, got it, yeah, yeah."
00:31:49,00:31:52,"So I think all those words are self, you know?"
00:31:52,00:31:54,"- Self-explanatory, yeah, yeah."
00:31:54,00:31:55,- Really?
00:31:55,00:31:57,- What Friday night is complete without...
00:31:57,00:31:58,(laughing)
00:31:58,00:32:00,"- It's awesome, eight over the bishop party."
00:32:00,00:32:03,(laughing)
00:32:03,00:32:05,- Ain't no genital investigatory behavior.
00:32:05,00:32:06,"- Absolutely, yeah."
00:32:06,00:32:08,"- Only works in rats though, apparently."
00:32:08,00:32:10,"- Well, we don't know."
00:32:10,00:32:13,I think we need to do the investigation for humans.
00:32:13,00:32:14,"- Oh god, I don't think we need to."
00:32:14,00:32:16,I think other people need to.
00:32:16,00:32:18,- It only works really in male rats as well.
00:32:18,00:32:20,- The female rats aren't that interested.
00:32:20,00:32:21,- Right.
00:32:21,00:32:23,- Ain't no genital eat or otherwise.
00:32:23,00:32:26,- About that kind of thing.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"- Hey, I'm just wondering if you're interested in me,"
00:32:28,00:32:29,Aino genital eat or otherwise.
00:32:29,00:32:32,(laughing)
00:32:32,00:32:35,"- It's a good word, isn't it?"
00:32:35,00:32:37,- Yeah.
00:32:37,00:32:40,- You're being really Aino genital about this mark.
00:32:40,00:32:42,(laughing)
00:32:42,00:32:44,- Is it Aino with one end?
00:32:44,00:32:45,"- Yeah. - I know, yeah."
00:32:45,00:32:47,"- Aino, right, I've never actually seen that."
00:32:47,00:32:48,- You've shown to that before?
00:32:48,00:32:49,- No. - No.
00:32:49,00:32:53,- It's where volcano is made up of two words.
00:32:53,00:32:54,Folk and Aino.
00:32:54,00:32:55,"- Right, I don't know that."
00:32:55,00:32:58,"- Because people thought it was vulcan, the god."
00:32:58,00:32:59,Here's Aino's.
00:32:59,00:33:00,"- Yeah, that's right."
00:33:00,00:33:01,- Shitting fire into the sky.
00:33:01,00:33:03,(laughing)
00:33:03,00:33:04,- Yeah.
00:33:04,00:33:07,- Gwyneth Poucho sells Afridisiacs.
00:33:07,00:33:10,"And this is a way of talking about her website,"
00:33:10,00:33:12,which I know this is very low-brow for us
00:33:12,00:33:14,"to go into this subject, but it's unbelievable."
00:33:14,00:33:19,"Her website called goop.com, which she sells extraordinary"
00:33:19,00:33:19,things on there.
00:33:19,00:33:22,"- Like what Anna, and for how much?"
00:33:22,00:33:24,(laughing)
00:33:24,00:33:25,- And if you're listening this week's episode
00:33:25,00:33:30,"of No Stuff Things A Fish, it's brought to you by Goop."
00:33:30,00:33:32,For all your Aino genital leads.
00:33:32,00:33:36,"- So for this Aino genital need, you can get sex bark,"
00:33:36,00:33:38,which is sex bark.
00:33:38,00:33:39,"- Yeah, sex bark."
00:33:39,00:33:40,- Look at what it's worth and it's sex bites.
00:33:40,00:33:45,(laughing)
00:33:45,00:33:49,"- Yeah, it's like chocolate, except then you have to add"
00:33:49,00:33:53,"something called Hushuwo to it, which is sex dust."
00:33:53,00:33:55,"And I don't, it doesn't really specify where you get that."
00:33:55,00:33:57,- It sounds to me like she's just taking objects
00:33:57,00:34:00,and putting the word sex in front of them.
00:34:00,00:34:02,- That's the sex cleaner being.
00:34:02,00:34:03,(laughing)
00:34:03,00:34:05,- There's a lot of sex dust on top of the sex piano.
00:34:05,00:34:07,(laughing)
00:34:07,00:34:11,"- But she also sells Jade eggs, do you know what these are?"
00:34:11,00:34:14,- Are they made out of Jade for the material?
00:34:14,00:34:16,"- I believe they are, they claim to be."
00:34:16,00:34:19,They're also called Yoni eggs and they're advertised
00:34:19,00:34:22,on goop.com as once strictly guarded secret
00:34:22,00:34:25,of Chinese concubines and royalty and antiquity.
00:34:25,00:34:28,"And they harness the power of energy, crystal healing"
00:34:28,00:34:30,and a cagal-like physical practice.
00:34:30,00:34:31,So it's all very scientifically sound.
00:34:31,00:34:34,- And what you do is you put them into your vagina
00:34:34,00:34:37,and you sit there with one in for a while
00:34:37,00:34:38,and it makes you feel better.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"- Strange that they didn't call them sex Jade eggs, isn't it?"
00:34:41,00:34:42,(laughing)
00:34:42,00:34:45,- 'Cause you hadn't developed that particular marketing twist yet.
00:34:45,00:34:48,"- And then you have to pass them again, presumably."
00:34:48,00:34:50,"- You pass them out again, yeah, of the same."
00:34:50,00:34:51,"- Wow, clocking."
00:34:51,00:34:53,(laughing)
00:34:53,00:34:56,- Wow.
00:34:56,00:34:58,"- That's, yeah, wow, that's, yeah, cool."
00:34:58,00:34:59,- That's only you.
00:34:59,00:35:01,"- I mean, if it's consenting adults."
00:35:01,00:35:02,- Nothing criminal about it.
00:35:02,00:35:03,"- No, no."
00:35:04,00:35:07,- Gailan said that any food which made you flatulence
00:35:07,00:35:09,was an aphrodisiac.
00:35:09,00:35:13,"Any warm, moist and windy foods were ones that produced lust."
00:35:13,00:35:14,- And did he do well?
00:35:14,00:35:16,(laughing)
00:35:16,00:35:18,- This is Tinder for a couple of times.
00:35:18,00:35:19,(laughing)
00:35:19,00:35:21,"Looking for a guy who,"
00:35:21,00:35:24,- Saferon can help you have a sustained erection they found.
00:35:24,00:35:25,- Wow.
00:35:25,00:35:29,- There was a 2009 study in Iran and the 20 male patients
00:35:29,00:35:31,were given Saferon for 10 days
00:35:31,00:35:35,and they showed a statistically significant improvement
00:35:35,00:35:39,in apparently their tip rigidity and tip tumessence
00:35:39,00:35:42,as well as base rigidity and base tumessence.
00:35:42,00:35:43,But no word on the middle.
00:35:43,00:35:44,- I got it.
00:35:44,00:35:46,(laughing)
00:35:46,00:35:51,"- So it's a bit like, you know, the slinky dog"
00:35:51,00:35:52,and toy story?
00:35:52,00:35:53,(laughing)
00:35:53,00:35:53,- God.
00:35:53,00:35:55,(laughing)
00:35:55,00:35:57,- I was reading about an aphrodisiac.
00:35:57,00:35:59,This is the title of the story.
00:35:59,00:36:02,Can a rare Hawaiian mushroom really give women
00:36:02,00:36:03,a spontaneous orgasm?
00:36:03,00:36:05,And this was a 15 year old study.
00:36:05,00:36:06,- Not by him.
00:36:06,00:36:07,(laughing)
00:36:07,00:36:08,- Sorry.
00:36:08,00:36:09,(laughing)
00:36:09,00:36:10,- Let me start that again.
00:36:10,00:36:13,- May steady continue in the rare mushroom.
00:36:13,00:36:13,(laughing)
00:36:13,00:36:15,- Same personation of a 15 year old.
00:36:15,00:36:16,"- Well, I sounded like."
00:36:16,00:36:19,(laughing)
00:36:19,00:36:21,"- Well, you had some 41."
00:36:21,00:36:22,"Now, when you were 15,"
00:36:22,00:36:23,(laughing)
00:36:23,00:36:27,"- I mean, the biggest podcast reveal."
00:36:27,00:36:29,(laughing)
00:36:29,00:36:31,Andy's grunge part.
00:36:31,00:36:34,(laughing)
00:36:34,00:36:37,- This is a study that was done in 2001.
00:36:37,00:36:40,And these two medical students published a report
00:36:40,00:36:43,in the International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms.
00:36:43,00:36:46,"And they did this study on 36 volunteers,"
00:36:46,00:36:47,both male and female.
00:36:47,00:36:51,"And they found that this mushroom,"
00:36:51,00:36:54,"this Hawaiian mushroom, was causing spontaneous orgasm"
00:36:54,00:36:58,"in a bunch of the women, a part of the study group."
00:36:58,00:37:00,"And so, everyone says it's not a big enough study group"
00:37:00,00:37:01,in order for that to be a truth.
00:37:01,00:37:03,So it's a very dubious thing.
00:37:03,00:37:05,"And the article I was reading saying,"
00:37:05,00:37:08,"actually no, it can't give you spontaneous orgasm."
00:37:08,00:37:10,"What I was wondering though, was if we thought that it did,"
00:37:10,00:37:14,I wonder if there's a sort of placebo effect with it.
00:37:14,00:37:16,"Therefore, could you placebo an orgasm?"
00:37:16,00:37:19,"- Well, almost all afridiziax and things"
00:37:19,00:37:22,that are sort of an afridiziax trade on the placebo effect.
00:37:22,00:37:23,- And do they?
00:37:23,00:37:24,"Oh, okay."
00:37:24,00:37:28,So oysters and the actual evidence for them changing chemicals
00:37:28,00:37:32,in your body to make you more interested in sex is pretty slim.
00:37:32,00:37:34,"- Yeah, although they don't claim spontaneous orgasms"
00:37:34,00:37:35,"to be fair, that's another..."
00:37:35,00:37:36,"I think when you have an afridiziax,"
00:37:36,00:37:39,you also need to have some other sexual stimulation.
00:37:39,00:37:41,"You don't just eat ten oysters and stand,"
00:37:41,00:37:43,"they're going, ""Why haven't I orgasm?"""
00:37:43,00:37:46,(laughing)
00:37:46,00:37:49,"- I don't know, darling, keep trying."
00:37:49,00:37:50,I'm doing the crossword.
