1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 - Hey everyone, before we begin this week's show,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,320
 we just have a quick request.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,120
 We are doing a live show on the 28th of February.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,960
 It's our third birthday party.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,480
 And we were hoping that we could ask you

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,760
 to submit a bunch of questions, interesting thoughts,

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,440
 ideas, whatever it is you want for us to read out on stage.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,640
 - Yeah, make them funny, make them snappy,

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,120
 make them cool, make them worthy of being aired,

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,920
 and they will be podcast at qi.com,

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,240
 email us your questions.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,880
 You could even tweet it to us as well

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,960
 on our @qipodcast account.

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,000
 Please do before this coming Tuesday.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,840
 And if we see it and it's short enough

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,840
 and funny enough and intelligent enough,

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,920
 we will read it on stage.

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,240
 Okay, on with the show.

19
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,640
 (blues music)

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,880
 - Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,320
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,920
 from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,080
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,560
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,960
 and Anna Chazinski.

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,280
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,080
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,640
 and in no particular order, here we go.

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,680
 Starting with you, Andy Murray.

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,720
 - My fact this week is that the smallest football league

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,120
 in the world consists of two teams

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,840
 who play each other 22 times every season.

33
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,840
 - Where is it?

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,240
 - It's on the Isles of Silly,

35
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,320
 which is just off Cornwall,

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,160
 which is the southwest tip of Britain

37
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,120
 for anyone who's not from Britain listening.

38
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,480
 And they're called the Woolpack Wanderers

39
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,960
 and the Garrison Gunners.

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
 And they used to be called the Rangers and the Rovers

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,760
 and then they thought that was a bit boring

42
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,120
 so they could make it more interesting.

43
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,720
 - And it's weird that they did that

44
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,800
 because you can only really call yourself the Gunners

45
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,520
 if you've got a historical connection

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,080
 to like an Arsenal's case and armaments factory

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,360
 and the Wanderers.

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,480
 People are called that when they don't have a permanent stadium

49
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,760
 which I assume they always have

50
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,480
 because there aren't any other teams in this place.

51
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,320
 - Yes.

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,560
 - So their names are lies.

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,680
 - I mean, they've been playing since World War I, I believe.

54
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,200
 - Well, they must be knackered.

55
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,400
 (laughing)

56
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,320
 They've got, he forgot to match how long the matches are.

57
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,000
 Half-time's coming up next year.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,200
 No, so maybe there is a connection potentially for the Gunners.

59
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,840
 - Well, they're called the Garrison Gunners

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,040
 so is it not to do with some kind of Garrison?

61
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,120
 - Yeah, I'm sure they're the Garrison on the Elves of Cili.

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,680
 I don't know, I don't have the facts.

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,520
 - Do you know what I really like?

64
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,240
 They play on the same football pitch every time

65
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,440
 but they swap for being a home and a way team

66
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
 so they're changing rooms.

67
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,480
 They change to say a way for the way team that way

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,360
 and then home on the next match.

69
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,720
 - But that means they're the exact opposite

70
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
 of what you would expect a Wanderers team to be then.

71
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,880
 - It's true.

72
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,400
 - Because not only have they always played on the same pitch

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,520
 they even play all their away games on the same pitch as well.

74
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,760
 (laughing)

75
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,600
 - It's very true.

76
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,360
 - The Wikipedia on them is unbelievably cautious.

77
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,400
 It says, "The league is reportedly the smallest in the world."

78
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,000
 I do not believe there's a one team league anywhere in the world.

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,360
 - You know how they pick the teams?

80
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,960
 They pick them by every year, a few weeks before the season,

81
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,280
 the captains of the two teams.

82
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,480
 They meet up in the pub and they basically, they take turns.

83
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
 - No. - Yes.

84
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
 - Oh my god. - Oh my god.

85
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

86
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,280
 So they try and make it so the teams

87
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,480
 are roughly equal in ability.

88
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,920
 - I was reading an interview with them though

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,880
 and they don't seem to even know which team they play for.

90
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,200
 One of them was us.

91
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,800
 One of them was us whose team he was on and he said,

92
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,920
 "Oh, I'm wearing red, which team is that?"

93
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,440
 (laughing)

94
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,240
 - Just the Isle of Silly for the people overseas

95
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,120
 who haven't heard of it, it's incredibly small

96
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,000
 and it's population size as of 2001.

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,440
 That's the last update I've seen that I could find

98
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,160
 2,153 people.

99
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,360
 So it's a very tiny population

100
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,920
 but they've worked out that 32% of the population participate

101
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,080
 at least three times a week in 30 minutes more sport,

102
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,160
 way greater than any other bit of Britain.

103
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,960
 - But then 1% of the population are in one of these football teams

104
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
 presumably.

105
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,280
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

106
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,120
 - Yeah, that's really good.

107
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
 That must be the highest anywhere.

108
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,640
 - Highest proportion of football players anywhere.

109
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,480
 - Yeah.

110
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,320
 - Professionals.

111
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,840
 - And also on their teams, I really like this,

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
 there's a huge gap of the age bracket of who plays

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,440
 where they're majorotively missing 16 to 25 year olds

114
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,880
 and the reason is because the schools in the Isle of Silly

115
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,200
 only go up to six form.

116
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,240
 So when you're 16, you have to go to the mainland

117
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,600
 to finish off your schooling.

118
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,640
 And so they end up just staying on the mainland

119
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,560
 when they come over rather than going back.

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,840
 - Basically on holiday, there is a kid.

121
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,240
 It's so lovely, amazing bird watching.

122
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,080
 - Oh really?

123
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
 - Amazing birds.

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,240
 - Did you ever see the Silly Bee?

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,080
 (laughing)

126
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,920
 - No.

127
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,000
 - Silly Bee is, yeah, it's a kind of bee

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 that you find on the Silly Islands.

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,840
 - That's great.

130
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,720
 - Is it good even in a Silly Bee?

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,680
 (laughing)

132
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,400
 - It never collects any pollen.

133
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,600
 It only collects twiglets and things like that.

134
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,280
 It's such a Silly Bee.

135
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,840
 - It just collects anecdotes, yeah.

136
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,320
 (laughing)

137
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,520
 - Yeah, it's actually quite endangered,

138
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,880
 but they, someone took a photo of one in 2012

139
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,520
 because people thought they might have even got extinct.

140
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,760
 So that was big news in the Silly Islands.

141
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,040
 - You did a really good job of transferring really quickly

142
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,880
 from a laughter voice to the very solemn,

143
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,280
 it's quite endangered voice.

144
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,560
 - Quite endangered.

145
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,440
 There's a serious side to the Silly Bee.

146
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,320
 (laughing)

147
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,840
 - Have you seen the Silly Police Force

148
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,960
 is quite famous around the world?

149
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,800
 - Oh yeah, sorry, now everything sounds like Silly.

150
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
 It's that they've only got two officers

151
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,880
 and I think they're one thing saying

152
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,320
 they're only posted for a certain number of years

153
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,440
 so they don't get too close to the local population.

154
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,680
 - They are, it's five years.

155
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,520
 - Five years, yeah.

156
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
 - Well, I know, but the last sergeant,

157
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,240
 he wrote the thing saying he'd been there for seven years.

158
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,320
 So I don't know.

159
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
 - Maybe no one liked it.

160
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,800
 (laughing)

161
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,560
 - He had to borrow a child's bike once

162
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,520
 to pursue a drunk driver.

163
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,880
 - And this is a Silly policeman

164
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,720
 you're talking about.

165
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,320
 - He's a Silly policeman.

166
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,680
 - I think it's a very good policeman,

167
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,000
 but one of the other cases that he dealt with was,

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040
 and I'm quoting here,

169
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,320
 a shed door was forced open at a football club,

170
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,680
 but one of the only clues available was a fried egg.

171
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,160
 - This is fried egg on the ground next to the shed.

172
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,360
 - Is there any resolution to that story?

173
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 Do we know the case of the fried egg?

174
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,160
 - If there is, I don't have it.

175
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,000
 - Sorry.

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,040
 - And escape chicken.

177
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,600
 (laughing)

178
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,200
 - No, they don't fry their eggs today.

179
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,360
 That's what he says.

180
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,920
 (laughing)

181
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,720
 - I was reading, so the teams actually do team up as well

182
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,000
 to play against the mainland.

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
 There's a team.

184
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,400
 - Which is a massively uneven contest to be fair.

185
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,240
 (laughing)

186
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,760
 - So they play the England football team,

187
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,560
 they play, who are they called?

188
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,720
 - It's dynamo chuff in hands and hands.

189
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,160
 - Yeah, and so they play them together.

190
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,520
 And they have a trophy that they use,

191
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,800
 the Lioness Cup.

192
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
 And the Lioness Cup trophy is the smallest trophy in the world.

193
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,480
 - In size, you mean?

194
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,120
 - Yeah, in size, it's very tiny.

195
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,440
 I think it's in the FIFA museum, isn't it?

196
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,240
 - They took it for the FIFA museum for a year.

197
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,160
 It's six millimeters tall.

198
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,000
 - Whoa.

199
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,840
 - That's very sweet.

200
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,240
 - That's smaller than a silly bee.

201
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,960
 (laughing)

202
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,400
 - It was made by a carpenter from dynamo truffs and his wife.

203
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,480
 I think they're artists.

204
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,040
 - So is it made out of wood then?

205
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,160
 - I think it's made of wood and metal.

206
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,760
 You know, the oldest player in the football league retired

207
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,320
 last year at the age of 70.

208
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,840
 - 70, but I read the way that they play.

209
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,760
 It doesn't sound overly competitive.

210
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,640
 In that, there's a journalist who is gonna play

211
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,600
 for the sake of writing an article

212
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,240
 and he just kept missing every time

213
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,120
 and he missed it like 16 times.

214
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,880
 But every time he missed it, everyone was really encouraging

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,440
 and apparently that's the whole thing it's just about.

216
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,240
 So this 70 year old guy, I bet he's shit.

217
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,360
 But it doesn't matter, 'cause they're really listening

218
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,680
 to this podcast.

219
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,520
 He didn't really say it.

220
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,280
 Looking at an empty six millimeter high spot

221
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,760
 on his mantel piece.

222
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,320
 I think, no, I've only been better.

223
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,080
 (laughing)

224
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,320
 It's like a bee.

225
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,400
 - Well, all of the haters is 70 play against, you know,

226
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,680
 ages, that don't include 16 to 20 pie,

227
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,360
 but everything that happens, he might be outplayed for his age.

228
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,200
 Maybe not.

229
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,240
 - The silly isles signed a piece treaty

230
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,320
 with the Netherlands a few years ago to end formally

231
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,600
 the 335 years war between the two countries.

232
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,440
 - Oh wow.

233
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,960
 - Even though no one actually knows

234
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,400
 if the 335 years war ever actually happened.

235
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,240
 - Whoa.

236
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,160
 - So there have been rumors since the 1600s.

237
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,080
 The war was declared between the Netherlands

238
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,000
 and the silly isles and then other people say

239
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,120
 it can't even have been declared,

240
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
 'cause they're not a nation and no one really knows,

241
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,000
 but the sources go back that far.

242
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,120
 And eventually, at some point, the silly isles

243
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,920
 wrote to the Netherlands and said,

244
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,080
 look, can we just acknowledge

245
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,440
 that there's never been a war between us?

246
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,920
 And the Netherlands said we can't actually verify that.

247
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,440
 I think we're probably still at war.

248
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,600
 So the silly isles said, okay, well, can we end the war piece?

249
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,560
 (laughing)

250
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,480
 And so yeah, they visited each other

251
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,560
 and they signed a treaty saying we're at peace.

252
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,400
 - It was amazing.

253
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,480
 The ambassador came over in a helicopter

254
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,760
 with a scroll to sign the piece.

255
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,560
 - But the admiral who declared war on the silly isles,

256
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,600
 the Dutch one was called Trump.

257
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
 - Oh, I see.

258
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
 - 10 Trump.

259
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,120
 - I know.

260
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,080
 So we don't know if he's any relation.

261
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,560
 - That's a long helicopter ride, isn't it?

262
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,400
 - 300 years.

263
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,040
 (laughing)

264
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,320
 - We said that the ambassador got there by helicopter.

265
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,480
 - It will have been from the mainland UK, yes.

266
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
 - The mainland UK.

267
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,160
 - You have to, yeah.

268
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
 - No, I was just only thinking, can you go over the channel

269
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
 and how far can you go on a helicopter?

270
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,480
 - You can go over the channel.

271
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,000
 - How bad do you think helicopters are?

272
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
 - Do you think you just threw them

273
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,880
 and then they go as far as you can toss it?

274
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
 - No, they just don't look like they have much fuel.

275
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,960
 - They could go about 300 miles,

276
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,720
 like just a small helicopter and then the big ones could go.

277
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,960
 - How far's that?

278
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,080
 - You just asked how far 300 miles is.

279
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,600
 - So you know a mile, yeah.

280
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,080
 It's 300 of those.

281
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,040
 - We can't reduce it further than that.

282
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,200
 (laughing)

283
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,960
 And the Netherlands is very close.

284
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,720
 - You used to always get a helicopter over.

285
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
 I think they've cancelled it now,

286
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,880
 but when I used to go as a kid,

287
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,720
 it was the only way that you'd go over

288
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,200
 except for the ferry crossing.

289
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
 - I think they might be gonna bring it back.

290
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,640
 - Oh really?

291
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,480
 - Either they're gonna bring it back

292
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,720
 or just have brought it back.

293
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
 Or they said they were going to and haven't done it.

294
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
 (laughing)

295
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,080
 - One of those kind of options there.

296
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,880
 - Great facts from James Ollion.

297
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,400
 (laughing)

298
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,760
 - I do have a fact about the longest

299
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,000
 and shortest things in the world,

300
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,800
 'cause there's about the world's smallest league of football.

301
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,640
 - Yep.

302
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,480
 - But I'm afraid it's about the world's largest penis.

303
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,960
 - Oh God.

304
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,680
 - The world's largest penis is only two inches shorter

305
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,920
 than the world's smallest man.

306
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,240
 - Wow.

307
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,480
 (laughing)

308
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,800
 - Are they on the same person?

309
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,640
 - Yeah, no.

310
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,120
 (laughing)

311
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,800
 - This is a man called Roberto Esquivel Cabrera

312
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,760
 who says his penis is 19 inches long.

313
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,520
 - It's not hard to verify that.

314
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,000
 - Well, how long is 19 inches?

315
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,120
 (laughing)

316
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,960
 - You know what I'm saying?

317
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,000
 - It's a short helicopter journey.

318
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,840
 - I'll say that.

319
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,920
 (laughing)

320
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,500
 (upbeat music)

321
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

322
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,480
 and that is Chazinski.

323
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,240
 - My fact this week is that in the 1940s in America,

324
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,200
 if you wanted to play a recording of a band song

325
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
 on the radio, the entire band had to be present

326
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,360
 in the studio while you played it.

327
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,000
 (laughing)

328
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,040
 This is about a musician strike in America

329
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,800
 between 1941 and 1943 about the fact that recorded music

330
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,880
 was being played on the radio.

331
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,920
 And so musicians thought they were gonna go out of business

332
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,040
 because they were no longer being paid to play live music.

333
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,560
 And so they went on strike and one of their demands

334
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,920
 was that every time a recording was played

335
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,760
 so the musicians didn't lose out.

336
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,320
 Every single person involved in making that recording

337
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,080
 had to turn up in the studio and then be paid the fee

338
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,280
 that they would be paid for.

339
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,120
 - That's amazing.

340
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,960
 - That's incredible.

341
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,280
 Why would they then still just play the recording

342
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,640
 and not have the band play?

343
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,000
 - Maybe it's more effort to get your studio set up

344
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,520
 and get the sound all sorted.

345
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,360
 - Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

346
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,920
 - If anyone's listening to this podcast,

347
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,880
 we will be turning up in your house.

348
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,720
 (laughing)

349
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,840
 - I've got, I'm gonna have to meet that 70-year-old man.

350
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,240
 (laughing)

351
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,040
 - I'm gonna have to meet him in the open moment.

352
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,640
 - I'm gonna have to meet the long penis, bloke.

353
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,640
 (laughing)

354
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,400
 - Just speaking of recreations,

355
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,120
 that was another thing that was very popular

356
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,840
 in the 1940s going back to the 20s

357
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,040
 and as late as the '50s, where they would recreate

358
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,600
 sport events because it was too hard to get live recording.

359
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,520
 So if there was a baseball match that was going on,

360
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,880
 while the baseball match was going on,

361
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,520
 they would relay the information

362
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,120
 about how the game was going back to a studio

363
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,520
 and the commentator would commentate

364
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,960
 as if it was live match.

365
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,800
 - Whoa.

366
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,520
 - But he would have a bat that was hanging next

367
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,960
 to his microphone, which he would hit anytime there was a hit

368
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,360
 and they would have crowd noise played in and so on

369
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,400
 and they would commentate live.

370
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,240
 - No.

371
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,080
 - Yeah.

372
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,760
 - It was all a recreation because it was too expensive

373
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,200
 to get the lines to mic up an entire stadium.

374
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,280
 - Did they have all the sports equipment

375
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,240
 hanging in the studio 'cause they must've had to,

376
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,880
 depending on what sport they've had to...

377
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,720
 (laughing)

378
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,280
 - They had the coconuts of the horse racing.

379
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
 (laughing)

380
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,760
 - And one of the sports announcers was Ronald Reagan

381
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,120
 in his early days when he was an actor.

382
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,960
 - Wow.

383
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,120
 - That is so funny.

384
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,960
 - That's really funny.

385
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,800
 - Amazing.

386
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,600
 James, you had a fact about darts, didn't you?

387
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
 - About darts.

388
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,360
 - Yeah, they used to, in the old days,

389
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,440
 they used to have darts on the radio

390
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,240
 and the way they would do it is you'd get a darts player

391
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,040
 and he would throw the darts at a board

392
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,720
 and then the guy would say, tell you what he got

393
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,480
 and then there'd be silence while you were allowed

394
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,520
 to throw your own darts and then you would be like

395
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,360
 playing against the guy.

396
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,640
 - Oh, it's so cool.

397
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
 - Whoa.

398
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,480
 - It's so good.

399
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,560
 - Why don't we do that kind of stuff anymore?

400
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,960
 - Well, I think it's because we have play stations.

401
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,720
 (laughing)

402
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,560
 - It's a very good point.

403
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,400
 - Yeah.

404
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,360
 - So, you know, old recording studios were really cramped

405
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,320
 and also they didn't have very good technology

406
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,560
 to do the recording.

407
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,560
 So, for example, you had maybe one recording horn, right?

408
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,960
 And you had to, which was soaking up all the sound.

409
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,840
 And you had to get the band positioned around it

410
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,640
 in exactly the right way that when they played,

411
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,680
 instruments wouldn't drown each other out.

412
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,520
 - Yeah.

413
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,920
 - And sorry, and by horn you mean something

414
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,960
 that takes in the sound.

415
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,800
 You don't mean that.

416
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,440
 - Sorry, I don't mean a French horn which gives out the sound.

417
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,680
 - Yeah, or a clown car horn as James just brilliantly

418
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,480
 did the sound effect for him.

419
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,800
 - Or the horn.

420
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,800
 - Or being sexually aroused.

421
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,760
 - Yeah, no one had an erection in the through me that.

422
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,080
 - Okay, can you guarantee that?

423
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
 - Can you guarantee that?

424
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,920
 (laughing)

425
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,960
 - So anyway, basically singers had the worst time of all

426
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,000
 because they had to move towards the horn

427
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,480
 when they were singing quietly.

428
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,000
 And when they had a loud bit coming off in the song,

429
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,680
 they had to lean away from the recording horn

430
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,120
 so that they didn't drown everybody out.

431
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
 But in experienced soloists got pushed back and forth

432
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,200
 on a trolley by an assistant.

433
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,520
 (laughing)

434
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,360
 - That's amazing.

435
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,200
 - Wow.

436
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,880
 - How hard is it to lean towards that?

437
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
 (laughing)

438
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,640
 - Probably people who complained about the sound quality

439
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,040
 on this podcast are thinking,

440
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,360
 you guys could do with doing that.

441
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,200
 - Yeah.

442
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,040
 (laughing)

443
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,200
 - Yes, we're all on a trolley at the moment.

444
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,040
 That's the problem.

445
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,400
 (laughing)

446
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,840
 - I'll wheelie chairs with Alex Bell

447
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,760
 running around because she is in an hour.

448
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,080
 (laughing)

449
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,520
 So how long did the strike go on?

450
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,800
 - Yeah, I'll just talk about the strike a little bit more.

451
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,360
 So it went on for two years.

452
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,760
 It's the longest ever strike in Hollywood

453
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,720
 entertainment industry history.

454
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,280
 And some other weird things about it.

455
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,160
 So the guy who led it was this guy called Petrillo.

456
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,720
 One of the things that Petrillo said

457
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,120
 that radio stations would have to do,

458
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,360
 one of the demands he made,

459
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,680
 and I'm not sure if he ever got around to enforcing it,

460
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,440
 was that as soon as any station had played a record,

461
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,600
 they had to immediately destroy that record.

462
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,120
 (laughing)

463
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,520
 - Oh, that's so nice, that's cool.

464
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,480
 - But one thing that happened in the end was,

465
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,640
 it led to the decline of the big bands.

466
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,240
 And then it just became more about the singers

467
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,040
 than the bands.

468
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,880
 - Yeah.

469
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,600
 - So it didn't have the intended effect long-term,

470
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,440
 didn't it?

471
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,040
 - Not at all, almost the opposite, in fact.

472
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,320
 - I find it amazing that this was all going on

473
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,680
 from when did you say 1942 to '44?

474
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,520
 - Yes.

475
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,360
 - During a period of total war around the world.

476
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,400
 This was the main thing that was eating a load of people.

477
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,720
 - Right, it feels weird, the music is like,

478
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,560
 we're going on strike, it's not the time, mate.

479
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,960
 - I thought I'd have a look at some of the songs

480
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,560
 that were in the charts in the '40s.

481
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,040
 So one famous one was 'White Christmas',

482
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,480
 which was number one for 11 weeks in 1942.

483
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,800
 - Is this American or British?

484
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
 - This is the Billbar American chart, yeah.

485
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,800
 So 'White Christmas' was number one for 11 weeks,

486
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,840
 and I was quite surprised, it first got to number one

487
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,560
 in October that year.

488
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,720
 - Oh, really?

489
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,560
 - Yeah, that's kind of interesting.

490
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,800
 - So all this whining about Christmas starting too early,

491
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,600
 actually, it's always done it.

492
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,680
 - And in 1941, so a bit before this strike,

493
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,720
 there was things like Chattanooga Chuchu as number one,

494
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,720
 songs like 'Blue Champagne', my sister and I,

495
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,320
 but on October the 4th of 1941, for eight weeks,

496
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,600
 the number one song in America was 'Piano Concerto'

497
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,960
 number one in 'Be Flat Minor' by Chikovsky.

498
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,560
 That was top of the charts.

499
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,800
 - Wow, I thought he was around where earlier.

500
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,280
 - In 1940s.

501
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
 - You know.

502
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,120
 - But they had to have his body in the studio,

503
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,480
 whenever they played it.

504
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,200
 - Gossily exhuming.

505
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,080
 I should say that I got this fact from a website called Timeline.

506
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,680
 It's Timeline.com, and it's such a good website,

507
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,880
 and it basically tells you in-depth stories sort of from history,

508
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,040
 sort of related to stuff that happens in the news.

509
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,240
 But it's brilliant website, and they got this from a podcast

510
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,040
 I've just discovered called the Pessamist's Archive,

511
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,200
 which is also great, and the idea of this podcast is,

512
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,520
 it's about stuff throughout history,

513
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,400
 people have been terrified of change,

514
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,160
 and they've always said this is going to destroy it.

515
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,040
 - Oh, cool.

516
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,360
 - And they have loads of examples of that.

517
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,040
 So, you know, trains thought buses were going to destroy them.

518
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,280
 Horses and carts campaigned against trains,

519
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,640
 because they thought trains were going to destroy them,

520
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,720
 which they did.

521
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,360
 People thought the radio was really damaging for your ears

522
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,960
 and for kids.

523
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,800
 People thought Walkman should be banned.

524
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,920
 It's so, it's really interesting.

525
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,600
 Pessamist's Archive is, I would recommend.

526
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,520
 - Yeah, I wonder how many bits and new technology

527
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,160
 have just been outright accepted as the right way forward.

528
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,640
 Like airplanes, they thought would never.

529
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,160
 - Yeah, never thought they'd take off.

530
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,640
 (laughing)

531
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,320
 - Do you know they played music on Apollo 11?

532
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,240
 - Really? - Oh, hardly.

533
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,560
 Like in the lift, when you were waiting to take off.

534
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,600
 - While they were going.

535
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
 - While they were going, to keep them calm.

536
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,680
 - That's amazing.

537
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,920
 - Waiting, what, during take off?

538
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,400
 - Apparently. - Wow.

539
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,720
 - Did they also have buttons like in a lift

540
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,280
 and one of them said, "Moon."

541
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
 (laughing)

542
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,120
 - Jupiter.

543
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,960
 - Yeah.

544
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,560
 (upbeat music)

545
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,480
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

546
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,720
 and that is my fact.

547
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,040
 My fact this week is that the British Library

548
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,000
 has a collection of over 60 million newspapers

549
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,520
 and none of them can catch fire.

550
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,840
 You cannot light any of them on fire.

551
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,120
 - Give us a go, I've got a flamethrower.

552
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,280
 (laughing)

553
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,200
 - Are they kept in water?

554
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,760
 - Are they kept in a vacuum?

555
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,760
 - Yeah, no, it's, so the British Library,

556
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,360
 obviously ginormous archive.

557
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,920
 Too big to even fit in one place in London

558
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,800
 in St. Pancras where the British Library is.

559
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,960
 So they have a warehouse out in a place called Boston Spa,

560
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,880
 which is out in the countryside of England.

561
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,640
 And in there, they house all of the newspaper archive.

562
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,520
 This goes back some three centuries,

563
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,440
 and it's a collection of 60 million.

564
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,120
 So what they've done in there is that they've reduced

565
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,640
 the oxygen level to a lower percentage,

566
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,160
 which means it's impossible to light a flame inside

567
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,240
 that you cannot light a match.

568
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,680
 You cannot make your lighter produce a flame.

569
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,600
 Therefore, you are unable to light any of the newspapers

570
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
 in there.

571
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,440
 It's very clever.

572
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,280
 - So cool.

573
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,800
 - Yeah, you can't actually work in that building

574
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,480
 for too long because you go a bit loopy.

575
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,920
 Employees don't actually really need to be down there

576
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,360
 for long because the whole thing is operated by robots.

577
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,720
 - Amazing.

578
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,600
 - Amazing department.

579
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,000
 But when they do go in, they're only allowed in for so long

580
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,960
 because the oxygen level is so low.

581
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,720
 - It's the same amount of oxygen as is in a pressurised

582
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,680
 air cabin in a narrow plane.

583
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,840
 I didn't quite realise how much the oxygen levels

584
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,600
 are reduced when an aircraft cabin is pressurised,

585
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,040
 but they're reduced by 25% just because of the pressurisation.

586
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,200
 And reducing it by 25% ends up with it being the equivalent

587
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,000
 of 15% oxygen concentration at sea level,

588
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,040
 which is about the same.

589
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,240
 And the only reason we don't really notice it

590
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,560
 is because you don't really do anything on a plane.

591
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,920
 But if you try to run a marathon up and down that corridor,

592
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,360
 you'd be in trouble for a number of reasons.

593
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,560
 - A marathon is 26 and a bit miles done.

594
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,800
 - And how long is that?

595
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,520
 - It's a medium length helicopter ride.

596
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,520
 - Yeah.

597
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,720
 - Yeah, and also it's all in the dark this warehouse

598
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,800
 because robots don't need lights.

599
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,040
 - I think it's a bit harsh that these robots have to work

600
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
 in the dark.

601
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,520
 - I know they're robots, but just feels like,

602
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,920
 you know, give them a light, give them...

603
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,560
 - They hate light, they're like vampires.

604
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,560
 - How they meant to read in there?

605
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,040
 - Maybe it's to stop them from reading.

606
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,920
 - That's right, they're going to be doing their job, yeah.

607
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,560
 - If you're a member of the British Library

608
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,560
 and you request one, the robot goes to the shelf,

609
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,280
 it gets down the thing and then it goes to an airlock

610
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,800
 and it passes the thing through the airlock

611
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,360
 to a human on the other side

612
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,320
 so that it preserves the oxygen levels in the room.

613
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,240
 How cool is that?

614
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,960
 - Yeah, and then in most cases,

615
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,200
 they do have a reading room there,

616
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,720
 but a lot of it is ordered from the central London library.

617
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,320
 So it gets in a van and they just bring it over.

618
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,200
 It's bringing these, it's a lot of effort

619
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,040
 to read a newspaper.

620
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,880
 - It's amazing, yeah.

621
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,760
 - Although you can, most of it's digitised, I think.

622
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,160
 So the British Library has pet up

623
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,320
 with the British newspaper archive,

624
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,880
 which I think I can't really mention,

625
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,800
 and they're digitising most of their newspapers on that.

626
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,920
 And I think you're only allowed to extract something

627
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,520
 from this place in Boston Spa

628
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
 if it's not available digitally.

629
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,360
 - Right.

630
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,960
 - A way thing about Boston Spa, it's very small place

631
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,680
 in New Yorkshire, it's got a Wikipedia page,

632
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,520
 very short.

633
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,440
 No word is a mention on its Wikipedia page

634
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,000
 that it constitutes the entire British Library

635
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,360
 newspaper archive.

636
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,520
 I think someone needs to add that in.

637
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,560
 - The first library in Britain, Manchester Free Library,

638
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,600
 which opened in 1852 in Manchester,

639
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,000
 and it had 18,000 bucks.

640
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,880
 And it was so popular in its first week

641
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,760
 that a police officer was assigned to control

642
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,280
 the crowd around the borrowing desk.

643
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,120
 - Wow.

644
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,200
 - And the first librarian was called Edward Edwards.

645
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,440
 (all laughing)

646
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,800
 - I was reading a thing about so libraries keep shutting down,

647
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,600
 and one of the things as well that happens

648
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,480
 in a lot of libraries is if a book doesn't get borrowed,

649
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,440
 then they get taken off the library shelf.

650
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,320
 And what that means is that if the library actually

651
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,440
 wants to keep the book, they end up having to buy the book

652
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,360
 back to put on their shelf, so it costs them a lot of money.

653
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,680
 So there is a library in Orlando

654
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,680
 where they found a guy who checked out 2,361 books

655
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,160
 in the span of nine months.

656
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,400
 And it turned out it was the librarian there

657
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,680
 who created a false library card.

658
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,040
 And the idea was is that now that he borrowed it,

659
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,560
 it was in circulation and you get paid for circulation

660
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,320
 as well it brings in funds.

661
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,360
 But he got in serious trouble because it's very legal

662
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,040
 to fake of being a library borrower.

663
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,840
 - That's a shame, 'cause that is a brilliant idea.

664
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,840
 - Yeah, he was saying that he was saving money technically

665
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,680
 because they would just buy the books back anyway.

666
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,160
 So it was just him trying to be a bit cheeky

667
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,400
 about keeping the books without it, costing the library

668
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,840
 anything, but unfortunately it was seen as illegal.

669
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,280
 And he's now in jail for life.

670
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,120
 - What?

671
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,480
 (all laughing)

672
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,160
 - It's no wonder that is totally plausible

673
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,440
 about the American justice system.

674
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,720
 He was placed on paid suspension.

675
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,560
 - Oh, okay.

676
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,760
 - It does sound a bit like playing your own songs

677
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,360
 on Spotify nonstop.

678
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,680
 - Yes, that kind of thing.

679
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,760
 - That's a good idea.

680
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
 - People do it, don't they?

681
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,600
 - Do they?

682
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,440
 - I mean, there was a band who did that.

683
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,200
 - We spoke about on the podcast ages ago,

684
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,360
 I think they're called Wolfpack or something like that.

685
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,200
 - Good memory.

686
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,560
 - Yeah, what they did was they streamed their album

687
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,200
 and told everyone to stream it because if it went enough,

688
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,280
 so they said when you go to bed,

689
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,200
 just stream it over and over, put on repeat

690
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,800
 but put it on low volume or no volume.

691
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,880
 - Oh, wasn't a silent album, though.

692
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

693
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,360
 Sorry, so the volume thing was nothing.

694
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,920
 Yeah, and they did make a lot of money

695
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,520
 which funded their tour,

696
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,280
 but they got caught out by Spotify.

697
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,360
 - And they're all in prison.

698
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,200
 - Yeah, for life.

699
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,880
 (all laughing)

700
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,320
 - There is an archive called the London Metropolitan Archives

701
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,200
 and they have a whole collection of old London records,

702
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,000
 sort of parish records and city records and things like that.

703
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,080
 But many of them are unbelievably badly burned

704
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,120
 from a fire that happened in 1786.

705
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,320
 And then why haven't I was after the fire?

706
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,320
 They said we should preserve these records just in case.

707
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,280
 And now, 200 and something years later,

708
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,360
 what that's nearly 240 years later,

709
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,720
 they are becoming able to read them.

710
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,560
 - How do you mean?

711
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,440
 - What they've been doing is they've been preserving

712
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,960
 the pages very carefully in boxes

713
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,080
 and then they increase the humidity

714
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,440
 and they sort of puff them out and then they scan them

715
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,720
 and then they can digitally flatten the pages.

716
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,440
 - So you kind of unburn them a little bit.

717
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,280
 Basically, yeah.

718
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,320
 - Hang on, you can unburn something by getting it wet.

719
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,720
 - And no, you increase the humidity.

720
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,560
 I don't know if that is--

721
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,400
 - It is wetness.

722
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
 - Yeah, okay, good point.

723
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,240
 And then, oh yeah, and they use magnets

724
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,400
 to hold the page flat while they're scanning it

725
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,560
 or as flat as they can.

726
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,920
 I mean, it's unbelievably clever,

727
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,120
 but basically it's meaning that they can suddenly read

728
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,960
 all these things.

729
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,000
 - But all that we find out is that Mr. Jones

730
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,840
 lived on high-holbin.

731
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,320
 - There could be clues in here.

732
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,360
 There could be important clues to how we say everything.

733
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,960
 - All I'm saying is it's a lot of effort

734
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,840
 to just learn the list of names

735
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,600
 of people getting married and stuff.

736
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
 - You love reading long lists of information, James.

737
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,640
 This is right up your street.

738
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,000
 - But just the vision of keeping these things for 200 years

739
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,840
 is amazing.

740
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,160
 - Just in case we change our own technology.

741
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,080
 - Yeah, read them again.

742
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,680
 - I kind of think that's incredibly admirable.

743
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,520
 - Yeah.

744
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,360
 - Yeah, that's great.

745
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,360
 - James thinks it's absolutely worthless, but--

746
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,200
 - I like it, yeah.

747
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,920
 (all laughing)

748
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,120
 - I think the money could be spent better elsewhere.

749
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,960
 - Yep.

750
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,920
 - They'll give you more libraries.

751
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,760
 (all laughing)

752
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,120
 - And then take thousands of books out of the better time.

753
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,200
 (all laughing)

754
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,800
 (upbeat music)

755
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,600
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

756
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,040
 and that is James.

757
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,240
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the man who invented

758
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,520
 Muldwine also invented an Aphrodisiac sorbet.

759
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,640
 - Muldwine.

760
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,040
 - Well, yes, he did.

761
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,400
 Well, Amanda, both of those things.

762
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
 (all laughing)

763
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,480
 Muldwine is kind of pretty old, pretty ancient,

764
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,440
 but Blue Van, which is the German version of it,

765
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,200
 has a guy who is often called the inventor of it.

766
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,160
 He's called August Joseph Ludwig von Wachibath.

767
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,400
 (all laughing)

768
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,840
 - Which is a pretty strong name.

769
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,680
 (all laughing)

770
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,680
 And he is the author of the oldest extant recipe.

771
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,400
 So in Germany, they call him the father of Muldwine.

772
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,160
 And quite recently, some historians found some writings

773
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,800
 of his of a recipe for Aphrodisiac sorbet.

774
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,760
 - Mmm.

775
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,520
 - And the sorbet is made with the delicious whites of two eggs,

776
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,440
 the juice of two lemons, two pounds of sugar,

777
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,040
 a few grains of ambergris.

778
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,720
 - Hold on, it's done writing this down.

779
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,120
 (all laughing)

780
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,720
 - It's done just to whip it down his pen

781
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
 and start scrolling notes on his page.

782
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,040
 - So done two eggs.

783
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,880
 - Two eggs.

784
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,400
 - Yeah, two lemons, two pounds of sugar,

785
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,320
 some ambergris, and delicious lozenges

786
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,560
 from the pharmacy four ounces of.

787
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,720
 - Oh, great.

788
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
 - It's just strepsils.

789
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,080
 - But we don't know what's in the lozenges.

790
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,240
 That's a problem, you see.

791
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,800
 That might be the magic ingredient.

792
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,120
 And all we've said is one pound of sugar per egg.

793
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,680
 I mean, that's quite a sugary recipe.

794
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,240
 - But also it has an incredibly expensive recipe in there

795
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,640
 because it's using ambergris in there.

796
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,520
 - Yeah, which you start at least slipped in,

797
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,920
 like just some sugars and milk, some solid diamond,

798
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,400
 and it's gonna be a flower.

799
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,720
 - So we've told on it.

800
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,560
 - Yeah.

801
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
 - But if you don't have that,

802
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,600
 you can use the glandulous secretions of a musk rat.

803
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,440
 - Oh good.

804
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,280
 (all laughing)

805
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,440
 - Well, we got a lot of that.

806
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,560
 (all laughing)

807
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,240
 No, what I was writing down was he's called

808
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,480
 the father of Muldwine.

809
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
 I was wondering if that he was called that

810
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,200
 because that's just way easier to say than his actual name.

811
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,840
 (all laughing)

812
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,600
 - Oh, Gustjo's if Ludwig Wagner-Vacabar.

813
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,640
 What's hard about that?

814
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,480
 - Oh, you're right.

815
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,320
 I'm afraid.

816
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,720
 - He seemed, it's a shame.

817
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,240
 A lot of the articles on him online,

818
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,640
 there's a lot of results when he put his name in,

819
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,840
 but they're all in German.

820
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,080
 And I really want to read more about this guy,

821
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,160
 but I didn't have time today.

822
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,640
 - You didn't have time to learn German.

823
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,440
 (all laughing)

824
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,160
 - When are you gonna get that done over the weekend?

825
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,000
 - Yeah, I'll say.

826
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,480
 - Yeah.

827
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,160
 He's, as a wild claim, isn't it?

828
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,840
 This father of Muldwine because people have been drinking.

829
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,000
 He's been up wine and alcoholic drinks

830
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 since the dawn of time.

831
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,200
 So I think peeps talks about drinking it.

832
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,360
 - Right.

833
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,040
 - And- - The ancient Greeks as well.

834
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,360
 - The ancient Greeks drinking it.

835
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,040
 - Even before the time of Samuel Peep.

836
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,160
 (all laughing)

837
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,440
 - Well, you said dawn of time,

838
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,680
 which is, I think, a bit far back.

839
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,080
 - So I said, I said from when we've been drinking-

840
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,920
 - You said the dawn of time.

841
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,760
 - I said the dawn of time.

842
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,600
 - Yeah, the dawn of time.

843
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,160
 - The dinosaurs actually had a very,

844
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,720
 the first thing's made in the Big Bang.

845
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,560
 - Yeah.

846
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,200
 - It was a hydrogen helium and Muldwine.

847
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
 - And gloves.

848
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,600
 (all laughing)

849
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,760
 - Do you know how they used to heat it?

850
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,320
 And I think they still do heat it.

851
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,160
 - Over a flame?

852
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
 No. - No.

853
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,000
 - Not over a flame.

854
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,440
 - Oh, in a microwave.

855
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,280
 - Yeah, that's right.

856
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
 That's why Samuel peeps did it.

857
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,480
 - In some dung.

858
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,640
 - Oh, peeps things up.

859
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,400
 - No, maybe they, maybe some of them did that.

860
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,200
 - Cutting open the body of a horse

861
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,240
 and putting it in there.

862
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,200
 - And pouring it into there

863
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,080
 and then you drink it from the orifice.

864
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,120
 - By taking the latent heat of the early universe.

865
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,240
 (all laughing)

866
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,560
 - It's just the Big Bang was a hot time.

867
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,360
 It was actually, it was a drink question.

868
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,000
 (all laughing)

869
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,840
 - It's still a war, we're calling that.

870
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,120
 (all laughing)

871
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,320
 - All Muldwine gets here from comments.

872
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,880
 No, well, peeps records how they would get a polka

873
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,000
 really, really hot over the fire.

874
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
 So you'd hold a polka over the fire

875
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,640
 and then you'd have a huge vat of beer,

876
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,960
 which I often was in those days, or wine.

877
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,760
 And then you'd stir it with a hot polka.

878
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,960
 So you'd stir it in a barrel of beer with a polka.

879
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
 - That's really clever.

880
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,800
 - Yeah.

881
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,640
 - That's cool.

882
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,480
 - Does that work?

883
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,760
 - Really well, or would work.

884
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,600
 - I think it did seem to be.

885
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,440
 - Would work, of course.

886
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,520
 - So like if I wanted to make a tea,

887
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
 but I didn't have a...

888
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,640
 - If you had a cup, you didn't have a kettle,

889
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,120
 but you didn't have a red hot polka.

890
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,280
 (all laughing)

891
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,120
 - Yeah, would that work?

892
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,960
 - I guess.

893
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,320
 - Could you get the water boiling hot?

894
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,120
 - Yeah, you could, I suppose.

895
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,960
 - Yeah, maybe.

896
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,080
 - 'Cause you know, you need it quite hot

897
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,800
 so you make a really good cup of tea.

898
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,640
 - Yeah.

899
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,880
 - But I mean, the cup's not that big, is it?

900
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,160
 So I imagine the mould wine, that's a pot.

901
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,440
 - Yeah, you don't want to damage the cup

902
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,760
 that you're making a tea, and either,

903
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,880
 and if you're wiggling around a red hot polka net,

904
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,720
 you might.

905
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,040
 (all laughing)

906
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,080
 So the Victorian television of mould wine,

907
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,960
 which they called Smoking Bishop.

908
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,800
 - That's a thing.

909
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,640
 - Yeah, that was a thing.

910
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,680
 It was port, it was port fruit and spices,

911
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,360
 but they had also Smoking Archbishop,

912
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,880
 which was with Claret and Smoking Pope.

913
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,440
 And in a Christmas carol,

914
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,680
 screwed promises Bob Cratchett, some Smoking Bishop.

915
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,520
 - We'll see.

916
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,360
 - Yeah.

917
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,920
 You could have quite a fun night, if you were a bishop,

918
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,040
 with some Smoking Bishop,

919
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,080
 and then you could eat some Stinking Bishop, the cheese.

920
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,920
 - Yeah.

921
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,760
 - Oh yeah.

922
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,720
 - If there are any bishops listening,

923
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,920
 who want to know how to party.

924
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,440
 (all laughing)

925
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,280
 - But wait, it wasn't just bishops who were allowed

926
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,120
 to drink it, right?

927
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,440
 - No, it was everyone who was allowed to drink it.

928
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,280
 It was just a name.

929
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,360
 - So you don't have to be a bishop who knows how to party.

930
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,800
 You can be anyone who knows how to party.

931
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
 - That's true, yeah.

932
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,720
 - Could we do some Aprodisiac stuff?

933
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,560
 - Yeah.

934
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,400
 - Okay, no, sorry.

935
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,920
 - No, what I was going to say is,

936
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,680
 they did an experiment with some rats,

937
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,640
 where they took out one of the ingredients,

938
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,960
 famigree switches, Ambrian.

939
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,280
 So it's like a type of compound,

940
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,080
 and they gave it to the rats,

941
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,360
 and it produced an increase of a no genital

942
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,520
 investigatory behavior.

943
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,440
 - So let's unpack that a second.

944
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,440
 A no genital investigatory.

945
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,400
 Okay, got it, yeah, yeah.

946
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,200
 So I think all those words are self, you know?

947
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,480
 - Self-explanatory, yeah, yeah.

948
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,320
 - Really?

949
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,160
 - What Friday night is complete without...

950
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,400
 (laughing)

951
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,440
 - It's awesome, eight over the bishop party.

952
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,160
 (laughing)

953
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,760
 - Ain't no genital investigatory behavior.

954
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,960
 - Absolutely, yeah.

955
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,800
 - Only works in rats though, apparently.

956
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,120
 - Well, we don't know.

957
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,120
 I think we need to do the investigation for humans.

958
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,560
 - Oh god, I don't think we need to.

959
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,640
 I think other people need to.

960
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,800
 - It only works really in male rats as well.

961
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,880
 - The female rats aren't that interested.

962
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
 - Right.

963
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,920
 - Ain't no genital eat or otherwise.

964
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,120
 - About that kind of thing.

965
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,240
 - Hey, I'm just wondering if you're interested in me,

966
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,840
 Aino genital eat or otherwise.

967
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,340
 (laughing)

968
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,960
 - It's a good word, isn't it?

969
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,520
 - Yeah.

970
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,000
 - You're being really Aino genital about this mark.

971
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,840
 (laughing)

972
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,480
 - Is it Aino with one end?

973
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,600
 - Yeah. - I know, yeah.

974
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,520
 - Aino, right, I've never actually seen that.

975
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,640
 - You've shown to that before?

976
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,800
 - No. - No.

977
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,640
 - It's where volcano is made up of two words.

978
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,960
 Folk and Aino.

979
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
 - Right, I don't know that.

980
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,600
 - Because people thought it was vulcan, the god.

981
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,440
 Here's Aino's.

982
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,280
 - Yeah, that's right.

983
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,600
 - Shitting fire into the sky.

984
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,840
 (laughing)

985
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,680
 - Yeah.

986
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,440
 - Gwyneth Poucho sells Afridisiacs.

987
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,120
 And this is a way of talking about her website,

988
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,280
 which I know this is very low-brow for us

989
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,560
 to go into this subject, but it's unbelievable.

990
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,000
 Her website called goop.com, which she sells extraordinary

991
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,840
 things on there.

992
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,120
 - Like what Anna, and for how much?

993
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,440
 (laughing)

994
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,920
 - And if you're listening this week's episode

995
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,160
 of No Stuff Things A Fish, it's brought to you by Goop.

996
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,000
 For all your Aino genital leads.

997
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,560
 - So for this Aino genital need, you can get sex bark,

998
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,200
 which is sex bark.

999
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,040
 - Yeah, sex bark.

1000
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,640
 - Look at what it's worth and it's sex bites.

1001
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,640
 (laughing)

1002
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,160
 - Yeah, it's like chocolate, except then you have to add

1003
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,200
 something called Hushuwo to it, which is sex dust.

1004
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,640
 And I don't, it doesn't really specify where you get that.

1005
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,880
 - It sounds to me like she's just taking objects

1006
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,160
 and putting the word sex in front of them.

1007
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,240
 - That's the sex cleaner being.

1008
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,080
 (laughing)

1009
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,480
 - There's a lot of sex dust on top of the sex piano.

1010
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,960
 (laughing)

1011
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,800
 - But she also sells Jade eggs, do you know what these are?

1012
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,320
 - Are they made out of Jade for the material?

1013
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,440
 - I believe they are, they claim to be.

1014
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,000
 They're also called Yoni eggs and they're advertised

1015
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,560
 on goop.com as once strictly guarded secret

1016
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,720
 of Chinese concubines and royalty and antiquity.

1017
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,400
 And they harness the power of energy, crystal healing

1018
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,040
 and a cagal-like physical practice.

1019
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,920
 So it's all very scientifically sound.

1020
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,640
 - And what you do is you put them into your vagina

1021
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,520
 and you sit there with one in for a while

1022
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,720
 and it makes you feel better.

1023
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,400
 - Strange that they didn't call them sex Jade eggs, isn't it?

1024
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,720
 (laughing)

1025
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,640
 - 'Cause you hadn't developed that particular marketing twist yet.

1026
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,320
 - And then you have to pass them again, presumably.

1027
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,240
 - You pass them out again, yeah, of the same.

1028
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
 - Wow, clocking.

1029
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,440
 (laughing)

1030
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,000
 - Wow.

1031
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,280
 - That's, yeah, wow, that's, yeah, cool.

1032
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,120
 - That's only you.

1033
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,160
 - I mean, if it's consenting adults.

1034
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,320
 - Nothing criminal about it.

1035
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,160
 - No, no.

1036
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,600
 - Gailan said that any food which made you flatulence

1037
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,360
 was an aphrodisiac.

1038
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,200
 Any warm, moist and windy foods were ones that produced lust.

1039
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,120
 - And did he do well?

1040
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,440
 (laughing)

1041
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,200
 - This is Tinder for a couple of times.

1042
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,440
 (laughing)

1043
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,120
 Looking for a guy who,

1044
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,840
 - Saferon can help you have a sustained erection they found.

1045
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,680
 - Wow.

1046
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,560
 - There was a 2009 study in Iran and the 20 male patients

1047
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,640
 were given Saferon for 10 days

1048
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,320
 and they showed a statistically significant improvement

1049
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,200
 in apparently their tip rigidity and tip tumessence

1050
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,200
 as well as base rigidity and base tumessence.

1051
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,520
 But no word on the middle.

1052
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,360
 - I got it.

1053
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,680
 (laughing)

1054
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,400
 - So it's a bit like, you know, the slinky dog

1055
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,240
 and toy story?

1056
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,080
 (laughing)

1057
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,920
 - God.

1058
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,480
 (laughing)

1059
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,440
 - I was reading about an aphrodisiac.

1060
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,640
 This is the title of the story.

1061
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,160
 Can a rare Hawaiian mushroom really give women

1062
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,800
 a spontaneous orgasm?

1063
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,920
 And this was a 15 year old study.

1064
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,760
 - Not by him.

1065
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,600
 (laughing)

1066
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,440
 - Sorry.

1067
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,280
 (laughing)

1068
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,120
 - Let me start that again.

1069
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,000
 - May steady continue in the rare mushroom.

1070
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,840
 (laughing)

1071
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,800
 - Same personation of a 15 year old.

1072
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,880
 - Well, I sounded like.

1073
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,720
 (laughing)

1074
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,080
 - Well, you had some 41.

1075
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
 Now, when you were 15,

1076
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,920
 (laughing)

1077
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,760
 - I mean, the biggest podcast reveal.

1078
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,800
 (laughing)

1079
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,600
 Andy's grunge part.

1080
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,680
 (laughing)

1081
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,160
 - This is a study that was done in 2001.

1082
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,320
 And these two medical students published a report

1083
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,400
 in the International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms.

1084
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,560
 And they did this study on 36 volunteers,

1085
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,880
 both male and female.

1086
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,280
 And they found that this mushroom,

1087
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,520
 this Hawaiian mushroom, was causing spontaneous orgasm

1088
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,160
 in a bunch of the women, a part of the study group.

1089
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,800
 And so, everyone says it's not a big enough study group

1090
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,960
 in order for that to be a truth.

1091
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,480
 So it's a very dubious thing.

1092
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,240
 And the article I was reading saying,

1093
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,240
 actually no, it can't give you spontaneous orgasm.

1094
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,800
 What I was wondering though, was if we thought that it did,

1095
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,160
 I wonder if there's a sort of placebo effect with it.

1096
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,440
 Therefore, could you placebo an orgasm?

1097
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,880
 - Well, almost all afridiziax and things

1098
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,320
 that are sort of an afridiziax trade on the placebo effect.

1099
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
 - And do they?

1100
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,000
 Oh, okay.

1101
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,080
 So oysters and the actual evidence for them changing chemicals

1102
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,000
 in your body to make you more interested in sex is pretty slim.

1103
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 - Yeah, although they don't claim spontaneous orgasms

1104
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,320
 to be fair, that's another...

1105
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,720
 I think when you have an afridiziax,

1106
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,760
 you also need to have some other sexual stimulation.

1107
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,680
 You don't just eat ten oysters and stand,

1108
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,640
 they're going, "Why haven't I orgasm?"

1109
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,040
 (laughing)

1110
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,120
 - I don't know, darling, keep trying.

1111
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,640
 I'm doing the crossword.

1112
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,760
 (laughing)

1113
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,340
 (upbeat music)

1114
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,520
 - Okay, that's it.

1115
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,640
 That is all of our facts.

1116
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,040

 (laughing)

1121
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
