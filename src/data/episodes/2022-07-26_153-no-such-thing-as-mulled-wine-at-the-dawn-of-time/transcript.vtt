WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 - Hey everyone, before we begin this week's show,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.320
 we just have a quick request.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.120
 We are doing a live show on the 28th of February.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.960
 It's our third birthday party.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.480
 And we were hoping that we could ask you

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.760
 to submit a bunch of questions, interesting thoughts,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.440
 ideas, whatever it is you want for us to read out on stage.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.640
 - Yeah, make them funny, make them snappy,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.120
 make them cool, make them worthy of being aired,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.920
 and they will be podcast at qi.com,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.240
 email us your questions.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.880
 You could even tweet it to us as well

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.960
 on our @qipodcast account.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.000
 Please do before this coming Tuesday.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.840
 And if we see it and it's short enough

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.840
 and funny enough and intelligent enough,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.920
 we will read it on stage.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.240
 Okay, on with the show.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.640
 (blues music)

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.880
 - Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.320
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.920
 from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.080
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.560
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.960
 and Anna Chazinski.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.280
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.080
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.640
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.680
 Starting with you, Andy Murray.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.720
 - My fact this week is that the smallest football league

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.120
 in the world consists of two teams

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.840
 who play each other 22 times every season.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 - Where is it?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.240
 - It's on the Isles of Silly,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.320
 which is just off Cornwall,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.160
 which is the southwest tip of Britain

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.120
 for anyone who's not from Britain listening.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.480
 And they're called the Woolpack Wanderers

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.960
 and the Garrison Gunners.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.560
 And they used to be called the Rangers and the Rovers

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.760
 and then they thought that was a bit boring

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.120
 so they could make it more interesting.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.720
 - And it's weird that they did that

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.800
 because you can only really call yourself the Gunners

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.520
 if you've got a historical connection

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.080
 to like an Arsenal's case and armaments factory

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.360
 and the Wanderers.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.480
 People are called that when they don't have a permanent stadium

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.760
 which I assume they always have

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.480
 because there aren't any other teams in this place.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.320
 - Yes.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.560
 - So their names are lies.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.680
 - I mean, they've been playing since World War I, I believe.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.200
 - Well, they must be knackered.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.400
 (laughing)

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.320
 They've got, he forgot to match how long the matches are.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.000
 Half-time's coming up next year.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.200
 No, so maybe there is a connection potentially for the Gunners.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.840
 - Well, they're called the Garrison Gunners

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.040
 so is it not to do with some kind of Garrison?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.120
 - Yeah, I'm sure they're the Garrison on the Elves of Cili.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.680
 I don't know, I don't have the facts.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.520
 - Do you know what I really like?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.240
 They play on the same football pitch every time

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.440
 but they swap for being a home and a way team

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.440
 so they're changing rooms.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.480
 They change to say a way for the way team that way

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.360
 and then home on the next match.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.720
 - But that means they're the exact opposite

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.040
 of what you would expect a Wanderers team to be then.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.880
 - It's true.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.400
 - Because not only have they always played on the same pitch

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.520
 they even play all their away games on the same pitch as well.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.760
 (laughing)

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.600
 - It's very true.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.360
 - The Wikipedia on them is unbelievably cautious.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.400
 It says, "The league is reportedly the smallest in the world."

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.000
 I do not believe there's a one team league anywhere in the world.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.360
 - You know how they pick the teams?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.960
 They pick them by every year, a few weeks before the season,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.280
 the captains of the two teams.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.480
 They meet up in the pub and they basically, they take turns.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.480
 - No. - Yes.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.480
 - Oh my god. - Oh my god.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.280
 So they try and make it so the teams

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.480
 are roughly equal in ability.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.920
 - I was reading an interview with them though

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.880
 and they don't seem to even know which team they play for.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.200
 One of them was us.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.800
 One of them was us whose team he was on and he said,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.920
 "Oh, I'm wearing red, which team is that?"

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.440
 (laughing)

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.240
 - Just the Isle of Silly for the people overseas

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.120
 who haven't heard of it, it's incredibly small

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.000
 and it's population size as of 2001.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.440
 That's the last update I've seen that I could find

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.160
 2,153 people.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.360
 So it's a very tiny population

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.920
 but they've worked out that 32% of the population participate

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.080
 at least three times a week in 30 minutes more sport,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.160
 way greater than any other bit of Britain.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.960
 - But then 1% of the population are in one of these football teams

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.800
 presumably.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.280
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.120
 - Yeah, that's really good.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.120
 That must be the highest anywhere.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.640
 - Highest proportion of football players anywhere.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.480
 - Yeah.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.320
 - Professionals.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.840
 - And also on their teams, I really like this,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.840
 there's a huge gap of the age bracket of who plays

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.440
 where they're majorotively missing 16 to 25 year olds

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.880
 and the reason is because the schools in the Isle of Silly

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.200
 only go up to six form.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.240
 So when you're 16, you have to go to the mainland

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.600
 to finish off your schooling.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.640
 And so they end up just staying on the mainland

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.560
 when they come over rather than going back.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.840
 - Basically on holiday, there is a kid.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.240
 It's so lovely, amazing bird watching.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.080
 - Oh really?

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.080
 - Amazing birds.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.240
 - Did you ever see the Silly Bee?

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.080
 (laughing)

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.920
 - No.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.000
 - Silly Bee is, yeah, it's a kind of bee

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 that you find on the Silly Islands.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.840
 - That's great.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.720
 - Is it good even in a Silly Bee?

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.680
 (laughing)

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.400
 - It never collects any pollen.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.600
 It only collects twiglets and things like that.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.280
 It's such a Silly Bee.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.840
 - It just collects anecdotes, yeah.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.320
 (laughing)

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.520
 - Yeah, it's actually quite endangered,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.880
 but they, someone took a photo of one in 2012

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.520
 because people thought they might have even got extinct.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.760
 So that was big news in the Silly Islands.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.040
 - You did a really good job of transferring really quickly

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.880
 from a laughter voice to the very solemn,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.280
 it's quite endangered voice.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.560
 - Quite endangered.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.440
 There's a serious side to the Silly Bee.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.320
 (laughing)

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.840
 - Have you seen the Silly Police Force

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.960
 is quite famous around the world?

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.800
 - Oh yeah, sorry, now everything sounds like Silly.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.400
 It's that they've only got two officers

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.880
 and I think they're one thing saying

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.320
 they're only posted for a certain number of years

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.440
 so they don't get too close to the local population.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.680
 - They are, it's five years.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.520
 - Five years, yeah.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.880
 - Well, I know, but the last sergeant,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.240
 he wrote the thing saying he'd been there for seven years.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.320
 So I don't know.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.320
 - Maybe no one liked it.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.800
 (laughing)

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.560
 - He had to borrow a child's bike once

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.520
 to pursue a drunk driver.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.880
 - And this is a Silly policeman

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.720
 you're talking about.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.320
 - He's a Silly policeman.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.680
 - I think it's a very good policeman,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.000
 but one of the other cases that he dealt with was,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.040
 and I'm quoting here,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.320
 a shed door was forced open at a football club,

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.680
 but one of the only clues available was a fried egg.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.160
 - This is fried egg on the ground next to the shed.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.360
 - Is there any resolution to that story?

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.360
 Do we know the case of the fried egg?

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.160
 - If there is, I don't have it.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.000
 - Sorry.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.040
 - And escape chicken.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.600
 (laughing)

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.200
 - No, they don't fry their eggs today.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.360
 That's what he says.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.920
 (laughing)

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.720
 - I was reading, so the teams actually do team up as well

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.000
 to play against the mainland.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.200
 There's a team.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.400
 - Which is a massively uneven contest to be fair.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.240
 (laughing)

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.760
 - So they play the England football team,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.560
 they play, who are they called?

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.720
 - It's dynamo chuff in hands and hands.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.160
 - Yeah, and so they play them together.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.520
 And they have a trophy that they use,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.800
 the Lioness Cup.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.160
 And the Lioness Cup trophy is the smallest trophy in the world.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.480
 - In size, you mean?

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.120
 - Yeah, in size, it's very tiny.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.440
 I think it's in the FIFA museum, isn't it?

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.240
 - They took it for the FIFA museum for a year.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.160
 It's six millimeters tall.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.000
 - Whoa.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.840
 - That's very sweet.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.240
 - That's smaller than a silly bee.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.960
 (laughing)

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.400
 - It was made by a carpenter from dynamo truffs and his wife.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.480
 I think they're artists.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.040
 - So is it made out of wood then?

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.160
 - I think it's made of wood and metal.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.760
 You know, the oldest player in the football league retired

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.320
 last year at the age of 70.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.840
 - 70, but I read the way that they play.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.760
 It doesn't sound overly competitive.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.640
 In that, there's a journalist who is gonna play

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.600
 for the sake of writing an article

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.240
 and he just kept missing every time

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.120
 and he missed it like 16 times.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.880
 But every time he missed it, everyone was really encouraging

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.440
 and apparently that's the whole thing it's just about.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.240
 So this 70 year old guy, I bet he's shit.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.360
 But it doesn't matter, 'cause they're really listening

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.680
 to this podcast.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.520
 He didn't really say it.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.280
 Looking at an empty six millimeter high spot

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.760
 on his mantel piece.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.320
 I think, no, I've only been better.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.080
 (laughing)

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.320
 It's like a bee.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.400
 - Well, all of the haters is 70 play against, you know,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.680
 ages, that don't include 16 to 20 pie,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.360
 but everything that happens, he might be outplayed for his age.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.200
 Maybe not.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.240
 - The silly isles signed a piece treaty

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.320
 with the Netherlands a few years ago to end formally

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.600
 the 335 years war between the two countries.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.440
 - Oh wow.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.960
 - Even though no one actually knows

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.400
 if the 335 years war ever actually happened.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.240
 - Whoa.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.160
 - So there have been rumors since the 1600s.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.080
 The war was declared between the Netherlands

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.000
 and the silly isles and then other people say

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.120
 it can't even have been declared,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.200
 'cause they're not a nation and no one really knows,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.000
 but the sources go back that far.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.120
 And eventually, at some point, the silly isles

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.920
 wrote to the Netherlands and said,

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.080
 look, can we just acknowledge

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.440
 that there's never been a war between us?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.920
 And the Netherlands said we can't actually verify that.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.440
 I think we're probably still at war.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.600
 So the silly isles said, okay, well, can we end the war piece?

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.560
 (laughing)

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.480
 And so yeah, they visited each other

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.560
 and they signed a treaty saying we're at peace.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.400
 - It was amazing.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.480
 The ambassador came over in a helicopter

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.760
 with a scroll to sign the piece.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.560
 - But the admiral who declared war on the silly isles,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.600
 the Dutch one was called Trump.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.440
 - Oh, I see.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.280
 - 10 Trump.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.120
 - I know.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.080
 So we don't know if he's any relation.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.560
 - That's a long helicopter ride, isn't it?

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.400
 - 300 years.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.040
 (laughing)

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.320
 - We said that the ambassador got there by helicopter.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.480
 - It will have been from the mainland UK, yes.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.320
 - The mainland UK.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.160
 - You have to, yeah.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.760
 - No, I was just only thinking, can you go over the channel

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.360
 and how far can you go on a helicopter?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.480
 - You can go over the channel.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.000
 - How bad do you think helicopters are?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.400
 - Do you think you just threw them

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.880
 and then they go as far as you can toss it?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.040
 - No, they just don't look like they have much fuel.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.960
 - They could go about 300 miles,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.720
 like just a small helicopter and then the big ones could go.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.960
 - How far's that?

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.080
 - You just asked how far 300 miles is.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.600
 - So you know a mile, yeah.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.080
 It's 300 of those.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.040
 - We can't reduce it further than that.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.200
 (laughing)

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.960
 And the Netherlands is very close.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.720
 - You used to always get a helicopter over.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.720
 I think they've cancelled it now,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.880
 but when I used to go as a kid,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.720
 it was the only way that you'd go over

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.200
 except for the ferry crossing.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.800
 - I think they might be gonna bring it back.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.640
 - Oh really?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.480
 - Either they're gonna bring it back

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.720
 or just have brought it back.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.480
 Or they said they were going to and haven't done it.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.480
 (laughing)

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.080
 - One of those kind of options there.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.880
 - Great facts from James Ollion.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.400
 (laughing)

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.760
 - I do have a fact about the longest

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.000
 and shortest things in the world,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.800
 'cause there's about the world's smallest league of football.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.640
 - Yep.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.480
 - But I'm afraid it's about the world's largest penis.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.960
 - Oh God.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.680
 - The world's largest penis is only two inches shorter

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.920
 than the world's smallest man.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.240
 - Wow.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.480
 (laughing)

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.800
 - Are they on the same person?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.640
 - Yeah, no.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.120
 (laughing)

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.800
 - This is a man called Roberto Esquivel Cabrera

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.760
 who says his penis is 19 inches long.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.520
 - It's not hard to verify that.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.000
 - Well, how long is 19 inches?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.120
 (laughing)

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.960
 - You know what I'm saying?

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.000
 - It's a short helicopter journey.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.840
 - I'll say that.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.920
 (laughing)

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.500
 (upbeat music)

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.480
 and that is Chazinski.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.240
 - My fact this week is that in the 1940s in America,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.200
 if you wanted to play a recording of a band song

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.320
 on the radio, the entire band had to be present

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.360
 in the studio while you played it.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.000
 (laughing)

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.040
 This is about a musician strike in America

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.800
 between 1941 and 1943 about the fact that recorded music

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.880
 was being played on the radio.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.920
 And so musicians thought they were gonna go out of business

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.040
 because they were no longer being paid to play live music.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.560
 And so they went on strike and one of their demands

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.920
 was that every time a recording was played

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.760
 so the musicians didn't lose out.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.320
 Every single person involved in making that recording

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.080
 had to turn up in the studio and then be paid the fee

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.280
 that they would be paid for.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.120
 - That's amazing.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.960
 - That's incredible.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.280
 Why would they then still just play the recording

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.640
 and not have the band play?

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.000
 - Maybe it's more effort to get your studio set up

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.520
 and get the sound all sorted.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.360
 - Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.920
 - If anyone's listening to this podcast,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.880
 we will be turning up in your house.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.720
 (laughing)

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.840
 - I've got, I'm gonna have to meet that 70-year-old man.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.240
 (laughing)

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.040
 - I'm gonna have to meet him in the open moment.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.640
 - I'm gonna have to meet the long penis, bloke.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.640
 (laughing)

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.400
 - Just speaking of recreations,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.120
 that was another thing that was very popular

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.840
 in the 1940s going back to the 20s

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.040
 and as late as the '50s, where they would recreate

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.600
 sport events because it was too hard to get live recording.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.520
 So if there was a baseball match that was going on,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.880
 while the baseball match was going on,

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.520
 they would relay the information

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.120
 about how the game was going back to a studio

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.520
 and the commentator would commentate

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.960
 as if it was live match.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.800
 - Whoa.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.520
 - But he would have a bat that was hanging next

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.960
 to his microphone, which he would hit anytime there was a hit

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.360
 and they would have crowd noise played in and so on

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.400
 and they would commentate live.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.240
 - No.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.080
 - Yeah.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.760
 - It was all a recreation because it was too expensive

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.200
 to get the lines to mic up an entire stadium.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.280
 - Did they have all the sports equipment

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.240
 hanging in the studio 'cause they must've had to,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.880
 depending on what sport they've had to...

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.720
 (laughing)

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.280
 - They had the coconuts of the horse racing.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.280
 (laughing)

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.760
 - And one of the sports announcers was Ronald Reagan

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.120
 in his early days when he was an actor.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.960
 - Wow.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.120
 - That is so funny.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:14.960
 - That's really funny.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.800
 - Amazing.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.600
 James, you had a fact about darts, didn't you?

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600
 - About darts.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.360
 - Yeah, they used to, in the old days,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.440
 they used to have darts on the radio

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.240
 and the way they would do it is you'd get a darts player

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.040
 and he would throw the darts at a board

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.720
 and then the guy would say, tell you what he got

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.480
 and then there'd be silence while you were allowed

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.520
 to throw your own darts and then you would be like

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.360
 playing against the guy.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.640
 - Oh, it's so cool.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.640
 - Whoa.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.480
 - It's so good.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.560
 - Why don't we do that kind of stuff anymore?

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.960
 - Well, I think it's because we have play stations.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.720
 (laughing)

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.560
 - It's a very good point.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.400
 - Yeah.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.360
 - So, you know, old recording studios were really cramped

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.320
 and also they didn't have very good technology

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.560
 to do the recording.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.560
 So, for example, you had maybe one recording horn, right?

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.960
 And you had to, which was soaking up all the sound.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.840
 And you had to get the band positioned around it

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.640
 in exactly the right way that when they played,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.680
 instruments wouldn't drown each other out.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.520
 - Yeah.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.920
 - And sorry, and by horn you mean something

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.960
 that takes in the sound.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.800
 You don't mean that.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.440
 - Sorry, I don't mean a French horn which gives out the sound.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.680
 - Yeah, or a clown car horn as James just brilliantly

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.480
 did the sound effect for him.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.800
 - Or the horn.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.800
 - Or being sexually aroused.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.760
 - Yeah, no one had an erection in the through me that.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.080
 - Okay, can you guarantee that?

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.080
 - Can you guarantee that?

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.920
 (laughing)

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.960
 - So anyway, basically singers had the worst time of all

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.000
 because they had to move towards the horn

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.480
 when they were singing quietly.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.000
 And when they had a loud bit coming off in the song,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.680
 they had to lean away from the recording horn

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.120
 so that they didn't drown everybody out.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.440
 But in experienced soloists got pushed back and forth

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.200
 on a trolley by an assistant.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.520
 (laughing)

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.360
 - That's amazing.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.200
 - Wow.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.880
 - How hard is it to lean towards that?

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.880
 (laughing)

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.640
 - Probably people who complained about the sound quality

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.040
 on this podcast are thinking,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.360
 you guys could do with doing that.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.200
 - Yeah.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.040
 (laughing)

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.200
 - Yes, we're all on a trolley at the moment.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.040
 That's the problem.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.400
 (laughing)

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.840
 - I'll wheelie chairs with Alex Bell

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.760
 running around because she is in an hour.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.080
 (laughing)

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.520
 So how long did the strike go on?

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.800
 - Yeah, I'll just talk about the strike a little bit more.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.360
 So it went on for two years.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.760
 It's the longest ever strike in Hollywood

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.720
 entertainment industry history.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.280
 And some other weird things about it.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.160
 So the guy who led it was this guy called Petrillo.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.720
 One of the things that Petrillo said

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.120
 that radio stations would have to do,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.360
 one of the demands he made,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.680
 and I'm not sure if he ever got around to enforcing it,

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.440
 was that as soon as any station had played a record,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.600
 they had to immediately destroy that record.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.120
 (laughing)

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.520
 - Oh, that's so nice, that's cool.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.480
 - But one thing that happened in the end was,

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.640
 it led to the decline of the big bands.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.240
 And then it just became more about the singers

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.040
 than the bands.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:53.880
 - Yeah.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.600
 - So it didn't have the intended effect long-term,

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.440
 didn't it?

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.040
 - Not at all, almost the opposite, in fact.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.320
 - I find it amazing that this was all going on

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.680
 from when did you say 1942 to '44?

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.520
 - Yes.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.360
 - During a period of total war around the world.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.400
 This was the main thing that was eating a load of people.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.720
 - Right, it feels weird, the music is like,

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.560
 we're going on strike, it's not the time, mate.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.960
 - I thought I'd have a look at some of the songs

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.560
 that were in the charts in the '40s.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.040
 So one famous one was 'White Christmas',

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.480
 which was number one for 11 weeks in 1942.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.800
 - Is this American or British?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.720
 - This is the Billbar American chart, yeah.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.800
 So 'White Christmas' was number one for 11 weeks,

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.840
 and I was quite surprised, it first got to number one

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.560
 in October that year.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.720
 - Oh, really?

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.560
 - Yeah, that's kind of interesting.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.800
 - So all this whining about Christmas starting too early,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.600
 actually, it's always done it.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.680
 - And in 1941, so a bit before this strike,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.720
 there was things like Chattanooga Chuchu as number one,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.720
 songs like 'Blue Champagne', my sister and I,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.320
 but on October the 4th of 1941, for eight weeks,

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.600
 the number one song in America was 'Piano Concerto'

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.960
 number one in 'Be Flat Minor' by Chikovsky.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.560
 That was top of the charts.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.800
 - Wow, I thought he was around where earlier.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.280
 - In 1940s.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.720
 - You know.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.120
 - But they had to have his body in the studio,

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.480
 whenever they played it.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.200
 - Gossily exhuming.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.080
 I should say that I got this fact from a website called Timeline.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.680
 It's Timeline.com, and it's such a good website,

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.880
 and it basically tells you in-depth stories sort of from history,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.040
 sort of related to stuff that happens in the news.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.240
 But it's brilliant website, and they got this from a podcast

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.040
 I've just discovered called the Pessamist's Archive,

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.200
 which is also great, and the idea of this podcast is,

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.520
 it's about stuff throughout history,

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.400
 people have been terrified of change,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.160
 and they've always said this is going to destroy it.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.040
 - Oh, cool.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.360
 - And they have loads of examples of that.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.040
 So, you know, trains thought buses were going to destroy them.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.280
 Horses and carts campaigned against trains,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.640
 because they thought trains were going to destroy them,

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.720
 which they did.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.360
 People thought the radio was really damaging for your ears

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:57.960
 and for kids.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.800
 People thought Walkman should be banned.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.920
 It's so, it's really interesting.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.600
 Pessamist's Archive is, I would recommend.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.520
 - Yeah, I wonder how many bits and new technology

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.160
 have just been outright accepted as the right way forward.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.640
 Like airplanes, they thought would never.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.160
 - Yeah, never thought they'd take off.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.640
 (laughing)

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.320
 - Do you know they played music on Apollo 11?

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.240
 - Really? - Oh, hardly.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.560
 Like in the lift, when you were waiting to take off.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.600
 - While they were going.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.840
 - While they were going, to keep them calm.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.680
 - That's amazing.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.920
 - Waiting, what, during take off?

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.400
 - Apparently. - Wow.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.720
 - Did they also have buttons like in a lift

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.280
 and one of them said, "Moon."

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.280
 (laughing)

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.120
 - Jupiter.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.960
 - Yeah.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.560
 (upbeat music)

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.480
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.720
 and that is my fact.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.040
 My fact this week is that the British Library

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.000
 has a collection of over 60 million newspapers

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.520
 and none of them can catch fire.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.840
 You cannot light any of them on fire.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.120
 - Give us a go, I've got a flamethrower.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.280
 (laughing)

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.200
 - Are they kept in water?

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.760
 - Are they kept in a vacuum?

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.760
 - Yeah, no, it's, so the British Library,

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.360
 obviously ginormous archive.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.920
 Too big to even fit in one place in London

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.800
 in St. Pancras where the British Library is.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.960
 So they have a warehouse out in a place called Boston Spa,

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.880
 which is out in the countryside of England.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.640
 And in there, they house all of the newspaper archive.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.520
 This goes back some three centuries,

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.440
 and it's a collection of 60 million.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.120
 So what they've done in there is that they've reduced

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.640
 the oxygen level to a lower percentage,

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.160
 which means it's impossible to light a flame inside

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.240
 that you cannot light a match.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.680
 You cannot make your lighter produce a flame.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.600
 Therefore, you are unable to light any of the newspapers

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.600
 in there.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.440
 It's very clever.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.280
 - So cool.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.800
 - Yeah, you can't actually work in that building

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.480
 for too long because you go a bit loopy.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.920
 Employees don't actually really need to be down there

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.360
 for long because the whole thing is operated by robots.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.720
 - Amazing.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.600
 - Amazing department.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.000
 But when they do go in, they're only allowed in for so long

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.960
 because the oxygen level is so low.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.720
 - It's the same amount of oxygen as is in a pressurised

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.680
 air cabin in a narrow plane.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.840
 I didn't quite realise how much the oxygen levels

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.600
 are reduced when an aircraft cabin is pressurised,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.040
 but they're reduced by 25% just because of the pressurisation.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.200
 And reducing it by 25% ends up with it being the equivalent

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.000
 of 15% oxygen concentration at sea level,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.040
 which is about the same.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.240
 And the only reason we don't really notice it

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.560
 is because you don't really do anything on a plane.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.920
 But if you try to run a marathon up and down that corridor,

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.360
 you'd be in trouble for a number of reasons.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.560
 - A marathon is 26 and a bit miles done.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.800
 - And how long is that?

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.520
 - It's a medium length helicopter ride.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.520
 - Yeah.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.720
 - Yeah, and also it's all in the dark this warehouse

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.800
 because robots don't need lights.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.040
 - I think it's a bit harsh that these robots have to work

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.040
 in the dark.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.520
 - I know they're robots, but just feels like,

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.920
 you know, give them a light, give them...

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.560
 - They hate light, they're like vampires.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.560
 - How they meant to read in there?

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.040
 - Maybe it's to stop them from reading.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.920
 - That's right, they're going to be doing their job, yeah.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.560
 - If you're a member of the British Library

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.560
 and you request one, the robot goes to the shelf,

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.280
 it gets down the thing and then it goes to an airlock

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.800
 and it passes the thing through the airlock

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.360
 to a human on the other side

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.320
 so that it preserves the oxygen levels in the room.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.240
 How cool is that?

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.960
 - Yeah, and then in most cases,

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.200
 they do have a reading room there,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.720
 but a lot of it is ordered from the central London library.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.320
 So it gets in a van and they just bring it over.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.200
 It's bringing these, it's a lot of effort

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.040
 to read a newspaper.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:30.880
 - It's amazing, yeah.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.760
 - Although you can, most of it's digitised, I think.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.160
 So the British Library has pet up

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.320
 with the British newspaper archive,

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.880
 which I think I can't really mention,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.800
 and they're digitising most of their newspapers on that.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.920
 And I think you're only allowed to extract something

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.520
 from this place in Boston Spa

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.520
 if it's not available digitally.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.360
 - Right.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.960
 - A way thing about Boston Spa, it's very small place

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.680
 in New Yorkshire, it's got a Wikipedia page,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.520
 very short.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.440
 No word is a mention on its Wikipedia page

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.000
 that it constitutes the entire British Library

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.360
 newspaper archive.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.520
 I think someone needs to add that in.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.560
 - The first library in Britain, Manchester Free Library,

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.600
 which opened in 1852 in Manchester,

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.000
 and it had 18,000 bucks.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.880
 And it was so popular in its first week

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.760
 that a police officer was assigned to control

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.280
 the crowd around the borrowing desk.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.120
 - Wow.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.200
 - And the first librarian was called Edward Edwards.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.440
 (all laughing)

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.800
 - I was reading a thing about so libraries keep shutting down,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.600
 and one of the things as well that happens

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.480
 in a lot of libraries is if a book doesn't get borrowed,

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.440
 then they get taken off the library shelf.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.320
 And what that means is that if the library actually

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.440
 wants to keep the book, they end up having to buy the book

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.360
 back to put on their shelf, so it costs them a lot of money.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.680
 So there is a library in Orlando

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.680
 where they found a guy who checked out 2,361 books

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.160
 in the span of nine months.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.400
 And it turned out it was the librarian there

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.680
 who created a false library card.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.040
 And the idea was is that now that he borrowed it,

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.560
 it was in circulation and you get paid for circulation

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.320
 as well it brings in funds.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.360
 But he got in serious trouble because it's very legal

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.040
 to fake of being a library borrower.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.840
 - That's a shame, 'cause that is a brilliant idea.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.840
 - Yeah, he was saying that he was saving money technically

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.680
 because they would just buy the books back anyway.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.160
 So it was just him trying to be a bit cheeky

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.400
 about keeping the books without it, costing the library

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.840
 anything, but unfortunately it was seen as illegal.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.280
 And he's now in jail for life.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.120
 - What?

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.480
 (all laughing)

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.160
 - It's no wonder that is totally plausible

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.440
 about the American justice system.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.720
 He was placed on paid suspension.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.560
 - Oh, okay.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.760
 - It does sound a bit like playing your own songs

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.360
 on Spotify nonstop.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.680
 - Yes, that kind of thing.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.760
 - That's a good idea.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.760
 - People do it, don't they?

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.600
 - Do they?

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.440
 - I mean, there was a band who did that.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.200
 - We spoke about on the podcast ages ago,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.360
 I think they're called Wolfpack or something like that.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.200
 - Good memory.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.560
 - Yeah, what they did was they streamed their album

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.200
 and told everyone to stream it because if it went enough,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.280
 so they said when you go to bed,

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.200
 just stream it over and over, put on repeat

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.800
 but put it on low volume or no volume.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.880
 - Oh, wasn't a silent album, though.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.360
 Sorry, so the volume thing was nothing.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.920
 Yeah, and they did make a lot of money

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.520
 which funded their tour,

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.280
 but they got caught out by Spotify.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.360
 - And they're all in prison.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.200
 - Yeah, for life.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.880
 (all laughing)

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.320
 - There is an archive called the London Metropolitan Archives

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.200
 and they have a whole collection of old London records,

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.000
 sort of parish records and city records and things like that.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.080
 But many of them are unbelievably badly burned

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.120
 from a fire that happened in 1786.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.320
 And then why haven't I was after the fire?

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.320
 They said we should preserve these records just in case.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.280
 And now, 200 and something years later,

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.360
 what that's nearly 240 years later,

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.720
 they are becoming able to read them.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.560
 - How do you mean?

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.440
 - What they've been doing is they've been preserving

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.960
 the pages very carefully in boxes

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.080
 and then they increase the humidity

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.440
 and they sort of puff them out and then they scan them

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.720
 and then they can digitally flatten the pages.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.440
 - So you kind of unburn them a little bit.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.280
 Basically, yeah.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.320
 - Hang on, you can unburn something by getting it wet.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.720
 - And no, you increase the humidity.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.560
 I don't know if that is--

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.400
 - It is wetness.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.400
 - Yeah, okay, good point.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.240
 And then, oh yeah, and they use magnets

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.400
 to hold the page flat while they're scanning it

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.560
 or as flat as they can.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.920
 I mean, it's unbelievably clever,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.120
 but basically it's meaning that they can suddenly read

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.960
 all these things.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.000
 - But all that we find out is that Mr. Jones

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.840
 lived on high-holbin.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.320
 - There could be clues in here.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.360
 There could be important clues to how we say everything.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.960
 - All I'm saying is it's a lot of effort

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.840
 to just learn the list of names

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.600
 of people getting married and stuff.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.400
 - You love reading long lists of information, James.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.640
 This is right up your street.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:43.000
 - But just the vision of keeping these things for 200 years

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.840
 is amazing.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.160
 - Just in case we change our own technology.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.080
 - Yeah, read them again.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.680
 - I kind of think that's incredibly admirable.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.520
 - Yeah.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.360
 - Yeah, that's great.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.360
 - James thinks it's absolutely worthless, but--

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.200
 - I like it, yeah.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.920
 (all laughing)

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.120
 - I think the money could be spent better elsewhere.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:55.960
 - Yep.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.920
 - They'll give you more libraries.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.760
 (all laughing)

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.120
 - And then take thousands of books out of the better time.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.200
 (all laughing)

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.800
 (upbeat music)

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:09.600
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.040
 and that is James.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.240
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the man who invented

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.520
 Muldwine also invented an Aphrodisiac sorbet.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.640
 - Muldwine.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.040
 - Well, yes, he did.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.400
 Well, Amanda, both of those things.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.080
 (all laughing)

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.480
 Muldwine is kind of pretty old, pretty ancient,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.440
 but Blue Van, which is the German version of it,

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.200
 has a guy who is often called the inventor of it.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.160
 He's called August Joseph Ludwig von Wachibath.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.400
 (all laughing)

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.840
 - Which is a pretty strong name.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.680
 (all laughing)

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.680
 And he is the author of the oldest extant recipe.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.400
 So in Germany, they call him the father of Muldwine.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.160
 And quite recently, some historians found some writings

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.800
 of his of a recipe for Aphrodisiac sorbet.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.760
 - Mmm.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.520
 - And the sorbet is made with the delicious whites of two eggs,

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.440
 the juice of two lemons, two pounds of sugar,

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.040
 a few grains of ambergris.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.720
 - Hold on, it's done writing this down.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.120
 (all laughing)

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.720
 - It's done just to whip it down his pen

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.720
 and start scrolling notes on his page.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.040
 - So done two eggs.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:17.880
 - Two eggs.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.400
 - Yeah, two lemons, two pounds of sugar,

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.320
 some ambergris, and delicious lozenges

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.560
 from the pharmacy four ounces of.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.720
 - Oh, great.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.720
 - It's just strepsils.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.080
 - But we don't know what's in the lozenges.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.240
 That's a problem, you see.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.800
 That might be the magic ingredient.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.120
 And all we've said is one pound of sugar per egg.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.680
 I mean, that's quite a sugary recipe.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.240
 - But also it has an incredibly expensive recipe in there

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.640
 because it's using ambergris in there.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.520
 - Yeah, which you start at least slipped in,

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.920
 like just some sugars and milk, some solid diamond,

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.400
 and it's gonna be a flower.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.720
 - So we've told on it.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.560
 - Yeah.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.560
 - But if you don't have that,

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.600
 you can use the glandulous secretions of a musk rat.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.440
 - Oh good.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.280
 (all laughing)

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.440
 - Well, we got a lot of that.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.560
 (all laughing)

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.240
 No, what I was writing down was he's called

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.480
 the father of Muldwine.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.480
 I was wondering if that he was called that

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.200
 because that's just way easier to say than his actual name.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.840
 (all laughing)

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.600
 - Oh, Gustjo's if Ludwig Wagner-Vacabar.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.640
 What's hard about that?

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.480
 - Oh, you're right.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.320
 I'm afraid.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.720
 - He seemed, it's a shame.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.240
 A lot of the articles on him online,

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.640
 there's a lot of results when he put his name in,

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.840
 but they're all in German.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.080
 And I really want to read more about this guy,

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.160
 but I didn't have time today.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.640
 - You didn't have time to learn German.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.440
 (all laughing)

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.160
 - When are you gonna get that done over the weekend?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.000
 - Yeah, I'll say.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.480
 - Yeah.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.160
 He's, as a wild claim, isn't it?

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.840
 This father of Muldwine because people have been drinking.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.000
 He's been up wine and alcoholic drinks

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 since the dawn of time.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.200
 So I think peeps talks about drinking it.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.360
 - Right.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.040
 - And- - The ancient Greeks as well.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.360
 - The ancient Greeks drinking it.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.040
 - Even before the time of Samuel Peep.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.160
 (all laughing)

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.440
 - Well, you said dawn of time,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.680
 which is, I think, a bit far back.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.080
 - So I said, I said from when we've been drinking-

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:56.920
 - You said the dawn of time.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.760
 - I said the dawn of time.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.600
 - Yeah, the dawn of time.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.160
 - The dinosaurs actually had a very,

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.720
 the first thing's made in the Big Bang.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.560
 - Yeah.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.200
 - It was a hydrogen helium and Muldwine.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.200
 - And gloves.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.600
 (all laughing)

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.760
 - Do you know how they used to heat it?

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.320
 And I think they still do heat it.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.160
 - Over a flame?

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.160
 No. - No.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.000
 - Not over a flame.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.440
 - Oh, in a microwave.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.280
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.280
 That's why Samuel peeps did it.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.480
 - In some dung.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.640
 - Oh, peeps things up.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.400
 - No, maybe they, maybe some of them did that.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.200
 - Cutting open the body of a horse

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.240
 and putting it in there.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.200
 - And pouring it into there

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.080
 and then you drink it from the orifice.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.120
 - By taking the latent heat of the early universe.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.240
 (all laughing)

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.560
 - It's just the Big Bang was a hot time.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.360
 It was actually, it was a drink question.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.000
 (all laughing)

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.840
 - It's still a war, we're calling that.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.120
 (all laughing)

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.320
 - All Muldwine gets here from comments.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.880
 No, well, peeps records how they would get a polka

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.000
 really, really hot over the fire.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.200
 So you'd hold a polka over the fire

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.640
 and then you'd have a huge vat of beer,

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.960
 which I often was in those days, or wine.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.760
 And then you'd stir it with a hot polka.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.960
 So you'd stir it in a barrel of beer with a polka.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.960
 - That's really clever.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.800
 - Yeah.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.640
 - That's cool.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.480
 - Does that work?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.760
 - Really well, or would work.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.600
 - I think it did seem to be.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.440
 - Would work, of course.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.520
 - So like if I wanted to make a tea,

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.520
 but I didn't have a...

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.640
 - If you had a cup, you didn't have a kettle,

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.120
 but you didn't have a red hot polka.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.280
 (all laughing)

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.120
 - Yeah, would that work?

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:18.960
 - I guess.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.320
 - Could you get the water boiling hot?

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.120
 - Yeah, you could, I suppose.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:22.960
 - Yeah, maybe.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.080
 - 'Cause you know, you need it quite hot

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.800
 so you make a really good cup of tea.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.640
 - Yeah.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.880
 - But I mean, the cup's not that big, is it?

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.160
 So I imagine the mould wine, that's a pot.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.440
 - Yeah, you don't want to damage the cup

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.760
 that you're making a tea, and either,

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.880
 and if you're wiggling around a red hot polka net,

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.720
 you might.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.040
 (all laughing)

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.080
 So the Victorian television of mould wine,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.960
 which they called Smoking Bishop.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.800
 - That's a thing.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.640
 - Yeah, that was a thing.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.680
 It was port, it was port fruit and spices,

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.360
 but they had also Smoking Archbishop,

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.880
 which was with Claret and Smoking Pope.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.440
 And in a Christmas carol,

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.680
 screwed promises Bob Cratchett, some Smoking Bishop.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.520
 - We'll see.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.360
 - Yeah.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.920
 You could have quite a fun night, if you were a bishop,

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.040
 with some Smoking Bishop,

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.080
 and then you could eat some Stinking Bishop, the cheese.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.920
 - Yeah.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.760
 - Oh yeah.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.720
 - If there are any bishops listening,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.920
 who want to know how to party.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.440
 (all laughing)

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.280
 - But wait, it wasn't just bishops who were allowed

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.120
 to drink it, right?

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.440
 - No, it was everyone who was allowed to drink it.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.280
 It was just a name.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.360
 - So you don't have to be a bishop who knows how to party.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.800
 You can be anyone who knows how to party.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.800
 - That's true, yeah.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.720
 - Could we do some Aprodisiac stuff?

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.560
 - Yeah.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.400
 - Okay, no, sorry.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.920
 - No, what I was going to say is,

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.680
 they did an experiment with some rats,

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.640
 where they took out one of the ingredients,

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.960
 famigree switches, Ambrian.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.280
 So it's like a type of compound,

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.080
 and they gave it to the rats,

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.360
 and it produced an increase of a no genital

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.520
 investigatory behavior.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.440
 - So let's unpack that a second.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.440
 A no genital investigatory.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.400
 Okay, got it, yeah, yeah.

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.200
 So I think all those words are self, you know?

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.480
 - Self-explanatory, yeah, yeah.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.320
 - Really?

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.160
 - What Friday night is complete without...

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.400
 (laughing)

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.440
 - It's awesome, eight over the bishop party.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.160
 (laughing)

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.760
 - Ain't no genital investigatory behavior.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.960
 - Absolutely, yeah.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.800
 - Only works in rats though, apparently.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.120
 - Well, we don't know.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.120
 I think we need to do the investigation for humans.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.560
 - Oh god, I don't think we need to.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.640
 I think other people need to.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.800
 - It only works really in male rats as well.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.880
 - The female rats aren't that interested.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.880
 - Right.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.920
 - Ain't no genital eat or otherwise.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.120
 - About that kind of thing.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.240
 - Hey, I'm just wondering if you're interested in me,

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.840
 Aino genital eat or otherwise.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.340
 (laughing)

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.960
 - It's a good word, isn't it?

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.520
 - Yeah.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.000
 - You're being really Aino genital about this mark.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.840
 (laughing)

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.480
 - Is it Aino with one end?

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.600
 - Yeah. - I know, yeah.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.520
 - Aino, right, I've never actually seen that.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.640
 - You've shown to that before?

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.800
 - No. - No.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.640
 - It's where volcano is made up of two words.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.960
 Folk and Aino.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.960
 - Right, I don't know that.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.600
 - Because people thought it was vulcan, the god.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.440
 Here's Aino's.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.280
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.600
 - Shitting fire into the sky.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.840
 (laughing)

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.680
 - Yeah.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.440
 - Gwyneth Poucho sells Afridisiacs.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.120
 And this is a way of talking about her website,

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.280
 which I know this is very low-brow for us

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.560
 to go into this subject, but it's unbelievable.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.000
 Her website called goop.com, which she sells extraordinary

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:19.840
 things on there.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.120
 - Like what Anna, and for how much?

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.440
 (laughing)

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.920
 - And if you're listening this week's episode

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.160
 of No Stuff Things A Fish, it's brought to you by Goop.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.000
 For all your Aino genital leads.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.560
 - So for this Aino genital need, you can get sex bark,

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.200
 which is sex bark.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.040
 - Yeah, sex bark.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.640
 - Look at what it's worth and it's sex bites.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.640
 (laughing)

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.160
 - Yeah, it's like chocolate, except then you have to add

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.200
 something called Hushuwo to it, which is sex dust.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.640
 And I don't, it doesn't really specify where you get that.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.880
 - It sounds to me like she's just taking objects

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.160
 and putting the word sex in front of them.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.240
 - That's the sex cleaner being.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.080
 (laughing)

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.480
 - There's a lot of sex dust on top of the sex piano.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.960
 (laughing)

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.800
 - But she also sells Jade eggs, do you know what these are?

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.320
 - Are they made out of Jade for the material?

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.440
 - I believe they are, they claim to be.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.000
 They're also called Yoni eggs and they're advertised

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.560
 on goop.com as once strictly guarded secret

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.720
 of Chinese concubines and royalty and antiquity.

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.400
 And they harness the power of energy, crystal healing

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.040
 and a cagal-like physical practice.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.920
 So it's all very scientifically sound.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.640
 - And what you do is you put them into your vagina

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.520
 and you sit there with one in for a while

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.720
 and it makes you feel better.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.400
 - Strange that they didn't call them sex Jade eggs, isn't it?

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.720
 (laughing)

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.640
 - 'Cause you hadn't developed that particular marketing twist yet.

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.320
 - And then you have to pass them again, presumably.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.240
 - You pass them out again, yeah, of the same.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.240
 - Wow, clocking.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.440
 (laughing)

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.000
 - Wow.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.280
 - That's, yeah, wow, that's, yeah, cool.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.120
 - That's only you.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.160
 - I mean, if it's consenting adults.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.320
 - Nothing criminal about it.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.160
 - No, no.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.600
 - Gailan said that any food which made you flatulence

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.360
 was an aphrodisiac.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.200
 Any warm, moist and windy foods were ones that produced lust.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.120
 - And did he do well?

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.440
 (laughing)

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.200
 - This is Tinder for a couple of times.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.440
 (laughing)

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.120
 Looking for a guy who,

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.840
 - Saferon can help you have a sustained erection they found.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.680
 - Wow.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.560
 - There was a 2009 study in Iran and the 20 male patients

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.640
 were given Saferon for 10 days

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:35.320
 and they showed a statistically significant improvement

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.200
 in apparently their tip rigidity and tip tumessence

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.200
 as well as base rigidity and base tumessence.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.520
 But no word on the middle.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.360
 - I got it.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.680
 (laughing)

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.400
 - So it's a bit like, you know, the slinky dog

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.240
 and toy story?

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.080
 (laughing)

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:53.920
 - God.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.480
 (laughing)

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.440
 - I was reading about an aphrodisiac.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.640
 This is the title of the story.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.160
 Can a rare Hawaiian mushroom really give women

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.800
 a spontaneous orgasm?

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.920
 And this was a 15 year old study.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:06.760
 - Not by him.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.600
 (laughing)

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.440
 - Sorry.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.280
 (laughing)

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.120
 - Let me start that again.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.000
 - May steady continue in the rare mushroom.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.840
 (laughing)

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.800
 - Same personation of a 15 year old.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.880
 - Well, I sounded like.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.720
 (laughing)

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.080
 - Well, you had some 41.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.080
 Now, when you were 15,

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.920
 (laughing)

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.760
 - I mean, the biggest podcast reveal.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.800
 (laughing)

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.600
 Andy's grunge part.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.680
 (laughing)

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.160
 - This is a study that was done in 2001.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.320
 And these two medical students published a report

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.400
 in the International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.560
 And they did this study on 36 volunteers,

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.880
 both male and female.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.280
 And they found that this mushroom,

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.520
 this Hawaiian mushroom, was causing spontaneous orgasm

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.160
 in a bunch of the women, a part of the study group.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.800
 And so, everyone says it's not a big enough study group

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.960
 in order for that to be a truth.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.480
 So it's a very dubious thing.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.240
 And the article I was reading saying,

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.240
 actually no, it can't give you spontaneous orgasm.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.800
 What I was wondering though, was if we thought that it did,

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.160
 I wonder if there's a sort of placebo effect with it.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.440
 Therefore, could you placebo an orgasm?

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.880
 - Well, almost all afridiziax and things

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.320
 that are sort of an afridiziax trade on the placebo effect.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.160
 - And do they?

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.000
 Oh, okay.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.080
 So oysters and the actual evidence for them changing chemicals

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.000
 in your body to make you more interested in sex is pretty slim.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 - Yeah, although they don't claim spontaneous orgasms

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.320
 to be fair, that's another...

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.720
 I think when you have an afridiziax,

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.760
 you also need to have some other sexual stimulation.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.680
 You don't just eat ten oysters and stand,

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.640
 they're going, "Why haven't I orgasm?"

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.040
 (laughing)

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.120
 - I don't know, darling, keep trying.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.640
 I'm doing the crossword.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.760
 (laughing)

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.340
 (upbeat music)

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:59.520
 - Okay, that's it.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.640
 That is all of our facts.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.040
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.840

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.800
 (laughing)

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800
 It's sexual.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.280

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.880

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.240
