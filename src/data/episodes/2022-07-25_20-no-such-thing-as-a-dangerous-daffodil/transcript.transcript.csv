00:00:00,00:00:02,- We run it on QI a few years ago. - Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:05,"- Which was, there's no such thing as a fish. - You did a nice, such thing as a fish."
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."
00:00:12,00:00:24,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:24,00:00:27,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:27,00:00:33,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting at a table with Ann Miller, James Harkin, and Andy Murray."
00:00:33,00:00:38,"And once again, we've gathered around with our favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:38,00:00:40,"and in no particular order, here they are."
00:00:40,00:00:45,"Okay, fact number one, and that's you, James."
00:00:45,00:00:52,"Okay, my fact is that the most painful place to be stung by a bee is your nostril."
00:00:52,00:00:54,- Is it? - It is.
00:00:54,00:00:55,So a bee inside your nose.
00:00:55,00:00:59,"Yeah, just the inside of your nostril apparently, it's the worst place to be stung."
00:00:59,00:01:04,"- How do you know this? - Well, I know this because there was a Cornell University student"
00:01:04,00:01:09,"called Michael Smith, who decided to let bees sting him on all different parts of his body"
00:01:09,00:01:11,and find out which was the most painful.
00:01:11,00:01:15,"- When he say, ""Oh, do you mean actually all?"" - Well, the main ones."
00:01:15,00:01:16,- The main ones. - The main ones.
00:01:16,00:01:19,- The skin. - The main ones are my hands and my feet.
00:01:19,00:01:23,"Yeah, I want to put nostril on my head shoulder's knees and toes, obviously."
00:01:23,00:01:28,"I'd say inside your mouth's fully pretty bad. - Yes. - Or your ears, like things that are touching your ears."
00:01:28,00:01:31,- Did he do it on his penis? That's what we're all dancing around.
00:01:31,00:01:35,"- I know. - Well, you might be dancing around your penis."
00:01:35,00:01:38,"- I would be of a bee, it's stung it."
00:01:38,00:01:39,"- He did, yes."
00:01:39,00:01:45,"He did it on the number of different parts of his body, and he gave them marks out of ten"
00:01:45,00:01:49,"for how painful they were, and the nostril was 9.0."
00:01:49,00:01:56,"The upper lip was 8.7, and the penis was the third worst place to be stung, and it was 7.3 out of ten."
00:01:56,00:02:02,"- Wow. - He had one bee, which he would hold beside his body in order to make it sting him."
00:02:02,00:02:06,- And a poor bee. Just put back in the box afterwards.
00:02:06,00:02:08,"- Oh, thank god that's over, then half an hour later."
00:02:08,00:02:10,"- Oh, here we go."
00:02:10,00:02:13,- Is it true that bees don't die after stinging you?
00:02:13,00:02:14,- Mammals have tougher skin.
00:02:14,00:02:18,"So if they sting a mammal, there's a higher chance of the sting being left behind"
00:02:18,00:02:20,"and then the bee, not surviving."
00:02:20,00:02:23,"However, if they sting other insects, which is what they normally sting, then they're fine."
00:02:23,00:02:24,They can sting them repeatedly.
00:02:24,00:02:28,- Do you know what a bee does if it can't sting you if you're too small to be stung?
00:02:28,00:02:30,"- If you're too small to be stung, you're going to be arrested and arrested."
00:02:30,00:02:32,"- They're not a human, like an insect."
00:02:32,00:02:33,"- Oh, like an insect. - Come on in between your nose."
00:02:33,00:02:35,"- Yes, yeah. I know, what does it do?"
00:02:35,00:02:36,- They bite. - They bite.
00:02:36,00:02:40,"- And their bites have a chemical in their basically paralyzes their prey, so they can turn them out of their hives."
00:02:40,00:02:43,And they might be able to be used in human medicine for anesthetics.
00:02:43,00:02:52,"Actually, the theme tune to our podcast ""Wosps"" by Ampere Yes, the song is all about how bees survive a wasp attack"
00:02:52,00:02:57,"when they come into their nest, which is that they heat it up by vibrating inside."
00:02:57,00:03:02,"And they can sustain within their own body a certain amount of heat, which is higher than a wasp heat."
00:03:02,00:03:05,So they literally cook the wasp inside the hive.
00:03:05,00:03:06,- That's awesome.
00:03:06,00:03:10,"- We also should mention the least painful places, just in case you have a supervillain say."
00:03:10,00:03:13,"- It's all about bees-beasting, YouTube."
00:03:13,00:03:15,"- Well, all of your shoe would be, yeah."
00:03:15,00:03:17,- It would be amazing. - I'll look at that.
00:03:17,00:03:23,"- But on the body, the skull tip of the middle toe, apparently, and upper arm, they're all very low rated 2.3."
00:03:23,00:03:28,"- I read about this horrible thing in New Zealand, where they're selling the venom face masks."
00:03:28,00:03:34,"So the idea is that it works like a natural bullshocks in it, so they need about 20 hives to harvest one gram of this venom."
00:03:34,00:03:37,"And they claim a mixture of skin and feel firmer, it makes it, you know, like you've had a facelift."
00:03:37,00:03:41,"- But there are told you say there's no benefits, and actually it can cause you quite severe medical problems."
00:03:41,00:03:44,- Bees can fly higher than Mount Everest.
00:03:44,00:03:48,"We did a thing about landing a helicopter on Mount Everest, which is incredibly difficult and dangerous,"
00:03:48,00:03:52,"because the air is so thin up there that even with the speed of helicopters, the rotor blades go at,"
00:03:52,00:03:53,it's almost impossible to do.
00:03:53,00:03:56,"- But someone has done it, and has done it, yeah."
00:03:56,00:03:58,"- But it wasn't a bee, just to clarify."
00:03:58,00:04:05,"- Well, Edmund Hilary, he was a beekeeper, and he actually was his beekeeping job that funded his trip to get to Mount Everest, yeah."
00:04:05,00:04:09,"- Yeah, he put it on his passport when they asked what his job was, he said he was a beekeeper."
00:04:09,00:04:10,"- Oh, that's awesome."
00:04:10,00:04:12,"- Yeah, other famous beekeepers, Sherlock Holmes."
00:04:12,00:04:14,"- Yes, he retired to become a beekeeper."
00:04:14,00:04:15,- He retired as a beekeeper.
00:04:15,00:04:18,"- Yeah, Aristotle as well, was a beekeeper."
00:04:18,00:04:24,"And he made this really odd claim that they survived for seven years, when in fact they survived for seven weeks."
00:04:24,00:04:28,"So either he thought, ""Well, they're still here,"" and just didn't recognize that he had new born bees."
00:04:28,00:04:29,"- Oh, he was a dog."
00:04:29,00:04:30,"- Oh my god, yeah."
00:04:30,00:04:31,"- Wow, Aristotle."
00:04:31,00:04:32,- We just blend this thing wider.
00:04:32,00:04:34,- Yeah.
00:04:34,00:04:39,"- I saw everything in the news, in the news a few weeks ago, that Norfolk police are warning people to be aware of bee rustlers."
00:04:39,00:04:42,They've been turning up in the night and stealing hives full of thousands of bees.
00:04:42,00:04:43,- Oh really?
00:04:43,00:04:44,"- So that's quite a high risk, fair."
00:04:44,00:04:45,"- Yeah, wow."
00:04:45,00:04:49,"- Germany has fantastic bee laws, and roughly broken down their this."
00:04:49,00:04:56,"If bees break away from a hive, they are only still your bees if you're in pursuit."
00:04:56,00:04:58,"So as long as you're in pursuit, they are your bees."
00:04:58,00:05:00,So there is nowhere off limits to you.
00:05:00,00:05:04,"If you have to run into the houses of parliament there, you can because you're just here to your bees."
00:05:04,00:05:04,- Yeah.
00:05:04,00:05:06,- You're exactly like this from this law.
00:05:06,00:05:07,- Yeah.
00:05:07,00:05:12,"- If they then land in the hive of someone else's farm, and it's an empty hive,"
00:05:12,00:05:16,"then you can break that hive down, collect your bees and bring it back and just replace the hive."
00:05:16,00:05:22,"If it lands in a hive that's full of bees, then the other owner is just acquired some new bees."
00:05:22,00:05:25,"Now the best law of the whole thing is that if you're in pursuit of your bees,"
00:05:25,00:05:28,"there's a law that states that if you see someone else in pursuit of their bees,"
00:05:28,00:05:33,"and your two bee colonies collide and turn into one swarm,"
00:05:33,00:05:35,you are now the co-owner of these bees.
00:05:35,00:05:37,"- You're in business with the hive, they're in business."
00:05:37,00:05:39,"- Yeah, if he drops out of pursuit, then it's your business."
00:05:39,00:05:41,- You're in buzziness more like.
00:05:41,00:05:47,Can I quickly tell you about bee bids?
00:05:47,00:05:47,Please do.
00:05:47,00:05:48,"- Ooh, yeah."
00:05:48,00:05:52,- This is an article by beekeeper on beeinformed.org.
00:05:52,00:05:53,"Nice, but the article reads,"
00:05:53,00:05:58,"""Having about 10,000 bees on your face is one of the best ways to demonstrate how calm and fun"
00:05:58,00:06:00,"bees can be."""
00:06:00,00:06:03,"And so the idea is that, so step one, prepare the bees,"
00:06:03,00:06:08,"step two, prepare the person, step three, add bees, step four, remove bees."
00:06:08,00:06:11,Because of the more detail on how you do all of these things.
00:06:11,00:06:13,"So basically you attach them to your chin,"
00:06:13,00:06:16,and you have to put Vaseline on your eyes and you have to put Coffin in your ears.
00:06:16,00:06:17,- How do you attach them to your chin?
00:06:17,00:06:21,Is it like on each hair and your chin or something?
00:06:21,00:06:25,- You put a queen bee just below your chin and the bees swarm to her.
00:06:25,00:06:26,- How do you get her?
00:06:26,00:06:29,"- You spray the bees with sugar syrup,"
00:06:29,00:06:32,"and then the assistant will tie the queen around your head so the queen is under your chin,"
00:06:32,00:06:37,"and then you just hold a tray on your belly and the assistant dumps all the bees into the tray,"
00:06:37,00:06:38,and they just gather to the queen.
00:06:38,00:06:39,- Okay.
00:06:39,00:06:41,- And you've got a massive beard made of bees.
00:06:41,00:06:45,"However, he does point out he's never done this without being stung at least once or twice."
00:06:45,00:06:49,"- I want to know what would happen if you were in Germany and you were chasing your bees,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,and they all gathered on some guy's face.
00:06:51,00:06:52,- You get on him.
00:06:53,00:06:56,"There is a myth about bees, according to the internet."
00:06:56,00:07:01,This is a common misconception amongst some people that bees hate bad language
00:07:01,00:07:04,and will sting those who swear in their presence.
00:07:04,00:07:08,"- I heard that if you kill, I think it works for bees, Andrew, whilst if you kill them,"
00:07:08,00:07:10,"you need to get out of there quick because if you kill them,"
00:07:10,00:07:13,they release a chemical to warn their hive mates that there's danger.
00:07:13,00:07:15,- They can do that even if they're still alive.
00:07:15,00:07:21,- There was something in the news this week that they found that gorillas communicate by BL.
00:07:21,00:07:23,"- I mean, you mean gorilla gorillas, not gorilla warriors."
00:07:23,00:07:25,- Philogastro just raised an arm.
00:07:25,00:07:32,"- Well, yes, Arifat used to just fart whenever he wanted to because that was his kind of thing."
00:07:32,00:07:33,It was his intimidation.
00:07:33,00:07:34,- To clear the room.
00:07:34,00:07:36,- It was just his thing.
00:07:36,00:07:40,"He got so much joy and we have the room to ourselves, please."
00:07:40,00:07:41,He does make a presence.
00:07:41,00:07:47,"I was reading that urban bees, they've completely evolved."
00:07:47,00:07:50,So there was a study done in Toronto that showed that three out of eight
00:07:50,00:07:56,alfalfa leaf cutter bees have nests that are made up of shredded plastic bags.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"Apparently, they use us as sort of salt licks, like us humans."
00:07:59,00:08:02,- Lots of insects drink animals tears together.
00:08:02,00:08:07,- We did on QI a few years ago that there was a company developing bee bomb detectors
00:08:07,00:08:11,and trained bees to stick out their tongue at the smell of explosives and things like that.
00:08:11,00:08:12,- Wow.
00:08:12,00:08:16,- You know how you use smoke to pacify bees?
00:08:16,00:08:17,Do you know how that works?
00:08:17,00:08:19,- No.
00:08:19,00:08:22,It doesn't make them drowsy as you might think in the normal way.
00:08:22,00:08:25,They think they're in trouble and so they eat up all of the honey
00:08:25,00:08:28,"and because they eat up so much, they're so full."
00:08:28,00:08:31,They can't really do anything and they're just waddling around
00:08:31,00:08:32,and they're not attacking people.
00:08:32,00:08:34,I think that's how the smoke stuff works.
00:08:34,00:08:35,- That's great.
00:08:35,00:08:35,"- That's great, isn't it?"
00:08:35,00:08:37,- I really hope it will be by getting them addicted to the smoke
00:08:37,00:08:40,and so that they just want another cigarette.
00:08:40,00:08:45,"- Well, there is a study where they tried to get some bees addicted to narcotics"
00:08:45,00:08:46,to see how it affected the bees.
00:08:46,00:08:47,"- Well, it could possibly go wrong."
00:08:47,00:08:49,"- Yeah, so they got some bees hooked to cocaine."
00:08:49,00:08:50,"And according to the results,"
00:08:50,00:08:52,"the cocaine-turned-good bees,"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"productive members of the hive,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,into untrustworthy bees.
00:08:56,00:09:00,- Grace will hand it up a morph as well.
00:09:00,00:09:00,"- No, I think..."
00:09:00,00:09:02,"- He has an untrustworthy bee behaviour, Dan."
00:09:02,00:09:05,"- I think, if I remember this study correctly,"
00:09:05,00:09:08,bees will do a little dance to say how much honey they have.
00:09:08,00:09:09,"Yeah, call the waggle dance."
00:09:09,00:09:11,And the ones who had taken cocaine would do that.
00:09:11,00:09:14,We've got lots of honey dance when actually they should have done that.
00:09:14,00:09:15,We didn't really find much honey.
00:09:15,00:09:17,We mostly found cocaine dance.
00:09:17,00:09:17,- That's amazing.
00:09:17,00:09:19,- We found more than anyone else has ever found.
00:09:19,00:09:20,You've got to come. You've got to come and look.
00:09:20,00:09:22,- What about drunk bees? Do you know about them?
00:09:22,00:09:22,- No.
00:09:22,00:09:24,- So you're sitting in a corner and getting a bit sad?
00:09:24,00:09:25,"- Yeah, it is a bit like that."
00:09:25,00:09:28,They have more flying accidents than sober ones.
00:09:28,00:09:33,And they can sometimes forget how to get back to the hive and die as a result.
00:09:33,00:09:35,"And if they do make it back to the hive,"
00:09:35,00:09:39,then they can be rounded on by other bees who punish them by chewing off their legs.
00:09:39,00:09:41,- So they're legless.
00:09:45,00:09:49,"- Okay, let's move on to fact B, fact number two."
00:09:49,00:09:50,Just a call back there.
00:09:50,00:09:53,"Yeah, okay, this is my fact."
00:09:53,00:09:57,And this fact is that Walt Disney used to eat breakfast like all of us.
00:09:57,00:10:01,But his favorite breakfast was fresh doughnuts dunked in scotch.
00:10:01,00:10:03,- That's why the national dish of Scotland.
00:10:03,00:10:08,"- He's one of those people who, when you look into him,"
00:10:08,00:10:11,just comes up with so many extraordinary little facts about him
00:10:11,00:10:13,that you would never have known.
00:10:13,00:10:19,"And I'm surprised that we do know, I'm surprised that we do know that he dunked his doughnuts in scotch."
00:10:19,00:10:23,I'm surprised that we know that he used to keep his testicles on ice.
00:10:23,00:10:27,"- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, he dunked his scotch."
00:10:27,00:10:28,- That was on ice.
00:10:28,00:10:29,- He was his testicles.
00:10:29,00:10:34,He used to put his balls on ice because he had a low sperm count and he thought that would help.
00:10:34,00:10:35,"- He's in the electronics room, is that it?"
00:10:35,00:10:36,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:10:36,00:10:38,"- Yeah, the rest of him isn't frozen."
00:10:38,00:10:39,It's just his testicles.
00:10:39,00:10:40,- It's just his balls.
00:10:40,00:10:41,- When we regenerate him.
00:10:42,00:10:43,- Isn't he an almost pair of balls?
00:10:43,00:10:49,- There's a guy called Josh Schumacher in America and he's painted a thing called Snowballs.
00:10:49,00:10:53,And these are pants that come with a special integrated pocket
00:10:53,00:10:57,that cools the man's nether regions in an effort to boost his sperm count.
00:10:57,00:10:57,- Ah.
00:10:57,00:10:59,- And the awkward Christmas is sorted.
00:10:59,00:11:00,- Yeah.
00:11:00,00:11:02,For the man who has everything.
00:11:02,00:11:03,- Colder testicles.
00:11:03,00:11:06,"- Um, a scariest way I went around a few years ago."
00:11:06,00:11:08,That Iron Blue lowered your sperm count.
00:11:08,00:11:09,- Really?
00:11:09,00:11:11,- You basically would stuff the Scottish reproduction rates.
00:11:11,00:11:12,I think it turned out not to be true.
00:11:12,00:11:17,"- Um, Chinese Unix would keep their testicles in a jar"
00:11:17,00:11:21,in the hope that they would arrive complete in the next world after they died.
00:11:21,00:11:21,- Oh my god.
00:11:21,00:11:25,"- I just moved house and I, you know, I'm getting rid of a lot of my old stuff."
00:11:25,00:11:29,"I can imagine finding your testicles in a drawer or something and thinking,"
00:11:29,00:11:30,"""I will hang on to these."""
00:11:30,00:11:31,"- Yeah, everyone's got one of those drawers at home."
00:11:31,00:11:32,Haven't they?
00:11:32,00:11:35,"It just starts and ends like old batteries, jars of testicles."
00:11:35,00:11:37,- What happens to foreskins?
00:11:37,00:11:37,- What do you mean?
00:11:37,00:11:38,- On circumcision.
00:11:38,00:11:41,Some of them can be used in cosmetics.
00:11:41,00:11:42,- Yeah.
00:11:42,00:11:44,- And they're not really supposed to be face masks.
00:11:44,00:11:47,"- I know, they're used as artificial eyelashers."
00:11:47,00:11:50,"They're just, no, they're not actually."
00:11:50,00:11:51,- Oh my god.
00:11:51,00:11:54,"- No, there was a bit of a, a bit of a thing a couple of years ago"
00:11:54,00:11:57,"that some hospitals have been taking the,"
00:11:57,00:12:01,removed fastkins from children and they've been using them
00:12:01,00:12:04,to make cosmetics without the patient's consent.
00:12:04,00:12:06,- I did work experience in the hospital when I was younger
00:12:06,00:12:08,and I was in an operating theater and they had a sign on the world
00:12:08,00:12:10,about different kinds of bins.
00:12:10,00:12:12,"And after I made it, I was, I think it was the orange bin"
00:12:12,00:12:13,was for human body parts.
00:12:13,00:12:14,- Oh.
00:12:14,00:12:16,"- I never saw one, but I love the wary of one."
00:12:16,00:12:19,"- That's like recycling gum, mad, isn't it?"
00:12:19,00:12:21,"It's like, you're going to put it in your green bin"
00:12:21,00:12:22,or your brown bin or your orange bin.
00:12:22,00:12:23,- I didn't pay for it.
00:12:23,00:12:24,- Walt Disney.
00:12:24,00:12:26,What do we have about him?
00:12:26,00:12:30,- Something I didn't know about Walt was that he was the voice of Mickey.
00:12:30,00:12:31,- There are lots of Mickey Mouse's and one of the actors
00:12:31,00:12:34,"played Mickey Mouse, married lady who played Minnie Mouse."
00:12:34,00:12:35,Which is very nice.
00:12:35,00:12:36,"- Oh, that's good."
00:12:36,00:12:37,- That is good.
00:12:37,00:12:38,- And cows in Mickey Mouse.
00:12:38,00:12:41,There was a complaint that the otters were too big
00:12:41,00:12:42,when it first came out.
00:12:42,00:12:42,"- Oh, really?"
00:12:42,00:12:44,- And they said pictures in the future
00:12:44,00:12:46,will have small or invisible otters.
00:12:46,00:12:50,"Quite unlike the gargantuan organ whose antics have laked,"
00:12:50,00:12:52,her shocked some and convulsed others.
00:12:52,00:12:54,- I get a lot of those letters too.
00:12:54,00:12:57,- I found that yesterday.
00:12:57,00:12:58,"This is not really related,"
00:12:58,00:13:00,but from the Mickey and Minnie thing.
00:13:00,00:13:02,Do you know Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas?
00:13:02,00:13:02,- Yeah.
00:13:02,00:13:04,- Was someone in peanuts?
00:13:04,00:13:05,- What?
00:13:05,00:13:07,- I forgot the name of the character in peanuts.
00:13:07,00:13:09,The one with blonde curly hair.
00:13:09,00:13:11,Her voice was done in the 80s by Fergie.
00:13:11,00:13:13,It was the first thing she ever did when she was like nine years old.
00:13:13,00:13:15,"- Okay, I've just googled it."
00:13:15,00:13:16,She played Sally.
00:13:16,00:13:17,- That's right.
00:13:17,00:13:18,- That's a really good fact.
00:13:18,00:13:18,- Yeah.
00:13:18,00:13:22,- Just one other related fact to people behind the characters.
00:13:22,00:13:24,Ariel and Bell.
00:13:24,00:13:27,So Ariel from the lore mermaid and Bell from Beauty and the Beast.
00:13:27,00:13:29,They were both based on a real-life model.
00:13:29,00:13:31,Whose name was Cherie Stoner.
00:13:31,00:13:33,And they used all of her mannerisms.
00:13:33,00:13:37,"So there's very famously, Ariel does this thing where she kind of blows her hair"
00:13:37,00:13:39,in frustration and her hair bows.
00:13:39,00:13:42,That was just Cherie just improvising in the moment.
00:13:42,00:13:44,- Cherie also had the tail of the fish.
00:13:44,00:13:45,- She did it.
00:13:45,00:13:46,"So I mean, it was very convenient."
00:13:46,00:13:49,But she wasn't just a model because then she became a part of the family.
00:13:49,00:13:53,And she was the writer and producer for the Animaniacs
00:13:53,00:13:54,"and Casper, the friendly ghost."
00:13:54,00:13:54,- Oh really?
00:13:54,00:13:56,"- Yeah, she was like a proper..."
00:13:56,00:13:57,- That's pretty good.
00:13:57,00:14:00,That reminds me of a fact about the Statue of Liberty.
00:14:00,00:14:01,It was designed by Bertoldy.
00:14:02,00:14:07,I think he based the body of the Statue of Liberty on his mistress
00:14:07,00:14:08,and the face on his mother.
00:14:08,00:14:10,"- Oh, that's not a five-bed."
00:14:10,00:14:11,"- Which is a little bit pro-idean, isn't it?"
00:14:11,00:14:14,"- But that's like Justin's mother will be very statuesque, if so."
00:14:14,00:14:16,- Maybe she's wore a big tiara all the time.
00:14:16,00:14:17,- Maybe.
00:14:17,00:14:20,"Justin Pollard, one of the other QILs."
00:14:20,00:14:24,"In his book, Seeker Britain, he talks about how the roles"
00:14:24,00:14:26,"Royce, the Statue, the spirit of ecstasy,"
00:14:26,00:14:29,is based on the mistress of Mr. Royce.
00:14:29,00:14:31,"Was it, yeah, well, one of them."
00:14:31,00:14:33,"It was their mistress, who died in a boating accident."
00:14:33,00:14:36,And it was his tribute to her to people alive forever.
00:14:36,00:14:38,"Yeah, so that's his mistress on the front of the car."
00:14:38,00:14:40,Let's talk about breakfast.
00:14:40,00:14:43,"There was a study done saying that if you eat cake for breakfast,"
00:14:43,00:14:45,it's really good if you're on a diet.
00:14:45,00:14:48,And they got a load of overweight people.
00:14:48,00:14:50,And they gave them cake for breakfast.
00:14:50,00:14:52,That was the only difference in any of their lifestyle.
00:14:52,00:14:54,And they all lost weight.
00:14:54,00:14:57,"And the idea is that if you eat the sugary stuff in the morning,"
00:14:57,00:14:59,you're less likely to snack on it during the day.
00:14:59,00:15:01,Wow.
00:15:01,00:15:03,So a bowl of special K and a bowl of frosties
00:15:03,00:15:05,have only a one calorie difference.
00:15:05,00:15:07,And it's the special K that are more calorific.
00:15:07,00:15:08,Whoa.
00:15:08,00:15:09,So you're better off eating frosties.
00:15:09,00:15:10,"Well, really."
00:15:10,00:15:14,"The iron that you get added to cereals,"
00:15:14,00:15:15,"if you have a good enough magnet,"
00:15:15,00:15:18,you can get the iron filings out of the cereal.
00:15:18,00:15:19,There's a way of doing that.
00:15:19,00:15:21,There's videos on YouTube of how to do it.
00:15:21,00:15:22,"Oh, that's awesome."
00:15:22,00:15:22,Yeah.
00:15:22,00:15:23,Disney World.
00:15:23,00:15:24,Yes.
00:15:24,00:15:28,Is the second largest purchaser of explosives in the US?
00:15:28,00:15:30,They're just for their fireworks or are they taken to terrorism?
00:15:30,00:15:31,"No, it's fireworks."
00:15:31,00:15:33,But after the military is number one.
00:15:33,00:15:34,All that planning is something really big.
00:15:34,00:15:37,"Actually, that reminds me of the fact"
00:15:37,00:15:40,that I almost used for the podcast this week.
00:15:40,00:15:42,I read it on a website called Collector's Weekly.com.
00:15:42,00:15:44,"And they said that before they had fireworks,"
00:15:44,00:15:47,"what they would do is they would get two anvils,"
00:15:47,00:15:48,"turn one of them upside down,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,"put it on top of the other one,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"put explosives in between them,"
00:15:52,00:15:56,set fire to the explosives so that the anvil would fly into the sky.
00:15:56,00:15:57,What could possibly go wrong?
00:15:57,00:15:59,"I know, and it caused all sorts of problems,"
00:15:59,00:16:01,people getting injured and what have you.
00:16:01,00:16:02,But hang on.
00:16:02,00:16:04,It's the cartoon trope of someone being killed
00:16:04,00:16:05,by a massive anvil falling on them.
00:16:05,00:16:07,Something that was a real risk.
00:16:07,00:16:07,Yeah.
00:16:07,00:16:09,The weather's going to be heavy anvils today
00:16:09,00:16:10,with scattered hammers.
00:16:10,00:16:11,[LAUGHS]
00:16:11,00:16:17,"OK, it is time now to move on to fact number three."
00:16:17,00:16:19,"And that is you, Anne."
00:16:19,00:16:22,"Yes, my fact is that the French used to call Arsonic"
00:16:22,00:16:25,"""poudre de sucession"" or ""inheritance powder"""
00:16:25,00:16:27,because it was used in so many murders.
00:16:27,00:16:30,That was obviously not sort of on the tin.
00:16:30,00:16:33,"Yeah, then the pharmacy, I would say, inheritance powder."
00:16:33,00:16:36,"No, it was actually, Arsonic was used quite a lot at this point"
00:16:36,00:16:39,because it was used to kill rats.
00:16:39,00:16:41,And they actually also used Arsonic to colour their wallpaper green.
00:16:41,00:16:42,So there were quite a lot of cases
00:16:42,00:16:45,where people would have this sort of symptoms.
00:16:45,00:16:46,"And when they went to the seaside, it would clear up"
00:16:46,00:16:47,because they were away from their wallpaper
00:16:47,00:16:50,and this sort of lingering Arsonicness was there.
00:16:50,00:16:52,Wasn't Napoleon supposedly poisoned?
00:16:52,00:16:54,"But I mean, that was the myth, wasn't it?"
00:16:54,00:16:55,"Yeah, there's a myth."
00:16:55,00:16:58,People are pretty sure these days that he died of stomach cancer.
00:16:58,00:17:00,Not a lot of wallpaper.
00:17:00,00:17:03,"That's the weird Philan on the official form,"
00:17:03,00:17:04,"""Calls of Death"" wallpaper."
00:17:04,00:17:08,"That was almost anvil, anvil, anvil, wallpaper."
00:17:08,00:17:11,"It's like that, either that wallpaper goes or I will."
00:17:11,00:17:12,"Yeah, he was that, he said that."
00:17:12,00:17:13,Oscar Wilde.
00:17:13,00:17:14,Turns out he didn't say that.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"He said something like it, but he said it days before he died."
00:17:17,00:17:19,"And I don't think he kind of went,"
00:17:19,00:17:21,"""Oh, that was a pretty good end line, I'm just going to leave it there."""
00:17:21,00:17:23,He lived on for another 30 years in complete silence.
00:17:23,00:17:27,Yeah. But there's Arsonic that.
00:17:27,00:17:30,"So I got it from Lucy Worsley's book about Modos,"
00:17:30,00:17:30,which is really interesting.
00:17:30,00:17:33,It's all about how the British can do years of recess
00:17:33,00:17:34,about reading about Modos.
00:17:34,00:17:36,"The Arsonic itself, it was problematic,"
00:17:36,00:17:37,because it didn't have a smell.
00:17:37,00:17:39,And the symptoms are very similar to cholera.
00:17:39,00:17:43,"And you couldn't trace it at all until some chemists developed the marsh test,"
00:17:43,00:17:45,which is how you could separate Arsonic and prove someone had it.
00:17:45,00:17:48,"Before that, there was no way of proving that you had taken Arsonic."
00:17:48,00:17:49,So it was there?
00:17:49,00:17:51,"It's not supposed to smell of garlic when you heat it up, or something."
00:17:51,00:17:52,"Yes, I read that as well."
00:17:52,00:17:53,"When you heat it, it's..."
00:17:53,00:17:56,Maybe they weren't cooking it.
00:17:56,00:17:58,"Yeah, or maybe they were putting it in garlic bread."
00:17:58,00:18:02,One of the best tests for the presence of Arsonic
00:18:02,00:18:05,"was developed by Samuel Haneman,"
00:18:05,00:18:07,who is the guy who invented homeopathy.
00:18:07,00:18:09,So that was one of his more successful...
00:18:09,00:18:12,Could his test detect like one part in 10 billion?
00:18:12,00:18:15,"You do need a small amount, though, to live."
00:18:15,00:18:16,They've tested it.
00:18:16,00:18:17,"Yeah, you have it in your body."
00:18:17,00:18:20,"Yeah, so they've tested on chickens and rats."
00:18:20,00:18:21,"They've given them a diet, normal diet,"
00:18:21,00:18:24,"but only without Arsonic, and they grow up standard."
00:18:24,00:18:26,"So they don't know whether it's essential for humans,"
00:18:26,00:18:28,because I don't think it's done that kind of experiment.
00:18:28,00:18:30,But isn't it in lipstick as well?
00:18:30,00:18:34,"In some things, yeah, there's some traces in the USA, I think."
00:18:34,00:18:36,I think it's not allowed in any British cosmetics.
00:18:36,00:18:42,"In the US, you're allowed up to three parts per million of Arsonic in lipstick."
00:18:42,00:18:43,"Wow, to you."
00:18:43,00:18:45,"I was like, really grim stuff, but food isn't there, right?"
00:18:45,00:18:48,"You had like one hair, or have many grams, and one dead fly."
00:18:48,00:18:53,"One rodent hair, per jar, and three up to three maggots."
00:18:53,00:18:54,One testicle.
00:18:54,00:18:57,"One testicle, as long as it's Walt Disney's."
00:18:57,00:18:58,In your frozen peas.
00:18:58,00:19:01,"But they used to think it was good for us,"
00:19:01,00:19:03,"and they, because it was prescribed for a lot of medication."
00:19:03,00:19:04,Yeah.
00:19:04,00:19:06,"Diabetes, tuberculosis, malaria."
00:19:06,00:19:07,"Here, Carlos Arsonic."
00:19:07,00:19:09,"Yeah, pretty much everything."
00:19:09,00:19:11,"It was, it was a pick me up."
00:19:11,00:19:12,The cure also.
00:19:12,00:19:14,"Yeah, there was a medicine called Dr. Fowler's solution,"
00:19:14,00:19:17,which was used to treat females.
00:19:17,00:19:18,And it's just a solution with potassium arsenide.
00:19:18,00:19:20,Watered down with lavender water.
00:19:20,00:19:22,And you would take a few drops with a glass of wine.
00:19:22,00:19:23,Charles Dickens had it.
00:19:23,00:19:27,"It was used a cural, tonic, aphrodisiac, treat snake bites, malaria,"
00:19:27,00:19:29,"epilepsy, morning sickness, diarrhea."
00:19:29,00:19:30,You name it.
00:19:30,00:19:34,There was also Dr. Roses Arsonic complexion wafers.
00:19:34,00:19:39,They were advertised as being simply magical for the complexion.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"I've got another fact from Lucie Worsi's book, which I really love,"
00:19:41,00:19:43,"which is Madame Tussard's Chamber of Horrors,"
00:19:43,00:19:46,"which, which, namely, is just called the other chamber,"
00:19:46,00:19:48,sort of full with models of murder as you go and look at them.
00:19:48,00:19:50,"And during the First World War,"
00:19:50,00:19:53,trainee soldiers used to be set in the initiation test
00:19:53,00:19:55,to go and hide in the chamber and spend the whole night there.
00:19:55,00:19:59,And it became such a pest that Madame Tussard had to officially ask the war
00:19:59,00:20:00,for us to stop them doing this.
00:20:00,00:20:01,"Oh, wow."
00:20:01,00:20:02,You're sneaking in.
00:20:02,00:20:06,I have a fact that you like Annabar Arsonic.
00:20:06,00:20:09,And that is that hedgehogs are immune to arsenic poisoning.
00:20:09,00:20:10,So hedgehogs?
00:20:10,00:20:12,I like a good hedgehog fact.
00:20:12,00:20:14,You can build up a resistance to Arsonic.
00:20:14,00:20:16,"If you try your hardest, which is good news."
00:20:16,00:20:20,"Yeah, there was some peasants in the Stirian Alps."
00:20:20,00:20:23,It's several centuries ago who ate massive chunks of arsenic twice a week
00:20:23,00:20:25,and they claimed it improved the complexion.
00:20:25,00:20:26,So not far off.
00:20:26,00:20:28,"Ah, really?"
00:20:28,00:20:30,"And scientists said, now that's ridiculous, arsenic's very poisonous."
00:20:30,00:20:32,"And they're like, well, how come our skin is so good?"
00:20:32,00:20:35,How come I'm going after a day in the field?
00:20:35,00:20:40,But then there was a meeting in 1875 of the Association of German Scientists
00:20:40,00:20:44,at which a peasant ate twice the fatal dose of arsenic trioxide
00:20:44,00:20:45,before a big audience.
00:20:45,00:20:48,"And they tested him afterwards and they tested his urine, which is how you tell me."
00:20:48,00:20:53,"Wow, before a big audience, it's like people were easily enthained in those days."
00:20:53,00:20:56,"Well, they didn't have transformers, didn't they?"
00:20:56,00:20:58,"Can't watch a man, he might die."
00:20:58,00:21:00,"Yeah, I'd watch that, like a shot."
00:21:00,00:21:03,I think it's like an early version of man versus food.
00:21:03,00:21:04,But versus poison.
00:21:04,00:21:05,"Yeah, that's a great step."
00:21:05,00:21:07,"Today, man one, but next time."
00:21:07,00:21:11,"Poison, poison, poison, anvil."
00:21:11,00:21:13,"Anvil, anvil."
00:21:14,00:21:20,"If you are poisoned with nitric acid, the way to tell is your snot starts to foam."
00:21:20,00:21:22,"Wow, that's cool."
00:21:22,00:21:24,The Agatha Christie's novels.
00:21:24,00:21:28,"So Agatha Christie used to work as a nurse and a pharmacy dispenser during the work,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,where she got a lot of her knowledge about poisons.
00:21:30,00:21:33,Over a half of her character deaths were from poison.
00:21:33,00:21:35,"And there was one case where she, I won't say the book,"
00:21:35,00:21:36,it case it's a spoiler.
00:21:36,00:21:38,"But in one kit novel, she is talian poisoning."
00:21:38,00:21:40,"And she detailed the symptoms so thoroughly, like,"
00:21:40,00:21:42,hair loss and things that go wrong.
00:21:42,00:21:45,That they were then used by people to diagnose real life cases of talian poisoning.
00:21:45,00:21:47,And she saved at least two lives.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"Wow, what a great fact."
00:21:49,00:21:50,That's awesome.
00:21:50,00:21:53,Dogs can be poisoned by eating the feces of drug users.
00:21:53,00:21:55,Just a fact.
00:21:55,00:21:56,It serves them right.
00:21:56,00:21:57,Let's do it.
00:21:57,00:22:01,I read in the New York Times that 2008 was the first time in 30 years
00:22:01,00:22:04,that more people died from poisoning than from car crashes.
00:22:04,00:22:05,"Oh, wow."
00:22:05,00:22:08,"Oh, I see, I found the facts online, which I really like,"
00:22:08,00:22:10,which is that Jack Bauer has killed more people than sharks.
00:22:10,00:22:12,How many sharks has he killed?
00:22:12,00:22:15,"Well, the aquatic series is coming up next, so we'll see you."
00:22:15,00:22:18,Other things that are poisonous.
00:22:18,00:22:21,"Daffodils, old parts of a daffodil plant are poisonous to varying effects."
00:22:21,00:22:24,"If we, if I ate a daffodil, I'd die."
00:22:24,00:22:27,"If you ate too many of them, yeah, you can even if you're trapped"
00:22:27,00:22:29,"in a small space with a daffodil, it'll give you headaches."
00:22:29,00:22:30,I don't know.
00:22:30,00:22:31,I'm weird.
00:22:31,00:22:34,If you're stuck in a lift and the only other passenger is a daffodil.
00:22:34,00:22:34,Yeah.
00:22:34,00:22:37,"I would like to think that after the guy eating a steak,"
00:22:37,00:22:40,"it was like, I'm for our next act."
00:22:40,00:22:42,It's a man in the box with a daffodil.
00:22:42,00:22:46,David Blaine will be with this daffodil in a cupboard for 90 days.
00:22:46,00:22:49,Does that mean if you're going to hospital and you're bringing flowers to someone?
00:22:49,00:22:50,Don't bring that to us.
00:22:50,00:22:51,You're not meant to have flowers at night.
00:22:51,00:22:52,They bring them out of the woods.
00:22:52,00:22:53,Do they?
00:22:53,00:22:55,I think of a pollen or there's some there.
00:22:55,00:22:57,"Well, they'll take oxygen out of the air and release cows outside."
00:22:57,00:22:59,People in hospitals need their oxygen.
00:22:59,00:22:59,"Yeah, but not..."
00:22:59,00:23:01,They do. They take all flowers out of hot woods at night.
00:23:01,00:23:03,"No, I'm not saying they don't take flowers out of the woods."
00:23:03,00:23:07,"I'm just saying, I think the amount of oxygen a daffodil can deal with in a night"
00:23:07,00:23:07,is not going to be asphyxiation.
00:23:07,00:23:09,It's going to be a very ostentatious present.
00:23:09,00:23:11,"Andy, you think you're so hard."
00:23:11,00:23:13,You can sit in a room with a daffodil.
00:23:13,00:23:14,He's not afraid. He'll do it.
00:23:14,00:23:15,He'll see him do it.
00:23:15,00:23:16,Get me one now.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"Yeah, I'm right now."
00:23:17,00:23:19,We're going to put Andy in a room with a daffodil for the next week.
00:23:19,00:23:22,"And if he's not on next week's podcast, you know what's happening to him."
00:23:22,00:23:28,"All right, it's time for our final fact of the episode."
00:23:28,00:23:31,"And that, of course, is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:23:31,00:23:35,My fact this week is that shouting at drivers improves their driving.
00:23:35,00:23:37,That doesn't really work in my experience.
00:23:37,00:23:39,"Yeah, this is under certain circumstances."
00:23:39,00:23:40,I shouldn't clarify.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"If you're listening to this in the car, don't bellow at the driver."
00:23:43,00:23:47,This was a study in Kenya.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"They have a lot of buses, they're called Matatus."
00:23:49,00:23:56,And the initiative was basically to put stickers in buses with appalling images of accidents
00:23:56,00:24:00,and things like that because they have so many traffic accidents and so many deaths.
00:24:00,00:24:01,Right.
00:24:01,00:24:06,And the idea was to get passengers on the buses to stand up and speak up against these
00:24:06,00:24:08,reckless drivers who caused a lot of accidents.
00:24:08,00:24:12,"And they said, ""Look, if the driver's driving badly, look at all these horrible accident photos,"
00:24:12,00:24:15,"like on a packet of cigarettes and speak up."""
00:24:15,00:24:18,And everyone just started shouting at the drivers on these randomly-
00:24:18,00:24:19,Slow down!
00:24:19,00:24:20,"Yeah, you maniac."
00:24:20,00:24:25,And they found that Matatus with these stickers are about half as likely to get into accidents.
00:24:25,00:24:26,But-
00:24:26,00:24:27,"There is, yeah, there's certain effects."
00:24:27,00:24:29,I can't remember what it's called.
00:24:29,00:24:33,There was a factory and they wanted to see if they could improve the outputs.
00:24:33,00:24:35,And they did loads of different things to these people.
00:24:35,00:24:38,"And everything they tried, the output would go up."
00:24:38,00:24:41,"No matter what they tried, they would make the lights a bit brighter, it would work."
00:24:41,00:24:43,"They would make the lights darker, it would work."
00:24:43,00:24:45,"They would try everything, it would always work."
00:24:45,00:24:48,"And just by the fact that you're being tested or you're being studied,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,it makes people try harder because they know someone's watching.
00:24:50,00:24:52,But I do think this did genuinely affect you.
00:24:52,00:24:54,"Yeah, no, it's a really good fact."
00:24:54,00:24:58,So I have a news article about shouting just to slip in.
00:24:58,00:25:02,A dog walker sparked a major search and rescue operation
00:25:02,00:25:05,by calling out for her pet named Yelp.
00:25:06,00:25:09,"And basically, people had heard her shouting ""Yelp, Yelp"""
00:25:09,00:25:11,"and thought she was shouting ""Help, Help."""
00:25:11,00:25:15,And there was a massive operation to try and find this woman who's calling for help.
00:25:15,00:25:18,That's what I think people were calling.
00:25:18,00:25:21,There was like an open shaft nearby and people thought
00:25:21,00:25:23,that their voice was coming from the shaft.
00:25:23,00:25:29,It's quite really good what's put a lost dog ad in the newspaper
00:25:29,00:25:31,"and the ad just read, ""Here, boy."""
00:25:31,00:25:34,That's great.
00:25:34,00:25:40,Was there one of the QI panellists who said that they had a dog called Mingus?
00:25:40,00:25:42,"Oh, it's Ross Noble. Is this Granddad's dog, I think?"
00:25:42,00:25:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:42,00:25:45,"But yes, his dog was named Mingus."
00:25:45,00:25:47,"I can't do the accent, but Ross said."
00:25:47,00:25:49,And the problem with this dog was that he had the same accent as Ross.
00:25:49,00:25:51,"So he goes to the park and be telling ""Mingus, Mingus!"""
00:25:51,00:25:54,"No, the local girls are like, ""Who are you calling?"""
00:25:54,00:25:58,I read earlier that there was an ancient Greek belief that
00:25:58,00:26:01,"""Buzzle would grow better if you shouted curses at it while you were planting it."""
00:26:01,00:26:03,"I haven't properly tried this out, but I liked the sound of it."
00:26:03,00:26:05,Maybe it's because the bees would come and pollinate it.
00:26:05,00:26:07,"Yeah, they would come to the swearing."
00:26:07,00:26:09,"It's an ancient secret, there'll be one Earth."
00:26:09,00:26:13,The effect when you're at a party or something and everyone's talking loud.
00:26:13,00:26:16,So you talk a bit louder and then eventually everyone's talking really loud.
00:26:16,00:26:19,There's a scientifically observed effect called the Lombard effect.
00:26:19,00:26:19,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:19,00:26:22,"And it doesn't just happen to people that happens in animals, too."
00:26:22,00:26:26,"Zebra Finches, quails, hummingbirds, marmosets, beluga whales, orcas, manatees."
00:26:26,00:26:28,"That sounds like a great party, yeah."
00:26:28,00:26:32,"Well, they've discovered that there's a certain type of bird"
00:26:32,00:26:36,"that sings louder now in the city, just back to urban animals."
00:26:36,00:26:36,This people out.
00:26:36,00:26:38,"Yeah, yeah, because of just the city noises."
00:26:38,00:26:40,"I can't remember what it's called, but it's..."
00:26:40,00:26:44,"I'm pretty sure nice and girls sing louder in the cities, but I don't think it's..."
00:26:44,00:26:45,I don't think that's what you're talking about.
00:26:45,00:26:47,Because I want to know if there's a word for that effect
00:26:47,00:26:49,"when you say something awkward, because it's loud,"
00:26:49,00:26:52,"and since you say it, the music cuts out, and that's what gives you shout."
00:26:52,00:26:54,We should call it the unmillar effect.
00:26:54,00:26:55,"Maybe not, that's not a good one."
00:26:55,00:26:57,It's not something good named after me.
00:26:57,00:26:58,"Okay, here's not here."
00:26:58,00:26:59,We should call it the anotizanski effect.
00:27:01,00:27:06,I like just with this original fact of the idea of being shouted out when you're driving a bus.
00:27:06,00:27:10,"I read this great story years ago, which this has reminded me of."
00:27:10,00:27:13,"There was a bridge in China, which famously people would jump off"
00:27:13,00:27:15,and try and commit suicide.
00:27:15,00:27:18,"But if the police got there in time, they would block off the bridge"
00:27:18,00:27:22,and they would have tried to negotiate the guy off the bridge.
00:27:22,00:27:26,"And this one time, they were stuck for like two hours,"
00:27:26,00:27:28,"while this guy was on the edge of the bridge,"
00:27:28,00:27:33,"threatening to kill himself, and this retired soldier was just so sick of the police,"
00:27:33,00:27:35,not being able to negotiate with this guy.
00:27:35,00:27:38,"He just decided, I'm going to do something about this."
00:27:38,00:27:41,"He got out of his car, he went past the police."
00:27:41,00:27:43,"They couldn't stop him, and he went up to the guy,"
00:27:43,00:27:45,and he put his hand out to shake his hand.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"They shook hands, and then he pushed him off the bridge."
00:27:47,00:27:53,"Because he was like, you're holding up the traffic."
00:27:53,00:27:54,"Now, fortunately, when he plunged,"
00:27:54,00:27:59,"he landed on a partially inflated, big bouncy castle that they make."
00:27:59,00:28:02,"You know, there was a children's party going on below."
00:28:02,00:28:04,"No, you know when you're committing suicide,"
00:28:04,00:28:05,they try to lure you down.
00:28:05,00:28:07,"Yeah, they always, for a lot of, if you get there in time,"
00:28:07,00:28:09,"for a lot of suicide people,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,like if there's a fire and they'll have a blanket.
00:28:11,00:28:13,They'll take off your shoes before you plummet.
00:28:13,00:28:16,I have some facts about bad drivers.
00:28:16,00:28:16,Okay.
00:28:16,00:28:19,I spent some of this afternoon doing a theory test online.
00:28:19,00:28:20,"Oh, yeah, how'd you get on?"
00:28:20,00:28:21,I passed.
00:28:21,00:28:22,Did you drive?
00:28:22,00:28:23,"Yeah, you're right."
00:28:23,00:28:24,"I can, yeah."
00:28:24,00:28:25,I got the minimum pass mark.
00:28:25,00:28:27,But I just love these questions.
00:28:27,00:28:28,So here's one.
00:28:28,00:28:30,It's a multiple choice.
00:28:30,00:28:31,I'll just read out the options.
00:28:31,00:28:33,"As you approach a pelican crossing,"
00:28:33,00:28:34,the lights change to green.
00:28:34,00:28:36,Elderly people are halfway across.
00:28:36,00:28:40,You should wait because they will take longer to cross.
00:28:40,00:28:41,"Yeah, that sounds reasonable."
00:28:41,00:28:44,"Wave to them to cross as quickly as they can,"
00:28:44,00:28:47,or rev your engine to make them hurry.
00:28:47,00:28:49,I remember Jenny's and myself.
00:28:49,00:28:50,"And they always were traveling like,"
00:28:50,00:28:51,"""Reg your ends."""
00:28:51,00:28:52,"No, just like, wait and proceed Wednesday."
00:28:53,00:28:57,"I know, there's another one where you're at a lunch occasion"
00:28:57,00:28:59,and you'll have to drive in the evening.
00:28:59,00:29:01,Should you drink nothing?
00:29:01,00:29:04,Have a hot meal with your alcohol.
00:29:04,00:29:09,There was an internet news story a few years ago.
00:29:09,00:29:10,And I'm quite sure it's not true.
00:29:10,00:29:14,But it was supposedly the Chinese theory test.
00:29:14,00:29:17,And some of the questions were so ridiculous.
00:29:17,00:29:19,"One of them was like, ""You knock someone over."
00:29:19,00:29:24,"Do you A, go over, get their intestines and push it back into their potty."""
00:29:24,00:29:29,"Or B, ring for help people to the side."
00:29:29,00:29:31,"Yeah, exactly."
00:29:31,00:29:32,"Well, there's one as man,"
00:29:32,00:29:34,which is an accident casualty as an engine arm.
00:29:34,00:29:36,"They can move freely, but it's bleeding."
00:29:36,00:29:38,Why should you get them to keep it in a raised position?
00:29:38,00:29:40,"Is it A, that will help to reduce the bleeding?"
00:29:40,00:29:43,"B, because it will ease the pain."
00:29:43,00:29:45,"C, it will help them to be seen more easily."
00:29:45,00:29:48,"Or D, to stop them touching other people."
00:29:49,00:29:50,Would they're blood?
00:29:50,00:29:53,That was a real British theory test.
00:29:53,00:29:55,Here's a thing about driving.
00:29:55,00:29:59,You can drive fast enough for speed cameras not to get you.
00:29:59,00:30:01,If you're driving fast enough on a road.
00:30:01,00:30:02,How fast do you have to be going?
00:30:02,00:30:05,Only 119 million miles per hour.
00:30:05,00:30:07,"Top gear, we're with you."
00:30:07,00:30:11,"When they invented the speed cameras themselves to encourage speeding initially,"
00:30:11,00:30:11,wasn't it?
00:30:11,00:30:13,It was the racing driver who invented the equipment.
00:30:13,00:30:16,"Yeah, that's how he was doing on the curves and corners."
00:30:16,00:30:17,"Yeah, okay."
00:30:17,00:30:18,I have a fact about car insurance.
00:30:18,00:30:22,Which is the very first policy was written by Lloyds in 1904.
00:30:22,00:30:23,And it had never been done before.
00:30:23,00:30:24,And so there were no guidelines.
00:30:24,00:30:26,There were completely started from scratch.
00:30:26,00:30:29,And so all the documents referred to it as a ship navigating on land.
00:30:29,00:30:32,"Nice, nice, like it."
00:30:32,00:30:34,"I have a fact about that guy, Gatso."
00:30:34,00:30:35,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:35,00:30:37,He died in 1998.
00:30:37,00:30:39,He was caught out by his own cameras all the time.
00:30:39,00:30:41,"And he himself said,"
00:30:41,00:30:44,"""I am often caught by my own speed cameras and find hefty finds on my door mat."
00:30:44,00:30:46,Even I can't escape my own invention.
00:30:46,00:30:47,"Because I love speeding."""
00:30:47,00:30:49,He said all of that.
00:30:49,00:30:54,"Just with the shouting thing,"
00:30:54,00:30:57,shouting obviously sometimes can just really make you feel good as well.
00:30:57,00:30:59,But there was a study that was done.
00:30:59,00:31:01,And this did win an egg Nobel.
00:31:01,00:31:02,We've mentioned egg Nobel.
00:31:02,00:31:05,"One of our previous guests was Mark Abrams, who runs the whole thing."
00:31:05,00:31:10,"Oh, and the ward was given to Richard Stevens and some others at Keele University"
00:31:10,00:31:13,who confirmed that swearing relieves pain.
00:31:13,00:31:14,"Yeah, I remember that."
00:31:14,00:31:14,Yeah.
00:31:14,00:31:16,"Yeah, it's called Lalo Chizia."
00:31:16,00:31:17,Yeah.
00:31:17,00:31:21,6% of drivers will deliberately swerve to kill animals they see on the road.
00:31:21,00:31:22,"Oh, 6%."
00:31:22,00:31:22,"Well, that's pretty low."
00:31:22,00:31:23,That's not.
00:31:23,00:31:24,"No, these words then will swerve the same way."
00:31:24,00:31:25,"Yeah, exactly."
00:31:25,00:31:28,And the way that they worked that out is there was a study done.
00:31:28,00:31:30,"And they got like plastic animals,"
00:31:30,00:31:33,like a little plastic snake or a plastic scorpion or something.
00:31:33,00:31:36,And they were put it on the side of the road where people weren't driving.
00:31:36,00:31:38,And they would count how many of them sweared.
00:31:38,00:31:39,"Oh, you didn't say it was a snake or a scorpion."
00:31:39,00:31:43,I thought you were imagining an elk or a puppy or a penguin.
00:31:43,00:31:45,I was like with my hedgehog facts.
00:31:45,00:31:46,I never really met a man.
00:31:46,00:31:47,And he would drive around.
00:31:47,00:31:50,"And if he found roadkill hedgehogs, he would take them,"
00:31:50,00:31:53,"make a clay cast of them, then put them back on the road"
00:31:53,00:31:53,as a permanent marker.
00:31:53,00:31:55,So people would notice how many deaths they'd be in.
00:31:55,00:31:56,Wow.
00:31:56,00:31:57,Wow.
00:31:57,00:31:58,There's someone else who drives around
00:31:58,00:32:00,cooking roadkill and eating it.
00:32:00,00:32:01,So maybe they're partners.
00:32:01,00:32:03,He's tried loads of stuff.
00:32:03,00:32:04,"Yeah, he keeps eating this concrete."
00:32:04,00:32:07,Hard and teeth.
00:32:07,00:32:08,I wanted to just thinking about that.
00:32:08,00:32:11,Someone putting a plastic snake on the side of the road.
00:32:11,00:32:12,I wonder how many times a day
00:32:12,00:32:15,just even the four of us are being secretly tested
00:32:15,00:32:16,by scientists.
00:32:16,00:32:18,Like there's just so many of these experiments going around.
00:32:18,00:32:20,What about that Facebook thing the other day?
00:32:20,00:32:21,"Oh, that's strange."
00:32:21,00:32:22,"See, when you log on to Facebook,"
00:32:22,00:32:23,you don't see everything.
00:32:23,00:32:25,You see a selection that Facebook chooses to show you.
00:32:25,00:32:26,And they started skewing it.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"So you'd see, like, sort of pessimistic updates"
00:32:28,00:32:30,from your email friends.
00:32:30,00:32:31,And then they'd watch you see if you then
00:32:31,00:32:34,posted a more sad update if they could affect your mood
00:32:34,00:32:35,by what they showed you.
00:32:35,00:32:36,Wow.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"It's a fairly uncontroversial finding, I think,"
00:32:38,00:32:41,that if you see a load of miserable status
00:32:41,00:32:42,as you'll feel a bit glum.
00:32:42,00:32:44,"I'll tell you, hate all your friends, which I do."
00:32:44,00:32:46,So you've got the shine Friday.
00:32:46,00:32:47,"Yeah, I was delighted."
00:32:47,00:32:49,I post a lot of cheery statuses.
00:32:49,00:32:50,Great to see Neville lost his job.
00:32:50,00:32:52,It's Neville.
00:32:52,00:32:55,"So it is controversial though,"
00:32:55,00:32:58,because they're experimenting on people
00:32:58,00:32:59,who haven't given their permission.
00:32:59,00:33:00,That's a big no-go.
00:33:00,00:33:00,I'm not saying it's not.
00:33:00,00:33:01,I'm not saying it's not.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"Yeah, but presumably the snake's on a road isn't."
00:33:03,00:33:05,"Well, the rubber snake can't give him"
00:33:05,00:33:06,full consent for two reasons.
00:33:06,00:33:09,"For many, many."
00:33:09,00:33:11,I'm sort of the driver.
00:33:11,00:33:12,I don't know who you are.
00:33:12,00:33:16,"OK, we should wrap up."
00:33:16,00:33:18,Has anyone got any last minifacts on the trend?
00:33:18,00:33:19,"Yeah, go for it."
00:33:19,00:33:20,"We're especially from our first fact book,"
00:33:20,00:33:23,"""1-2-7-Q-I-Facts,"" which is that Schimpfloss"
00:33:23,00:33:25,"is a German 24-hour hotline,"
00:33:25,00:33:27,which allows customers to release
00:33:27,00:33:29,pen to progression by swearing at the telephone operators.
00:33:29,00:33:31,Have you seen things dressed?
00:33:31,00:33:31,Give them a call.
00:33:31,00:33:32,That's what they're doing.
00:33:32,00:33:33,Do you have the number by any chance?
00:33:33,00:33:34,"I don't, but hopefully we can put it on our website."
00:33:34,00:33:35,"Yeah, we can send it."
00:33:35,00:33:36,We'll put it on our website.
00:33:36,00:33:42,"1-800-AAAGH! OK, that's it. That's all of our facts."
00:33:42,00:33:43,"Thanks, everyone, for listening to this episode."
00:33:43,00:33:45,And no such thing as a fish.
00:33:45,00:33:47,And if you want to talk to any of us about the things
00:33:47,00:33:49,"that we said on this episode,"
00:33:49,00:33:51,you can reach us all on our Twitter handles.
00:33:51,00:33:53,I'm on @SriberlandJames.
00:33:53,00:33:54,@egshapedan.
00:33:54,00:33:56,@miller_an.
00:33:56,00:33:58,Andy @undruhunterm.
00:33:58,00:33:59,We'll be back again next week.
00:33:59,00:34:00,And we'll see you then.
00:34:00,00:34:01,Goodbye.
00:34:03,00:34:07,"Hi, everybody. We recorded that podcast actually a couple of days ago."
00:34:07,00:34:11,"And since then, Andy and Dan have gone to the Edinburgh Festival."
00:34:11,00:34:13,"So if you find yourself in the Edinburgh area,"
00:34:13,00:34:15,you might want to go and watch their shows.
00:34:15,00:34:16,They have two each.
00:34:16,00:34:19,Andy is doing two improv shows.
00:34:19,00:34:20,One is called ostentatious.
00:34:20,00:34:22,And the other is called Folly Adder.
00:34:22,00:34:25,And Dan is doing his first one-hour comedy show
00:34:25,00:34:27,called Cockblocked From Outer Space.
00:34:27,00:34:30,"And he will also be producing Museum of Curiosity,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,which is the QI radio show.
00:34:32,00:34:35,And they'll be doing a live show in Edinburgh as well.
00:34:35,00:34:39,"So if you're a fan of their voices, why not go along?"
00:34:39,00:34:45,The laws are on their way.
00:34:45,00:34:52,"And this time, there's no escape."
