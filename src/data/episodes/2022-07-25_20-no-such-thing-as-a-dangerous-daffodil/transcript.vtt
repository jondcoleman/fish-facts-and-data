00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
 - We run it on QI a few years ago. - Yeah.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.680
 - Which was, there's no such thing as a fish. - You did a nice, such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.860
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.720
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:24.320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.420
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.360
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting at a table with Ann Miller, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.040
 And once again, we've gathered around with our favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.440
 and in no particular order, here they are.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.860
 Okay, fact number one, and that's you, James.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.680
 Okay, my fact is that the most painful place to be stung by a bee is your nostril.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.100
 - Is it? - It is.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.820
 So a bee inside your nose.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.500
 Yeah, just the inside of your nostril apparently, it's the worst place to be stung.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.020
 - How do you know this? - Well, I know this because there was a Cornell University student

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.540
 called Michael Smith, who decided to let bees sting him on all different parts of his body

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.620
 and find out which was the most painful.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.100
 - When he say, "Oh, do you mean actually all?" - Well, the main ones.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.900
 - The main ones. - The main ones.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.820
 - The skin. - The main ones are my hands and my feet.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.060
 Yeah, I want to put nostril on my head shoulder's knees and toes, obviously.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.340
 I'd say inside your mouth's fully pretty bad. - Yes. - Or your ears, like things that are touching your ears.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.220
 - Did he do it on his penis? That's what we're all dancing around.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.100
 - I know. - Well, you might be dancing around your penis.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.100
 - I would be of a bee, it's stung it.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.940
 - He did, yes.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.580
 He did it on the number of different parts of his body, and he gave them marks out of ten

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.100
 for how painful they were, and the nostril was 9.0.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.220
 The upper lip was 8.7, and the penis was the third worst place to be stung, and it was 7.3 out of ten.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.820
 - Wow. - He had one bee, which he would hold beside his body in order to make it sting him.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.780
 - And a poor bee. Just put back in the box afterwards.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.860
 - Oh, thank god that's over, then half an hour later.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.180
 - Oh, here we go.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.380
 - Is it true that bees don't die after stinging you?

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.820
 - Mammals have tougher skin.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.020
 So if they sting a mammal, there's a higher chance of the sting being left behind

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.020
 and then the bee, not surviving.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.660
 However, if they sting other insects, which is what they normally sting, then they're fine.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.980
 They can sting them repeatedly.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.140
 - Do you know what a bee does if it can't sting you if you're too small to be stung?

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.900
 - If you're too small to be stung, you're going to be arrested and arrested.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.380
 - They're not a human, like an insect.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.980
 - Oh, like an insect. - Come on in between your nose.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.580
 - Yes, yeah. I know, what does it do?

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.780
 - They bite. - They bite.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.940
 - And their bites have a chemical in their basically paralyzes their prey, so they can turn them out of their hives.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.660
 And they might be able to be used in human medicine for anesthetics.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:52.340
 Actually, the theme tune to our podcast "Wosps" by Ampere Yes, the song is all about how bees survive a wasp attack

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.140
 when they come into their nest, which is that they heat it up by vibrating inside.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.140
 And they can sustain within their own body a certain amount of heat, which is higher than a wasp heat.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.380
 So they literally cook the wasp inside the hive.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.220
 - That's awesome.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.780
 - We also should mention the least painful places, just in case you have a supervillain say.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.780
 - It's all about bees-beasting, YouTube.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.700
 - Well, all of your shoe would be, yeah.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.660
 - It would be amazing. - I'll look at that.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.980
 - But on the body, the skull tip of the middle toe, apparently, and upper arm, they're all very low rated 2.3.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.220
 - I read about this horrible thing in New Zealand, where they're selling the venom face masks.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.020
 So the idea is that it works like a natural bullshocks in it, so they need about 20 hives to harvest one gram of this venom.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.500
 And they claim a mixture of skin and feel firmer, it makes it, you know, like you've had a facelift.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.580
 - But there are told you say there's no benefits, and actually it can cause you quite severe medical problems.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.940
 - Bees can fly higher than Mount Everest.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.780
 We did a thing about landing a helicopter on Mount Everest, which is incredibly difficult and dangerous,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.380
 because the air is so thin up there that even with the speed of helicopters, the rotor blades go at,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.580
 it's almost impossible to do.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.100
 - But someone has done it, and has done it, yeah.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.460
 - But it wasn't a bee, just to clarify.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.020
 - Well, Edmund Hilary, he was a beekeeper, and he actually was his beekeeping job that funded his trip to get to Mount Everest, yeah.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.260
 - Yeah, he put it on his passport when they asked what his job was, he said he was a beekeeper.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.220
 - Oh, that's awesome.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.620
 - Yeah, other famous beekeepers, Sherlock Holmes.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.060
 - Yes, he retired to become a beekeeper.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.260
 - He retired as a beekeeper.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.460
 - Yeah, Aristotle as well, was a beekeeper.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:24.300
 And he made this really odd claim that they survived for seven years, when in fact they survived for seven weeks.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.220
 So either he thought, "Well, they're still here," and just didn't recognize that he had new born bees.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.580
 - Oh, he was a dog.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.620
 - Oh my god, yeah.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.580
 - Wow, Aristotle.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.780
 - We just blend this thing wider.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.060
 - Yeah.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.740
 - I saw everything in the news, in the news a few weeks ago, that Norfolk police are warning people to be aware of bee rustlers.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.540
 They've been turning up in the night and stealing hives full of thousands of bees.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.020
 - Oh really?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.540
 - So that's quite a high risk, fair.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.500
 - Yeah, wow.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.260
 - Germany has fantastic bee laws, and roughly broken down their this.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:56.300
 If bees break away from a hive, they are only still your bees if you're in pursuit.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.860
 So as long as you're in pursuit, they are your bees.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.540
 So there is nowhere off limits to you.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.540
 If you have to run into the houses of parliament there, you can because you're just here to your bees.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.940
 - Yeah.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.780
 - You're exactly like this from this law.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.260
 - Yeah.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.620
 - If they then land in the hive of someone else's farm, and it's an empty hive,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.940
 then you can break that hive down, collect your bees and bring it back and just replace the hive.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.140
 If it lands in a hive that's full of bees, then the other owner is just acquired some new bees.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.260
 Now the best law of the whole thing is that if you're in pursuit of your bees,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.940
 there's a law that states that if you see someone else in pursuit of their bees,

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.260
 and your two bee colonies collide and turn into one swarm,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.740
 you are now the co-owner of these bees.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.980
 - You're in business with the hive, they're in business.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.980
 - Yeah, if he drops out of pursuit, then it's your business.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.340
 - You're in buzziness more like.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.180
 Can I quickly tell you about bee bids?

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.740
 Please do.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.380
 - Ooh, yeah.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.060
 - This is an article by beekeeper on beeinformed.org.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.980
 Nice, but the article reads,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.540
 "Having about 10,000 bees on your face is one of the best ways to demonstrate how calm and fun

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.220
 bees can be."

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.740
 And so the idea is that, so step one, prepare the bees,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.620
 step two, prepare the person, step three, add bees, step four, remove bees.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.660
 Because of the more detail on how you do all of these things.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.820
 So basically you attach them to your chin,

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.380
 and you have to put Vaseline on your eyes and you have to put Coffin in your ears.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.900
 - How do you attach them to your chin?

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.020
 Is it like on each hair and your chin or something?

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.180
 - You put a queen bee just below your chin and the bees swarm to her.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.860
 - How do you get her?

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.180
 - You spray the bees with sugar syrup,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.860
 and then the assistant will tie the queen around your head so the queen is under your chin,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.180
 and then you just hold a tray on your belly and the assistant dumps all the bees into the tray,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.780
 and they just gather to the queen.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.260
 - Okay.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.100
 - And you've got a massive beard made of bees.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.580
 However, he does point out he's never done this without being stung at least once or twice.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.260
 - I want to know what would happen if you were in Germany and you were chasing your bees,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.100
 and they all gathered on some guy's face.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.220
 - You get on him.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.060
 There is a myth about bees, according to the internet.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.660
 This is a common misconception amongst some people that bees hate bad language

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.540
 and will sting those who swear in their presence.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.700
 - I heard that if you kill, I think it works for bees, Andrew, whilst if you kill them,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.460
 you need to get out of there quick because if you kill them,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.820
 they release a chemical to warn their hive mates that there's danger.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.740
 - They can do that even if they're still alive.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.260
 - There was something in the news this week that they found that gorillas communicate by BL.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.660
 - I mean, you mean gorilla gorillas, not gorilla warriors.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.660
 - Philogastro just raised an arm.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.300
 - Well, yes, Arifat used to just fart whenever he wanted to because that was his kind of thing.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.340
 It was his intimidation.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.620
 - To clear the room.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.060
 - It was just his thing.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.060
 He got so much joy and we have the room to ourselves, please.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.180
 He does make a presence.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:47.180
 I was reading that urban bees, they've completely evolved.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.940
 So there was a study done in Toronto that showed that three out of eight

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:56.060
 alfalfa leaf cutter bees have nests that are made up of shredded plastic bags.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.260
 Apparently, they use us as sort of salt licks, like us humans.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.140
 - Lots of insects drink animals tears together.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:07.180
 - We did on QI a few years ago that there was a company developing bee bomb detectors

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.900
 and trained bees to stick out their tongue at the smell of explosives and things like that.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.380
 - Wow.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.940
 - You know how you use smoke to pacify bees?

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:17.900
 Do you know how that works?

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.180
 - No.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.300
 It doesn't make them drowsy as you might think in the normal way.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.660
 They think they're in trouble and so they eat up all of the honey

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.940
 and because they eat up so much, they're so full.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.340
 They can't really do anything and they're just waddling around

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.460
 and they're not attacking people.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.460
 I think that's how the smoke stuff works.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.180
 - That's great.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:35.900
 - That's great, isn't it?

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.820
 - I really hope it will be by getting them addicted to the smoke

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.220
 and so that they just want another cigarette.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.180
 - Well, there is a study where they tried to get some bees addicted to narcotics

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.860
 to see how it affected the bees.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.660
 - Well, it could possibly go wrong.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.740
 - Yeah, so they got some bees hooked to cocaine.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.940
 And according to the results,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.780
 the cocaine-turned-good bees,

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.540
 productive members of the hive,

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.780
 into untrustworthy bees.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.220
 - Grace will hand it up a morph as well.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.700
 - No, I think...

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.700
 - He has an untrustworthy bee behaviour, Dan.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.100
 - I think, if I remember this study correctly,

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.540
 bees will do a little dance to say how much honey they have.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.900
 Yeah, call the waggle dance.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.980
 And the ones who had taken cocaine would do that.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.460
 We've got lots of honey dance when actually they should have done that.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.580
 We didn't really find much honey.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.020
 We mostly found cocaine dance.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.900
 - That's amazing.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.500
 - We found more than anyone else has ever found.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.460
 You've got to come. You've got to come and look.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.060
 - What about drunk bees? Do you know about them?

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:22.860
 - No.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.380
 - So you're sitting in a corner and getting a bit sad?

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.740
 - Yeah, it is a bit like that.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.780
 They have more flying accidents than sober ones.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.820
 And they can sometimes forget how to get back to the hive and die as a result.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.420
 And if they do make it back to the hive,

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.500
 then they can be rounded on by other bees who punish them by chewing off their legs.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.020
 - So they're legless.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.020
 - Okay, let's move on to fact B, fact number two.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.460
 Just a call back there.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.340
 Yeah, okay, this is my fact.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.420
 And this fact is that Walt Disney used to eat breakfast like all of us.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.180
 But his favorite breakfast was fresh doughnuts dunked in scotch.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.740
 - That's why the national dish of Scotland.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.380
 - He's one of those people who, when you look into him,

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.820
 just comes up with so many extraordinary little facts about him

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.820
 that you would never have known.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.740
 And I'm surprised that we do know, I'm surprised that we do know that he dunked his doughnuts in scotch.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.660
 I'm surprised that we know that he used to keep his testicles on ice.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.180
 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, he dunked his scotch.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.060
 - That was on ice.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.260
 - He was his testicles.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.140
 He used to put his balls on ice because he had a low sperm count and he thought that would help.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.500
 - He's in the electronics room, is that it?

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.300
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.380
 - Yeah, the rest of him isn't frozen.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.500
 It's just his testicles.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.140
 - It's just his balls.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.340
 - When we regenerate him.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.740
 - Isn't he an almost pair of balls?

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:49.740
 - There's a guy called Josh Schumacher in America and he's painted a thing called Snowballs.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.820
 And these are pants that come with a special integrated pocket

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.260
 that cools the man's nether regions in an effort to boost his sperm count.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:57.820
 - Ah.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.820
 - And the awkward Christmas is sorted.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.860
 - Yeah.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.140
 For the man who has everything.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.900
 - Colder testicles.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.540
 - Um, a scariest way I went around a few years ago.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.380
 That Iron Blue lowered your sperm count.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.020
 - Really?

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.900
 - You basically would stuff the Scottish reproduction rates.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.940
 I think it turned out not to be true.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:17.580
 - Um, Chinese Unix would keep their testicles in a jar

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.180
 in the hope that they would arrive complete in the next world after they died.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.740
 - Oh my god.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.340
 - I just moved house and I, you know, I'm getting rid of a lot of my old stuff.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.020
 I can imagine finding your testicles in a drawer or something and thinking,

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.220
 "I will hang on to these."

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.980
 - Yeah, everyone's got one of those drawers at home.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:32.460
 Haven't they?

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.820
 It just starts and ends like old batteries, jars of testicles.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.180
 - What happens to foreskins?

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:37.820
 - What do you mean?

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.860
 - On circumcision.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.980
 Some of them can be used in cosmetics.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.780
 - Yeah.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.780
 - And they're not really supposed to be face masks.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.740
 - I know, they're used as artificial eyelashers.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.220
 They're just, no, they're not actually.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.100
 - Oh my god.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.700
 - No, there was a bit of a, a bit of a thing a couple of years ago

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.500
 that some hospitals have been taking the,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.660
 removed fastkins from children and they've been using them

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.220
 to make cosmetics without the patient's consent.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.380
 - I did work experience in the hospital when I was younger

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.780
 and I was in an operating theater and they had a sign on the world

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.220
 about different kinds of bins.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.460
 And after I made it, I was, I think it was the orange bin

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.980
 was for human body parts.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.620
 - Oh.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.860
 - I never saw one, but I love the wary of one.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.100
 - That's like recycling gum, mad, isn't it?

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.420
 It's like, you're going to put it in your green bin

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.940
 or your brown bin or your orange bin.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.900
 - I didn't pay for it.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.940
 - Walt Disney.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.300
 What do we have about him?

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.220
 - Something I didn't know about Walt was that he was the voice of Mickey.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.980
 - There are lots of Mickey Mouse's and one of the actors

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.540
 played Mickey Mouse, married lady who played Minnie Mouse.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.340
 Which is very nice.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.140
 - Oh, that's good.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.020
 - That is good.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.620
 - And cows in Mickey Mouse.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.260
 There was a complaint that the otters were too big

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.460
 when it first came out.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:42.940
 - Oh, really?

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.700
 - And they said pictures in the future

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.860
 will have small or invisible otters.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.380
 Quite unlike the gargantuan organ whose antics have laked,

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.700
 her shocked some and convulsed others.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.060
 - I get a lot of those letters too.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.260
 - I found that yesterday.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.460
 This is not really related,

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.380
 but from the Mickey and Minnie thing.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.300
 Do you know Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas?

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:02.700
 - Yeah.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.540
 - Was someone in peanuts?

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.340
 - What?

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.100
 - I forgot the name of the character in peanuts.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.180
 The one with blonde curly hair.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.580
 Her voice was done in the 80s by Fergie.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.820
 It was the first thing she ever did when she was like nine years old.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.340
 - Okay, I've just googled it.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.860
 She played Sally.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.420
 - That's right.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.460
 - That's a really good fact.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:18.940
 - Yeah.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.860
 - Just one other related fact to people behind the characters.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.140
 Ariel and Bell.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.900
 So Ariel from the lore mermaid and Bell from Beauty and the Beast.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.740
 They were both based on a real-life model.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.420
 Whose name was Cherie Stoner.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.180
 And they used all of her mannerisms.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.020
 So there's very famously, Ariel does this thing where she kind of blows her hair

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.660
 in frustration and her hair bows.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.700
 That was just Cherie just improvising in the moment.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.700
 - Cherie also had the tail of the fish.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.340
 - She did it.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.780
 So I mean, it was very convenient.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.980
 But she wasn't just a model because then she became a part of the family.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.100
 And she was the writer and producer for the Animaniacs

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.380
 and Casper, the friendly ghost.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:54.860
 - Oh really?

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.460
 - Yeah, she was like a proper...

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.180
 - That's pretty good.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.220
 That reminds me of a fact about the Statue of Liberty.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.660
 It was designed by Bertoldy.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.420
 I think he based the body of the Statue of Liberty on his mistress

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.860
 and the face on his mother.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.620
 - Oh, that's not a five-bed.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.340
 - Which is a little bit pro-idean, isn't it?

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.860
 - But that's like Justin's mother will be very statuesque, if so.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.940
 - Maybe she's wore a big tiara all the time.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:17.820
 - Maybe.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.620
 Justin Pollard, one of the other QILs.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.220
 In his book, Seeker Britain, he talks about how the roles

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.380
 Royce, the Statue, the spirit of ecstasy,

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.580
 is based on the mistress of Mr. Royce.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.100
 Was it, yeah, well, one of them.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.420
 It was their mistress, who died in a boating accident.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.220
 And it was his tribute to her to people alive forever.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.540
 Yeah, so that's his mistress on the front of the car.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.540
 Let's talk about breakfast.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.420
 There was a study done saying that if you eat cake for breakfast,

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.020
 it's really good if you're on a diet.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.140
 And they got a load of overweight people.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.140
 And they gave them cake for breakfast.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.940
 That was the only difference in any of their lifestyle.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.300
 And they all lost weight.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.340
 And the idea is that if you eat the sugary stuff in the morning,

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.980
 you're less likely to snack on it during the day.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.340
 Wow.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.580
 So a bowl of special K and a bowl of frosties

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.340
 have only a one calorie difference.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.980
 And it's the special K that are more calorific.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.540
 Whoa.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.980
 So you're better off eating frosties.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.780
 Well, really.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.540
 The iron that you get added to cereals,

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.900
 if you have a good enough magnet,

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.620
 you can get the iron filings out of the cereal.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.580
 There's a way of doing that.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.500
 There's videos on YouTube of how to do it.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.220
 Oh, that's awesome.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:22.700
 Yeah.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.660
 Disney World.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.460
 Yes.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.460
 Is the second largest purchaser of explosives in the US?

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.860
 They're just for their fireworks or are they taken to terrorism?

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.660
 No, it's fireworks.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.180
 But after the military is number one.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.620
 All that planning is something really big.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.340
 Actually, that reminds me of the fact

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.060
 that I almost used for the podcast this week.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.780
 I read it on a website called Collector's Weekly.com.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.780
 And they said that before they had fireworks,

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.420
 what they would do is they would get two anvils,

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.940
 turn one of them upside down,

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.460
 put it on top of the other one,

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.620
 put explosives in between them,

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.460
 set fire to the explosives so that the anvil would fly into the sky.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.660
 What could possibly go wrong?

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.820
 I know, and it caused all sorts of problems,

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.340
 people getting injured and what have you.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.540
 But hang on.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.380
 It's the cartoon trope of someone being killed

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.900
 by a massive anvil falling on them.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.260
 Something that was a real risk.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:07.740
 Yeah.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.500
 The weather's going to be heavy anvils today

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.860
 with scattered hammers.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.820
 [LAUGHS]

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:17.740
 OK, it is time now to move on to fact number three.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.500
 And that is you, Anne.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.380
 Yes, my fact is that the French used to call Arsonic

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.180
 "poudre de sucession" or "inheritance powder"

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.340
 because it was used in so many murders.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.620
 That was obviously not sort of on the tin.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.420
 Yeah, then the pharmacy, I would say, inheritance powder.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.140
 No, it was actually, Arsonic was used quite a lot at this point

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.020
 because it was used to kill rats.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.660
 And they actually also used Arsonic to colour their wallpaper green.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.620
 So there were quite a lot of cases

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.020
 where people would have this sort of symptoms.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.540
 And when they went to the seaside, it would clear up

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.820
 because they were away from their wallpaper

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.300
 and this sort of lingering Arsonicness was there.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.860
 Wasn't Napoleon supposedly poisoned?

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.700
 But I mean, that was the myth, wasn't it?

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.500
 Yeah, there's a myth.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.860
 People are pretty sure these days that he died of stomach cancer.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.780
 Not a lot of wallpaper.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.180
 That's the weird Philan on the official form,

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.620
 "Calls of Death" wallpaper.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.380
 That was almost anvil, anvil, anvil, wallpaper.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.020
 It's like that, either that wallpaper goes or I will.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.140
 Yeah, he was that, he said that.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.180
 Oscar Wilde.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.380
 Turns out he didn't say that.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.180
 He said something like it, but he said it days before he died.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.180
 And I don't think he kind of went,

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.180
 "Oh, that was a pretty good end line, I'm just going to leave it there."

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.900
 He lived on for another 30 years in complete silence.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.420
 Yeah. But there's Arsonic that.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.060
 So I got it from Lucy Worsley's book about Modos,

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.780
 which is really interesting.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.020
 It's all about how the British can do years of recess

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.380
 about reading about Modos.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.060
 The Arsonic itself, it was problematic,

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.420
 because it didn't have a smell.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.740
 And the symptoms are very similar to cholera.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.420
 And you couldn't trace it at all until some chemists developed the marsh test,

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.340
 which is how you could separate Arsonic and prove someone had it.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.220
 Before that, there was no way of proving that you had taken Arsonic.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.020
 So it was there?

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.340
 It's not supposed to smell of garlic when you heat it up, or something.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.300
 Yes, I read that as well.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.820
 When you heat it, it's...

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.060
 Maybe they weren't cooking it.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.460
 Yeah, or maybe they were putting it in garlic bread.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.940
 One of the best tests for the presence of Arsonic

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.020
 was developed by Samuel Haneman,

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.260
 who is the guy who invented homeopathy.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.500
 So that was one of his more successful...

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.460
 Could his test detect like one part in 10 billion?

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.980
 You do need a small amount, though, to live.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:16.700
 They've tested it.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.900
 Yeah, you have it in your body.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.140
 Yeah, so they've tested on chickens and rats.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.900
 They've given them a diet, normal diet,

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.940
 but only without Arsonic, and they grow up standard.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.860
 So they don't know whether it's essential for humans,

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.460
 because I don't think it's done that kind of experiment.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.700
 But isn't it in lipstick as well?

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.380
 In some things, yeah, there's some traces in the USA, I think.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.780
 I think it's not allowed in any British cosmetics.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:42.300
 In the US, you're allowed up to three parts per million of Arsonic in lipstick.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.420
 Wow, to you.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.660
 I was like, really grim stuff, but food isn't there, right?

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.940
 You had like one hair, or have many grams, and one dead fly.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.180
 One rodent hair, per jar, and three up to three maggots.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.380
 One testicle.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.180
 One testicle, as long as it's Walt Disney's.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.380
 In your frozen peas.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.500
 But they used to think it was good for us,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.500
 and they, because it was prescribed for a lot of medication.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.300
 Yeah.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.300
 Diabetes, tuberculosis, malaria.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.660
 Here, Carlos Arsonic.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.500
 Yeah, pretty much everything.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.500
 It was, it was a pick me up.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.460
 The cure also.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.700
 Yeah, there was a medicine called Dr. Fowler's solution,

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.020
 which was used to treat females.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.780
 And it's just a solution with potassium arsenide.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.460
 Watered down with lavender water.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.380
 And you would take a few drops with a glass of wine.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.660
 Charles Dickens had it.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.420
 It was used a cural, tonic, aphrodisiac, treat snake bites, malaria,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.820
 epilepsy, morning sickness, diarrhea.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.860
 You name it.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.220
 There was also Dr. Roses Arsonic complexion wafers.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:39.020
 They were advertised as being simply magical for the complexion.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.580
 I've got another fact from Lucie Worsi's book, which I really love,

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.820
 which is Madame Tussard's Chamber of Horrors,

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.460
 which, which, namely, is just called the other chamber,

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.700
 sort of full with models of murder as you go and look at them.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.700
 And during the First World War,

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.420
 trainee soldiers used to be set in the initiation test

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.660
 to go and hide in the chamber and spend the whole night there.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.260
 And it became such a pest that Madame Tussard had to officially ask the war

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.860
 for us to stop them doing this.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:01.860
 Oh, wow.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.860
 You're sneaking in.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.060
 I have a fact that you like Annabar Arsonic.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.500
 And that is that hedgehogs are immune to arsenic poisoning.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.300
 So hedgehogs?

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.700
 I like a good hedgehog fact.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.700
 You can build up a resistance to Arsonic.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.940
 If you try your hardest, which is good news.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.140
 Yeah, there was some peasants in the Stirian Alps.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.980
 It's several centuries ago who ate massive chunks of arsenic twice a week

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.900
 and they claimed it improved the complexion.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.700
 So not far off.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.300
 Ah, really?

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.700
 And scientists said, now that's ridiculous, arsenic's very poisonous.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.700
 And they're like, well, how come our skin is so good?

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.740
 How come I'm going after a day in the field?

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:40.220
 But then there was a meeting in 1875 of the Association of German Scientists

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.300
 at which a peasant ate twice the fatal dose of arsenic trioxide

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.420
 before a big audience.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.380
 And they tested him afterwards and they tested his urine, which is how you tell me.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.180
 Wow, before a big audience, it's like people were easily enthained in those days.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.540
 Well, they didn't have transformers, didn't they?

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.220
 Can't watch a man, he might die.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.860
 Yeah, I'd watch that, like a shot.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.420
 I think it's like an early version of man versus food.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.780
 But versus poison.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.980
 Yeah, that's a great step.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.660
 Today, man one, but next time.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.980
 Poison, poison, poison, anvil.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.820
 Anvil, anvil.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:20.860
 If you are poisoned with nitric acid, the way to tell is your snot starts to foam.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.780
 Wow, that's cool.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.620
 The Agatha Christie's novels.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.780
 So Agatha Christie used to work as a nurse and a pharmacy dispenser during the work,

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.460
 where she got a lot of her knowledge about poisons.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.100
 Over a half of her character deaths were from poison.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.340
 And there was one case where she, I won't say the book,

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.300
 it case it's a spoiler.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.700
 But in one kit novel, she is talian poisoning.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.940
 And she detailed the symptoms so thoroughly, like,

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.540
 hair loss and things that go wrong.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.900
 That they were then used by people to diagnose real life cases of talian poisoning.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.340
 And she saved at least two lives.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.180
 Wow, what a great fact.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.220
 That's awesome.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.340
 Dogs can be poisoned by eating the feces of drug users.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.420
 Just a fact.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.380
 It serves them right.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.580
 Let's do it.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.580
 I read in the New York Times that 2008 was the first time in 30 years

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.620
 that more people died from poisoning than from car crashes.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.820
 Oh, wow.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.060
 Oh, I see, I found the facts online, which I really like,

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.860
 which is that Jack Bauer has killed more people than sharks.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.460
 How many sharks has he killed?

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.980
 Well, the aquatic series is coming up next, so we'll see you.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.140
 Other things that are poisonous.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.980
 Daffodils, old parts of a daffodil plant are poisonous to varying effects.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.140
 If we, if I ate a daffodil, I'd die.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.100
 If you ate too many of them, yeah, you can even if you're trapped

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.820
 in a small space with a daffodil, it'll give you headaches.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.860
 I don't know.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.660
 I'm weird.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.460
 If you're stuck in a lift and the only other passenger is a daffodil.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:34.940
 Yeah.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.820
 I would like to think that after the guy eating a steak,

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.300
 it was like, I'm for our next act.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.300
 It's a man in the box with a daffodil.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.220
 David Blaine will be with this daffodil in a cupboard for 90 days.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.820
 Does that mean if you're going to hospital and you're bringing flowers to someone?

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.460
 Don't bring that to us.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.740
 You're not meant to have flowers at night.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.940
 They bring them out of the woods.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.420
 Do they?

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.100
 I think of a pollen or there's some there.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.820
 Well, they'll take oxygen out of the air and release cows outside.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.020
 People in hospitals need their oxygen.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:22:59.900
 Yeah, but not...

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.820
 They do. They take all flowers out of hot woods at night.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.660
 No, I'm not saying they don't take flowers out of the woods.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.020
 I'm just saying, I think the amount of oxygen a daffodil can deal with in a night

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:07.980
 is not going to be asphyxiation.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.580
 It's going to be a very ostentatious present.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.260
 Andy, you think you're so hard.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.500
 You can sit in a room with a daffodil.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.700
 He's not afraid. He'll do it.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.340
 He'll see him do it.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.060
 Get me one now.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.100
 Yeah, I'm right now.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.740
 We're going to put Andy in a room with a daffodil for the next week.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.620
 And if he's not on next week's podcast, you know what's happening to him.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:28.220
 All right, it's time for our final fact of the episode.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.580
 And that, of course, is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.020
 My fact this week is that shouting at drivers improves their driving.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.740
 That doesn't really work in my experience.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.900
 Yeah, this is under certain circumstances.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.860
 I shouldn't clarify.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.900
 If you're listening to this in the car, don't bellow at the driver.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.260
 This was a study in Kenya.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.660
 They have a lot of buses, they're called Matatus.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:56.460
 And the initiative was basically to put stickers in buses with appalling images of accidents

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.620
 and things like that because they have so many traffic accidents and so many deaths.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.340
 Right.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:06.140
 And the idea was to get passengers on the buses to stand up and speak up against these

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.380
 reckless drivers who caused a lot of accidents.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.460
 And they said, "Look, if the driver's driving badly, look at all these horrible accident photos,

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.420
 like on a packet of cigarettes and speak up."

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.620
 And everyone just started shouting at the drivers on these randomly-

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.420
 Slow down!

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.700
 Yeah, you maniac.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:25.260
 And they found that Matatus with these stickers are about half as likely to get into accidents.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.380
 But-

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.820
 There is, yeah, there's certain effects.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.020
 I can't remember what it's called.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:33.580
 There was a factory and they wanted to see if they could improve the outputs.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.900
 And they did loads of different things to these people.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.460
 And everything they tried, the output would go up.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.180
 No matter what they tried, they would make the lights a bit brighter, it would work.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.020
 They would make the lights darker, it would work.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.180
 They would try everything, it would always work.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.620
 And just by the fact that you're being tested or you're being studied,

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.940
 it makes people try harder because they know someone's watching.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.780
 But I do think this did genuinely affect you.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.540
 Yeah, no, it's a really good fact.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.140
 So I have a news article about shouting just to slip in.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.460
 A dog walker sparked a major search and rescue operation

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.180
 by calling out for her pet named Yelp.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.500
 And basically, people had heard her shouting "Yelp, Yelp"

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.660
 and thought she was shouting "Help, Help."

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.420
 And there was a massive operation to try and find this woman who's calling for help.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.220
 That's what I think people were calling.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.180
 There was like an open shaft nearby and people thought

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.340
 that their voice was coming from the shaft.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:29.980
 It's quite really good what's put a lost dog ad in the newspaper

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.260
 and the ad just read, "Here, boy."

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.940
 That's great.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:40.220
 Was there one of the QI panellists who said that they had a dog called Mingus?

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.460
 Oh, it's Ross Noble. Is this Granddad's dog, I think?

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:42.780
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.500
 But yes, his dog was named Mingus.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.100
 I can't do the accent, but Ross said.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.820
 And the problem with this dog was that he had the same accent as Ross.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.980
 So he goes to the park and be telling "Mingus, Mingus!"

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.060
 No, the local girls are like, "Who are you calling?"

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:58.380
 I read earlier that there was an ancient Greek belief that

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.980
 "Buzzle would grow better if you shouted curses at it while you were planting it."

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.580
 I haven't properly tried this out, but I liked the sound of it.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.980
 Maybe it's because the bees would come and pollinate it.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.580
 Yeah, they would come to the swearing.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.900
 It's an ancient secret, there'll be one Earth.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.420
 The effect when you're at a party or something and everyone's talking loud.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.220
 So you talk a bit louder and then eventually everyone's talking really loud.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.100
 There's a scientifically observed effect called the Lombard effect.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:19.500
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.220
 And it doesn't just happen to people that happens in animals, too.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.700
 Zebra Finches, quails, hummingbirds, marmosets, beluga whales, orcas, manatees.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.300
 That sounds like a great party, yeah.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.940
 Well, they've discovered that there's a certain type of bird

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.060
 that sings louder now in the city, just back to urban animals.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:36.860
 This people out.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.860
 Yeah, yeah, because of just the city noises.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.700
 I can't remember what it's called, but it's...

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.540
 I'm pretty sure nice and girls sing louder in the cities, but I don't think it's...

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.580
 I don't think that's what you're talking about.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.820
 Because I want to know if there's a word for that effect

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.580
 when you say something awkward, because it's loud,

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.540
 and since you say it, the music cuts out, and that's what gives you shout.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.140
 We should call it the unmillar effect.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.580
 Maybe not, that's not a good one.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.340
 It's not something good named after me.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.060
 Okay, here's not here.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.980
 We should call it the anotizanski effect.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:06.700
 I like just with this original fact of the idea of being shouted out when you're driving a bus.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.140
 I read this great story years ago, which this has reminded me of.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.900
 There was a bridge in China, which famously people would jump off

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.420
 and try and commit suicide.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.620
 But if the police got there in time, they would block off the bridge

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.780
 and they would have tried to negotiate the guy off the bridge.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.700
 And this one time, they were stuck for like two hours,

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.620
 while this guy was on the edge of the bridge,

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:33.180
 threatening to kill himself, and this retired soldier was just so sick of the police,

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.820
 not being able to negotiate with this guy.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.300
 He just decided, I'm going to do something about this.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.100
 He got out of his car, he went past the police.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.820
 They couldn't stop him, and he went up to the guy,

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.580
 and he put his hand out to shake his hand.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.660
 They shook hands, and then he pushed him off the bridge.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:53.100
 Because he was like, you're holding up the traffic.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.620
 Now, fortunately, when he plunged,

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:59.260
 he landed on a partially inflated, big bouncy castle that they make.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.140
 You know, there was a children's party going on below.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.140
 No, you know when you're committing suicide,

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.260
 they try to lure you down.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.900
 Yeah, they always, for a lot of, if you get there in time,

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.180
 for a lot of suicide people,

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.020
 like if there's a fire and they'll have a blanket.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.180
 They'll take off your shoes before you plummet.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.060
 I have some facts about bad drivers.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:16.620
 Okay.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.420
 I spent some of this afternoon doing a theory test online.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.540
 Oh, yeah, how'd you get on?

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.340
 I passed.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.300
 Did you drive?

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.260
 Yeah, you're right.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.300
 I can, yeah.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.980
 I got the minimum pass mark.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.980
 But I just love these questions.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.620
 So here's one.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.380
 It's a multiple choice.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.820
 I'll just read out the options.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.180
 As you approach a pelican crossing,

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.620
 the lights change to green.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.780
 Elderly people are halfway across.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:40.620
 You should wait because they will take longer to cross.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.980
 Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.140
 Wave to them to cross as quickly as they can,

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.100
 or rev your engine to make them hurry.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.420
 I remember Jenny's and myself.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.540
 And they always were traveling like,

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:51.020
 "Reg your ends."

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.780
 No, just like, wait and proceed Wednesday.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.260
 I know, there's another one where you're at a lunch occasion

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.340
 and you'll have to drive in the evening.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.100
 Should you drink nothing?

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.540
 Have a hot meal with your alcohol.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:09.020
 There was an internet news story a few years ago.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.780
 And I'm quite sure it's not true.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.780
 But it was supposedly the Chinese theory test.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.420
 And some of the questions were so ridiculous.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.740
 One of them was like, "You knock someone over.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:24.780
 Do you A, go over, get their intestines and push it back into their potty."

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.900
 Or B, ring for help people to the side.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.180
 Yeah, exactly.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.380
 Well, there's one as man,

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.380
 which is an accident casualty as an engine arm.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.380
 They can move freely, but it's bleeding.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.780
 Why should you get them to keep it in a raised position?

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.940
 Is it A, that will help to reduce the bleeding?

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.260
 B, because it will ease the pain.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.420
 C, it will help them to be seen more easily.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.700
 Or D, to stop them touching other people.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.940
 Would they're blood?

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.980
 That was a real British theory test.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.740
 Here's a thing about driving.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.980
 You can drive fast enough for speed cameras not to get you.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.820
 If you're driving fast enough on a road.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.860
 How fast do you have to be going?

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.100
 Only 119 million miles per hour.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.260
 Top gear, we're with you.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.260
 When they invented the speed cameras themselves to encourage speeding initially,

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:11.740
 wasn't it?

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.260
 It was the racing driver who invented the equipment.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.220
 Yeah, that's how he was doing on the curves and corners.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.180
 Yeah, okay.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.940
 I have a fact about car insurance.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.700
 Which is the very first policy was written by Lloyds in 1904.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.820
 And it had never been done before.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.700
 And so there were no guidelines.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.220
 There were completely started from scratch.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.340
 And so all the documents referred to it as a ship navigating on land.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.140
 Nice, nice, like it.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.540
 I have a fact about that guy, Gatso.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.420
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.500
 He died in 1998.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.900
 He was caught out by his own cameras all the time.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.020
 And he himself said,

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.460
 "I am often caught by my own speed cameras and find hefty finds on my door mat.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.220
 Even I can't escape my own invention.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.340
 Because I love speeding."

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.740
 He said all of that.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:54.060
 Just with the shouting thing,

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.420
 shouting obviously sometimes can just really make you feel good as well.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.980
 But there was a study that was done.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.500
 And this did win an egg Nobel.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.380
 We've mentioned egg Nobel.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.420
 One of our previous guests was Mark Abrams, who runs the whole thing.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.700
 Oh, and the ward was given to Richard Stevens and some others at Keele University

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.420
 who confirmed that swearing relieves pain.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.220
 Yeah, I remember that.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:14.780
 Yeah.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.380
 Yeah, it's called Lalo Chizia.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.180
 Yeah.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:21.180
 6% of drivers will deliberately swerve to kill animals they see on the road.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.060
 Oh, 6%.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:22.860
 Well, that's pretty low.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.500
 That's not.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.620
 No, these words then will swerve the same way.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.420
 Yeah, exactly.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.220
 And the way that they worked that out is there was a study done.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.140
 And they got like plastic animals,

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.820
 like a little plastic snake or a plastic scorpion or something.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.700
 And they were put it on the side of the road where people weren't driving.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.220
 And they would count how many of them sweared.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.660
 Oh, you didn't say it was a snake or a scorpion.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.420
 I thought you were imagining an elk or a puppy or a penguin.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.580
 I was like with my hedgehog facts.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:46.620
 I never really met a man.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.980
 And he would drive around.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.700
 And if he found roadkill hedgehogs, he would take them,

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.020
 make a clay cast of them, then put them back on the road

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:53.980
 as a permanent marker.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.820
 So people would notice how many deaths they'd be in.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.780
 Wow.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:57.260
 Wow.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.460
 There's someone else who drives around

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.300
 cooking roadkill and eating it.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.660
 So maybe they're partners.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.260
 He's tried loads of stuff.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.860
 Yeah, he keeps eating this concrete.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.020
 Hard and teeth.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.540
 I wanted to just thinking about that.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.100
 Someone putting a plastic snake on the side of the road.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.940
 I wonder how many times a day

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.820
 just even the four of us are being secretly tested

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.700
 by scientists.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.460
 Like there's just so many of these experiments going around.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.060
 What about that Facebook thing the other day?

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.180
 Oh, that's strange.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.300
 See, when you log on to Facebook,

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.180
 you don't see everything.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.820
 You see a selection that Facebook chooses to show you.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:26.940
 And they started skewing it.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.700
 So you'd see, like, sort of pessimistic updates

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.300
 from your email friends.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.580
 And then they'd watch you see if you then

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.620
 posted a more sad update if they could affect your mood

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.580
 by what they showed you.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.220
 Wow.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.940
 It's a fairly uncontroversial finding, I think,

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.100
 that if you see a load of miserable status

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.300
 as you'll feel a bit glum.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.460
 I'll tell you, hate all your friends, which I do.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.460
 So you've got the shine Friday.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.580
 Yeah, I was delighted.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.340
 I post a lot of cheery statuses.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.700
 Great to see Neville lost his job.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.860
 It's Neville.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.980
 So it is controversial though,

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.140
 because they're experimenting on people

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.260
 who haven't given their permission.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.060
 That's a big no-go.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:00.940
 I'm not saying it's not.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:01.660
 I'm not saying it's not.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.980
 Yeah, but presumably the snake's on a road isn't.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.340
 Well, the rubber snake can't give him

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.620
 full consent for two reasons.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.420
 For many, many.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.260
 I'm sort of the driver.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.540
 I don't know who you are.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.460
 OK, we should wrap up.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.940
 Has anyone got any last minifacts on the trend?

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.820
 Yeah, go for it.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:20.860
 We're especially from our first fact book,

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.820
 "1-2-7-Q-I-Facts," which is that Schimpfloss

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.660
 is a German 24-hour hotline,

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.020
 which allows customers to release

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.900
 pen to progression by swearing at the telephone operators.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.020
 Have you seen things dressed?

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.660
 Give them a call.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.140
 That's what they're doing.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.260
 Do you have the number by any chance?

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.700
 I don't, but hopefully we can put it on our website.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.420
 Yeah, we can send it.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.460
 We'll put it on our website.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:42.060
 1-800-AAAGH! OK, that's it. That's all of our facts.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.740
 Thanks, everyone, for listening to this episode.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.340
 And no such thing as a fish.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.740
 And if you want to talk to any of us about the things

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.020
 that we said on this episode,

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.340
 you can reach us all on our Twitter handles.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.340
 I'm on @SriberlandJames.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.860
 @egshapedan.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.460
 @miller_an.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.220
 Andy @undruhunterm.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.820
 We'll be back again next week.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.780
 And we'll see you then.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.340
 Goodbye.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.980
 Hi, everybody. We recorded that podcast actually a couple of days ago.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.340
 And since then, Andy and Dan have gone to the Edinburgh Festival.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.820
 So if you find yourself in the Edinburgh area,

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.340
 you might want to go and watch their shows.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.860
 They have two each.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.020
 Andy is doing two improv shows.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.780
 One is called ostentatious.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.620
 And the other is called Folly Adder.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.660
 And Dan is doing his first one-hour comedy show

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:27.740
 called Cockblocked From Outer Space.

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.700
 And he will also be producing Museum of Curiosity,

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.860
 which is the QI radio show.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.500
 And they'll be doing a live show in Edinburgh as well.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.420
 So if you're a fan of their voices, why not go along?

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:45.740
 The laws are on their way.

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:52.940
 And this time, there's no escape.
