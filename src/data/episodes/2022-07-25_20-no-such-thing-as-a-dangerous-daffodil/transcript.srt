1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
 - We run it on QI a few years ago. - Yeah.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,680
 - Which was, there's no such thing as a fish. - You did a nice, such thing as a fish.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,860
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,720
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:24,320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,420
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,360
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting at a table with Ann Miller, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,040
 And once again, we've gathered around with our favorite facts from the last seven days,

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,440
 and in no particular order, here they are.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,860
 Okay, fact number one, and that's you, James.

11
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:52,680
 Okay, my fact is that the most painful place to be stung by a bee is your nostril.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,100
 - Is it? - It is.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,820
 So a bee inside your nose.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,500
 Yeah, just the inside of your nostril apparently, it's the worst place to be stung.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,020
 - How do you know this? - Well, I know this because there was a Cornell University student

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,540
 called Michael Smith, who decided to let bees sting him on all different parts of his body

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,620
 and find out which was the most painful.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,100
 - When he say, "Oh, do you mean actually all?" - Well, the main ones.

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,900
 - The main ones. - The main ones.

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,820
 - The skin. - The main ones are my hands and my feet.

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,060
 Yeah, I want to put nostril on my head shoulder's knees and toes, obviously.

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,340
 I'd say inside your mouth's fully pretty bad. - Yes. - Or your ears, like things that are touching your ears.

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,220
 - Did he do it on his penis? That's what we're all dancing around.

24
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,100
 - I know. - Well, you might be dancing around your penis.

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,100
 - I would be of a bee, it's stung it.

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,940
 - He did, yes.

27
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:45,580
 He did it on the number of different parts of his body, and he gave them marks out of ten

28
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,100
 for how painful they were, and the nostril was 9.0.

29
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:56,220
 The upper lip was 8.7, and the penis was the third worst place to be stung, and it was 7.3 out of ten.

30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:02,820
 - Wow. - He had one bee, which he would hold beside his body in order to make it sting him.

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,780
 - And a poor bee. Just put back in the box afterwards.

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,860
 - Oh, thank god that's over, then half an hour later.

33
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,180
 - Oh, here we go.

34
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,380
 - Is it true that bees don't die after stinging you?

35
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,820
 - Mammals have tougher skin.

36
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,020
 So if they sting a mammal, there's a higher chance of the sting being left behind

37
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,020
 and then the bee, not surviving.

38
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,660
 However, if they sting other insects, which is what they normally sting, then they're fine.

39
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,980
 They can sting them repeatedly.

40
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,140
 - Do you know what a bee does if it can't sting you if you're too small to be stung?

41
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,900
 - If you're too small to be stung, you're going to be arrested and arrested.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,380
 - They're not a human, like an insect.

43
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,980
 - Oh, like an insect. - Come on in between your nose.

44
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,580
 - Yes, yeah. I know, what does it do?

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,780
 - They bite. - They bite.

46
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,940
 - And their bites have a chemical in their basically paralyzes their prey, so they can turn them out of their hives.

47
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,660
 And they might be able to be used in human medicine for anesthetics.

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:52,340
 Actually, the theme tune to our podcast "Wosps" by Ampere Yes, the song is all about how bees survive a wasp attack

49
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,140
 when they come into their nest, which is that they heat it up by vibrating inside.

50
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,140
 And they can sustain within their own body a certain amount of heat, which is higher than a wasp heat.

51
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,380
 So they literally cook the wasp inside the hive.

52
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,220
 - That's awesome.

53
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,780
 - We also should mention the least painful places, just in case you have a supervillain say.

54
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,780
 - It's all about bees-beasting, YouTube.

55
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,700
 - Well, all of your shoe would be, yeah.

56
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,660
 - It would be amazing. - I'll look at that.

57
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,980
 - But on the body, the skull tip of the middle toe, apparently, and upper arm, they're all very low rated 2.3.

58
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,220
 - I read about this horrible thing in New Zealand, where they're selling the venom face masks.

59
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,020
 So the idea is that it works like a natural bullshocks in it, so they need about 20 hives to harvest one gram of this venom.

60
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,500
 And they claim a mixture of skin and feel firmer, it makes it, you know, like you've had a facelift.

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,580
 - But there are told you say there's no benefits, and actually it can cause you quite severe medical problems.

62
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,940
 - Bees can fly higher than Mount Everest.

63
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,780
 We did a thing about landing a helicopter on Mount Everest, which is incredibly difficult and dangerous,

64
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,380
 because the air is so thin up there that even with the speed of helicopters, the rotor blades go at,

65
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,580
 it's almost impossible to do.

66
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,100
 - But someone has done it, and has done it, yeah.

67
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,460
 - But it wasn't a bee, just to clarify.

68
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:05,020
 - Well, Edmund Hilary, he was a beekeeper, and he actually was his beekeeping job that funded his trip to get to Mount Everest, yeah.

69
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,260
 - Yeah, he put it on his passport when they asked what his job was, he said he was a beekeeper.

70
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,220
 - Oh, that's awesome.

71
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,620
 - Yeah, other famous beekeepers, Sherlock Holmes.

72
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,060
 - Yes, he retired to become a beekeeper.

73
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,260
 - He retired as a beekeeper.

74
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,460
 - Yeah, Aristotle as well, was a beekeeper.

75
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:24,300
 And he made this really odd claim that they survived for seven years, when in fact they survived for seven weeks.

76
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,220
 So either he thought, "Well, they're still here," and just didn't recognize that he had new born bees.

77
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,580
 - Oh, he was a dog.

78
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,620
 - Oh my god, yeah.

79
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,580
 - Wow, Aristotle.

80
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,780
 - We just blend this thing wider.

81
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,060
 - Yeah.

82
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,740
 - I saw everything in the news, in the news a few weeks ago, that Norfolk police are warning people to be aware of bee rustlers.

83
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,540
 They've been turning up in the night and stealing hives full of thousands of bees.

84
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,020
 - Oh really?

85
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,540
 - So that's quite a high risk, fair.

86
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,500
 - Yeah, wow.

87
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,260
 - Germany has fantastic bee laws, and roughly broken down their this.

88
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:56,300
 If bees break away from a hive, they are only still your bees if you're in pursuit.

89
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,860
 So as long as you're in pursuit, they are your bees.

90
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,540
 So there is nowhere off limits to you.

91
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,540
 If you have to run into the houses of parliament there, you can because you're just here to your bees.

92
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:04,940
 - Yeah.

93
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,780
 - You're exactly like this from this law.

94
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,260
 - Yeah.

95
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,620
 - If they then land in the hive of someone else's farm, and it's an empty hive,

96
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,940
 then you can break that hive down, collect your bees and bring it back and just replace the hive.

97
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,140
 If it lands in a hive that's full of bees, then the other owner is just acquired some new bees.

98
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,260
 Now the best law of the whole thing is that if you're in pursuit of your bees,

99
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,940
 there's a law that states that if you see someone else in pursuit of their bees,

100
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,260
 and your two bee colonies collide and turn into one swarm,

101
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,740
 you are now the co-owner of these bees.

102
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,980
 - You're in business with the hive, they're in business.

103
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,980
 - Yeah, if he drops out of pursuit, then it's your business.

104
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,340
 - You're in buzziness more like.

105
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,180
 Can I quickly tell you about bee bids?

106
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,740
 Please do.

107
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,380
 - Ooh, yeah.

108
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,060
 - This is an article by beekeeper on beeinformed.org.

109
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,980
 Nice, but the article reads,

110
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,540
 "Having about 10,000 bees on your face is one of the best ways to demonstrate how calm and fun

111
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,220
 bees can be."

112
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,740
 And so the idea is that, so step one, prepare the bees,

113
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,620
 step two, prepare the person, step three, add bees, step four, remove bees.

114
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,660
 Because of the more detail on how you do all of these things.

115
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,820
 So basically you attach them to your chin,

116
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,380
 and you have to put Vaseline on your eyes and you have to put Coffin in your ears.

117
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,900
 - How do you attach them to your chin?

118
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,020
 Is it like on each hair and your chin or something?

119
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,180
 - You put a queen bee just below your chin and the bees swarm to her.

120
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,860
 - How do you get her?

121
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,180
 - You spray the bees with sugar syrup,

122
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,860
 and then the assistant will tie the queen around your head so the queen is under your chin,

123
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,180
 and then you just hold a tray on your belly and the assistant dumps all the bees into the tray,

124
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,780
 and they just gather to the queen.

125
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,260
 - Okay.

126
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,100
 - And you've got a massive beard made of bees.

127
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,580
 However, he does point out he's never done this without being stung at least once or twice.

128
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,260
 - I want to know what would happen if you were in Germany and you were chasing your bees,

129
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,100
 and they all gathered on some guy's face.

130
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,220
 - You get on him.

131
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,060
 There is a myth about bees, according to the internet.

132
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,660
 This is a common misconception amongst some people that bees hate bad language

133
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,540
 and will sting those who swear in their presence.

134
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,700
 - I heard that if you kill, I think it works for bees, Andrew, whilst if you kill them,

135
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,460
 you need to get out of there quick because if you kill them,

136
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,820
 they release a chemical to warn their hive mates that there's danger.

137
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,740
 - They can do that even if they're still alive.

138
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,260
 - There was something in the news this week that they found that gorillas communicate by BL.

139
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,660
 - I mean, you mean gorilla gorillas, not gorilla warriors.

140
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,660
 - Philogastro just raised an arm.

141
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:32,300
 - Well, yes, Arifat used to just fart whenever he wanted to because that was his kind of thing.

142
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,340
 It was his intimidation.

143
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,620
 - To clear the room.

144
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,060
 - It was just his thing.

145
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,060
 He got so much joy and we have the room to ourselves, please.

146
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,180
 He does make a presence.

147
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:47,180
 I was reading that urban bees, they've completely evolved.

148
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,940
 So there was a study done in Toronto that showed that three out of eight

149
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,060
 alfalfa leaf cutter bees have nests that are made up of shredded plastic bags.

150
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,260
 Apparently, they use us as sort of salt licks, like us humans.

151
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,140
 - Lots of insects drink animals tears together.

152
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,180
 - We did on QI a few years ago that there was a company developing bee bomb detectors

153
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,900
 and trained bees to stick out their tongue at the smell of explosives and things like that.

154
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,380
 - Wow.

155
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,940
 - You know how you use smoke to pacify bees?

156
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,900
 Do you know how that works?

157
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,180
 - No.

158
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,300
 It doesn't make them drowsy as you might think in the normal way.

159
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,660
 They think they're in trouble and so they eat up all of the honey

160
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,940
 and because they eat up so much, they're so full.

161
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,340
 They can't really do anything and they're just waddling around

162
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,460
 and they're not attacking people.

163
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,460
 I think that's how the smoke stuff works.

164
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,180
 - That's great.

165
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,900
 - That's great, isn't it?

166
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,820
 - I really hope it will be by getting them addicted to the smoke

167
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,220
 and so that they just want another cigarette.

168
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,180
 - Well, there is a study where they tried to get some bees addicted to narcotics

169
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,860
 to see how it affected the bees.

170
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,660
 - Well, it could possibly go wrong.

171
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,740
 - Yeah, so they got some bees hooked to cocaine.

172
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,940
 And according to the results,

173
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,780
 the cocaine-turned-good bees,

174
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,540
 productive members of the hive,

175
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,780
 into untrustworthy bees.

176
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,220
 - Grace will hand it up a morph as well.

177
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,700
 - No, I think...

178
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,700
 - He has an untrustworthy bee behaviour, Dan.

179
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,100
 - I think, if I remember this study correctly,

180
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,540
 bees will do a little dance to say how much honey they have.

181
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,900
 Yeah, call the waggle dance.

182
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,980
 And the ones who had taken cocaine would do that.

183
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,460
 We've got lots of honey dance when actually they should have done that.

184
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,580
 We didn't really find much honey.

185
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,020
 We mostly found cocaine dance.

186
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,900
 - That's amazing.

187
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,500
 - We found more than anyone else has ever found.

188
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,460
 You've got to come. You've got to come and look.

189
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,060
 - What about drunk bees? Do you know about them?

190
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,860
 - No.

191
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,380
 - So you're sitting in a corner and getting a bit sad?

192
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,740
 - Yeah, it is a bit like that.

193
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,780
 They have more flying accidents than sober ones.

194
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,820
 And they can sometimes forget how to get back to the hive and die as a result.

195
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,420
 And if they do make it back to the hive,

196
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,500
 then they can be rounded on by other bees who punish them by chewing off their legs.

197
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,020
 - So they're legless.

198
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,020
 - Okay, let's move on to fact B, fact number two.

199
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,460
 Just a call back there.

200
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,340
 Yeah, okay, this is my fact.

201
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,420
 And this fact is that Walt Disney used to eat breakfast like all of us.

202
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,180
 But his favorite breakfast was fresh doughnuts dunked in scotch.

203
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,740
 - That's why the national dish of Scotland.

204
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,380
 - He's one of those people who, when you look into him,

205
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,820
 just comes up with so many extraordinary little facts about him

206
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
 that you would never have known.

207
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,740
 And I'm surprised that we do know, I'm surprised that we do know that he dunked his doughnuts in scotch.

208
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,660
 I'm surprised that we know that he used to keep his testicles on ice.

209
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,180
 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, he dunked his scotch.

210
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,060
 - That was on ice.

211
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,260
 - He was his testicles.

212
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,140
 He used to put his balls on ice because he had a low sperm count and he thought that would help.

213
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,500
 - He's in the electronics room, is that it?

214
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,300
 - Yeah, exactly.

215
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,380
 - Yeah, the rest of him isn't frozen.

216
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,500
 It's just his testicles.

217
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,140
 - It's just his balls.

218
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,340
 - When we regenerate him.

219
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,740
 - Isn't he an almost pair of balls?

220
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,740
 - There's a guy called Josh Schumacher in America and he's painted a thing called Snowballs.

221
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,820
 And these are pants that come with a special integrated pocket

222
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,260
 that cools the man's nether regions in an effort to boost his sperm count.

223
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,820
 - Ah.

224
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
 - And the awkward Christmas is sorted.

225
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,860
 - Yeah.

226
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,140
 For the man who has everything.

227
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,900
 - Colder testicles.

228
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,540
 - Um, a scariest way I went around a few years ago.

229
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,380
 That Iron Blue lowered your sperm count.

230
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,020
 - Really?

231
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,900
 - You basically would stuff the Scottish reproduction rates.

232
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,940
 I think it turned out not to be true.

233
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,580
 - Um, Chinese Unix would keep their testicles in a jar

234
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,180
 in the hope that they would arrive complete in the next world after they died.

235
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,740
 - Oh my god.

236
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,340
 - I just moved house and I, you know, I'm getting rid of a lot of my old stuff.

237
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,020
 I can imagine finding your testicles in a drawer or something and thinking,

238
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,220
 "I will hang on to these."

239
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,980
 - Yeah, everyone's got one of those drawers at home.

240
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,460
 Haven't they?

241
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,820
 It just starts and ends like old batteries, jars of testicles.

242
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,180
 - What happens to foreskins?

243
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,820
 - What do you mean?

244
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,860
 - On circumcision.

245
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,980
 Some of them can be used in cosmetics.

246
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,780
 - Yeah.

247
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,780
 - And they're not really supposed to be face masks.

248
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,740
 - I know, they're used as artificial eyelashers.

249
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,220
 They're just, no, they're not actually.

250
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,100
 - Oh my god.

251
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,700
 - No, there was a bit of a, a bit of a thing a couple of years ago

252
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,500
 that some hospitals have been taking the,

253
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,660
 removed fastkins from children and they've been using them

254
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,220
 to make cosmetics without the patient's consent.

255
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,380
 - I did work experience in the hospital when I was younger

256
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,780
 and I was in an operating theater and they had a sign on the world

257
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,220
 about different kinds of bins.

258
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,460
 And after I made it, I was, I think it was the orange bin

259
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,980
 was for human body parts.

260
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,620
 - Oh.

261
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,860
 - I never saw one, but I love the wary of one.

262
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,100
 - That's like recycling gum, mad, isn't it?

263
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,420
 It's like, you're going to put it in your green bin

264
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,940
 or your brown bin or your orange bin.

265
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,900
 - I didn't pay for it.

266
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,940
 - Walt Disney.

267
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,300
 What do we have about him?

268
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,220
 - Something I didn't know about Walt was that he was the voice of Mickey.

269
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,980
 - There are lots of Mickey Mouse's and one of the actors

270
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,540
 played Mickey Mouse, married lady who played Minnie Mouse.

271
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,340
 Which is very nice.

272
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,140
 - Oh, that's good.

273
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,020
 - That is good.

274
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,620
 - And cows in Mickey Mouse.

275
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,260
 There was a complaint that the otters were too big

276
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,460
 when it first came out.

277
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:42,940
 - Oh, really?

278
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,700
 - And they said pictures in the future

279
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,860
 will have small or invisible otters.

280
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,380
 Quite unlike the gargantuan organ whose antics have laked,

281
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,700
 her shocked some and convulsed others.

282
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,060
 - I get a lot of those letters too.

283
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,260
 - I found that yesterday.

284
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,460
 This is not really related,

285
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,380
 but from the Mickey and Minnie thing.

286
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,300
 Do you know Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas?

287
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,700
 - Yeah.

288
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,540
 - Was someone in peanuts?

289
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,340
 - What?

290
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,100
 - I forgot the name of the character in peanuts.

291
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,180
 The one with blonde curly hair.

292
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,580
 Her voice was done in the 80s by Fergie.

293
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,820
 It was the first thing she ever did when she was like nine years old.

294
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,340
 - Okay, I've just googled it.

295
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,860
 She played Sally.

296
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,420
 - That's right.

297
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,460
 - That's a really good fact.

298
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:18,940
 - Yeah.

299
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,860
 - Just one other related fact to people behind the characters.

300
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,140
 Ariel and Bell.

301
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,900
 So Ariel from the lore mermaid and Bell from Beauty and the Beast.

302
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,740
 They were both based on a real-life model.

303
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,420
 Whose name was Cherie Stoner.

304
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,180
 And they used all of her mannerisms.

305
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,020
 So there's very famously, Ariel does this thing where she kind of blows her hair

306
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,660
 in frustration and her hair bows.

307
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,700
 That was just Cherie just improvising in the moment.

308
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,700
 - Cherie also had the tail of the fish.

309
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,340
 - She did it.

310
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,780
 So I mean, it was very convenient.

311
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,980
 But she wasn't just a model because then she became a part of the family.

312
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,100
 And she was the writer and producer for the Animaniacs

313
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,380
 and Casper, the friendly ghost.

314
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,860
 - Oh really?

315
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,460
 - Yeah, she was like a proper...

316
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,180
 - That's pretty good.

317
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,220
 That reminds me of a fact about the Statue of Liberty.

318
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,660
 It was designed by Bertoldy.

319
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,420
 I think he based the body of the Statue of Liberty on his mistress

320
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,860
 and the face on his mother.

321
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,620
 - Oh, that's not a five-bed.

322
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,340
 - Which is a little bit pro-idean, isn't it?

323
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,860
 - But that's like Justin's mother will be very statuesque, if so.

324
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,940
 - Maybe she's wore a big tiara all the time.

325
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,820
 - Maybe.

326
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,620
 Justin Pollard, one of the other QILs.

327
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,220
 In his book, Seeker Britain, he talks about how the roles

328
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,380
 Royce, the Statue, the spirit of ecstasy,

329
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,580
 is based on the mistress of Mr. Royce.

330
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,100
 Was it, yeah, well, one of them.

331
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,420
 It was their mistress, who died in a boating accident.

332
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,220
 And it was his tribute to her to people alive forever.

333
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,540
 Yeah, so that's his mistress on the front of the car.

334
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,540
 Let's talk about breakfast.

335
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,420
 There was a study done saying that if you eat cake for breakfast,

336
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,020
 it's really good if you're on a diet.

337
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,140
 And they got a load of overweight people.

338
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,140
 And they gave them cake for breakfast.

339
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,940
 That was the only difference in any of their lifestyle.

340
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,300
 And they all lost weight.

341
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,340
 And the idea is that if you eat the sugary stuff in the morning,

342
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,980
 you're less likely to snack on it during the day.

343
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,340
 Wow.

344
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,580
 So a bowl of special K and a bowl of frosties

345
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,340
 have only a one calorie difference.

346
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,980
 And it's the special K that are more calorific.

347
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,540
 Whoa.

348
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,980
 So you're better off eating frosties.

349
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,780
 Well, really.

350
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,540
 The iron that you get added to cereals,

351
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,900
 if you have a good enough magnet,

352
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,620
 you can get the iron filings out of the cereal.

353
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,580
 There's a way of doing that.

354
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,500
 There's videos on YouTube of how to do it.

355
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,220
 Oh, that's awesome.

356
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,700
 Yeah.

357
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,660
 Disney World.

358
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,460
 Yes.

359
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,460
 Is the second largest purchaser of explosives in the US?

360
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,860
 They're just for their fireworks or are they taken to terrorism?

361
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,660
 No, it's fireworks.

362
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,180
 But after the military is number one.

363
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,620
 All that planning is something really big.

364
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,340
 Actually, that reminds me of the fact

365
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,060
 that I almost used for the podcast this week.

366
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,780
 I read it on a website called Collector's Weekly.com.

367
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,780
 And they said that before they had fireworks,

368
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,420
 what they would do is they would get two anvils,

369
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,940
 turn one of them upside down,

370
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,460
 put it on top of the other one,

371
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,620
 put explosives in between them,

372
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,460
 set fire to the explosives so that the anvil would fly into the sky.

373
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,660
 What could possibly go wrong?

374
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,820
 I know, and it caused all sorts of problems,

375
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,340
 people getting injured and what have you.

376
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,540
 But hang on.

377
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,380
 It's the cartoon trope of someone being killed

378
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,900
 by a massive anvil falling on them.

379
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,260
 Something that was a real risk.

380
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,740
 Yeah.

381
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,500
 The weather's going to be heavy anvils today

382
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,860
 with scattered hammers.

383
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,820
 [LAUGHS]

384
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,740
 OK, it is time now to move on to fact number three.

385
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,500
 And that is you, Anne.

386
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,380
 Yes, my fact is that the French used to call Arsonic

387
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,180
 "poudre de sucession" or "inheritance powder"

388
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,340
 because it was used in so many murders.

389
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,620
 That was obviously not sort of on the tin.

390
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,420
 Yeah, then the pharmacy, I would say, inheritance powder.

391
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,140
 No, it was actually, Arsonic was used quite a lot at this point

392
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,020
 because it was used to kill rats.

393
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,660
 And they actually also used Arsonic to colour their wallpaper green.

394
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,620
 So there were quite a lot of cases

395
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,020
 where people would have this sort of symptoms.

396
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,540
 And when they went to the seaside, it would clear up

397
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,820
 because they were away from their wallpaper

398
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,300
 and this sort of lingering Arsonicness was there.

399
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,860
 Wasn't Napoleon supposedly poisoned?

400
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,700
 But I mean, that was the myth, wasn't it?

401
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,500
 Yeah, there's a myth.

402
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,860
 People are pretty sure these days that he died of stomach cancer.

403
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,780
 Not a lot of wallpaper.

404
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,180
 That's the weird Philan on the official form,

405
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,620
 "Calls of Death" wallpaper.

406
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,380
 That was almost anvil, anvil, anvil, wallpaper.

407
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,020
 It's like that, either that wallpaper goes or I will.

408
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,140
 Yeah, he was that, he said that.

409
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,180
 Oscar Wilde.

410
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,380
 Turns out he didn't say that.

411
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,180
 He said something like it, but he said it days before he died.

412
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,180
 And I don't think he kind of went,

413
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,180
 "Oh, that was a pretty good end line, I'm just going to leave it there."

414
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,900
 He lived on for another 30 years in complete silence.

415
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,420
 Yeah. But there's Arsonic that.

416
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,060
 So I got it from Lucy Worsley's book about Modos,

417
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,780
 which is really interesting.

418
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,020
 It's all about how the British can do years of recess

419
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,380
 about reading about Modos.

420
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,060
 The Arsonic itself, it was problematic,

421
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,420
 because it didn't have a smell.

422
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,740
 And the symptoms are very similar to cholera.

423
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,420
 And you couldn't trace it at all until some chemists developed the marsh test,

424
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,340
 which is how you could separate Arsonic and prove someone had it.

425
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,220
 Before that, there was no way of proving that you had taken Arsonic.

426
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,020
 So it was there?

427
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,340
 It's not supposed to smell of garlic when you heat it up, or something.

428
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,300
 Yes, I read that as well.

429
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,820
 When you heat it, it's...

430
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,060
 Maybe they weren't cooking it.

431
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,460
 Yeah, or maybe they were putting it in garlic bread.

432
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,940
 One of the best tests for the presence of Arsonic

433
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,020
 was developed by Samuel Haneman,

434
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,260
 who is the guy who invented homeopathy.

435
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,500
 So that was one of his more successful...

436
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,460
 Could his test detect like one part in 10 billion?

437
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,980
 You do need a small amount, though, to live.

438
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,700
 They've tested it.

439
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,900
 Yeah, you have it in your body.

440
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,140
 Yeah, so they've tested on chickens and rats.

441
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,900
 They've given them a diet, normal diet,

442
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,940
 but only without Arsonic, and they grow up standard.

443
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,860
 So they don't know whether it's essential for humans,

444
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,460
 because I don't think it's done that kind of experiment.

445
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,700
 But isn't it in lipstick as well?

446
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,380
 In some things, yeah, there's some traces in the USA, I think.

447
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,780
 I think it's not allowed in any British cosmetics.

448
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,300
 In the US, you're allowed up to three parts per million of Arsonic in lipstick.

449
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,420
 Wow, to you.

450
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,660
 I was like, really grim stuff, but food isn't there, right?

451
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,940
 You had like one hair, or have many grams, and one dead fly.

452
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,180
 One rodent hair, per jar, and three up to three maggots.

453
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,380
 One testicle.

454
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,180
 One testicle, as long as it's Walt Disney's.

455
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,380
 In your frozen peas.

456
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,500
 But they used to think it was good for us,

457
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 and they, because it was prescribed for a lot of medication.

458
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,300
 Yeah.

459
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
 Diabetes, tuberculosis, malaria.

460
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,660
 Here, Carlos Arsonic.

461
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,500
 Yeah, pretty much everything.

462
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
 It was, it was a pick me up.

463
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,460
 The cure also.

464
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,700
 Yeah, there was a medicine called Dr. Fowler's solution,

465
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,020
 which was used to treat females.

466
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,780
 And it's just a solution with potassium arsenide.

467
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,460
 Watered down with lavender water.

468
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,380
 And you would take a few drops with a glass of wine.

469
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,660
 Charles Dickens had it.

470
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,420
 It was used a cural, tonic, aphrodisiac, treat snake bites, malaria,

471
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,820
 epilepsy, morning sickness, diarrhea.

472
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,860
 You name it.

473
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,220
 There was also Dr. Roses Arsonic complexion wafers.

474
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:39,020
 They were advertised as being simply magical for the complexion.

475
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,580
 I've got another fact from Lucie Worsi's book, which I really love,

476
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,820
 which is Madame Tussard's Chamber of Horrors,

477
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,460
 which, which, namely, is just called the other chamber,

478
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,700
 sort of full with models of murder as you go and look at them.

479
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
 And during the First World War,

480
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,420
 trainee soldiers used to be set in the initiation test

481
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,660
 to go and hide in the chamber and spend the whole night there.

482
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,260
 And it became such a pest that Madame Tussard had to officially ask the war

483
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,860
 for us to stop them doing this.

484
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,860
 Oh, wow.

485
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
 You're sneaking in.

486
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,060
 I have a fact that you like Annabar Arsonic.

487
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,500
 And that is that hedgehogs are immune to arsenic poisoning.

488
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,300
 So hedgehogs?

489
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,700
 I like a good hedgehog fact.

490
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,700
 You can build up a resistance to Arsonic.

491
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,940
 If you try your hardest, which is good news.

492
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,140
 Yeah, there was some peasants in the Stirian Alps.

493
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,980
 It's several centuries ago who ate massive chunks of arsenic twice a week

494
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,900
 and they claimed it improved the complexion.

495
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,700
 So not far off.

496
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,300
 Ah, really?

497
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,700
 And scientists said, now that's ridiculous, arsenic's very poisonous.

498
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
 And they're like, well, how come our skin is so good?

499
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,740
 How come I'm going after a day in the field?

500
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,220
 But then there was a meeting in 1875 of the Association of German Scientists

501
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,300
 at which a peasant ate twice the fatal dose of arsenic trioxide

502
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,420
 before a big audience.

503
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,380
 And they tested him afterwards and they tested his urine, which is how you tell me.

504
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,180
 Wow, before a big audience, it's like people were easily enthained in those days.

505
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,540
 Well, they didn't have transformers, didn't they?

506
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,220
 Can't watch a man, he might die.

507
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,860
 Yeah, I'd watch that, like a shot.

508
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,420
 I think it's like an early version of man versus food.

509
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,780
 But versus poison.

510
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,980
 Yeah, that's a great step.

511
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,660
 Today, man one, but next time.

512
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,980
 Poison, poison, poison, anvil.

513
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,820
 Anvil, anvil.

514
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:20,860
 If you are poisoned with nitric acid, the way to tell is your snot starts to foam.

515
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,780
 Wow, that's cool.

516
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,620
 The Agatha Christie's novels.

517
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,780
 So Agatha Christie used to work as a nurse and a pharmacy dispenser during the work,

518
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,460
 where she got a lot of her knowledge about poisons.

519
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,100
 Over a half of her character deaths were from poison.

520
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,340
 And there was one case where she, I won't say the book,

521
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,300
 it case it's a spoiler.

522
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,700
 But in one kit novel, she is talian poisoning.

523
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,940
 And she detailed the symptoms so thoroughly, like,

524
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,540
 hair loss and things that go wrong.

525
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,900
 That they were then used by people to diagnose real life cases of talian poisoning.

526
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,340
 And she saved at least two lives.

527
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,180
 Wow, what a great fact.

528
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,220
 That's awesome.

529
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,340
 Dogs can be poisoned by eating the feces of drug users.

530
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,420
 Just a fact.

531
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,380
 It serves them right.

532
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,580
 Let's do it.

533
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,580
 I read in the New York Times that 2008 was the first time in 30 years

534
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,620
 that more people died from poisoning than from car crashes.

535
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,820
 Oh, wow.

536
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,060
 Oh, I see, I found the facts online, which I really like,

537
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,860
 which is that Jack Bauer has killed more people than sharks.

538
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,460
 How many sharks has he killed?

539
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,980
 Well, the aquatic series is coming up next, so we'll see you.

540
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,140
 Other things that are poisonous.

541
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,980
 Daffodils, old parts of a daffodil plant are poisonous to varying effects.

542
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,140
 If we, if I ate a daffodil, I'd die.

543
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,100
 If you ate too many of them, yeah, you can even if you're trapped

544
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,820
 in a small space with a daffodil, it'll give you headaches.

545
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,860
 I don't know.

546
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,660
 I'm weird.

547
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,460
 If you're stuck in a lift and the only other passenger is a daffodil.

548
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:34,940
 Yeah.

549
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,820
 I would like to think that after the guy eating a steak,

550
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,300
 it was like, I'm for our next act.

551
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
 It's a man in the box with a daffodil.

552
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,220
 David Blaine will be with this daffodil in a cupboard for 90 days.

553
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,820
 Does that mean if you're going to hospital and you're bringing flowers to someone?

554
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,460
 Don't bring that to us.

555
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,740
 You're not meant to have flowers at night.

556
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,940
 They bring them out of the woods.

557
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,420
 Do they?

558
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,100
 I think of a pollen or there's some there.

559
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,820
 Well, they'll take oxygen out of the air and release cows outside.

560
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,020
 People in hospitals need their oxygen.

561
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,900
 Yeah, but not...

562
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,820
 They do. They take all flowers out of hot woods at night.

563
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,660
 No, I'm not saying they don't take flowers out of the woods.

564
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,020
 I'm just saying, I think the amount of oxygen a daffodil can deal with in a night

565
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,980
 is not going to be asphyxiation.

566
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,580
 It's going to be a very ostentatious present.

567
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,260
 Andy, you think you're so hard.

568
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,500
 You can sit in a room with a daffodil.

569
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,700
 He's not afraid. He'll do it.

570
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,340
 He'll see him do it.

571
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,060
 Get me one now.

572
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,100
 Yeah, I'm right now.

573
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,740
 We're going to put Andy in a room with a daffodil for the next week.

574
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,620
 And if he's not on next week's podcast, you know what's happening to him.

575
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,220
 All right, it's time for our final fact of the episode.

576
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,580
 And that, of course, is Andrew Hunter Murray.

577
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,020
 My fact this week is that shouting at drivers improves their driving.

578
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,740
 That doesn't really work in my experience.

579
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,900
 Yeah, this is under certain circumstances.

580
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,860
 I shouldn't clarify.

581
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,900
 If you're listening to this in the car, don't bellow at the driver.

582
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,260
 This was a study in Kenya.

583
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,660
 They have a lot of buses, they're called Matatus.

584
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:56,460
 And the initiative was basically to put stickers in buses with appalling images of accidents

585
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,620
 and things like that because they have so many traffic accidents and so many deaths.

586
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,340
 Right.

587
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:06,140
 And the idea was to get passengers on the buses to stand up and speak up against these

588
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,380
 reckless drivers who caused a lot of accidents.

589
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,460
 And they said, "Look, if the driver's driving badly, look at all these horrible accident photos,

590
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,420
 like on a packet of cigarettes and speak up."

591
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,620
 And everyone just started shouting at the drivers on these randomly-

592
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,420
 Slow down!

593
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,700
 Yeah, you maniac.

594
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,260
 And they found that Matatus with these stickers are about half as likely to get into accidents.

595
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,380
 But-

596
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,820
 There is, yeah, there's certain effects.

597
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,020
 I can't remember what it's called.

598
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,580
 There was a factory and they wanted to see if they could improve the outputs.

599
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,900
 And they did loads of different things to these people.

600
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,460
 And everything they tried, the output would go up.

601
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,180
 No matter what they tried, they would make the lights a bit brighter, it would work.

602
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,020
 They would make the lights darker, it would work.

603
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,180
 They would try everything, it would always work.

604
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,620
 And just by the fact that you're being tested or you're being studied,

605
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,940
 it makes people try harder because they know someone's watching.

606
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,780
 But I do think this did genuinely affect you.

607
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,540
 Yeah, no, it's a really good fact.

608
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,140
 So I have a news article about shouting just to slip in.

609
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,460
 A dog walker sparked a major search and rescue operation

610
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,180
 by calling out for her pet named Yelp.

611
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,500
 And basically, people had heard her shouting "Yelp, Yelp"

612
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,660
 and thought she was shouting "Help, Help."

613
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,420
 And there was a massive operation to try and find this woman who's calling for help.

614
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,220
 That's what I think people were calling.

615
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,180
 There was like an open shaft nearby and people thought

616
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,340
 that their voice was coming from the shaft.

617
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:29,980
 It's quite really good what's put a lost dog ad in the newspaper

618
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,260
 and the ad just read, "Here, boy."

619
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,940
 That's great.

620
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,220
 Was there one of the QI panellists who said that they had a dog called Mingus?

621
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,460
 Oh, it's Ross Noble. Is this Granddad's dog, I think?

622
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:42,780
 Oh, yeah.

623
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,500
 But yes, his dog was named Mingus.

624
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,100
 I can't do the accent, but Ross said.

625
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,820
 And the problem with this dog was that he had the same accent as Ross.

626
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,980
 So he goes to the park and be telling "Mingus, Mingus!"

627
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,060
 No, the local girls are like, "Who are you calling?"

628
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,380
 I read earlier that there was an ancient Greek belief that

629
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,980
 "Buzzle would grow better if you shouted curses at it while you were planting it."

630
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,580
 I haven't properly tried this out, but I liked the sound of it.

631
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,980
 Maybe it's because the bees would come and pollinate it.

632
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,580
 Yeah, they would come to the swearing.

633
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,900
 It's an ancient secret, there'll be one Earth.

634
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,420
 The effect when you're at a party or something and everyone's talking loud.

635
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,220
 So you talk a bit louder and then eventually everyone's talking really loud.

636
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,100
 There's a scientifically observed effect called the Lombard effect.

637
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,500
 Oh, yeah.

638
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,220
 And it doesn't just happen to people that happens in animals, too.

639
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,700
 Zebra Finches, quails, hummingbirds, marmosets, beluga whales, orcas, manatees.

640
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,300
 That sounds like a great party, yeah.

641
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,940
 Well, they've discovered that there's a certain type of bird

642
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,060
 that sings louder now in the city, just back to urban animals.

643
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,860
 This people out.

644
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,860
 Yeah, yeah, because of just the city noises.

645
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,700
 I can't remember what it's called, but it's...

646
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,540
 I'm pretty sure nice and girls sing louder in the cities, but I don't think it's...

647
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,580
 I don't think that's what you're talking about.

648
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,820
 Because I want to know if there's a word for that effect

649
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,580
 when you say something awkward, because it's loud,

650
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,540
 and since you say it, the music cuts out, and that's what gives you shout.

651
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,140
 We should call it the unmillar effect.

652
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,580
 Maybe not, that's not a good one.

653
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,340
 It's not something good named after me.

654
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,060
 Okay, here's not here.

655
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,980
 We should call it the anotizanski effect.

656
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:06,700
 I like just with this original fact of the idea of being shouted out when you're driving a bus.

657
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,140
 I read this great story years ago, which this has reminded me of.

658
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,900
 There was a bridge in China, which famously people would jump off

659
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,420
 and try and commit suicide.

660
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,620
 But if the police got there in time, they would block off the bridge

661
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,780
 and they would have tried to negotiate the guy off the bridge.

662
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,700
 And this one time, they were stuck for like two hours,

663
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,620
 while this guy was on the edge of the bridge,

664
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,180
 threatening to kill himself, and this retired soldier was just so sick of the police,

665
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,820
 not being able to negotiate with this guy.

666
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,300
 He just decided, I'm going to do something about this.

667
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,100
 He got out of his car, he went past the police.

668
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,820
 They couldn't stop him, and he went up to the guy,

669
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,580
 and he put his hand out to shake his hand.

670
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,660
 They shook hands, and then he pushed him off the bridge.

671
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:53,100
 Because he was like, you're holding up the traffic.

672
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,620
 Now, fortunately, when he plunged,

673
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,260
 he landed on a partially inflated, big bouncy castle that they make.

674
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,140
 You know, there was a children's party going on below.

675
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,140
 No, you know when you're committing suicide,

676
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,260
 they try to lure you down.

677
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,900
 Yeah, they always, for a lot of, if you get there in time,

678
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,180
 for a lot of suicide people,

679
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,020
 like if there's a fire and they'll have a blanket.

680
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,180
 They'll take off your shoes before you plummet.

681
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,060
 I have some facts about bad drivers.

682
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,620
 Okay.

683
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,420
 I spent some of this afternoon doing a theory test online.

684
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,540
 Oh, yeah, how'd you get on?

685
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,340
 I passed.

686
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,300
 Did you drive?

687
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,260
 Yeah, you're right.

688
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,300
 I can, yeah.

689
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,980
 I got the minimum pass mark.

690
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,980
 But I just love these questions.

691
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,620
 So here's one.

692
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,380
 It's a multiple choice.

693
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,820
 I'll just read out the options.

694
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,180
 As you approach a pelican crossing,

695
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,620
 the lights change to green.

696
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,780
 Elderly people are halfway across.

697
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,620
 You should wait because they will take longer to cross.

698
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,980
 Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

699
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,140
 Wave to them to cross as quickly as they can,

700
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,100
 or rev your engine to make them hurry.

701
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,420
 I remember Jenny's and myself.

702
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,540
 And they always were traveling like,

703
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,020
 "Reg your ends."

704
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,780
 No, just like, wait and proceed Wednesday.

705
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,260
 I know, there's another one where you're at a lunch occasion

706
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,340
 and you'll have to drive in the evening.

707
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,100
 Should you drink nothing?

708
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,540
 Have a hot meal with your alcohol.

709
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,020
 There was an internet news story a few years ago.

710
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,780
 And I'm quite sure it's not true.

711
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,780
 But it was supposedly the Chinese theory test.

712
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,420
 And some of the questions were so ridiculous.

713
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,740
 One of them was like, "You knock someone over.

714
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,780
 Do you A, go over, get their intestines and push it back into their potty."

715
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,900
 Or B, ring for help people to the side.

716
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,180
 Yeah, exactly.

717
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,380
 Well, there's one as man,

718
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,380
 which is an accident casualty as an engine arm.

719
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,380
 They can move freely, but it's bleeding.

720
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,780
 Why should you get them to keep it in a raised position?

721
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,940
 Is it A, that will help to reduce the bleeding?

722
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,260
 B, because it will ease the pain.

723
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,420
 C, it will help them to be seen more easily.

724
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,700
 Or D, to stop them touching other people.

725
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,940
 Would they're blood?

726
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,980
 That was a real British theory test.

727
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,740
 Here's a thing about driving.

728
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,980
 You can drive fast enough for speed cameras not to get you.

729
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,820
 If you're driving fast enough on a road.

730
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,860
 How fast do you have to be going?

731
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,100
 Only 119 million miles per hour.

732
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,260
 Top gear, we're with you.

733
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,260
 When they invented the speed cameras themselves to encourage speeding initially,

734
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,740
 wasn't it?

735
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,260
 It was the racing driver who invented the equipment.

736
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,220
 Yeah, that's how he was doing on the curves and corners.

737
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,180
 Yeah, okay.

738
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,940
 I have a fact about car insurance.

739
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,700
 Which is the very first policy was written by Lloyds in 1904.

740
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,820
 And it had never been done before.

741
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,700
 And so there were no guidelines.

742
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,220
 There were completely started from scratch.

743
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,340
 And so all the documents referred to it as a ship navigating on land.

744
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,140
 Nice, nice, like it.

745
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,540
 I have a fact about that guy, Gatso.

746
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,420
 Oh, yeah.

747
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,500
 He died in 1998.

748
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,900
 He was caught out by his own cameras all the time.

749
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,020
 And he himself said,

750
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,460
 "I am often caught by my own speed cameras and find hefty finds on my door mat.

751
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,220
 Even I can't escape my own invention.

752
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,340
 Because I love speeding."

753
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,740
 He said all of that.

754
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,060
 Just with the shouting thing,

755
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,420
 shouting obviously sometimes can just really make you feel good as well.

756
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,980
 But there was a study that was done.

757
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,500
 And this did win an egg Nobel.

758
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,380
 We've mentioned egg Nobel.

759
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,420
 One of our previous guests was Mark Abrams, who runs the whole thing.

760
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,700
 Oh, and the ward was given to Richard Stevens and some others at Keele University

761
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,420
 who confirmed that swearing relieves pain.

762
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,220
 Yeah, I remember that.

763
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,780
 Yeah.

764
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,380
 Yeah, it's called Lalo Chizia.

765
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,180
 Yeah.

766
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:21,180
 6% of drivers will deliberately swerve to kill animals they see on the road.

767
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,060
 Oh, 6%.

768
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,860
 Well, that's pretty low.

769
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,500
 That's not.

770
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,620
 No, these words then will swerve the same way.

771
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,420
 Yeah, exactly.

772
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,220
 And the way that they worked that out is there was a study done.

773
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,140
 And they got like plastic animals,

774
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,820
 like a little plastic snake or a plastic scorpion or something.

775
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,700
 And they were put it on the side of the road where people weren't driving.

776
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,220
 And they would count how many of them sweared.

777
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,660
 Oh, you didn't say it was a snake or a scorpion.

778
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,420
 I thought you were imagining an elk or a puppy or a penguin.

779
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,580
 I was like with my hedgehog facts.

780
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,620
 I never really met a man.

781
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,980
 And he would drive around.

782
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,700
 And if he found roadkill hedgehogs, he would take them,

783
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,020
 make a clay cast of them, then put them back on the road

784
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,980
 as a permanent marker.

785
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,820
 So people would notice how many deaths they'd be in.

786
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,780
 Wow.

787
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,260
 Wow.

788
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,460
 There's someone else who drives around

789
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,300
 cooking roadkill and eating it.

790
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,660
 So maybe they're partners.

791
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,260
 He's tried loads of stuff.

792
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,860
 Yeah, he keeps eating this concrete.

793
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,020
 Hard and teeth.

794
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,540
 I wanted to just thinking about that.

795
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,100
 Someone putting a plastic snake on the side of the road.

796
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,940
 I wonder how many times a day

797
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,820
 just even the four of us are being secretly tested

798
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,700
 by scientists.

799
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,460
 Like there's just so many of these experiments going around.

800
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,060
 What about that Facebook thing the other day?

801
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,180
 Oh, that's strange.

802
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,300
 See, when you log on to Facebook,

803
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,180
 you don't see everything.

804
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,820
 You see a selection that Facebook chooses to show you.

805
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,940
 And they started skewing it.

806
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,700
 So you'd see, like, sort of pessimistic updates

807
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,300
 from your email friends.

808
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,580
 And then they'd watch you see if you then

809
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,620
 posted a more sad update if they could affect your mood

810
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,580
 by what they showed you.

811
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,220
 Wow.

812
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,940
 It's a fairly uncontroversial finding, I think,

813
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,100
 that if you see a load of miserable status

814
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,300
 as you'll feel a bit glum.

815
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,460
 I'll tell you, hate all your friends, which I do.

816
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,460
 So you've got the shine Friday.

817
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,580
 Yeah, I was delighted.

818
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,340
 I post a lot of cheery statuses.

819
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,700
 Great to see Neville lost his job.

820
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,860
 It's Neville.

821
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,980
 So it is controversial though,

822
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,140
 because they're experimenting on people

823
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,260
 who haven't given their permission.

824
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,060
 That's a big no-go.

825
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,940
 I'm not saying it's not.

826
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,660
 I'm not saying it's not.

827
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,980
 Yeah, but presumably the snake's on a road isn't.

828
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,340
 Well, the rubber snake can't give him

829
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,620
 full consent for two reasons.

830
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,420
 For many, many.

831
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,260
 I'm sort of the driver.

832
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,540
 I don't know who you are.

833
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,460
 OK, we should wrap up.

834
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,940
 Has anyone got any last minifacts on the trend?

835
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,820
 Yeah, go for it.

836
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,860
 We're especially from our first fact book,

837
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,820
 "1-2-7-Q-I-Facts," which is that Schimpfloss

838
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,660
 is a German 24-hour hotline,

839
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,020
 which allows customers to release

840
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,900
 pen to progression by swearing at the telephone operators.

841
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,020
 Have you seen things dressed?

842
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,660
 Give them a call.

843
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,140
 That's what they're doing.

844
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,260
 Do you have the number by any chance?

845
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,700
 I don't, but hopefully we can put it on our website.

846
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,420
 Yeah, we can send it.

847
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,460
 We'll put it on our website.

848
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:42,060
 1-800-AAAGH! OK, that's it. That's all of our facts.

849
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,740
 Thanks, everyone, for listening to this episode.

850
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,340

 And if you want to talk to any of us about the things

852
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,020
 that we said on this episode,

00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,340
 you can reach us all on our Twitter handles.

854
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,340

856
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,460
 @miller_an.

857
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,220
 Andy @undruhunterm.

858
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,820
 We'll be back again next week.

859
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,780
 And we'll see you then.

860
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,340
 Goodbye.

861
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:07,980
 Hi, everybody. We recorded that podcast actually a couple of days ago.

862
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,340
 And since then, Andy and Dan have gone to the Edinburgh Festival.

863
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,820
 So if you find yourself in the Edinburgh area,

864
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,340
 you might want to go and watch their shows.

865
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,860
 They have two each.

866
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,020
 Andy is doing two improv shows.

867
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,780
 One is called ostentatious.

868
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,620
 And the other is called Folly Adder.

869
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,660
 And Dan is doing his first one-hour comedy show

870
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,740
 called Cockblocked From Outer Space.

871
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,700
 And he will also be producing Museum of Curiosity,

872
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,860
 which is the QI radio show.

873
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,500
 And they'll be doing a live show in Edinburgh as well.

874
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,420
 So if you're a fan of their voices, why not go along?

875
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:45,740
 The laws are on their way.

876
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:52,940
 And this time, there's no escape.
