00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to"
00:00:20,00:00:26,"you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna"
00:00:26,00:00:32,"Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around our"
00:00:32,00:00:37,"microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order,"
00:00:37,00:00:45,here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Anna. My fact this week is that 19 states
00:00:45,00:00:53,in the USA have banned the banning of clotheslines. It's a double ban. Does that mean clotheslines
00:00:53,00:00:58,as in things you put clothes on or is this like a wrestling term where you kind of almost
00:00:58,00:01:02,decapitate someone? Surely the wrestling move is covered by other legislation.
00:01:02,00:01:07,In wrestling are you allowed to strangle people with a clothesline?
00:01:07,00:01:11,"No, well yeah, you are. You are. I mean, you know, that's modern wrestling."
00:01:11,00:01:17,"It's a metaphorical clothesline that I'm talking about. It's a forearm, yeah. You open up your arm,"
00:01:17,00:01:21,you run towards them and you hit them across the neck with your arm and that's the clothesline.
00:01:21,00:01:25,"It's like, it's a type of tackle in American football, I think, and then they turn it into"
00:01:25,00:01:29,"a wrestling move. Interesting. See, I knew about the, you know, sometimes someone will"
00:01:29,00:01:33,"turn up with a steel chair or hit someone else with a table, but I didn't know there was a laundry"
00:01:33,00:01:37,"rack or a laundry line that could also be drafted into service in wrestling matches,"
00:01:37,00:01:41,"if this makes more sense. Yeah, me neither. All my research on clotheslines did not come"
00:01:41,00:01:45,"across the wrestling move. Stuck to clotheslines themselves and they're quite controversial,"
00:01:45,00:01:52,"turns out. So a lot of rental associations, housing associations ban them because they're"
00:01:52,00:01:57,sort of unsightly. They've got a bad image. They sort of were historically associated with
00:01:57,00:02:01,poverty in the fifties when people were getting electronic washing machines and dryers. So it
00:02:01,00:02:05,"was like, if you hung your clothes out, it showed you're not in a posh neighborhood."
00:02:05,00:02:10,"And so lots of housing associations say, don't do it. But of course, with the environmental"
00:02:10,00:02:13,"movement, everyone's gone, what are you talking about? It's much better to hang your clothes out"
00:02:13,00:02:19,"on a clothesline. And so about 2012, there was this big movement, and a bunch of states, Arizona,"
00:02:19,00:02:25,"Maryland, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, et cetera, said you're not allowed to ban them anymore."
00:02:25,00:02:29,"It is weird when you think about it, though, it's the only thing that's really intimate to us that"
00:02:29,00:02:34,"we just take out of the house to show everyone. You know, we're not showing it to them on purpose,"
00:02:34,00:02:40,but I don't hang my books outside or the contents of my fridge for people to see what my diet's like.
00:02:40,00:02:47,"Yeah, but you've got to stop washing your books. It's just odd, you know, we hang underwear outside."
00:02:47,00:02:51,"I get it. I get the banning of it. Yeah, but then after Second World War, when they were trying"
00:02:51,00:02:57,"to get more women in the workplace, it was kind of a new form of modern living where, you know,"
00:02:57,00:03:02,"everything was done by machines and stuff like this, especially in America. And so,"
00:03:02,00:03:07,and also they wanted to sell electricity. So they kind of thought that really it's almost a
00:03:07,00:03:12,patriotic duty to have a machine doing all your washing rather than your wife doing all your
00:03:12,00:03:17,"washing in America. And if you had it hanging outside, it was like a symbol that you were"
00:03:17,00:03:21,"part of the old times. When people used to do that, you weren't part of the new times,"
00:03:21,00:03:25,but it's slightly different in the UK because less than half of people in the UK have a tumble
00:03:25,00:03:31,"dryer, whereas in America, it's like, I don't know, like 80% or something like that. Yeah, it's huge."
00:03:32,00:03:37,"I was a money-saving expert in the UK and maybe this was you, Dan. There was someone who said,"
00:03:37,00:03:41,"""I've just moved to a new place and I'm the only person who hangs my laundry on the balcony."""
00:03:41,00:03:46,"Is it okay? And the first response was, ""Not acceptable at all. Who wants to see your"
00:03:46,00:03:50,shabby clothes hanging out on the balcony? Do you think the architect envisions that?
00:03:50,00:03:56,Clothes on balconies are the same as broken cars in front gardens. Have some pride in where you live.
00:03:56,00:04:01,"I really like that. So this gets called the right to dry, which is a catchy phrase,"
00:04:01,00:04:08,"but like Anna says, most, lots of states, nearly half of them are banned it, but Utah hasn't. Utah"
00:04:08,00:04:14,"has passed laws which allow local authorities to forbid people from banning clothes lines,"
00:04:14,00:04:20,"but they have not passed a law themselves. So they have legalized the banning of the ban,"
00:04:20,00:04:26,"but they have not just banned banning directly. So abused. Sorry, they've legalized the banning"
00:04:26,00:04:31,"of the ban. They've said it's okay to ban people from banning them. They've passed laws saying,"
00:04:31,00:04:36,"""Local authorities in Utah can ban bans, but they haven't stepped in themselves and banned bans"
00:04:36,00:04:43,"directly."" It feels like you can remove at least two of the bans from that sentence. I'm not sure."
00:04:43,00:04:46,"I've tried. It doesn't work. It's exactly as I said. Oh, yeah."
00:04:47,00:04:52,Do you know the most powerful room in America is a laundry room?
00:04:52,00:04:54,The White House. Yeah.
00:04:54,00:04:59,"Yeah. Well, it used to be. It used to be a laundry room. So Franklin Roosevelt actually moved the"
00:04:59,00:05:05,"Oval Office from where it used to be. It used to be located in the center of the White House,"
00:05:05,00:05:09,"and then you prefer to have it put more by windows, and there was an obvious room for it to go to,"
00:05:09,00:05:12,and that's the room where they used to hang all of the laundry in and dry it up there.
00:05:12,00:05:16,"He had that removed, and then the Oval Office was placed there."
00:05:16,00:05:20,"Oh, it doesn't smell nearly as nice now, presumably. That would have been what attracted him to the"
00:05:20,00:05:23,room. Very disappointing when they took the clean laundry out.
00:05:23,00:05:26,"When you see that center shot of a president behind the desk, they have to crop it because"
00:05:26,00:05:30,"just next to him, there's a clothes horse. It's just packed with everyone's washing."
00:05:30,00:05:36,"Clothes house. Do you guys call it a clothes house? That kind of thing. What do you call it,"
00:05:36,00:05:39,"Andy? I just like a laundry rack. Laundry rack. Hannah, what do you call them?"
00:05:40,00:05:46,Clothes ass. Mine's a bit smaller than your average ones.
00:05:46,00:05:53,"Because I call them clothes maiden, and I was googling this because I wanted to know where"
00:05:53,00:05:58,"the word came from, and then from my Google, it seemed to imply that this is not what anyone"
00:05:58,00:06:03,else calls it. I've never heard of clothes maiden. Definitely the sexiest version.
00:06:03,00:06:07,"Well, it's so strange. It's like, you know, when you have these words that you think are so common"
00:06:07,00:06:12,"and everyone uses them, and then you say them, and then everyone's like, what on earth are you"
00:06:12,00:06:17,"talking about? Well, this is it. But maiden is like what people in Lancashire would call,"
00:06:17,00:06:21,"I think, what Dan called a clothes horse, and Andy called a clothes rack, and we gloss over"
00:06:21,00:06:27,"what Anna called it. And I think, I can't find out why they're called maidens, but I reckon"
00:06:27,00:06:33,"it's because in a spinning machine, you would have two bits of wood that held the kind of spool,"
00:06:33,00:06:37,"and they were called a maiden, or they were called maidens, and they would stick upwards,"
00:06:37,00:06:41,"and then they would have a bar coming across them, and then you would hang things on there."
00:06:41,00:06:45,"And I reckon that that's why they call it, because obviously Lancashire was like a spinning area."
00:06:45,00:06:51,"Oh, that's cool. It wasn't the case that historically unmarried women used to stand"
00:06:51,00:06:55,with their arms outstretched for hours on end with clothes draped over them.
00:06:55,00:07:00,It was a simpler time and a happier time. Do you know why laundry smells nice?
00:07:02,00:07:06,"Specifically air-dried, because you put soap in your clothes."
00:07:06,00:07:12,"The soap helps, definitely. But that's specifically, I think, the difference between air-dried,"
00:07:12,00:07:19,line-dried towels supposedly smell nicer than machine-dried towels or whatever.
00:07:19,00:07:23,And scientists last year published a paper examining at the molecular level why these
00:07:23,00:07:28,"smells so damn good. And they got a load of samples, and they used ultrapurified water,"
00:07:28,00:07:33,"and then they hung the things out to dry, and then they sealed them in a bag for 15 hours"
00:07:33,00:07:37,"once they were dry, and then sampled the air that was being given off by these things,"
00:07:37,00:07:42,"and compared the chemical profiles and la, la, la. And after things have been out in the sun,"
00:07:42,00:07:49,"they emit specific organic molecules. And one of them is called octanal, and one of them is called,"
00:07:49,00:07:56,"I think it's pronounced non-anal, non-anal, but it's not non-anal. And non-anal smells of roses,"
00:07:56,00:08:01,apparently. And it's possible that exposure to ozone outdoors transforms these chemicals
00:08:01,00:08:07,"and makes them smell lovely. Non-anal smells of roses. Do you think, if it was cold,"
00:08:07,00:08:10,"anything other than non-anal, it would still smell as sweet?"
00:08:10,00:08:14,I understand that reference. Thank you.
00:08:14,00:08:18,It's from Anna Corellina.
00:08:22,00:08:29,"It's the final line of Anna Corellina. You know, you were saying, James, that it was the"
00:08:29,00:08:34,"electricity movement, this push for electricity that meant people weren't supposed to hang their"
00:08:34,00:08:37,clothes out anymore. Do you know who the face of electricity was in the 1950s?
00:08:37,00:08:44,"Not Edison. He was dead long ago. 50s, yeah. Yeah, his face looked awful by that point."
00:08:44,00:08:48,"Is it like a John Wayne? Is it like a famous person? Yes, actually, you're really close with"
00:08:48,00:08:54,"John Wayne. Think of the budget version of John Wayne. Oh, I know, Reagan. Yeah, it was Reagan."
00:08:54,00:09:01,"Very strong. Oh, how sad that I said budget version of John Wayne, and you did get Reagan from that."
00:09:01,00:09:04,So he must have loved the Oval Office. He would have felt right at home in there.
00:09:04,00:09:09,"Maybe that's why he went for president. Although, actually, no, he wouldn't have liked it,"
00:09:09,00:09:13,because he was all about anti-clothesline. So he was the face of the live better
00:09:13,00:09:17,"electrically campaign. And there are great adverts you can watch online, which show him"
00:09:18,00:09:24,with his wife and his child sitting around a table and his wife just talking about
00:09:24,00:09:27,"how great it is that she doesn't have to slave over various things anymore,"
00:09:27,00:09:32,"because she now has an electric souffle maker, an electric coffee percolator,"
00:09:32,00:09:38,"an electric combined toaster and grill, a lot of stuff that we do not have anymore"
00:09:38,00:09:42,as standard in our homes. So cool. You know what I would have done if I was the advertising
00:09:42,00:09:47,"executive for that? I would have had him with a weapon, which fired bolts of electricity that"
00:09:47,00:09:52,"turned things electric. So they'd be like an old kettle, and he'd get his weapon and fire some"
00:09:52,00:09:57,"electricity at it, and it would turn into an electric kettle. And he would be called Ronald"
00:09:57,00:10:05,"Reagan. That is good. There's a career in marketing and advertising opening out before us,"
00:10:05,00:10:09,"and I like to see it. It's hard to see you go, but you're going on."
00:10:09,00:10:16,"Can imagine you guys sending me off a one-way ticket to Saatchi and Saatchi,"
00:10:16,00:10:20,"and then me arriving at the front door and them going, ""Sorry, we don't know what you're on about."""
00:10:20,00:10:23,We've just given you a big piece of slate with Ronald Reagan written on the front of it.
00:10:23,00:10:32,"Speaking of electric and laundry, you can now get a smart clothes peg,"
00:10:32,00:10:34,"which is pretty exciting. Oh, that is exciting. Yeah."
00:10:34,00:10:38,"What's it do? It detects UV light and humidity and temperature,"
00:10:38,00:10:42,and then it tells you when it's going to rain. And it also takes you-
00:10:42,00:10:45,"Is it just one, or do you need to put it on each of your different-"
00:10:45,00:10:51,"I can't imagine that you'd need to buy 100. 40 pegs yelling at you, ""Ah, it's going to rain!"""
00:10:51,00:10:55,"I don't think, yeah, because it texts you when the clothes are dry. So if you've got 150 of these,"
00:10:55,00:11:00,"I think you get 150 texts saying it clothes the dry. Yeah, because if one of your clothes is dry,"
00:11:00,00:11:02,there's a decent chance the rest of them are at least nearly dry.
00:11:02,00:11:07,Exactly. Unless your garden is so big or your laundry is so extensive.
00:11:07,00:11:11,"That's really cool. I wonder if hackers could get into those smart,"
00:11:11,00:11:14,"because usually when you have a smart thing, the hackers can get into it."
00:11:14,00:11:16,"Well, and find out what kind of nickers you wear."
00:11:16,00:11:21,"Wear, you know, the internet. That's the kind of thing the internet's into, isn't it?"
00:11:21,00:11:22,I've read. Are you all right?
00:11:22,00:11:25,"But I think some clothes do take much longer to dry than others,"
00:11:25,00:11:28,"so I think you would need one for each item. Oh, gosh, Hannah."
00:11:28,00:11:31,Surely you just put the smart peg on the thing that takes longest to dry.
00:11:31,00:11:36,"Oh, God, I've wasted so much money on a thousand smart things."
00:11:36,00:11:40,"Do you, when you're doing the laundry and you put stuff outside,"
00:11:40,00:11:44,"you just go out and you take one thing. Oh, this is dry. I'll take this then."
00:11:44,00:11:48,Every five minutes. I'm not going to the garden.
00:11:48,00:11:53,"You know, washing detergent can be quite dangerous in war."
00:11:53,00:11:58,"So the army actually has a list of banned detergents that they're not allowed to use,"
00:11:58,00:12:02,"because they contain optical brightness. So imagine you wash, you was saying,"
00:12:02,00:12:06,"but if you use Dazz and your clothes are white or the white, you're going to be spotted in."
00:12:06,00:12:12,"No, this is, this is all to do with sort of, you know, infrared and so on."
00:12:12,00:12:17,"You know, if you have optical brightness in it, it'll go slightly fluorescent,"
00:12:17,00:12:21,"your clothing, and that can be picked up by night vision goggles and so on."
00:12:21,00:12:25,So they have a very strict list of what you're allowed to wash your clothes in.
00:12:25,00:12:27,Wow. So funny.
00:12:27,00:12:31,"But that is another idea for James to take to Sachi and Sachi, I think, for the next Dazz ad."
00:12:31,00:12:35,I think so bright that you will die in all situations.
00:12:35,00:12:38,"Oh, yeah. So the ad is just one, there's like 50 of them,"
00:12:38,00:12:42,and they all get gunned down except for the one guy who then holds up a Dazz box.
00:12:42,00:12:44,"It says, don't get shot."
00:12:44,00:12:46,He's the one who does get shot.
00:12:46,00:12:47,"Oh, the Dazz guy is dead."
00:12:47,00:12:48,Dazz man's dead.
00:12:48,00:12:53,"What you actually need is loads of, like people in a battle, loads of different sides,"
00:12:53,00:12:57,"and then they all want to give up. And so they all get a white flag,"
00:12:57,00:13:00,"but nine of them are really dirty white flags because they don't use Dazz,"
00:13:00,00:13:04,"but then one person has used Dazz and they have a really shiny white flag,"
00:13:04,00:13:05,and they're the ones that survive.
00:13:05,00:13:06,That is good.
00:13:08,00:13:12,Is the white flag means I surrender?
00:13:12,00:13:13,I surrender.
00:13:13,00:13:16,Is a dirty flag mean fuck you? What are you going to do?
00:13:16,00:13:18,What are you going to do?
00:13:18,00:13:19,Clear signal.
00:13:19,00:13:21,I don't deserve clemency because I have no hygiene.
00:13:21,00:13:26,"I've used this flag so many times, it's dirty."
00:13:26,00:13:33,"I don't think Dazz have advertised on British TV for some years now,"
00:13:33,00:13:38,"but if they've been saving up in their war chest for the next big campaign, this is it."
00:13:39,00:13:40,This is the thing.
00:13:40,00:13:46,"I can't believe this fact that I'm about to say,"
00:13:46,00:13:49,but Queen Victoria had a special train for her laundry.
00:13:49,00:13:56,"So there used to be a royal laundry in Richmond in London,"
00:13:56,00:14:00,"or did one and a half tons of laundry a day, so not all hers."
00:14:00,00:14:02,"It was, you know, Paris."
00:14:02,00:14:06,She was large by the end of her life though.
00:14:06,00:14:08,"It's true, but she wore a lot of layers."
00:14:08,00:14:08,Yeah.
00:14:08,00:14:13,"But basically wherever she was, apart from if she was in Scotland,"
00:14:13,00:14:16,which would have been insane for the laundry to come down from there.
00:14:16,00:14:19,"But even if she was on the Isle of Wight, or if she was at Windsor,"
00:14:19,00:14:22,"or her London Palace, Buckingham Palace, I guess,"
00:14:22,00:14:25,the railway handed over all these items.
00:14:25,00:14:28,"And I've seen sources saying, and this is the thing I really can't believe,"
00:14:28,00:14:32,"that it was a special miniature train, which took her laundry."
00:14:32,00:14:36,"She would have had to build a special railway line,"
00:14:36,00:14:40,like a special narrow gauge railway line for a miniature train with her pants.
00:14:40,00:14:41,And I cannot believe that.
00:14:41,00:14:45,She should have just got a washing machine in both of her palaces.
00:14:45,00:14:48,She wouldn't have to keep shipping it back.
00:14:48,00:14:49,"All right, Ronald Reagan."
00:14:49,00:14:54,"There was, speaking of railways,"
00:14:54,00:14:57,"we as a group have discussed the Underground Railroad before a few times,"
00:14:57,00:14:59,"but it's never been on this, I don't think."
00:14:59,00:15:05,"And that was the idea that you would take enslaved people from the South America,"
00:15:05,00:15:08,"and you would sneak them out of places where slavery was legal,"
00:15:08,00:15:11,and you would get them to places where they were safe.
00:15:11,00:15:16,"And there is a theory, or there's a story that you'll see a lot online,"
00:15:16,00:15:20,that people got messages through quilts on the Underground Railroad.
00:15:20,00:15:25,"And that is that you would put quilts on washing lines all the way along,"
00:15:25,00:15:26,and then you would see it.
00:15:26,00:15:27,"And if it had like a zigzag pattern,"
00:15:27,00:15:29,you'd know that this was a safe way to go.
00:15:29,00:15:31,"And if it had like a striped pattern,"
00:15:31,00:15:33,"it'd be like, we'll turn left here and stuff like that."
00:15:33,00:15:36,"And this story is all over the internet,"
00:15:36,00:15:38,"but according to National Geographic,"
00:15:38,00:15:42,quilt historians and Underground Railroad experts
00:15:42,00:15:46,have questioned the study's methodology of the original study.
00:15:46,00:15:51,"And apparently it was invented by a woman called Azala McDaniel-Williams,"
00:15:51,00:15:55,"who was a quilt salesperson in the 1990s,"
00:15:55,00:15:57,and wrote a book about quilts.
00:15:57,00:16:01,And she came up with this idea that this happened in the Underground Railroad.
00:16:01,00:16:03,"And it's not, it does make sense that you can send,"
00:16:03,00:16:06,there are examples of people sending messages using washing lines
00:16:06,00:16:08,"that happen in the American Civil War, I think."
00:16:08,00:16:12,"But this particular thing, I think, possibly not true."
00:16:12,00:16:12,That's a shame.
00:16:12,00:16:15,"It's a bit, it's a, it's someone trying to"
00:16:15,00:16:17,make the quilt a bigger part of world history.
00:16:17,00:16:18,I think so.
00:16:18,00:16:20,It's probably against inequality than it really is.
00:16:20,00:16:24,"It's a bit like, what was that mosquito expert that then had wine something?"
00:16:24,00:16:25,Timothy C. Weingard.
00:16:25,00:16:29,"Yeah, she is like the Timothy C. Weingard of quilts."
00:16:30,00:16:33,"Oh, I love that man."
00:16:33,00:16:38,"Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:16:38,00:16:39,And that is my fact.
00:16:39,00:16:44,My fact this week is that Canadian engineers are part of a secret order
00:16:44,00:16:46,designed by Rudyard Kipling.
00:16:46,00:16:55,"This is, this is called the ritual of the calling of an engineer."
00:16:55,00:17:02,"And it is a secret ritual that most, not all, but most are asked to take part in"
00:17:02,00:17:07,once they're sort of graduating to be officially a professional engineer.
00:17:07,00:17:11,And this little ritual started in the early 1900s.
00:17:11,00:17:17,And the people who set it up wanted a really good thing to read out at the ceremony.
00:17:17,00:17:18,And they couldn't do it on their own.
00:17:18,00:17:21,"So in 1922, they approached Rudyard Kipling,"
00:17:21,00:17:24,"author of the Jungle Book, and they asked him to write this thing."
00:17:24,00:17:26,And it's still going on to this day.
00:17:26,00:17:32,"You can still see, and this is how you know if a Canadian engineer is part of this secret order,"
00:17:32,00:17:33,look at the pinky finger.
00:17:33,00:17:37,"And if there's an iron ring on it, they are part of this secret sect."
00:17:37,00:17:39,"And there's not too much that we know about it, by the way."
00:17:39,00:17:41,"It is genuinely, they have the ceremony."
00:17:41,00:17:42,No friends are allowed to come.
00:17:42,00:17:44,No partners are allowed to come.
00:17:44,00:17:47,And only a few people have spoken about it publicly
00:17:47,00:17:50,telling us what goes on at these ceremonies.
00:17:50,00:17:53,"And it all sounds really tame, not dark at all, like really boring."
00:17:53,00:17:55,I don't know why they don't just tell us about it.
00:17:55,00:17:59,"Maybe, Dan, the people who came out, like the one or two people who've told you about it and said,"
00:17:59,00:18:01,"""Oh, yeah, it's really tame."""
00:18:01,00:18:02,"I mean, that's what they want you to think, isn't it?"
00:18:02,00:18:03,Exactly.
00:18:03,00:18:04,Yeah.
00:18:04,00:18:04,Very true.
00:18:04,00:18:05,Very true.
00:18:05,00:18:09,There's a very dangerous cabal going on in Canada.
00:18:09,00:18:11,We need to break it open.
00:18:11,00:18:16,"It's amazing that they just got the most famous writer in the world at the time,"
00:18:16,00:18:18,"as he was, to do this for them."
00:18:18,00:18:21,"They're so powerful, aren't they, these Canadian engineers."
00:18:21,00:18:22,"It's like, not surprising."
00:18:22,00:18:24,They probably could have got anyone.
00:18:24,00:18:24,Really?
00:18:24,00:18:26,"Yeah, you're right."
00:18:26,00:18:31,"My very good friend is an engineer and she worked in Canada for a year last year, a year before last."
00:18:31,00:18:35,And so I messaged her about this and she finds it pretty gross.
00:18:35,00:18:38,"So she's like, it's kind of disgusting because you go into the office"
00:18:38,00:18:41,and everyone else has this weird ring on their pinky.
00:18:41,00:18:44,And she also seemed to have an issue with the fact that
00:18:44,00:18:47,kind of anyone can get it according to her.
00:18:47,00:18:50,So you don't actually have to be chartered.
00:18:50,00:18:52,You only have to have graduated from university.
00:18:52,00:18:55,"In the UK, you don't get anything to your chartered, much longer process."
00:18:55,00:18:58,"And then you get an A3 certificate, not the same."
00:18:58,00:19:00,So it's kind of like piece of piss.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"She was like, any engineers can get it, by the way,"
00:19:02,00:19:04,even the ones who design air conditioning units.
00:19:04,00:19:07,"Well, Anna, it sounds like your friend is simultaneously very angry this exists"
00:19:07,00:19:09,and very angry she's not part of the club.
00:19:09,00:19:12,So she has a certificate.
00:19:12,00:19:14,I don't know what else she needs.
00:19:16,00:19:20,"But yeah, as you say, Andy, he was a really popular writer in that time."
00:19:20,00:19:23,So it is bizarre that he was writing for them.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Yeah.
00:19:24,00:19:27,"I think I had someone said, I think he was probably the richest"
00:19:27,00:19:30,classic author that Britain's ever had.
00:19:30,00:19:31,He was so bloody successful.
00:19:31,00:19:34,He bought himself a mansion with his proceeds.
00:19:34,00:19:39,There was one single story which ended up earning 31.5 million pounds.
00:19:39,00:19:42,"No, hang on."
00:19:42,00:19:44,"Wow. Rich and Asma, eat your heart out."
00:19:44,00:19:46,That is.
00:19:46,00:19:47,And that's a short story.
00:19:47,00:19:48,That's what he wrote in those days.
00:19:48,00:19:50,"That can't be in the money of the time,"
00:19:50,00:19:52,because you would have been able to buy the entire country with that.
00:19:52,00:19:56,"Sorry, it's the equivalent of 31.5 million, 250,000 pounds."
00:19:56,00:19:57,Which story?
00:19:57,00:19:59,"Well, it's a slight sheet."
00:19:59,00:20:00,It's called The Absent-Minded Beggar.
00:20:00,00:20:04,And it was the Daily Mail was running a charity fundraising thing
00:20:04,00:20:07,as part of an appeal to give money to soldiers in the ball.
00:20:07,00:20:09,And this is 1899.
00:20:09,00:20:12,"And Kipling wrote this poem, sent it to them and said,"
00:20:12,00:20:15,"""Use this as you see fit to raise as much money as you can."""
00:20:15,00:20:17,And so they did.
00:20:17,00:20:20,And all the proceeds that were raised from it went to the war effort.
00:20:20,00:20:22,But it really took off.
00:20:22,00:20:23,It was a sensation.
00:20:23,00:20:24,So it was a music hall.
00:20:24,00:20:28,"Anthem, Arthur Sullivan of Gilbert and Sullivan put music to it."
00:20:28,00:20:30,And people bloody loved it.
00:20:30,00:20:31,Cool.
00:20:31,00:20:32,Yeah.
00:20:32,00:20:37,He did a lot of that kind of writing with a slight element
00:20:37,00:20:39,of influencing public opinion behind it.
00:20:39,00:20:41,As in he was a campaigner.
00:20:41,00:20:44,He seemed to dislike a lot of things and a lot of people.
00:20:44,00:20:53,"So he is viewed variously as either a really, these days,"
00:20:53,00:20:57,"extremely old fashioned, jingoistic, imperialist, colonialist, racist,"
00:20:57,00:21:00,lots and lots of heavy criticism.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"Kind of kicked off by George Orwell,"
00:21:02,00:21:04,who pointed out that people have been hating Kipling.
00:21:04,00:21:06,"Pretty much since he was writing, since he was really popular,"
00:21:06,00:21:09,lots of people have really disliked Fredrick Kipling.
00:21:09,00:21:12,"But then again, he also has written these fabulous books,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,which are very observant about human nature and all this stuff.
00:21:14,00:21:16,So it kind of keeps the reputation going.
00:21:16,00:21:20,"But one of the things that he wrote was the phrase known unto God,"
00:21:20,00:21:25,which went on gravestones of unidentified servicemen after the war ended.
00:21:25,00:21:29,And he lost his only son in the First World War.
00:21:29,00:21:31,And he was on the Imperial War Graves Commission.
00:21:31,00:21:32,He played a big role in that.
00:21:32,00:21:36,And that was the phrase that he thought was most fitting.
00:21:36,00:21:39,He was always arguing that rich families
00:21:39,00:21:43,"shouldn't be able to erect loads of statues to their own children,"
00:21:43,00:21:46,because he thought that everyone who died in the war
00:21:46,00:21:49,really should have an equal remembrance.
00:21:49,00:21:51,And that was a huge thing.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"There was a family called the Sessles,"
00:21:53,00:21:56,who were one of the richest families in the whole of Britain.
00:21:56,00:21:57,"And he really stood up against them,"
00:21:57,00:22:00,because they wanted to do these statues.
00:22:00,00:22:02,"And he was like, ""No, everyone should have the same."""
00:22:02,00:22:03,"Oh, that's interesting."
00:22:03,00:22:06,"But yeah, he was a massive racist."
00:22:06,00:22:08,So that's another thing.
00:22:08,00:22:11,"I mean, he really, he was a white supremacist."
00:22:11,00:22:12,So yeah.
00:22:12,00:22:14,He's such an interesting character.
00:22:14,00:22:17,"So his first language is Hindi, born in India,"
00:22:17,00:22:19,cause like first years in India.
00:22:19,00:22:22,"And said apparently he wasn't very good at English when he learned it,"
00:22:22,00:22:24,because they learned it in translation from Hindi.
00:22:24,00:22:28,So you'd learn it in like a really stilted sing song way.
00:22:28,00:22:31,"And he said that when he came to Britain,"
00:22:31,00:22:33,so he came to Britain when he was about six
00:22:33,00:22:34,and was sent away by his parents.
00:22:34,00:22:37,And then he returned to India when he was 17.
00:22:37,00:22:39,"And he wrote that when he returned,"
00:22:39,00:22:42,"he found himself speaking in vernacular sentences,"
00:22:42,00:22:43,whose meaning I knew not.
00:22:43,00:22:45,He just found words coming out of his mouth
00:22:45,00:22:47,"that he remembered from his childhood,"
00:22:47,00:22:50,"not even knowing what he was saying, apparently, bizarre."
00:22:50,00:22:51,Yeah.
00:22:51,00:22:54,"He came up with the phrase ""the oldest profession"""
00:22:54,00:22:55,to mean prostitution.
00:22:55,00:22:59,"So lots of people said, ""Oh, that's the oldest profession."""
00:22:59,00:23:00,"But before Kipling,"
00:23:00,00:23:01,they were talking about lots of different professions.
00:23:01,00:23:05,"So there was, you know, tailors were described as the oldest profession."
00:23:05,00:23:07,"That's probably the first time anyone said,"
00:23:07,00:23:08,"""This is the oldest profession."""
00:23:08,00:23:09,"So that's the oldest, oldest profession."
00:23:09,00:23:12,"Murderers were claimed as being the oldest profession,"
00:23:12,00:23:13,"arguably not a profession, but still."
00:23:13,00:23:16,And there was this weird crossover period
00:23:16,00:23:18,where lots of people were still quite innocent of the phrase.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"So, but we're using it and then other people would think,"
00:23:20,00:23:22,"""Oh, I'm not sure that's what you mean."""
00:23:22,00:23:24,"So graduating cadets might be told,"
00:23:24,00:23:27,"""You are now entering the oldest profession in the world."""
00:23:27,00:23:30,"And not, you know, the old buffer who was doing a ceremony"
00:23:30,00:23:31,might not realize what he was saying.
00:23:32,00:23:32,That was a bit...
00:23:32,00:23:36,"Apparently, he coined a few other terms and words."
00:23:36,00:23:39,"So some of the words include ""lunchless."""
00:23:39,00:23:41,"Yeah, classic."
00:23:41,00:23:43,That describes someone who has no lunch.
00:23:43,00:23:44,Brilliant.
00:23:44,00:23:45,Just so you know.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"Genius, wasn't it? Genius of coined words."
00:23:47,00:23:48,He was.
00:23:48,00:23:49,"Apparently, he coined ""writer."""
00:23:49,00:23:51,"Apparently, that's his."
00:23:51,00:23:53,"That's the first use of ""writer."""
00:23:53,00:23:54,"Oh, that's a biggie, actually."
00:23:54,00:23:56,"It is for you, Andy,"
00:23:56,00:23:59,but most people don't use it quite as often as you do.
00:24:00,00:24:02,The sun rarely sets on a date
00:24:02,00:24:04,"when I have it said ""writer"" at least a few times."
00:24:04,00:24:09,"""Squidgy"" as well, and ""stinky."""
00:24:09,00:24:10,Promise.
00:24:10,00:24:10,Did he too?
00:24:10,00:24:13,"Because I know he coined ""squiggly"" as well,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,"and it seems like a cheat to coin ""squidgy"" and ""squiggly."""
00:24:15,00:24:17,"I don't know if you count one, if you've done the other."
00:24:17,00:24:19,"Oh, that's very different words."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"They, one of them, described something that's soft"
00:24:22,00:24:24,and the other one described something that goes in lots of directions.
00:24:24,00:24:25,Yeah.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"That's a good point, actually."
00:24:26,00:24:30,You wouldn't say I've just enjoyed a lovely moist squiggly bit of sponge cake
00:24:30,00:24:30,would you?
00:24:30,00:24:33,"No, you wouldn't say I've just drawn a squidgy line."
00:24:33,00:24:33,No.
00:24:33,00:24:36,"But we all say ""writer."""
00:24:36,00:24:42,He was so famous that towns named themselves after him.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"So there were two towns in, I think, Michigan,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,which named themselves Rudyard and Kipling after him.
00:24:47,00:24:52,"And there's a place in Saskatchewan called Kipling,"
00:24:52,00:24:53,and that is an interesting place for us
00:24:53,00:24:57,because it's the town where a Canadian blogger called Kyle MacDonald
00:24:57,00:25:00,traded his way from a paperclip up to a house.
00:25:00,00:25:01,Do you remember this guy?
00:25:01,00:25:02,"I do, yeah."
00:25:02,00:25:05,He started with a paperclip and traded it for loads and loads of things.
00:25:05,00:25:09,"This was in about the early 2000s, and he ended up with a house in Kipling."
00:25:09,00:25:11,"And the town now has, to commemorate it,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,with the world's largest paperclip.
00:25:13,00:25:16,They've got a 15-foot-old paperclip to commemorate that.
00:25:16,00:25:17,That's cool.
00:25:17,00:25:20,"Well, of course, as we said before, he was named after a place,"
00:25:20,00:25:22,a place where his parents met Rudyard Lake.
00:25:22,00:25:26,Also quite an interesting place because that was a massive tourist attraction.
00:25:26,00:25:28,So that's a lake in Staffordshire.
00:25:28,00:25:34,"And I discovered that, as well as being the reason that Rudyard's called Rudyard,"
00:25:34,00:25:37,"it was also the place where the African blondin,"
00:25:37,00:25:40,"as he called himself, a guy called Carlos Trower,"
00:25:40,00:25:44,in 1864 walked a tightrope 100 feet up above the lake.
00:25:44,00:25:44,Wow.
00:25:44,00:25:45,And it sounds great.
00:25:45,00:25:48,"And thousands of people used to go to this place every day, apparently."
00:25:48,00:25:52,"So I think apparently 20,000 visitors a day"
00:25:52,00:25:54,would visit this tourist attraction at its peak.
00:25:54,00:25:58,And they watched him and he did it carrying an 11-year-old boy.
00:25:58,00:26:01,"He did it backwards and forwards with his hands and feet shackled,"
00:26:01,00:26:04,which I've got no idea how you walk a tightrope like that.
00:26:04,00:26:07,And then at one point he was in the middle of the tightrope above the lake
00:26:07,00:26:10,"and then he went back to the edge, picked up a stove,"
00:26:10,00:26:13,brought it back to the middle and cooked himself ham and eggs.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"Which I don't, I also don't know how you cook"
00:26:15,00:26:17,on a stove in the middle of a tightrope.
00:26:17,00:26:21,"Isn't he the guy who he did Niagara Falls as well, isn't he?"
00:26:21,00:26:21,Blondin.
00:26:21,00:26:23,Blondin did Niagara Falls.
00:26:23,00:26:23,"That was the Blondin, yeah, yeah."
00:26:23,00:26:24,He named himself.
00:26:24,00:26:25,What's this guy's name?
00:26:25,00:26:26,"Oh, great."
00:26:26,00:26:30,"Okay, about, because Blondin also cooked in his walks as well, didn't he?"
00:26:30,00:26:32,So he's a total tribute act.
00:26:32,00:26:32,Yeah.
00:26:32,00:26:32,That's really cool.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"He's a tribute act, but over a lake in Staffordshire,"
00:26:35,00:26:39,"as opposed to over Niagara Falls, which I don't know,"
00:26:39,00:26:41,"I really like Staffordshire as a county,"
00:26:41,00:26:43,but I'm not sure it has quite the same gravitas.
00:26:43,00:26:44,It's not quite.
00:26:44,00:26:48,"Yeah, but if you're a tribute band, you don't play the O2."
00:26:48,00:26:51,"You play the poorly arms, you know?"
00:26:51,00:26:51,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:51,00:26:54,"No, but there is another thing that happened at Lake Rudyard,"
00:26:54,00:26:58,"which is that Matthew Webb, who the first person to swim the English Channel,"
00:26:58,00:27:01,he went to Lake Rudyard to host a grand aquatic fate
00:27:01,00:27:03,where he recreated his channel swim.
00:27:03,00:27:06,"Again, I have no idea how impressive that would have actually been,"
00:27:06,00:27:10,watching him to splash around in a lake for a bit.
00:27:10,00:27:15,I wonder what the difference is between recreating a swim across the channel
00:27:15,00:27:16,and just swimming.
00:27:16,00:27:18,"Like, how does he make it?"
00:27:18,00:27:22,"Does he put, like, a cross-channel ferry next to him or what?"
00:27:22,00:27:24,You're absolutely right.
00:27:24,00:27:27,"There's details that are frustratingly vague, because this was..."
00:27:27,00:27:29,You'd have to have people generate waves.
00:27:29,00:27:32,"He probably had lots of people in there kicking and splashing,"
00:27:32,00:27:33,because it's very strong currents.
00:27:33,00:27:34,Put a few poos in there.
00:27:34,00:27:35,Put a few poos.
00:27:35,00:27:40,"I'm sure they had, then, 20,000 visitors, Jay."
00:27:40,00:27:41,Some of those tourists are kids.
00:27:41,00:27:42,That's true.
00:27:42,00:27:46,"Skippling often associated with swastikas,"
00:27:47,00:27:52,"because he was very much into them, obviously growing up in India."
00:27:52,00:27:56,"And they were a symbol of peace, et cetera,"
00:27:56,00:28:00,until those dastardly Nazis got in on the act in the '30s.
00:28:00,00:28:06,But there was a guy in 1984 called Tom Driver who ran a bookshop.
00:28:06,00:28:08,"And he wrote to the Kippling Journal,"
00:28:08,00:28:12,"saying that whenever anyone comes into his shop,"
00:28:12,00:28:15,all they ask about is Kippling and the swastikas.
00:28:15,00:28:17,"Because they had lots of old editions,"
00:28:17,00:28:20,"and the old editions of Kippling all had the swastika on them,"
00:28:20,00:28:23,"and then later editions didn't have them anymore, of course."
00:28:23,00:28:25,"And he said, ""We have recently kept a record,"
00:28:25,00:28:29,and we average once a day when a visitor asks us
00:28:29,00:28:31,"some question about Kippling and the swastika."""
00:28:31,00:28:32,That is insane.
00:28:32,00:28:35,"""Usually at the back of it is a thought that Kippling was a Nazi."""
00:28:35,00:28:40,"And he said that they always tell them that this is an old peace sign,"
00:28:40,00:28:41,and that's it.
00:28:41,00:28:44,"And he said, ""Yeah, but that's what basically every single day"
00:28:44,00:28:47,"someone was coming in saying, 'Why are the swastikas on this?'"""
00:28:47,00:28:52,"I've got a couple of pre-1933 Kipplings,"
00:28:52,00:28:53,and they have the swastika on them.
00:28:53,00:28:54,"""Yeah, well, I did my dissertation on Kippling."""
00:28:54,00:28:55,"So, yeah."
00:28:55,00:28:56,"Oh, wow."
00:28:56,00:28:57,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:57,00:28:58,"Oh, you didn't let on."
00:28:58,00:29:00,"That's sort of cheating, isn't it?"
00:29:00,00:29:01,"Sorry, yeah."
00:29:01,00:29:03,Very much cheating in advance in preparation for this podcast.
00:29:03,00:29:07,It didn't take me any time.
00:29:07,00:29:10,"Next week, we'll be doing scanning, tunneling microscopes,"
00:29:10,00:29:12,which was what my dissertation was on.
00:29:12,00:29:14,Good luck.
00:29:14,00:29:23,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:29:23,00:29:27,"My fact is that when McDonald's launched the Filet-O-Fish sandwich,"
00:29:27,00:29:29,"its main competition was the Hula Burger,"
00:29:29,00:29:33,which was a slice of pineapple in a bun with cheese.
00:29:33,00:29:34,Yeah.
00:29:34,00:29:34,Yeah.
00:29:34,00:29:35,It was popular.
00:29:35,00:29:37,It was so unpopular.
00:29:37,00:29:40,"Basically, there was a bit of Cincinnati,"
00:29:40,00:29:42,where 87% of the population were Catholic.
00:29:42,00:29:44,"And as a result, didn't meet meat on Fridays."
00:29:44,00:29:49,"And as a result, the Cincinnati McDonald's took zero money on Fridays,"
00:29:49,00:29:51,because they didn't have any alternatives to their burgers.
00:29:51,00:29:54,"And the owner said, ""Right, I have come up with an idea"
00:29:54,00:29:56,called the Filet-O-Fish sandwich.
00:29:56,00:29:58,It's going to revolutionise the way we trade on Fridays.
00:29:58,00:29:59,"It's going to be great."""
00:29:59,00:30:00,"And he really needed this,"
00:30:00,00:30:01,"because he was a kind of franchise holder,"
00:30:01,00:30:04,so he needed the business to work money.
00:30:04,00:30:07,"And Ray Crock, the founder, said, he said in quotes,"
00:30:07,00:30:09,"""You're always coming up here with a bunch of crap."""
00:30:09,00:30:11,Didn't like the idea for the Filet-O-Fish.
00:30:11,00:30:13,"He said, ""My idea is much better."
00:30:13,00:30:15,The Hula Burger.
00:30:15,00:30:17,"We'll take a slice of pineapple, we'll grill it,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,"put some cheese on it, put it in a bun."""
00:30:19,00:30:22,"Sportingly, Ray Crock didn't just steamroller the owner,"
00:30:22,00:30:23,who was called Lou Grun.
00:30:23,00:30:24,"He said, ""Look, we'll have a competition."
00:30:24,00:30:26,"Good Friday, 1962."
00:30:26,00:30:27,"Demand for meat going to be very, very low,"
00:30:27,00:30:28,because of all the Christians.
00:30:28,00:30:32,"So we will stock both in certain stores on a given day,"
00:30:32,00:30:33,and we will see who wins.
00:30:33,00:30:36,"And the Filet-O-Fish sold 350,"
00:30:36,00:30:37,"and the Hula Burger sold six."""
00:30:37,00:30:41,And so they went with the Filet-O-Fish.
00:30:41,00:30:42,And when did you say this was?
00:30:42,00:30:44,This was '62.
00:30:44,00:30:46,So this was really the heyday of pineapple and cheese
00:30:46,00:30:47,being a fashionable dish.
00:30:47,00:30:48,And even then.
00:30:48,00:30:50,"Yeah, you're right."
00:30:50,00:30:51,"The canapes, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:51,00:30:52,It just didn't work.
00:30:52,00:30:54,You've got to put it on a stick.
00:30:54,00:30:56,"I mean, it sounds good to me."
00:30:56,00:30:57,Does it sound bad to you guys?
00:30:57,00:30:58,I wouldn't mind it.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"It doesn't sound filling, I think."
00:31:00,00:31:03,I think the problem is the slightly grainy texture
00:31:03,00:31:07,of the bread with the smooth texture of the pineapple.
00:31:07,00:31:10,"I'm really, one of my biggest fads is textures."
00:31:10,00:31:11,"I really struggle with certain textures,"
00:31:11,00:31:14,"and I think that would be the main problem, yeah."
00:31:14,00:31:15,Interesting.
00:31:15,00:31:16,"That might be why you hate mushrooms so much,"
00:31:16,00:31:17,because they do have a very distinctive texture.
00:31:17,00:31:20,"That is why meat jelly, stuff like that,"
00:31:20,00:31:21,I can't deal with that.
00:31:21,00:31:24,"Oh, I didn't know that you didn't like meat jelly."
00:31:24,00:31:25,That's pies ruined for you.
00:31:25,00:31:27,It's basically all of Russian cuisine
00:31:27,00:31:28,ruined for me as well.
00:31:28,00:31:30,"It's like, yeah."
00:31:30,00:31:33,"I think jelly should be sweet, personally."
00:31:33,00:31:36,And I think my McDonald's should be savory.
00:31:39,00:31:40,So you're on the filet-of-fish side.
00:31:40,00:31:42,"I think I am, really, yeah."
00:31:42,00:31:44,"Because I think, Dan, even though I agree with you, look,"
00:31:44,00:31:47,"if someone put in front of me pineapple and cheese in a bun,"
00:31:47,00:31:48,I would eat it.
00:31:48,00:31:49,"But if someone gave me the choice,"
00:31:49,00:31:51,I'd definitely go filet-of-fish.
00:31:51,00:31:53,"Would you, do you think you'd choose the pineapple?"
00:31:53,00:31:54,"No, no."
00:31:54,00:31:56,"I'm just saying there's a lot of options on the menu,"
00:31:56,00:32:00,and it doesn't stick out as a weird McDonald's one for me.
00:32:00,00:32:02,It just might not be as popular
00:32:02,00:32:05,"as one of their biggest, most popular burgers."
00:32:05,00:32:08,"Also, Catholics tend to eat fish on Fridays,"
00:32:08,00:32:10,as opposed to eating pineapples on Fridays.
00:32:10,00:32:12,So if it was for the Catholics.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"Yeah, you're right."
00:32:14,00:32:15,I see that now.
00:32:15,00:32:16,Yeah.
00:32:16,00:32:19,"You don't see Jesus having two pineapples and 12 loaves,"
00:32:19,00:32:21,"do you, between the 5,000?"
00:32:21,00:32:26,He would have only fed the 200 if they'd had the choice.
00:32:26,00:32:29,But maybe that was a secret.
00:32:29,00:32:31,Maybe there was another messiah at the stall next to him.
00:32:31,00:32:31,Yeah.
00:32:31,00:32:32,Yeah.
00:32:32,00:32:33,Pineapple tie-up.
00:32:33,00:32:37,"Oh, that's a cut scene from Life of Brian, surely."
00:32:37,00:32:42,"But yeah, pineapples, they were massive, weren't they?"
00:32:42,00:32:45,"Well, they were the same size as they are today,"
00:32:45,00:32:48,"or similar size, but they were really popular."
00:32:48,00:32:51,"And it was because they were so difficult to grow,"
00:32:51,00:32:54,and so they just became really exclusive.
00:32:54,00:32:54,Yeah.
00:32:54,00:32:55,And you couldn't grow them here.
00:32:55,00:32:58,"That was really hard to grow them here, wasn't it?"
00:32:58,00:33:02,So it was a sort of code that you were incredibly wealthy.
00:33:03,00:33:07,And so you can kind of date whole bits of British design
00:33:07,00:33:09,"and architecture to when they were built,"
00:33:09,00:33:11,"because if it's got a pineapple on,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,it's probably from that time in the 18th century
00:33:13,00:33:14,that everyone was obsessed with pineapples.
00:33:14,00:33:16,Gate posts and railings.
00:33:16,00:33:17,Yeah.
00:33:17,00:33:19,"But all of this stuff, by the way,"
00:33:19,00:33:21,"I just want to give a shout-out to Fran Bowman's book,"
00:33:21,00:33:24,"which is called The Pineapple King of Fruits,"
00:33:24,00:33:28,"which is possibly my favorite book on a single,"
00:33:28,00:33:31,"tiny, weird subject that I've ever read in my entire life."
00:33:31,00:33:32,So people should definitely read it.
00:33:33,00:33:36,But she basically says that once you learn
00:33:36,00:33:39,"how amazingly popular pineapples were for this short time,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,"wherever you go, you'll start seeing pineapples,"
00:33:41,00:33:44,"because like Candy says, they're absolutely everywhere."
00:33:44,00:33:44,Yeah.
00:33:44,00:33:45,It's really sad.
00:33:45,00:33:47,"And I can't believe we've never said before,"
00:33:47,00:33:48,but people used to rent them.
00:33:48,00:33:51,"So if you couldn't afford them, which a lot of people couldn't."
00:33:51,00:33:54,"So there was, again, it was a brief time."
00:33:54,00:33:56,I think it was the start of the 18th century.
00:33:56,00:33:59,"They would cost sort of £10,000 in today's money,"
00:33:59,00:34:00,as much as a carriage.
00:34:00,00:34:01,"So you'd rent one for a night,"
00:34:01,00:34:03,"and you'd carry it around like a bag,"
00:34:03,00:34:06,or you'd put it on your table if you're hosting a dinner party.
00:34:06,00:34:09,"And I think it was Fran Bowman who pointed out,"
00:34:09,00:34:11,it was terrifying if you were the servant
00:34:11,00:34:12,"who had to transport the pineapple around,"
00:34:12,00:34:15,because that's the equivalent of carrying a briefcase
00:34:15,00:34:16,stuffed with banknotes.
00:34:16,00:34:17,Yeah.
00:34:17,00:34:20,But who's going to know that you've got a pineapple under your cloak?
00:34:20,00:34:22,"It's not, you wouldn't just randomly mug someone"
00:34:22,00:34:23,in the hope that they'd have a pineapple.
00:34:23,00:34:25,That's jackpot for the mugger.
00:34:25,00:34:29,Didn't the rich used to hire people to sleep with their pineapples?
00:34:29,00:34:31,"Was that a thing, am I making that up?"
00:34:31,00:34:34,"Yeah, they used to protect their pineapples at night."
00:34:34,00:34:38,"Yeah, from any poachers or any animals."
00:34:38,00:34:40,"Yeah, exactly, if you were growing them."
00:34:40,00:34:41,What do you say am I making that up?
00:34:41,00:34:43,Have you read that somewhere?
00:34:43,00:34:45,We don't know if you're making it up.
00:34:45,00:34:48,"Well, I read Fran Bowman's book years and years ago,"
00:34:48,00:34:51,"and it's a memory from that, James, just bringing that up."
00:34:51,00:34:55,I know Charles II used to sleep with a pineapple.
00:34:55,00:34:57,"He'd sleep with anything, though."
00:34:57,00:34:58,He'd sleep with anything.
00:34:58,00:34:59,He'd sleep with a pineapple.
00:34:59,00:35:04,"Yeah, well, you know his mistress, Barbara Villiers."
00:35:04,00:35:06,He called her my sweet pineapple.
00:35:06,00:35:07,"Okay, okay."
00:35:07,00:35:09,"So, yeah, he slept with a pineapple."
00:35:09,00:35:11,"Barbara Villiers, amazing, isn't she?"
00:35:11,00:35:16,"She kind of became the king's favourite mistress,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,"and then after the king died,"
00:35:18,00:35:20,she just went completely off the rails.
00:35:20,00:35:24,"And at one stage, the absolute worst thing that she did"
00:35:24,00:35:27,was biting the penis off a recently exhumed bishop.
00:35:29,00:35:32,"I think as far as going off the rails is concerned,"
00:35:32,00:35:35,"I mean, Pete Dockers, he's got a lot to learn, hasn't he?"
00:35:35,00:35:38,What if he'd run out of pineapple?
00:35:38,00:35:42,"Charles II, he also commissioned a painting of himself"
00:35:42,00:35:44,being given a pineapple by his gardener.
00:35:44,00:35:46,That's how much he loved pineapples.
00:35:46,00:35:48,And it was kind of to prove a point.
00:35:48,00:35:52,"So, he ordered a pineapple because the French ambassador was there,"
00:35:52,00:35:54,"and Barbados was an English colony at the time,"
00:35:54,00:35:58,"and they were arguing over who got to own the nearby island of St Kitt's,"
00:35:58,00:35:59,"and he was basically asserting primacy,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,"because you could grow pineapples in Barbados,"
00:36:01,00:36:04,"and he was saying, ""Look, we can do this with our pineapples here,"
00:36:04,00:36:07,"so it makes sense that we should have this neighbouring bit of land as well."""
00:36:07,00:36:10,And I think that was why he commissioned a painting of himself
00:36:10,00:36:12,just getting a pineapple off his gardener.
00:36:12,00:36:15,"Wow, it was a little bit of an art-pureaus."
00:36:15,00:36:18,I was thinking how awful it must have been
00:36:18,00:36:20,"when the very first king received pineapple,"
00:36:20,00:36:22,that was King Ferdinand.
00:36:22,00:36:25,"So, pineapple was brought to Europe after Columbus's voyages,"
00:36:25,00:36:28,"the late 15th century, and King Ferdinand of Spain"
00:36:28,00:36:29,"was the first person to eat one,"
00:36:29,00:36:32,"and he said the flavour exceeds all other fruit,"
00:36:32,00:36:35,but it was the only one that survived the trip.
00:36:35,00:36:37,"And so, imagine how awful that is."
00:36:37,00:36:39,"You know, when you run out of something delicious,"
00:36:39,00:36:41,"and you have to go back to the shop,"
00:36:41,00:36:43,"it's the most delicious thing you've ever tasted in your life,"
00:36:43,00:36:44,and that's it.
00:36:44,00:36:47,"Because they all, like, he did have loads of them,"
00:36:47,00:36:50,"but they all just ended up squishy and rotten, didn't they?"
00:36:50,00:36:51,"Apart from one of them,"
00:36:51,00:36:54,which makes me think that perhaps the one
00:36:54,00:36:57,probably wasn't in the absolute best condition.
00:36:57,00:36:58,"If all the others have got,"
00:36:58,00:37:01,it's a bit like they're washing on your line going dry.
00:37:01,00:37:02,"If all the others are rotten,"
00:37:02,00:37:04,then that one's probably a bit rotten as well.
00:37:04,00:37:06,"All the others went squidgy,"
00:37:06,00:37:08,but this one happened to go squiggly.
00:37:08,00:37:09,This is weird.
00:37:09,00:37:13,You two are typo.
00:37:13,00:37:14,Have you guys ever been on a cruise?
00:37:14,00:37:15,Yep.
00:37:15,00:37:16,No.
00:37:16,00:37:19,"Okay, so James, you're the only one who's been on a cruise."
00:37:19,00:37:20,"When you were on the cruise,"
00:37:20,00:37:22,did you ever see on anyone else's door
00:37:22,00:37:24,a sticker with a pineapple on it?
00:37:24,00:37:27,"No, I didn't go on a very high-class cruise,"
00:37:27,00:37:28,it has to be said.
00:37:28,00:37:29,"Oh, that's fine,"
00:37:29,00:37:30,because this doesn't apply on high-class cruise.
00:37:30,00:37:31,"Oh, God."
00:37:31,00:37:32,This is the...
00:37:32,00:37:36,There is a myth among the cruising community
00:37:36,00:37:37,"that this indicates,"
00:37:37,00:37:39,"or if someone has a pineapple magnet or whatever,"
00:37:39,00:37:40,"or something like that,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,that they are swingers
00:37:42,00:37:43,and they are interested in having a good time.
00:37:43,00:37:45,Is that right?
00:37:45,00:37:47,"But, well, I don't know."
00:37:47,00:37:48,"Because when I went on the cruise,"
00:37:48,00:37:50,the whole time I was sat on the deck
00:37:50,00:37:52,reading Fran Bowman's book about pineapples.
00:37:52,00:37:54,So God knows what they all thought of me.
00:37:54,00:37:59,"Yeah, the thing is, the system is a poor one,"
00:37:59,00:38:01,"because obviously, I mean, assuming it,"
00:38:01,00:38:02,"this is not complete bollocks,"
00:38:02,00:38:03,which it may well be.
00:38:03,00:38:05,"But you would only see a few doors, don't you?"
00:38:05,00:38:06,"Because you normally, you know,"
00:38:06,00:38:07,"you have your corridor,"
00:38:07,00:38:08,and then you go up to the...
00:38:08,00:38:10,"Yeah, but if you're a swinger,"
00:38:10,00:38:11,you probably check in a few more doors
00:38:11,00:38:13,"than the average person, aren't you?"
00:38:13,00:38:14,That's a good point.
00:38:14,00:38:14,I think so.
00:38:14,00:38:15,Yeah.
00:38:15,00:38:16,You walk up a couple of corridors.
00:38:16,00:38:18,"You don't know who's behind the door, either."
00:38:18,00:38:19,"I mean, the worst thing would be,"
00:38:19,00:38:20,"if you've got the sticker on your door,"
00:38:20,00:38:22,"and someone knocks on the door, you open it,"
00:38:22,00:38:25,"and they say, ""Oh, sorry, I think I've got the wrong."""
00:38:25,00:38:29,"Sorry, nothing, never mind."
00:38:29,00:38:31,You probably dress as like a...
00:38:31,00:38:33,"I was going to say cabin boy,"
00:38:33,00:38:35,but more like a waiter or something.
00:38:35,00:38:36,And so you have that out.
00:38:36,00:38:38,"Like, if they knock on the door,"
00:38:38,00:38:40,"and you don't fancy them, you can say,"
00:38:40,00:38:44,"""Oh, sorry, I just come to collect your room service."""
00:38:44,00:38:44,That's good.
00:38:44,00:38:47,"I think that's the best possible solution,"
00:38:47,00:38:48,but that feels like a long...
00:38:48,00:38:51,"Now, you've got to pack your cabin boy outfit"
00:38:51,00:38:52,when you're going on a cruise.
00:38:52,00:38:56,I just think so many things have to come together
00:38:56,00:38:57,"at once to make this work,"
00:38:57,00:38:59,that I can't believe it's ever happened
00:38:59,00:39:00,in the history of the universe.
00:39:00,00:39:02,"It's like, you have to be..."
00:39:02,00:39:03,There have to be other swingers on the boat.
00:39:03,00:39:05,You have to be on the right corridor.
00:39:05,00:39:07,"You have to know about the pineapple rule,"
00:39:07,00:39:09,and they have to be attractive enough for you to accept.
00:39:09,00:39:11,"If anyone's listening,"
00:39:11,00:39:13,"if you've ever had a successful pineapple-based cruise experience,"
00:39:13,00:39:15,we want to hear about it.
00:39:15,00:39:16,Yeah.
00:39:16,00:39:19,"Hey, I was looking into other ways"
00:39:19,00:39:22,"of presenting pineapple for meals,"
00:39:22,00:39:25,and I came across a dessert I've never heard of before.
00:39:25,00:39:26,Have you guys heard of candle salad?
00:39:26,00:39:28,Have you ever had a candle salad?
00:39:28,00:39:29,"No, I haven't."
00:39:29,00:39:31,"I'm part of the electric generation,"
00:39:31,00:39:33,so I just plug my salad in at the wall.
00:39:33,00:39:38,"So, candle salad, it's a fruit salad,"
00:39:38,00:39:41,"although you do have lettuce in it as well as the base,"
00:39:41,00:39:43,"but the idea is you take a ring of pineapple,"
00:39:44,00:39:49,"and you place through the ring of pineapple at the base a banana,"
00:39:49,00:39:51,"a peeled banana, so it sits up through..."
00:39:51,00:39:54,I can see why the swingers would like this kind of thing.
00:39:54,00:39:57,"It has a red cherry on the top,"
00:39:57,00:39:59,"and then, and by the way,"
00:39:59,00:40:01,this supposedly is for children.
00:40:01,00:40:04,This is a great way to get kids to eat fruit.
00:40:04,00:40:05,It's got this cherry on the top.
00:40:05,00:40:08,"It's a banana sticking up through the pineapple,"
00:40:08,00:40:13,and you use either mayonnaise on it or cottage cheese.
00:40:14,00:40:17,"I swear to God, you do not put mayonnaise on it."
00:40:17,00:40:19,It's always good having you on for a day.
00:40:19,00:40:21,"I swear to God, you put it on,"
00:40:21,00:40:24,and you put it right at the tip of the banana.
00:40:24,00:40:26,What are you talking about?
00:40:26,00:40:28,"It's a kid's food,"
00:40:28,00:40:31,and it looks like probably erect penis.
00:40:31,00:40:34,That's just orgasm.
00:40:34,00:40:35,Stop feeding this to your children.
00:40:35,00:40:36,Yeah.
00:40:36,00:40:39,"Come on, Dan, which soft play area have you been to"
00:40:39,00:40:40,where they give you this halfway through?
00:40:40,00:40:44,Dan is no longer allowed to go to any soft play areas.
00:40:44,00:40:45,Where are you getting it from?
00:40:45,00:40:49,"I never saw this in my childhood, put it this way,"
00:40:49,00:40:50,and I was a Catholic.
00:40:50,00:40:55,"It was big in the 1920s in America,"
00:40:55,00:40:57,"and it still is around,"
00:40:57,00:41:00,"and if you Google it, there's plenty of pictures."
00:41:00,00:41:01,People love popping their pictures up
00:41:01,00:41:04,"to show you how their candle salad looks,"
00:41:04,00:41:08,and it has a full-on Wikipedia article telling about its history.
00:41:08,00:41:10,It's a real thing.
00:41:10,00:41:12,"Everything's got a Wikipedia article, mate."
00:41:12,00:41:13,There's always some nut job out there
00:41:13,00:41:15,willing to find a Wikipedia article.
00:41:15,00:41:18,How do you balance a cherry on a banana?
00:41:18,00:41:21,With clotted cream or whatever it was.
00:41:21,00:41:22,"Yeah, with mayonnaise."
00:41:22,00:41:23,With mayonnaise.
00:41:23,00:41:24,"James, mayonnaise."
00:41:24,00:41:24,Sorry.
00:41:24,00:41:26,That's the implausible bit.
00:41:26,00:41:28,"I was just trying to think of anything, Seemony."
00:41:28,00:41:30,I couldn't remember what it was.
00:41:30,00:41:32,Cottage cheese makes a lot of sense.
00:41:32,00:41:34,Cottage cheese famously goes with pineapple.
00:41:34,00:41:38,"Mayonnaise, like I say, it's top video to your kids."
00:41:38,00:41:45,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:41:45,00:41:47,and that is James.
00:41:47,00:41:48,"Okay, my fact this week"
00:41:48,00:41:52,is that there is a professional footballer called Naughty Naughty.
00:41:52,00:41:54,He has never been sent off.
00:41:54,00:42:00,"I mean, the headline that could have been Naughty Naughty Naughty."
00:42:00,00:42:02,Might still be because he's very young.
00:42:02,00:42:06,"Well, he is young compared to me."
00:42:06,00:42:08,He was born in 1994.
00:42:08,00:42:09,How old does that make?
00:42:09,00:42:10,"Yeah, he's pretty young."
00:42:10,00:42:11,He's young.
00:42:11,00:42:15,"So, basically, this guy,"
00:42:15,00:42:16,I known about him for a little while.
00:42:16,00:42:19,"He was played for Chelsea as a youth player,"
00:42:19,00:42:22,and then he's played for a few non-league teams
00:42:22,00:42:23,like Charlie and Dover.
00:42:23,00:42:27,"But recently he's gone to play for Queen of the South in Scotland,"
00:42:27,00:42:31,and last week he scored against Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
00:42:31,00:42:35,"And I was watching Gillette Soccer Saturday with Jeff Stelling,"
00:42:36,00:42:39,and Jeff Stelling said that this guy called Naughty Naughty
00:42:39,00:42:40,had never been sent off.
00:42:40,00:42:43,"And I checked, and as far as I can see, it's true."
00:42:43,00:42:46,"And, you know, we get a lot of our facts from books"
00:42:46,00:42:48,"or from scientific papers or stuff like this,"
00:42:48,00:42:50,"and I just thought, why can't you get facts"
00:42:50,00:42:52,from Gillette Soccer Saturday on Sky Sports?
00:42:52,00:42:54,Quite right.
00:42:54,00:42:56,"Facts you can find facts anywhere, can't you?"
00:42:56,00:43:00,I've always said there should be an opposite of normative determinism.
00:43:00,00:43:01,"I reckon I've said this in the podcast,"
00:43:01,00:43:03,"and if he's not evidence of that,"
00:43:03,00:43:04,then I don't know what is.
00:43:04,00:43:05,Yeah.
00:43:05,00:43:08,So on football was being sent off.
00:43:08,00:43:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:43:08,00:43:10,So I thought Naughty Naughty never has been.
00:43:10,00:43:12,There have been some wonderful soundings off
00:43:12,00:43:13,in the history of English football.
00:43:13,00:43:13,My God.
00:43:13,00:43:19,"So the earliest ever sending off was a Sunday League match in 2000,"
00:43:19,00:43:22,and it was between Cross Farm Park Celtic
00:43:22,00:43:25,"and Taunton East Reach Wanderers, right?"
00:43:25,00:43:27,"The referee blew his whistle at the start of the match,"
00:43:27,00:43:29,"very close to a player called Lee Todd,"
00:43:29,00:43:31,who was a part-time bricklayer who had his back turned.
00:43:31,00:43:33,"The referee blew his whistle very, very loud."
00:43:33,00:43:36,"Todd exclaimed, ""Fuck me, that was loud."""
00:43:36,00:43:38,The referee stopped the game two seconds in
00:43:38,00:43:40,and sent him off for abusive language.
00:43:40,00:43:43,And it's just a glorious story.
00:43:43,00:43:45,"Like, there are so many crunchy details about it."
00:43:45,00:43:49,"Like, he was also banned for 35 days and fined £27."
00:43:49,00:43:50,Twenty-seven.
00:43:50,00:43:50,Really?
00:43:50,00:43:51,£27.
00:43:51,00:43:53,"But then in the meeting about that,"
00:43:53,00:43:54,"he went, ""Fuck me, that's not very much."""
00:43:54,00:43:57,"Another 35 days, mate."
00:43:57,00:44:01,And he was tracked down 20 years after this match.
00:44:01,00:44:04,"Last year, he was tracked down by the website SportBible,"
00:44:04,00:44:07,and he's still slightly annoyed about it.
00:44:07,00:44:08,"He said, ""Fuck me. I mean, if anything,"
00:44:08,00:44:10,"he was wearing it himself."""
00:44:10,00:44:11,"True. Yeah, yeah."
00:44:11,00:44:14,"Unless it could, like, maybe the referee took it as a request."
00:44:14,00:44:18,He did have a pineapple stick on the back of his shirt.
00:44:18,00:44:22,Do you know what the record for being booked
00:44:22,00:44:23,with a yellow card is?
00:44:23,00:44:24,How quickly that was done.
00:44:24,00:44:29,"It was three seconds, and that was Vinnie Jones,"
00:44:29,00:44:32,"who most people globally will know as an actor,"
00:44:32,00:44:34,but used to be a professional footballer.
00:44:34,00:44:35,"Yeah, he was booked after three seconds,"
00:44:35,00:44:39,and he beat the previous record for a yellow card by two seconds.
00:44:39,00:44:42,"So it was a five-second was the previous record,"
00:44:42,00:44:44,and that was held by Vinnie Jones.
00:44:44,00:44:46,They smashed his own record.
00:44:46,00:44:49,"Yeah, the red card was invented by referee Ken Aston"
00:44:49,00:44:52,after the 1966 World Cup.
00:44:52,00:44:53,"You could be sent off before then,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,"but they didn't have card system,"
00:44:55,00:44:57,"because what happened was,"
00:44:57,00:45:00,"in the quarter-final of the World Cup,"
00:45:00,00:45:02,"which was between England and, I think, Argentina,"
00:45:02,00:45:05,it said in the newspapers the next day
00:45:05,00:45:08,"that both of the Charlton brothers had been booked,"
00:45:08,00:45:10,but they didn't remember it happening.
00:45:10,00:45:14,"And so England went to FIFA and said,"
00:45:14,00:45:16,"""It says in the newspapers that we've been booked,"
00:45:16,00:45:17,"but we have no idea what happened."""
00:45:17,00:45:20,And it turned out they had been and they hadn't noticed.
00:45:20,00:45:23,"But then Ken Aston, having seen this happen,"
00:45:23,00:45:26,"thought, ""Well, we need a more obvious symbol"
00:45:26,00:45:27,"of someone being sent off."""
00:45:27,00:45:30,"And apparently he was driving down Kensington High Street,"
00:45:30,00:45:32,"and he saw a traffic light,"
00:45:32,00:45:34,"and the yellow, he thought, meant, ""Take it easy,"
00:45:34,00:45:36,"and the red is to stop."""
00:45:36,00:45:37,"And so he thought, ""Well, that's a good idea."
00:45:37,00:45:39,"Let's have yellow and red cards."""
00:45:39,00:45:41,"So I guess the traffic lights aren't yellow,"
00:45:41,00:45:42,"they're amber, are they?"
00:45:42,00:45:44,"So they should be amber and red cards, maybe."
00:45:44,00:45:48,"But it's literally a light bulb moment,"
00:45:48,00:45:49,because what do you have in traffic lights?
00:45:49,00:45:50,You have light bulbs.
00:45:50,00:45:51,It's light bulbs.
00:45:51,00:45:55,"But it's also an extremely obvious theft to us now,"
00:45:55,00:45:58,"as in it's so obvious that, I don't know."
00:45:58,00:46:02,What do you mean to get red and yellow and green?
00:46:02,00:46:03,"Well, I heard about that, Ken Aston."
00:46:03,00:46:05,"You should be given, everyone should be given"
00:46:05,00:46:06,a green card at the start of the match.
00:46:06,00:46:08,That would be a really nice card.
00:46:08,00:46:08,Put them into America.
00:46:08,00:46:13,That was before the 1994 World Cup in America.
00:46:13,00:46:14,They all had to have a green card.
00:46:14,00:46:19,"In the match with the most ever red cards given,"
00:46:19,00:46:20,only one person was sent off.
00:46:20,00:46:22,"Oh, really? Why?"
00:46:22,00:46:23,Riddle me.
00:46:23,00:46:26,That? This was quite…
00:46:26,00:46:28,"And it's a good corner, his opening business."
00:46:28,00:46:33,"It was Valentine's Day, and they all got a load of red cards,"
00:46:33,00:46:35,"which said, ""Happy Valentine's Day"" on them."
00:46:35,00:46:38,"That's such a good answer, James."
00:46:38,00:46:39,"And I'm going to give you a bonus point for that,"
00:46:39,00:46:40,but it's not correct.
00:46:40,00:46:44,"36 people got red cards, but it was in 2011."
00:46:44,00:46:46,And it's vaguely famous.
00:46:46,00:46:48,The referee was this guy called Damian Rubino.
00:46:48,00:46:51,"And one player was sent off in the first half,"
00:46:51,00:46:52,because he just got two yellows.
00:46:52,00:46:56,And he returned in the second half to stand in the crowd
00:46:56,00:46:58,in his home clothes and cheer the teams on.
00:46:58,00:47:00,"And then at the end of the match,"
00:47:00,00:47:02,"this guy had been sent off in the first half,"
00:47:02,00:47:03,"came onto the pitch,"
00:47:03,00:47:06,and just punched one of the opposition players in the face
00:47:06,00:47:08,for reasons unknown to anyone.
00:47:08,00:47:09,But there's a huge brawl start.
00:47:09,00:47:10,So everyone chased him.
00:47:10,00:47:12,He fled to the locker room.
00:47:12,00:47:14,Everyone's favourite place to be.
00:47:14,00:47:16,"And then there was a big fight in there,"
00:47:16,00:47:18,"and then they came back out into the pitch, big fight there."
00:47:18,00:47:21,"And eventually the referees gave red cards to everyone on both teams,"
00:47:21,00:47:25,"plus all subs, plus a coach or two as well."
00:47:25,00:47:27,"But he was into, he's been interviewed this ref,"
00:47:27,00:47:30,"and he was like, ""I've got no idea why this guy"
00:47:30,00:47:34,"just jumped out of the stands when he punched someone in the face."""
00:47:34,00:47:37,"And years later, he bumped into him at another match."
00:47:37,00:47:40,"And the guy said, ""Sorry about that incident."
00:47:40,00:47:42,"We actually had some personal beef off the pitch."""
00:47:42,00:47:46,"I don't know what to talk about, but yeah."
00:47:46,00:47:48,We never know what it was.
00:47:48,00:47:50,We'll never know.
00:47:50,00:47:51,We can only speculate.
00:47:51,00:47:54,Yeah. A woman has got to be about a four.
00:47:54,00:47:59,The first woman to ever be sent off an official football match
00:47:59,00:48:00,for fighting was called Lily Parr.
00:48:00,00:48:02,She is very famous.
00:48:02,00:48:06,"She played for the Dick Kerr ladies,"
00:48:06,00:48:08,"who are some factory workers from Preston,"
00:48:08,00:48:09,"who we might have mentioned before, actually."
00:48:09,00:48:10,"Yeah, we must have."
00:48:10,00:48:13,Probably the most successful women's team of all time.
00:48:13,00:48:16,"Anyway, she had a shot that was so hard,"
00:48:16,00:48:19,she once broke the arm of a professional male goalkeeper.
00:48:19,00:48:22,That's how good she was.
00:48:22,00:48:25,"She scored more than a thousand goals during her career,"
00:48:25,00:48:28,"more than a thousand goals, 34 of which were in her first season"
00:48:28,00:48:30,when she was only 14 years old.
00:48:30,00:48:32,"Oh, wow."
00:48:32,00:48:33,How good does she sound?
00:48:33,00:48:34,What a prodigy.
00:48:34,00:48:36,They did used to play with bowling balls back then.
00:48:36,00:48:39,So much easier to break an arm.
00:48:39,00:48:41,Is Nanny a famous player?
00:48:41,00:48:42,Yeah. Yeah.
00:48:42,00:48:43,Played for United.
00:48:43,00:48:45,"Luis de Cunha is his name,"
00:48:45,00:48:47,"and Nanny's name is Played for United, as James says."
00:48:47,00:48:51,"In 2013, he was sent off in a match against Real Madrid,"
00:48:51,00:48:55,"and watching at home, one of the United fans was so outraged"
00:48:55,00:48:57,and enraged by this that he phoned the police.
00:48:57,00:48:58,He called 999.
00:48:58,00:49:05,"And he was the young lad, I think he called."
00:49:05,00:49:07,He was just so angry about this setting off.
00:49:07,00:49:08,He thought a crime has been committed.
00:49:08,00:49:11,"And then the police turned up and the car was going,"
00:49:11,00:49:12,"""Nanny, Nanny, Nanny."""
00:49:12,00:49:17,"If he didn't get a red for time wasting, then that's…"
00:49:17,00:49:18,He apologized later on.
00:49:18,00:49:22,He said it was bad judgment to phoned the old bill.
00:49:22,00:49:28,"I found a naughty manager, naughty football manager."
00:49:28,00:49:31,"Someone very famous, Jose Mourinho."
00:49:31,00:49:35,"So Jose Mourinho was given a two-match band once,"
00:49:35,00:49:39,and he found that horrible because he wasn't able to consult
00:49:39,00:49:42,with his team in the locker rooms.
00:49:42,00:49:46,"So he snuck in, and he managed to give his team a big talk."
00:49:46,00:49:49,"But then the problem was he got in there early, so he wasn't seen."
00:49:49,00:49:52,"But by the time he'd finished with his team,"
00:49:52,00:49:54,"the whole place was crowded with UEFA people,"
00:49:54,00:49:56,and he needed to somehow get out.
00:49:56,00:50:01,"So they popped a kit man, popped Jose Mourinho in a laundry basket."
00:50:01,00:50:03,No.
00:50:03,00:50:05,And wheeled him out.
00:50:05,00:50:09,So he left the lid bit of it open so that he was fine.
00:50:09,00:50:10,He could breathe.
00:50:10,00:50:12,"But suddenly, when they were in the corridors,"
00:50:12,00:50:15,"they could hear UEFA people, and he got really nervous."
00:50:15,00:50:16,The kit guy got really nervous.
00:50:16,00:50:19,So he slammed the lid down on top of the laundry basket.
00:50:19,00:50:23,"Problem is, Mourinho is claustrophobic and freaked out inside."
00:50:23,00:50:27,"And he thought he was dying, and he was just thrashing about."
00:50:27,00:50:30,"And eventually, when they got out, they opened it,"
00:50:30,00:50:33,"and he was like, and came out, and it was a big scene for him."
00:50:33,00:50:34,Yeah.
00:50:34,00:50:38,The problem was he ended up on the Isle of Wight in Queen Victoria.
00:50:38,00:50:39,"Well, who the hell are you?"
00:50:39,00:50:43,Such a good story.
00:50:44,00:50:47,Wow. Did you also have that as research for the laundry section?
00:50:47,00:50:48,I did. Yeah.
00:50:48,00:50:49,Yeah.
00:50:49,00:50:50,Yeah. You've got to double that up.
00:50:50,00:50:53,"James and Anna, I think it's fair to say that you're the two"
00:50:53,00:50:56,of this podcasting team who are more interested in football.
00:50:56,00:50:58,Yeah.
00:50:58,00:50:59,If we're ranking.
00:50:59,00:51:01,"Well, Anna's a Newcastle fan, but you know, not far."
00:51:01,00:51:03,Yeah. You can't really call it football now.
00:51:03,00:51:04,That kind of bit.
00:51:04,00:51:07,That's from a tram there found over there.
00:51:07,00:51:09,"OK. Well, I'm going to look up all these references later."
00:51:09,00:51:09,So thanks for those.
00:51:09,00:51:14,But are you guys familiar with the idea that it's harder
00:51:14,00:51:16,to play against 10 men than 11?
00:51:16,00:51:18,Is this the thing that people say?
00:51:18,00:51:21,People say it. Usually you're expected to win against 10 men
00:51:21,00:51:24,"because they have one fewer player, but a lot of teams do struggle."
00:51:24,00:51:25,Interesting.
00:51:25,00:51:25,OK.
00:51:25,00:51:27,I've never run. Is it the psychology of it?
00:51:27,00:51:31,"Well, it's either that or this is just from what I've read."
00:51:31,00:51:33,"It's that a team with 10 players retreats,"
00:51:33,00:51:35,and so they're going to be guarding the ball very carefully and all of this.
00:51:35,00:51:38,"But anyway, it's been studied and it's absolutely nonsense."
00:51:38,00:51:42,It's much easier to win more points and more goals against 10 men
00:51:42,00:51:43,than it is against 11.
00:51:43,00:51:45,The stats. That's what the stats say.
00:51:45,00:51:46,Thanks for the sense.
00:51:46,00:51:46,Yeah.
00:51:46,00:51:48,It's pretty hard to play against 15 men.
00:51:48,00:51:54,This was a problem that Arsenal had in a game against Dynamo Moscow in 1945.
00:51:54,00:51:57,"It was a friendly game, so not too bad."
00:51:57,00:51:59,But it was played in extremely heavy fog
00:51:59,00:52:02,so that no one could really see what was happening on the pitch.
00:52:02,00:52:07,"And at one stage, the Moscow Dynamo played made a substitution,"
00:52:07,00:52:08,but they didn't take a player off.
00:52:08,00:52:11,"They just brought someone on, but no one noticed."
00:52:12,00:52:15,"The fans who are watching reckon that one stage,"
00:52:15,00:52:17,they had 15 players on the pitch at one stage.
00:52:17,00:52:20,"Arsenal had a player set off,"
00:52:20,00:52:24,and the player snuck back onto the pitch for the rest of the game.
00:52:24,00:52:28,"And in the end, Arsenal lost 4-3."
00:52:28,00:52:33,"But probably one of the reasons was because their goalkeeper knocked himself out,"
00:52:33,00:52:35,"accidentally running into a goal post,"
00:52:35,00:52:37,which he couldn't see because of the fog.
00:52:40,00:52:42,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts."
