00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,800
 you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,000
 Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around our

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,360
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order,

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,440
 here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Anna. My fact this week is that 19 states

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:53,520
 in the USA have banned the banning of clotheslines. It's a double ban. Does that mean clotheslines

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,560
 as in things you put clothes on or is this like a wrestling term where you kind of almost

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,480
 decapitate someone? Surely the wrestling move is covered by other legislation.

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,760
 In wrestling are you allowed to strangle people with a clothesline?

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,840
 No, well yeah, you are. You are. I mean, you know, that's modern wrestling.

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,120
 It's a metaphorical clothesline that I'm talking about. It's a forearm, yeah. You open up your arm,

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,520
 you run towards them and you hit them across the neck with your arm and that's the clothesline.

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,520
 It's like, it's a type of tackle in American football, I think, and then they turn it into

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,360
 a wrestling move. Interesting. See, I knew about the, you know, sometimes someone will

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,920
 turn up with a steel chair or hit someone else with a table, but I didn't know there was a laundry

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,520
 rack or a laundry line that could also be drafted into service in wrestling matches,

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,280
 if this makes more sense. Yeah, me neither. All my research on clotheslines did not come

19
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,840
 across the wrestling move. Stuck to clotheslines themselves and they're quite controversial,

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,240
 turns out. So a lot of rental associations, housing associations ban them because they're

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,040
 sort of unsightly. They've got a bad image. They sort of were historically associated with

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,760
 poverty in the fifties when people were getting electronic washing machines and dryers. So it

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,920
 was like, if you hung your clothes out, it showed you're not in a posh neighborhood.

24
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,720
 And so lots of housing associations say, don't do it. But of course, with the environmental

25
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,840
 movement, everyone's gone, what are you talking about? It's much better to hang your clothes out

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,920
 on a clothesline. And so about 2012, there was this big movement, and a bunch of states, Arizona,

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,360
 Maryland, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, et cetera, said you're not allowed to ban them anymore.

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,840
 It is weird when you think about it, though, it's the only thing that's really intimate to us that

29
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,080
 we just take out of the house to show everyone. You know, we're not showing it to them on purpose,

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,400
 but I don't hang my books outside or the contents of my fridge for people to see what my diet's like.

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,120
 Yeah, but you've got to stop washing your books. It's just odd, you know, we hang underwear outside.

32
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,920
 I get it. I get the banning of it. Yeah, but then after Second World War, when they were trying

33
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,920
 to get more women in the workplace, it was kind of a new form of modern living where, you know,

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,320
 everything was done by machines and stuff like this, especially in America. And so,

35
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,600
 and also they wanted to sell electricity. So they kind of thought that really it's almost a

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,240
 patriotic duty to have a machine doing all your washing rather than your wife doing all your

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,680
 washing in America. And if you had it hanging outside, it was like a symbol that you were

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,440
 part of the old times. When people used to do that, you weren't part of the new times,

39
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,600
 but it's slightly different in the UK because less than half of people in the UK have a tumble

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,120
 dryer, whereas in America, it's like, I don't know, like 80% or something like that. Yeah, it's huge.

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,760
 I was a money-saving expert in the UK and maybe this was you, Dan. There was someone who said,

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,440
 "I've just moved to a new place and I'm the only person who hangs my laundry on the balcony."

43
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,720
 Is it okay? And the first response was, "Not acceptable at all. Who wants to see your

44
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,800
 shabby clothes hanging out on the balcony? Do you think the architect envisions that?

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,560
 Clothes on balconies are the same as broken cars in front gardens. Have some pride in where you live.

46
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,680
 I really like that. So this gets called the right to dry, which is a catchy phrase,

47
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,320
 but like Anna says, most, lots of states, nearly half of them are banned it, but Utah hasn't. Utah

48
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,320
 has passed laws which allow local authorities to forbid people from banning clothes lines,

49
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,160
 but they have not passed a law themselves. So they have legalized the banning of the ban,

50
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,640
 but they have not just banned banning directly. So abused. Sorry, they've legalized the banning

51
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,280
 of the ban. They've said it's okay to ban people from banning them. They've passed laws saying,

52
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,800
 "Local authorities in Utah can ban bans, but they haven't stepped in themselves and banned bans

53
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,200
 directly." It feels like you can remove at least two of the bans from that sentence. I'm not sure.

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,240
 I've tried. It doesn't work. It's exactly as I said. Oh, yeah.

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,480
 Do you know the most powerful room in America is a laundry room?

56
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,160
 The White House. Yeah.

57
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,920
 Yeah. Well, it used to be. It used to be a laundry room. So Franklin Roosevelt actually moved the

58
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,040
 Oval Office from where it used to be. It used to be located in the center of the White House,

59
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,360
 and then you prefer to have it put more by windows, and there was an obvious room for it to go to,

60
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,960
 and that's the room where they used to hang all of the laundry in and dry it up there.

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,320
 He had that removed, and then the Oval Office was placed there.

62
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,240
 Oh, it doesn't smell nearly as nice now, presumably. That would have been what attracted him to the

63
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,120
 room. Very disappointing when they took the clean laundry out.

64
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,400
 When you see that center shot of a president behind the desk, they have to crop it because

65
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,720
 just next to him, there's a clothes horse. It's just packed with everyone's washing.

66
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,000
 Clothes house. Do you guys call it a clothes house? That kind of thing. What do you call it,

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,280
 Andy? I just like a laundry rack. Laundry rack. Hannah, what do you call them?

68
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,080
 Clothes ass. Mine's a bit smaller than your average ones.

69
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,600
 Because I call them clothes maiden, and I was googling this because I wanted to know where

70
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,800
 the word came from, and then from my Google, it seemed to imply that this is not what anyone

71
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,360
 else calls it. I've never heard of clothes maiden. Definitely the sexiest version.

72
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,760
 Well, it's so strange. It's like, you know, when you have these words that you think are so common

73
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,400
 and everyone uses them, and then you say them, and then everyone's like, what on earth are you

74
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,200
 talking about? Well, this is it. But maiden is like what people in Lancashire would call,

75
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,600
 I think, what Dan called a clothes horse, and Andy called a clothes rack, and we gloss over

76
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,120
 what Anna called it. And I think, I can't find out why they're called maidens, but I reckon

77
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,680
 it's because in a spinning machine, you would have two bits of wood that held the kind of spool,

78
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,920
 and they were called a maiden, or they were called maidens, and they would stick upwards,

79
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,680
 and then they would have a bar coming across them, and then you would hang things on there.

80
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,520
 And I reckon that that's why they call it, because obviously Lancashire was like a spinning area.

81
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,280
 Oh, that's cool. It wasn't the case that historically unmarried women used to stand

82
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,120
 with their arms outstretched for hours on end with clothes draped over them.

83
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,720
 It was a simpler time and a happier time. Do you know why laundry smells nice?

84
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
 Specifically air-dried, because you put soap in your clothes.

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,800
 The soap helps, definitely. But that's specifically, I think, the difference between air-dried,

86
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,040
 line-dried towels supposedly smell nicer than machine-dried towels or whatever.

87
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,680
 And scientists last year published a paper examining at the molecular level why these

88
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,880
 smells so damn good. And they got a load of samples, and they used ultrapurified water,

89
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,280
 and then they hung the things out to dry, and then they sealed them in a bag for 15 hours

90
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,520
 once they were dry, and then sampled the air that was being given off by these things,

91
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,240
 and compared the chemical profiles and la, la, la. And after things have been out in the sun,

92
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,120
 they emit specific organic molecules. And one of them is called octanal, and one of them is called,

93
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,160
 I think it's pronounced non-anal, non-anal, but it's not non-anal. And non-anal smells of roses,

94
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,920
 apparently. And it's possible that exposure to ozone outdoors transforms these chemicals

95
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,680
 and makes them smell lovely. Non-anal smells of roses. Do you think, if it was cold,

96
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,320
 anything other than non-anal, it would still smell as sweet?

97
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,560
 I understand that reference. Thank you.

98
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,720
 It's from Anna Corellina.

99
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,440
 It's the final line of Anna Corellina. You know, you were saying, James, that it was the

100
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,080
 electricity movement, this push for electricity that meant people weren't supposed to hang their

101
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,920
 clothes out anymore. Do you know who the face of electricity was in the 1950s?

102
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:44,160
 Not Edison. He was dead long ago. 50s, yeah. Yeah, his face looked awful by that point.

103
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,560
 Is it like a John Wayne? Is it like a famous person? Yes, actually, you're really close with

104
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,320
 John Wayne. Think of the budget version of John Wayne. Oh, I know, Reagan. Yeah, it was Reagan.

105
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,120
 Very strong. Oh, how sad that I said budget version of John Wayne, and you did get Reagan from that.

106
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,240
 So he must have loved the Oval Office. He would have felt right at home in there.

107
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,520
 Maybe that's why he went for president. Although, actually, no, he wouldn't have liked it,

108
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,280
 because he was all about anti-clothesline. So he was the face of the live better

109
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,760
 electrically campaign. And there are great adverts you can watch online, which show him

110
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,080
 with his wife and his child sitting around a table and his wife just talking about

111
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,680
 how great it is that she doesn't have to slave over various things anymore,

112
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,480
 because she now has an electric souffle maker, an electric coffee percolator,

113
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,000
 an electric combined toaster and grill, a lot of stuff that we do not have anymore

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,400
 as standard in our homes. So cool. You know what I would have done if I was the advertising

115
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,840
 executive for that? I would have had him with a weapon, which fired bolts of electricity that

116
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,880
 turned things electric. So they'd be like an old kettle, and he'd get his weapon and fire some

117
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,040
 electricity at it, and it would turn into an electric kettle. And he would be called Ronald

118
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:05,280
 Reagan. That is good. There's a career in marketing and advertising opening out before us,

119
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,360
 and I like to see it. It's hard to see you go, but you're going on.

120
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,720
 Can imagine you guys sending me off a one-way ticket to Saatchi and Saatchi,

121
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,640
 and then me arriving at the front door and them going, "Sorry, we don't know what you're on about."

122
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,840
 We've just given you a big piece of slate with Ronald Reagan written on the front of it.

123
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:32,160
 Speaking of electric and laundry, you can now get a smart clothes peg,

124
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,960
 which is pretty exciting. Oh, that is exciting. Yeah.

125
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,480
 What's it do? It detects UV light and humidity and temperature,

126
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,960
 and then it tells you when it's going to rain. And it also takes you-

127
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,600
 Is it just one, or do you need to put it on each of your different-

128
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,200
 I can't imagine that you'd need to buy 100. 40 pegs yelling at you, "Ah, it's going to rain!"

129
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,440
 I don't think, yeah, because it texts you when the clothes are dry. So if you've got 150 of these,

130
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,080
 I think you get 150 texts saying it clothes the dry. Yeah, because if one of your clothes is dry,

131
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,960
 there's a decent chance the rest of them are at least nearly dry.

132
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,040
 Exactly. Unless your garden is so big or your laundry is so extensive.

133
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,120
 That's really cool. I wonder if hackers could get into those smart,

134
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,160
 because usually when you have a smart thing, the hackers can get into it.

135
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,800
 Well, and find out what kind of nickers you wear.

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,120
 Wear, you know, the internet. That's the kind of thing the internet's into, isn't it?

137
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,560
 I've read. Are you all right?

138
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,040
 But I think some clothes do take much longer to dry than others,

139
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,000
 so I think you would need one for each item. Oh, gosh, Hannah.

140
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,920
 Surely you just put the smart peg on the thing that takes longest to dry.

141
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,640
 Oh, God, I've wasted so much money on a thousand smart things.

142
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,720
 Do you, when you're doing the laundry and you put stuff outside,

143
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,640
 you just go out and you take one thing. Oh, this is dry. I'll take this then.

144
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,400
 Every five minutes. I'm not going to the garden.

145
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,120
 You know, washing detergent can be quite dangerous in war.

146
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,240
 So the army actually has a list of banned detergents that they're not allowed to use,

147
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,800
 because they contain optical brightness. So imagine you wash, you was saying,

148
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,080
 but if you use Dazz and your clothes are white or the white, you're going to be spotted in.

149
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:12,720
 No, this is, this is all to do with sort of, you know, infrared and so on.

150
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,600
 You know, if you have optical brightness in it, it'll go slightly fluorescent,

151
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,680
 your clothing, and that can be picked up by night vision goggles and so on.

152
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,760
 So they have a very strict list of what you're allowed to wash your clothes in.

153
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,280
 Wow. So funny.

154
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,600
 But that is another idea for James to take to Sachi and Sachi, I think, for the next Dazz ad.

155
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,520
 I think so bright that you will die in all situations.

156
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,480
 Oh, yeah. So the ad is just one, there's like 50 of them,

157
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,480
 and they all get gunned down except for the one guy who then holds up a Dazz box.

158
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,080
 It says, don't get shot.

159
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
 He's the one who does get shot.

160
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,200
 Oh, the Dazz guy is dead.

161
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
 Dazz man's dead.

162
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,840
 What you actually need is loads of, like people in a battle, loads of different sides,

163
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,520
 and then they all want to give up. And so they all get a white flag,

164
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,960
 but nine of them are really dirty white flags because they don't use Dazz,

165
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,320
 but then one person has used Dazz and they have a really shiny white flag,

166
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,520
 and they're the ones that survive.

167
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,880
 That is good.

168
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,720
 Is the white flag means I surrender?

169
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,360
 I surrender.

170
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,000
 Is a dirty flag mean fuck you? What are you going to do?

171
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,160
 What are you going to do?

172
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,280
 Clear signal.

173
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,920
 I don't deserve clemency because I have no hygiene.

174
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,240
 I've used this flag so many times, it's dirty.

175
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:33,440
 I don't think Dazz have advertised on British TV for some years now,

176
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,560
 but if they've been saving up in their war chest for the next big campaign, this is it.

177
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
 This is the thing.

178
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,320
 I can't believe this fact that I'm about to say,

179
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,680
 but Queen Victoria had a special train for her laundry.

180
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,880
 So there used to be a royal laundry in Richmond in London,

181
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,800
 or did one and a half tons of laundry a day, so not all hers.

182
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,160
 It was, you know, Paris.

183
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,160
 She was large by the end of her life though.

184
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,000
 It's true, but she wore a lot of layers.

185
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,640
 Yeah.

186
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,360
 But basically wherever she was, apart from if she was in Scotland,

187
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,080
 which would have been insane for the laundry to come down from there.

188
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,760
 But even if she was on the Isle of Wight, or if she was at Windsor,

189
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,560
 or her London Palace, Buckingham Palace, I guess,

190
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,920
 the railway handed over all these items.

191
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,320
 And I've seen sources saying, and this is the thing I really can't believe,

192
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,560
 that it was a special miniature train, which took her laundry.

193
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,560
 She would have had to build a special railway line,

194
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,000
 like a special narrow gauge railway line for a miniature train with her pants.

195
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,760
 And I cannot believe that.

196
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,680
 She should have just got a washing machine in both of her palaces.

197
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,480
 She wouldn't have to keep shipping it back.

198
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,520
 All right, Ronald Reagan.

199
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,160
 There was, speaking of railways,

200
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,920
 we as a group have discussed the Underground Railroad before a few times,

201
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,680
 but it's never been on this, I don't think.

202
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,440
 And that was the idea that you would take enslaved people from the South America,

203
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,960
 and you would sneak them out of places where slavery was legal,

204
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,120
 and you would get them to places where they were safe.

205
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,160
 And there is a theory, or there's a story that you'll see a lot online,

206
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,240
 that people got messages through quilts on the Underground Railroad.

207
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,360
 And that is that you would put quilts on washing lines all the way along,

208
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,240
 and then you would see it.

209
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,920
 And if it had like a zigzag pattern,

210
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,760
 you'd know that this was a safe way to go.

211
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,280
 And if it had like a striped pattern,

212
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,920
 it'd be like, we'll turn left here and stuff like that.

213
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,480
 And this story is all over the internet,

214
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,720
 but according to National Geographic,

215
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,000
 quilt historians and Underground Railroad experts

216
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,080
 have questioned the study's methodology of the original study.

217
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,360
 And apparently it was invented by a woman called Azala McDaniel-Williams,

218
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,280
 who was a quilt salesperson in the 1990s,

219
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,040
 and wrote a book about quilts.

220
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,120
 And she came up with this idea that this happened in the Underground Railroad.

221
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,360
 And it's not, it does make sense that you can send,

222
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,400
 there are examples of people sending messages using washing lines

223
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,960
 that happen in the American Civil War, I think.

224
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,080
 But this particular thing, I think, possibly not true.

225
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,800
 That's a shame.

226
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,600
 It's a bit, it's a, it's someone trying to

227
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,680
 make the quilt a bigger part of world history.

228
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,320
 I think so.

229
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,240
 It's probably against inequality than it really is.

230
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,320
 It's a bit like, what was that mosquito expert that then had wine something?

231
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
 Timothy C. Weingard.

232
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,680
 Yeah, she is like the Timothy C. Weingard of quilts.

233
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,200
 Oh, I love that man.

234
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,720
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

235
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,920
 And that is my fact.

236
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,800
 My fact this week is that Canadian engineers are part of a secret order

237
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
 designed by Rudyard Kipling.

238
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:55,680
 This is, this is called the ritual of the calling of an engineer.

239
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,320
 And it is a secret ritual that most, not all, but most are asked to take part in

240
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,120
 once they're sort of graduating to be officially a professional engineer.

241
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,760
 And this little ritual started in the early 1900s.

242
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,040
 And the people who set it up wanted a really good thing to read out at the ceremony.

243
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,560
 And they couldn't do it on their own.

244
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,200
 So in 1922, they approached Rudyard Kipling,

245
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,640
 author of the Jungle Book, and they asked him to write this thing.

246
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
 And it's still going on to this day.

247
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,080
 You can still see, and this is how you know if a Canadian engineer is part of this secret order,

248
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,600
 look at the pinky finger.

249
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,520
 And if there's an iron ring on it, they are part of this secret sect.

250
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,440
 And there's not too much that we know about it, by the way.

251
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,520
 It is genuinely, they have the ceremony.

252
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,720
 No friends are allowed to come.

253
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,000
 No partners are allowed to come.

254
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,600
 And only a few people have spoken about it publicly

255
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,080
 telling us what goes on at these ceremonies.

256
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,360
 And it all sounds really tame, not dark at all, like really boring.

257
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,040
 I don't know why they don't just tell us about it.

258
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,360
 Maybe, Dan, the people who came out, like the one or two people who've told you about it and said,

259
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,040
 "Oh, yeah, it's really tame."

260
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,960
 I mean, that's what they want you to think, isn't it?

261
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,600
 Exactly.

262
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,000
 Yeah.

263
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,800
 Very true.

264
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,600
 Very true.

265
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,120
 There's a very dangerous cabal going on in Canada.

266
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,920
 We need to break it open.

267
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,000
 It's amazing that they just got the most famous writer in the world at the time,

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 as he was, to do this for them.

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,120
 They're so powerful, aren't they, these Canadian engineers.

270
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,720
 It's like, not surprising.

271
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,000
 They probably could have got anyone.

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,720
 Really?

273
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,080
 Yeah, you're right.

274
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,840
 My very good friend is an engineer and she worked in Canada for a year last year, a year before last.

275
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,920
 And so I messaged her about this and she finds it pretty gross.

276
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,880
 So she's like, it's kind of disgusting because you go into the office

277
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,600
 and everyone else has this weird ring on their pinky.

278
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,480
 And she also seemed to have an issue with the fact that

279
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,360
 kind of anyone can get it according to her.

280
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,320
 So you don't actually have to be chartered.

281
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,560
 You only have to have graduated from university.

282
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,760
 In the UK, you don't get anything to your chartered, much longer process.

283
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,560
 And then you get an A3 certificate, not the same.

284
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,000
 So it's kind of like piece of piss.

285
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,080
 She was like, any engineers can get it, by the way,

286
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
 even the ones who design air conditioning units.

287
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,840
 Well, Anna, it sounds like your friend is simultaneously very angry this exists

288
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,760
 and very angry she's not part of the club.

289
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,800
 So she has a certificate.

290
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,080
 I don't know what else she needs.

291
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,880
 But yeah, as you say, Andy, he was a really popular writer in that time.

292
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,760
 So it is bizarre that he was writing for them.

293
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,640
 Yeah.

294
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,520
 I think I had someone said, I think he was probably the richest

295
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,240
 classic author that Britain's ever had.

296
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,520
 He was so bloody successful.

297
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,800
 He bought himself a mansion with his proceeds.

298
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,600
 There was one single story which ended up earning 31.5 million pounds.

299
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,080
 No, hang on.

300
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,800
 Wow. Rich and Asma, eat your heart out.

301
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,400
 That is.

302
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,760
 And that's a short story.

303
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,880
 That's what he wrote in those days.

304
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,400
 That can't be in the money of the time,

305
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,880
 because you would have been able to buy the entire country with that.

306
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,320
 Sorry, it's the equivalent of 31.5 million, 250,000 pounds.

307
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,600
 Which story?

308
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,120
 Well, it's a slight sheet.

309
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,640
 It's called The Absent-Minded Beggar.

310
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,720
 And it was the Daily Mail was running a charity fundraising thing

311
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,280
 as part of an appeal to give money to soldiers in the ball.

312
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,520
 And this is 1899.

313
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,960
 And Kipling wrote this poem, sent it to them and said,

314
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,920
 "Use this as you see fit to raise as much money as you can."

315
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,680
 And so they did.

316
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,720
 And all the proceeds that were raised from it went to the war effort.

317
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,160
 But it really took off.

318
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,200
 It was a sensation.

319
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,960
 So it was a music hall.

320
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,720
 Anthem, Arthur Sullivan of Gilbert and Sullivan put music to it.

321
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,960
 And people bloody loved it.

322
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,360
 Cool.

323
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,080
 Yeah.

324
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,760
 He did a lot of that kind of writing with a slight element

325
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,920
 of influencing public opinion behind it.

326
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,120
 As in he was a campaigner.

327
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,640
 He seemed to dislike a lot of things and a lot of people.

328
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:53,600
 So he is viewed variously as either a really, these days,

329
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,600
 extremely old fashioned, jingoistic, imperialist, colonialist, racist,

330
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,640
 lots and lots of heavy criticism.

331
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,000
 Kind of kicked off by George Orwell,

332
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,160
 who pointed out that people have been hating Kipling.

333
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,480
 Pretty much since he was writing, since he was really popular,

334
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
 lots of people have really disliked Fredrick Kipling.

335
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,480
 But then again, he also has written these fabulous books,

336
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,960
 which are very observant about human nature and all this stuff.

337
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,640
 So it kind of keeps the reputation going.

338
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,720
 But one of the things that he wrote was the phrase known unto God,

339
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,200
 which went on gravestones of unidentified servicemen after the war ended.

340
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,520
 And he lost his only son in the First World War.

341
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,440
 And he was on the Imperial War Graves Commission.

342
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,560
 He played a big role in that.

343
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,400
 And that was the phrase that he thought was most fitting.

344
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,760
 He was always arguing that rich families

345
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,680
 shouldn't be able to erect loads of statues to their own children,

346
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,640
 because he thought that everyone who died in the war

347
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,360
 really should have an equal remembrance.

348
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,280
 And that was a huge thing.

349
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,040
 There was a family called the Sessles,

350
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,160
 who were one of the richest families in the whole of Britain.

351
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,760
 And he really stood up against them,

352
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,080
 because they wanted to do these statues.

353
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
 And he was like, "No, everyone should have the same."

354
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,920
 Oh, that's interesting.

355
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,000
 But yeah, he was a massive racist.

356
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,480
 So that's another thing.

357
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,040
 I mean, he really, he was a white supremacist.

358
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,240
 So yeah.

359
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,400
 He's such an interesting character.

360
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,520
 So his first language is Hindi, born in India,

361
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,760
 cause like first years in India.

362
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,400
 And said apparently he wasn't very good at English when he learned it,

363
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,880
 because they learned it in translation from Hindi.

364
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,480
 So you'd learn it in like a really stilted sing song way.

365
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,280
 And he said that when he came to Britain,

366
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,440
 so he came to Britain when he was about six

367
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,800
 and was sent away by his parents.

368
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,120
 And then he returned to India when he was 17.

369
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,760
 And he wrote that when he returned,

370
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,160
 he found himself speaking in vernacular sentences,

371
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,920
 whose meaning I knew not.

372
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,680
 He just found words coming out of his mouth

373
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,440
 that he remembered from his childhood,

374
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,400
 not even knowing what he was saying, apparently, bizarre.

375
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,280
 Yeah.

376
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,080
 He came up with the phrase "the oldest profession"

377
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,200
 to mean prostitution.

378
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,120
 So lots of people said, "Oh, that's the oldest profession."

379
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,400
 But before Kipling,

380
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,920
 they were talking about lots of different professions.

381
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,440
 So there was, you know, tailors were described as the oldest profession.

382
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,040
 That's probably the first time anyone said,

383
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,000
 "This is the oldest profession."

384
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,520
 So that's the oldest, oldest profession.

385
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,240
 Murderers were claimed as being the oldest profession,

386
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,760
 arguably not a profession, but still.

387
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,160
 And there was this weird crossover period

388
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,560
 where lots of people were still quite innocent of the phrase.

389
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,960
 So, but we're using it and then other people would think,

390
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
 "Oh, I'm not sure that's what you mean."

391
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,640
 So graduating cadets might be told,

392
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,360
 "You are now entering the oldest profession in the world."

393
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,000
 And not, you know, the old buffer who was doing a ceremony

394
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,280
 might not realize what he was saying.

395
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,720
 That was a bit...

396
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,800
 Apparently, he coined a few other terms and words.

397
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,440
 So some of the words include "lunchless."

398
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
 Yeah, classic.

399
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,600
 That describes someone who has no lunch.

400
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,400
 Brilliant.

401
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,680
 Just so you know.

402
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,600
 Genius, wasn't it? Genius of coined words.

403
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,400
 He was.

404
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,920
 Apparently, he coined "writer."

405
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,360
 Apparently, that's his.

406
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,600
 That's the first use of "writer."

407
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,800
 Oh, that's a biggie, actually.

408
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,640
 It is for you, Andy,

409
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,360
 but most people don't use it quite as often as you do.

410
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
 The sun rarely sets on a date

411
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,240
 when I have it said "writer" at least a few times.

412
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,680
 "Squidgy" as well, and "stinky."

413
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,240
 Promise.

414
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,720
 Did he too?

415
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,040
 Because I know he coined "squiggly" as well,

416
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,600
 and it seems like a cheat to coin "squidgy" and "squiggly."

417
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,440
 I don't know if you count one, if you've done the other.

418
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,920
 Oh, that's very different words.

419
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,080
 They, one of them, described something that's soft

420
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,880
 and the other one described something that goes in lots of directions.

421
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,440
 Yeah.

422
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,560
 That's a good point, actually.

423
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,240
 You wouldn't say I've just enjoyed a lovely moist squiggly bit of sponge cake

424
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,640
 would you?

425
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,120
 No, you wouldn't say I've just drawn a squidgy line.

426
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,920
 No.

427
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,960
 But we all say "writer."

428
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,320
 He was so famous that towns named themselves after him.

429
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,680
 So there were two towns in, I think, Michigan,

430
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,920
 which named themselves Rudyard and Kipling after him.

431
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,160
 And there's a place in Saskatchewan called Kipling,

432
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,680
 and that is an interesting place for us

433
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,680
 because it's the town where a Canadian blogger called Kyle MacDonald

434
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,080
 traded his way from a paperclip up to a house.

435
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,120
 Do you remember this guy?

436
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,480
 I do, yeah.

437
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,120
 He started with a paperclip and traded it for loads and loads of things.

438
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,280
 This was in about the early 2000s, and he ended up with a house in Kipling.

439
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,920
 And the town now has, to commemorate it,

440
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,840
 with the world's largest paperclip.

441
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,400
 They've got a 15-foot-old paperclip to commemorate that.

442
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,440
 That's cool.

443
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,160
 Well, of course, as we said before, he was named after a place,

444
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,240
 a place where his parents met Rudyard Lake.

445
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,160
 Also quite an interesting place because that was a massive tourist attraction.

446
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,400
 So that's a lake in Staffordshire.

447
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,080
 And I discovered that, as well as being the reason that Rudyard's called Rudyard,

448
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,360
 it was also the place where the African blondin,

449
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,080
 as he called himself, a guy called Carlos Trower,

450
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,480
 in 1864 walked a tightrope 100 feet up above the lake.

451
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:44,880
 Wow.

452
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,760
 And it sounds great.

453
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,720
 And thousands of people used to go to this place every day, apparently.

454
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,000
 So I think apparently 20,000 visitors a day

455
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,960
 would visit this tourist attraction at its peak.

456
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,720
 And they watched him and he did it carrying an 11-year-old boy.

457
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,760
 He did it backwards and forwards with his hands and feet shackled,

458
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,480
 which I've got no idea how you walk a tightrope like that.

459
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,680
 And then at one point he was in the middle of the tightrope above the lake

460
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,400
 and then he went back to the edge, picked up a stove,

461
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,200
 brought it back to the middle and cooked himself ham and eggs.

462
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,440
 Which I don't, I also don't know how you cook

463
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,360
 on a stove in the middle of a tightrope.

464
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,280
 Isn't he the guy who he did Niagara Falls as well, isn't he?

465
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,920
 Blondin.

466
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,120
 Blondin did Niagara Falls.

467
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,760
 That was the Blondin, yeah, yeah.

468
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,560
 He named himself.

469
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,680
 What's this guy's name?

470
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,480
 Oh, great.

471
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,560
 Okay, about, because Blondin also cooked in his walks as well, didn't he?

472
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,000
 So he's a total tribute act.

473
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,160
 Yeah.

474
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,800
 That's really cool.

475
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,920
 He's a tribute act, but over a lake in Staffordshire,

476
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,440
 as opposed to over Niagara Falls, which I don't know,

477
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,360
 I really like Staffordshire as a county,

478
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,920
 but I'm not sure it has quite the same gravitas.

479
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,640
 It's not quite.

480
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,720
 Yeah, but if you're a tribute band, you don't play the O2.

481
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,040
 You play the poorly arms, you know?

482
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,840
 Yeah, yeah.

483
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,000
 No, but there is another thing that happened at Lake Rudyard,

484
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,400
 which is that Matthew Webb, who the first person to swim the English Channel,

485
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,440
 he went to Lake Rudyard to host a grand aquatic fate

486
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,680
 where he recreated his channel swim.

487
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,880
 Again, I have no idea how impressive that would have actually been,

488
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,480
 watching him to splash around in a lake for a bit.

489
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,200
 I wonder what the difference is between recreating a swim across the channel

490
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,080
 and just swimming.

491
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,960
 Like, how does he make it?

492
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,240
 Does he put, like, a cross-channel ferry next to him or what?

493
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,080
 You're absolutely right.

494
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,760
 There's details that are frustratingly vague, because this was...

495
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
 You'd have to have people generate waves.

496
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,160
 He probably had lots of people in there kicking and splashing,

497
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,360
 because it's very strong currents.

498
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,800
 Put a few poos in there.

499
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,360
 Put a few poos.

500
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,160
 I'm sure they had, then, 20,000 visitors, Jay.

501
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,520
 Some of those tourists are kids.

502
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,160
 That's true.

503
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,880
 Skippling often associated with swastikas,

504
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,720
 because he was very much into them, obviously growing up in India.

505
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,240
 And they were a symbol of peace, et cetera,

506
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,880
 until those dastardly Nazis got in on the act in the '30s.

507
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,560
 But there was a guy in 1984 called Tom Driver who ran a bookshop.

508
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,320
 And he wrote to the Kippling Journal,

509
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,080
 saying that whenever anyone comes into his shop,

510
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,120
 all they ask about is Kippling and the swastikas.

511
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,920
 Because they had lots of old editions,

512
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,720
 and the old editions of Kippling all had the swastika on them,

513
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,200
 and then later editions didn't have them anymore, of course.

514
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,840
 And he said, "We have recently kept a record,

515
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,040
 and we average once a day when a visitor asks us

516
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,440
 some question about Kippling and the swastika."

517
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,160
 That is insane.

518
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,520
 "Usually at the back of it is a thought that Kippling was a Nazi."

519
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,560
 And he said that they always tell them that this is an old peace sign,

520
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,120
 and that's it.

521
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,160
 And he said, "Yeah, but that's what basically every single day

522
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,120
 someone was coming in saying, 'Why are the swastikas on this?'"

523
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,000
 I've got a couple of pre-1933 Kipplings,

524
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,520
 and they have the swastika on them.

525
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,960
 "Yeah, well, I did my dissertation on Kippling."

526
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,920
 So, yeah.

527
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,720
 Oh, wow.

528
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

529
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,800
 Oh, you didn't let on.

530
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,640
 That's sort of cheating, isn't it?

531
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,360
 Sorry, yeah.

532
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
 Very much cheating in advance in preparation for this podcast.

533
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,600
 It didn't take me any time.

534
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,640
 Next week, we'll be doing scanning, tunneling microscopes,

535
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,800
 which was what my dissertation was on.

536
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,400
 Good luck.

537
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:23,280
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

538
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,120
 My fact is that when McDonald's launched the Filet-O-Fish sandwich,

539
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,680
 its main competition was the Hula Burger,

540
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,200
 which was a slice of pineapple in a bun with cheese.

541
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,000
 Yeah.

542
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,400
 Yeah.

543
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,200
 It was popular.

544
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,440
 It was so unpopular.

545
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,160
 Basically, there was a bit of Cincinnati,

546
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,560
 where 87% of the population were Catholic.

547
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
 And as a result, didn't meet meat on Fridays.

548
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,040
 And as a result, the Cincinnati McDonald's took zero money on Fridays,

549
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,760
 because they didn't have any alternatives to their burgers.

550
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,560
 And the owner said, "Right, I have come up with an idea

551
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,400
 called the Filet-O-Fish sandwich.

552
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,880
 It's going to revolutionise the way we trade on Fridays.

553
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,840
 It's going to be great."

554
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,720
 And he really needed this,

555
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,920
 because he was a kind of franchise holder,

556
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,160
 so he needed the business to work money.

557
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,680
 And Ray Crock, the founder, said, he said in quotes,

558
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,760
 "You're always coming up here with a bunch of crap."

559
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,280
 Didn't like the idea for the Filet-O-Fish.

560
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,760
 He said, "My idea is much better.

561
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,120
 The Hula Burger.

562
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,520
 We'll take a slice of pineapple, we'll grill it,

563
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,040
 put some cheese on it, put it in a bun."

564
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,400
 Sportingly, Ray Crock didn't just steamroller the owner,

565
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,200
 who was called Lou Grun.

566
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,560
 He said, "Look, we'll have a competition.

567
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,240
 Good Friday, 1962.

568
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,920
 Demand for meat going to be very, very low,

569
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,960
 because of all the Christians.

570
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,160
 So we will stock both in certain stores on a given day,

571
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,840
 and we will see who wins.

572
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,400
 And the Filet-O-Fish sold 350,

573
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,840
 and the Hula Burger sold six."

574
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,040
 And so they went with the Filet-O-Fish.

575
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,480
 And when did you say this was?

576
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,080
 This was '62.

577
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,240
 So this was really the heyday of pineapple and cheese

578
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,600
 being a fashionable dish.

579
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,640
 And even then.

580
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,080
 Yeah, you're right.

581
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,600
 The canapes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

582
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,560
 It just didn't work.

583
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,880
 You've got to put it on a stick.

584
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,000
 I mean, it sounds good to me.

585
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
 Does it sound bad to you guys?

586
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
 I wouldn't mind it.

587
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,080
 It doesn't sound filling, I think.

588
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,680
 I think the problem is the slightly grainy texture

589
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,120
 of the bread with the smooth texture of the pineapple.

590
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,000
 I'm really, one of my biggest fads is textures.

591
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,680
 I really struggle with certain textures,

592
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,160
 and I think that would be the main problem, yeah.

593
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,040
 Interesting.

594
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,640
 That might be why you hate mushrooms so much,

595
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,520
 because they do have a very distinctive texture.

596
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,080
 That is why meat jelly, stuff like that,

597
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,760
 I can't deal with that.

598
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
 Oh, I didn't know that you didn't like meat jelly.

599
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,440
 That's pies ruined for you.

600
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,280
 It's basically all of Russian cuisine

601
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,320
 ruined for me as well.

602
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,160
 It's like, yeah.

603
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,680
 I think jelly should be sweet, personally.

604
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,560
 And I think my McDonald's should be savory.

605
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,800
 So you're on the filet-of-fish side.

606
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
 I think I am, really, yeah.

607
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,960
 Because I think, Dan, even though I agree with you, look,

608
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,600
 if someone put in front of me pineapple and cheese in a bun,

609
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,560
 I would eat it.

610
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,920
 But if someone gave me the choice,

611
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,280
 I'd definitely go filet-of-fish.

612
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,920
 Would you, do you think you'd choose the pineapple?

613
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,240
 No, no.

614
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
 I'm just saying there's a lot of options on the menu,

615
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,320
 and it doesn't stick out as a weird McDonald's one for me.

616
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,080
 It just might not be as popular

617
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,040
 as one of their biggest, most popular burgers.

618
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,560
 Also, Catholics tend to eat fish on Fridays,

619
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,480
 as opposed to eating pineapples on Fridays.

620
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,880
 So if it was for the Catholics.

621
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,720
 Yeah, you're right.

622
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,920
 I see that now.

623
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,480
 Yeah.

624
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,760
 You don't see Jesus having two pineapples and 12 loaves,

625
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
 do you, between the 5,000?

626
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,720
 He would have only fed the 200 if they'd had the choice.

627
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,600
 But maybe that was a secret.

628
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,680
 Maybe there was another messiah at the stall next to him.

629
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:31,680
 Yeah.

630
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,180
 Yeah.

631
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,840
 Pineapple tie-up.

632
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,680
 Oh, that's a cut scene from Life of Brian, surely.

633
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,720
 But yeah, pineapples, they were massive, weren't they?

634
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,440
 Well, they were the same size as they are today,

635
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,000
 or similar size, but they were really popular.

636
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,040
 And it was because they were so difficult to grow,

637
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,320
 and so they just became really exclusive.

638
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,640
 Yeah.

639
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,600
 And you couldn't grow them here.

640
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,240
 That was really hard to grow them here, wasn't it?

641
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,720
 So it was a sort of code that you were incredibly wealthy.

642
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,920
 And so you can kind of date whole bits of British design

643
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,440
 and architecture to when they were built,

644
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,520
 because if it's got a pineapple on,

645
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,360
 it's probably from that time in the 18th century

646
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,960
 that everyone was obsessed with pineapples.

647
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,240
 Gate posts and railings.

648
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,040
 Yeah.

649
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,040
 But all of this stuff, by the way,

650
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,760
 I just want to give a shout-out to Fran Bowman's book,

651
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,080
 which is called The Pineapple King of Fruits,

652
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,240
 which is possibly my favorite book on a single,

653
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,280
 tiny, weird subject that I've ever read in my entire life.

654
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,720
 So people should definitely read it.

655
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,000
 But she basically says that once you learn

656
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,520
 how amazingly popular pineapples were for this short time,

657
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,760
 wherever you go, you'll start seeing pineapples,

658
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,400
 because like Candy says, they're absolutely everywhere.

659
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,640
 Yeah.

660
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,360
 It's really sad.

661
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,280
 And I can't believe we've never said before,

662
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,800
 but people used to rent them.

663
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,920
 So if you couldn't afford them, which a lot of people couldn't.

664
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,000
 So there was, again, it was a brief time.

665
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 I think it was the start of the 18th century.

666
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,840
 They would cost sort of £10,000 in today's money,

667
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,800
 as much as a carriage.

668
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,920
 So you'd rent one for a night,

669
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,920
 and you'd carry it around like a bag,

670
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,880
 or you'd put it on your table if you're hosting a dinner party.

671
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,760
 And I think it was Fran Bowman who pointed out,

672
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,120
 it was terrifying if you were the servant

673
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,880
 who had to transport the pineapple around,

674
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,120
 because that's the equivalent of carrying a briefcase

675
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,480
 stuffed with banknotes.

676
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,120
 Yeah.

677
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,000
 But who's going to know that you've got a pineapple under your cloak?

678
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,720
 It's not, you wouldn't just randomly mug someone

679
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,920
 in the hope that they'd have a pineapple.

680
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,280
 That's jackpot for the mugger.

681
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,440
 Didn't the rich used to hire people to sleep with their pineapples?

682
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
 Was that a thing, am I making that up?

683
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,400
 Yeah, they used to protect their pineapples at night.

684
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,560
 Yeah, from any poachers or any animals.

685
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
 Yeah, exactly, if you were growing them.

686
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,760
 What do you say am I making that up?

687
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,920
 Have you read that somewhere?

688
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,280
 We don't know if you're making it up.

689
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,160
 Well, I read Fran Bowman's book years and years ago,

690
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,520
 and it's a memory from that, James, just bringing that up.

691
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,360
 I know Charles II used to sleep with a pineapple.

692
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,440
 He'd sleep with anything, though.

693
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,400
 He'd sleep with anything.

694
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,760
 He'd sleep with a pineapple.

695
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,560
 Yeah, well, you know his mistress, Barbara Villiers.

696
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,400
 He called her my sweet pineapple.

697
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,840
 Okay, okay.

698
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,760
 So, yeah, he slept with a pineapple.

699
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,440
 Barbara Villiers, amazing, isn't she?

700
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,880
 She kind of became the king's favourite mistress,

701
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,400
 and then after the king died,

702
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,080
 she just went completely off the rails.

703
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,080
 And at one stage, the absolute worst thing that she did

704
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,200
 was biting the penis off a recently exhumed bishop.

705
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,880
 I think as far as going off the rails is concerned,

706
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,680
 I mean, Pete Dockers, he's got a lot to learn, hasn't he?

707
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,480
 What if he'd run out of pineapple?

708
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,320
 Charles II, he also commissioned a painting of himself

709
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,400
 being given a pineapple by his gardener.

710
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,240
 That's how much he loved pineapples.

711
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,400
 And it was kind of to prove a point.

712
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
 So, he ordered a pineapple because the French ambassador was there,

713
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,720
 and Barbados was an English colony at the time,

714
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,080
 and they were arguing over who got to own the nearby island of St Kitt's,

715
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,760
 and he was basically asserting primacy,

716
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,680
 because you could grow pineapples in Barbados,

717
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,640
 and he was saying, "Look, we can do this with our pineapples here,

718
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,360
 so it makes sense that we should have this neighbouring bit of land as well."

719
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,400
 And I think that was why he commissioned a painting of himself

720
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,480
 just getting a pineapple off his gardener.

721
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,680
 Wow, it was a little bit of an art-pureaus.

722
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,400
 I was thinking how awful it must have been

723
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,720
 when the very first king received pineapple,

724
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,320
 that was King Ferdinand.

725
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,440
 So, pineapple was brought to Europe after Columbus's voyages,

726
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,560
 the late 15th century, and King Ferdinand of Spain

727
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,680
 was the first person to eat one,

728
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,800
 and he said the flavour exceeds all other fruit,

729
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,920
 but it was the only one that survived the trip.

730
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,840
 And so, imagine how awful that is.

731
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,360
 You know, when you run out of something delicious,

732
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,120
 and you have to go back to the shop,

733
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,920
 it's the most delicious thing you've ever tasted in your life,

734
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,560
 and that's it.

735
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,280
 Because they all, like, he did have loads of them,

736
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,640
 but they all just ended up squishy and rotten, didn't they?

737
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,920
 Apart from one of them,

738
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,480
 which makes me think that perhaps the one

739
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,520
 probably wasn't in the absolute best condition.

740
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,560
 If all the others have got,

741
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,600
 it's a bit like they're washing on your line going dry.

742
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,640
 If all the others are rotten,

743
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,400
 then that one's probably a bit rotten as well.

744
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,320
 All the others went squidgy,

745
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
 but this one happened to go squiggly.

746
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,360
 This is weird.

747
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,040
 You two are typo.

748
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,880
 Have you guys ever been on a cruise?

749
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,520
 Yep.

750
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,320
 No.

751
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,040
 Okay, so James, you're the only one who's been on a cruise.

752
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,000
 When you were on the cruise,

753
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,720
 did you ever see on anyone else's door

754
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,480
 a sticker with a pineapple on it?

755
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,760
 No, I didn't go on a very high-class cruise,

756
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,800
 it has to be said.

757
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,360
 Oh, that's fine,

758
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,640
 because this doesn't apply on high-class cruise.

759
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,520
 Oh, God.

760
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,000
 This is the...

761
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,400
 There is a myth among the cruising community

762
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,760
 that this indicates,

763
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,600
 or if someone has a pineapple magnet or whatever,

764
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,640
 or something like that,

765
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,000
 that they are swingers

766
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,600
 and they are interested in having a good time.

767
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,120
 Is that right?

768
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,440
 But, well, I don't know.

769
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,960
 Because when I went on the cruise,

770
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,720
 the whole time I was sat on the deck

771
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,800
 reading Fran Bowman's book about pineapples.

772
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,320
 So God knows what they all thought of me.

773
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,920
 Yeah, the thing is, the system is a poor one,

774
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,680
 because obviously, I mean, assuming it,

775
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,720
 this is not complete bollocks,

776
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,600
 which it may well be.

777
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,520
 But you would only see a few doors, don't you?

778
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,480
 Because you normally, you know,

779
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,440
 you have your corridor,

780
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,720
 and then you go up to the...

781
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,080
 Yeah, but if you're a swinger,

782
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,840
 you probably check in a few more doors

783
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,600
 than the average person, aren't you?

784
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,000
 That's a good point.

785
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,880
 I think so.

786
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,200
 Yeah.

787
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,480
 You walk up a couple of corridors.

788
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,080
 You don't know who's behind the door, either.

789
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,680
 I mean, the worst thing would be,

790
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,960
 if you've got the sticker on your door,

791
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,720
 and someone knocks on the door, you open it,

792
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,360
 and they say, "Oh, sorry, I think I've got the wrong."

793
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,280
 Sorry, nothing, never mind.

794
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,520
 You probably dress as like a...

795
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,360
 I was going to say cabin boy,

796
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,440
 but more like a waiter or something.

797
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,800
 And so you have that out.

798
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,480
 Like, if they knock on the door,

799
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,400
 and you don't fancy them, you can say,

800
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,480
 "Oh, sorry, I just come to collect your room service."

801
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,880
 That's good.

802
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,600
 I think that's the best possible solution,

803
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,480
 but that feels like a long...

804
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,600
 Now, you've got to pack your cabin boy outfit

805
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,960
 when you're going on a cruise.

806
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,560
 I just think so many things have to come together

807
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,760
 at once to make this work,

808
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,200
 that I can't believe it's ever happened

809
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,880
 in the history of the universe.

810
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,640
 It's like, you have to be...

811
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,840
 There have to be other swingers on the boat.

812
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,200
 You have to be on the right corridor.

813
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,120
 You have to know about the pineapple rule,

814
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,040
 and they have to be attractive enough for you to accept.

815
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
 If anyone's listening,

816
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,520
 if you've ever had a successful pineapple-based cruise experience,

817
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,200
 we want to hear about it.

818
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
 Yeah.

819
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,760
 Hey, I was looking into other ways

820
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,640
 of presenting pineapple for meals,

821
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,200
 and I came across a dessert I've never heard of before.

822
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,960
 Have you guys heard of candle salad?

823
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,720
 Have you ever had a candle salad?

824
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,840
 No, I haven't.

825
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,600
 I'm part of the electric generation,

826
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,840
 so I just plug my salad in at the wall.

827
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,560
 So, candle salad, it's a fruit salad,

828
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,360
 although you do have lettuce in it as well as the base,

829
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,680
 but the idea is you take a ring of pineapple,

830
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,040
 and you place through the ring of pineapple at the base a banana,

831
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,920
 a peeled banana, so it sits up through...

832
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,560
 I can see why the swingers would like this kind of thing.

833
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,840
 It has a red cherry on the top,

834
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,680
 and then, and by the way,

835
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,200
 this supposedly is for children.

836
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,320
 This is a great way to get kids to eat fruit.

837
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,680
 It's got this cherry on the top.

838
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,240
 It's a banana sticking up through the pineapple,

839
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,200
 and you use either mayonnaise on it or cottage cheese.

840
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,840
 I swear to God, you do not put mayonnaise on it.

841
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,760
 It's always good having you on for a day.

842
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,200
 I swear to God, you put it on,

843
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,000
 and you put it right at the tip of the banana.

844
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,800
 What are you talking about?

845
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,400
 It's a kid's food,

846
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,440
 and it looks like probably erect penis.

847
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,000
 That's just orgasm.

848
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,440
 Stop feeding this to your children.

849
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,000
 Yeah.

850
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,040
 Come on, Dan, which soft play area have you been to

851
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,960
 where they give you this halfway through?

852
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,720
 Dan is no longer allowed to go to any soft play areas.

853
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,840
 Where are you getting it from?

854
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,280
 I never saw this in my childhood, put it this way,

855
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,720
 and I was a Catholic.

856
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,200
 It was big in the 1920s in America,

857
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,920
 and it still is around,

858
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,000
 and if you Google it, there's plenty of pictures.

859
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,440
 People love popping their pictures up

860
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,720
 to show you how their candle salad looks,

861
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,800
 and it has a full-on Wikipedia article telling about its history.

862
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,240
 It's a real thing.

863
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,160
 Everything's got a Wikipedia article, mate.

864
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,520
 There's always some nut job out there

865
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,120
 willing to find a Wikipedia article.

866
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,880
 How do you balance a cherry on a banana?

867
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,840
 With clotted cream or whatever it was.

868
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,800
 Yeah, with mayonnaise.

869
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,520
 With mayonnaise.

870
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,560
 James, mayonnaise.

871
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:24,880
 Sorry.

872
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,000
 That's the implausible bit.

873
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,800
 I was just trying to think of anything, Seemony.

874
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,240
 I couldn't remember what it was.

875
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,480
 Cottage cheese makes a lot of sense.

876
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,400
 Cottage cheese famously goes with pineapple.

877
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,000
 Mayonnaise, like I say, it's top video to your kids.

878
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:45,920
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

879
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,600
 and that is James.

880
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,800
 Okay, my fact this week

881
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,800
 is that there is a professional footballer called Naughty Naughty.

882
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,400
 He has never been sent off.

883
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,720
 I mean, the headline that could have been Naughty Naughty Naughty.

884
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,560
 Might still be because he's very young.

885
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,640
 Well, he is young compared to me.

886
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,400
 He was born in 1994.

887
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,760
 How old does that make?

888
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,480
 Yeah, he's pretty young.

889
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,120
 He's young.

890
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,040
 So, basically, this guy,

891
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,960
 I known about him for a little while.

892
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,520
 He was played for Chelsea as a youth player,

893
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,160
 and then he's played for a few non-league teams

894
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,680
 like Charlie and Dover.

895
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,600
 But recently he's gone to play for Queen of the South in Scotland,

896
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,920
 and last week he scored against Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

897
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,200
 And I was watching Gillette Soccer Saturday with Jeff Stelling,

898
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,600
 and Jeff Stelling said that this guy called Naughty Naughty

899
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,720
 had never been sent off.

900
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,200
 And I checked, and as far as I can see, it's true.

901
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,240
 And, you know, we get a lot of our facts from books

902
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,320
 or from scientific papers or stuff like this,

903
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,480
 and I just thought, why can't you get facts

904
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,880
 from Gillette Soccer Saturday on Sky Sports?

905
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,400
 Quite right.

906
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,720
 Facts you can find facts anywhere, can't you?

907
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,320
 I've always said there should be an opposite of normative determinism.

908
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,520
 I reckon I've said this in the podcast,

909
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,040
 and if he's not evidence of that,

910
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,320
 then I don't know what is.

911
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,200
 Yeah.

912
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,160
 So on football was being sent off.

913
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,320
 Oh, yeah.

914
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,400
 So I thought Naughty Naughty never has been.

915
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,080
 There have been some wonderful soundings off

916
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,200
 in the history of English football.

917
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,920
 My God.

918
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,920
 So the earliest ever sending off was a Sunday League match in 2000,

919
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,640
 and it was between Cross Farm Park Celtic

920
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,040
 and Taunton East Reach Wanderers, right?

921
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,200
 The referee blew his whistle at the start of the match,

922
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,120
 very close to a player called Lee Todd,

923
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,680
 who was a part-time bricklayer who had his back turned.

924
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,440
 The referee blew his whistle very, very loud.

925
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,160
 Todd exclaimed, "Fuck me, that was loud."

926
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,640
 The referee stopped the game two seconds in

927
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,240
 and sent him off for abusive language.

928
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,120
 And it's just a glorious story.

929
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,120
 Like, there are so many crunchy details about it.

930
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,040
 Like, he was also banned for 35 days and fined £27.

931
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,240
 Twenty-seven.

932
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:50,720
 Really?

933
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,760
 £27.

934
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,280
 But then in the meeting about that,

935
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,880
 he went, "Fuck me, that's not very much."

936
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,360
 Another 35 days, mate.

937
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,920
 And he was tracked down 20 years after this match.

938
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,240
 Last year, he was tracked down by the website SportBible,

939
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,280
 and he's still slightly annoyed about it.

940
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,960
 He said, "Fuck me. I mean, if anything,

941
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,320
 he was wearing it himself."

942
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,360
 True. Yeah, yeah.

943
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,080
 Unless it could, like, maybe the referee took it as a request.

944
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,000
 He did have a pineapple stick on the back of his shirt.

945
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,240
 Do you know what the record for being booked

946
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,440
 with a yellow card is?

947
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,560
 How quickly that was done.

948
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,360
 It was three seconds, and that was Vinnie Jones,

949
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,160
 who most people globally will know as an actor,

950
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,080
 but used to be a professional footballer.

951
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,680
 Yeah, he was booked after three seconds,

952
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,520
 and he beat the previous record for a yellow card by two seconds.

953
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,320
 So it was a five-second was the previous record,

954
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,240
 and that was held by Vinnie Jones.

955
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,320
 They smashed his own record.

956
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,920
 Yeah, the red card was invented by referee Ken Aston

957
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,400
 after the 1966 World Cup.

958
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,680
 You could be sent off before then,

959
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,200
 but they didn't have card system,

960
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,520
 because what happened was,

961
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,240
 in the quarter-final of the World Cup,

962
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,960
 which was between England and, I think, Argentina,

963
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,840
 it said in the newspapers the next day

964
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,480
 that both of the Charlton brothers had been booked,

965
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,240
 but they didn't remember it happening.

966
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,240
 And so England went to FIFA and said,

967
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,000
 "It says in the newspapers that we've been booked,

968
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,920
 but we have no idea what happened."

969
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,400
 And it turned out they had been and they hadn't noticed.

970
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,520
 But then Ken Aston, having seen this happen,

971
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,240
 thought, "Well, we need a more obvious symbol

972
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,600
 of someone being sent off."

973
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,640
 And apparently he was driving down Kensington High Street,

974
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,320
 and he saw a traffic light,

975
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,640
 and the yellow, he thought, meant, "Take it easy,

976
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,080
 and the red is to stop."

977
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,920
 And so he thought, "Well, that's a good idea.

978
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,120
 Let's have yellow and red cards."

979
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,360
 So I guess the traffic lights aren't yellow,

980
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,240
 they're amber, are they?

981
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,160
 So they should be amber and red cards, maybe.

982
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,320
 But it's literally a light bulb moment,

983
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,840
 because what do you have in traffic lights?

984
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,800
 You have light bulbs.

985
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,920
 It's light bulbs.

986
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,520
 But it's also an extremely obvious theft to us now,

987
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,320
 as in it's so obvious that, I don't know.

988
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,400
 What do you mean to get red and yellow and green?

989
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,680
 Well, I heard about that, Ken Aston.

990
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,280
 You should be given, everyone should be given

991
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,880
 a green card at the start of the match.

992
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,000
 That would be a really nice card.

993
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,640
 Put them into America.

994
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,120
 That was before the 1994 World Cup in America.

995
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,320
 They all had to have a green card.

996
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,120
 In the match with the most ever red cards given,

997
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,400
 only one person was sent off.

998
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,160
 Oh, really? Why?

999
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,360
 Riddle me.

1000
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,320
 That? This was quite…

1001
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,240
 And it's a good corner, his opening business.

1002
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,360
 It was Valentine's Day, and they all got a load of red cards,

1003
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,200
 which said, "Happy Valentine's Day" on them.

1004
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,080
 That's such a good answer, James.

1005
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,760
 And I'm going to give you a bonus point for that,

1006
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,960
 but it's not correct.

1007
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,800
 36 people got red cards, but it was in 2011.

1008
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,400
 And it's vaguely famous.

1009
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,800
 The referee was this guy called Damian Rubino.

1010
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,040
 And one player was sent off in the first half,

1011
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,640
 because he just got two yellows.

1012
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,080
 And he returned in the second half to stand in the crowd

1013
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,720
 in his home clothes and cheer the teams on.

1014
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,800
 And then at the end of the match,

1015
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,560
 this guy had been sent off in the first half,

1016
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,760
 came onto the pitch,

1017
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,000
 and just punched one of the opposition players in the face

1018
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,240
 for reasons unknown to anyone.

1019
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,600
 But there's a huge brawl start.

1020
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,880
 So everyone chased him.

1021
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,320
 He fled to the locker room.

1022
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,000
 Everyone's favourite place to be.

1023
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 And then there was a big fight in there,

1024
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,240
 and then they came back out into the pitch, big fight there.

1025
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,920
 And eventually the referees gave red cards to everyone on both teams,

1026
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,120
 plus all subs, plus a coach or two as well.

1027
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,680
 But he was into, he's been interviewed this ref,

1028
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,960
 and he was like, "I've got no idea why this guy

1029
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,320
 just jumped out of the stands when he punched someone in the face."

1030
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,600
 And years later, he bumped into him at another match.

1031
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,400
 And the guy said, "Sorry about that incident.

1032
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,960
 We actually had some personal beef off the pitch."

1033
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,320
 I don't know what to talk about, but yeah.

1034
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,400
 We never know what it was.

1035
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,240
 We'll never know.

1036
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,280
 We can only speculate.

1037
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,880
 Yeah. A woman has got to be about a four.

1038
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,120
 The first woman to ever be sent off an official football match

1039
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,960
 for fighting was called Lily Parr.

1040
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
 She is very famous.

1041
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,400
 She played for the Dick Kerr ladies,

1042
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,080
 who are some factory workers from Preston,

1043
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,600
 who we might have mentioned before, actually.

1044
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,880
 Yeah, we must have.

1045
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,120
 Probably the most successful women's team of all time.

1046
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,400
 Anyway, she had a shot that was so hard,

1047
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,280
 she once broke the arm of a professional male goalkeeper.

1048
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,160
 That's how good she was.

1049
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,280
 She scored more than a thousand goals during her career,

1050
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,880
 more than a thousand goals, 34 of which were in her first season

1051
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,720
 when she was only 14 years old.

1052
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,480
 Oh, wow.

1053
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,920
 How good does she sound?

1054
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,720
 What a prodigy.

1055
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,640
 They did used to play with bowling balls back then.

1056
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,200
 So much easier to break an arm.

1057
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,040
 Is Nanny a famous player?

1058
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,000
 Yeah. Yeah.

1059
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,360
 Played for United.

1060
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,600
 Luis de Cunha is his name,

1061
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,840
 and Nanny's name is Played for United, as James says.

1062
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,040
 In 2013, he was sent off in a match against Real Madrid,

1063
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,440
 and watching at home, one of the United fans was so outraged

1064
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,840
 and enraged by this that he phoned the police.

1065
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,960
 He called 999.

1066
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:05,040
 And he was the young lad, I think he called.

1067
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,040
 He was just so angry about this setting off.

1068
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,800
 He thought a crime has been committed.

1069
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,280
 And then the police turned up and the car was going,

1070
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,720
 "Nanny, Nanny, Nanny."

1071
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,600
 If he didn't get a red for time wasting, then that's…

1072
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,880
 He apologized later on.

1073
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,880
 He said it was bad judgment to phoned the old bill.

1074
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,640
 I found a naughty manager, naughty football manager.

1075
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,440
 Someone very famous, Jose Mourinho.

1076
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,680
 So Jose Mourinho was given a two-match band once,

1077
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,840
 and he found that horrible because he wasn't able to consult

1078
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,400
 with his team in the locker rooms.

1079
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,480
 So he snuck in, and he managed to give his team a big talk.

1080
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,600
 But then the problem was he got in there early, so he wasn't seen.

1081
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,000
 But by the time he'd finished with his team,

1082
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,400
 the whole place was crowded with UEFA people,

1083
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,240
 and he needed to somehow get out.

1084
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,200
 So they popped a kit man, popped Jose Mourinho in a laundry basket.

1085
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,120
 No.

1086
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,600
 And wheeled him out.

1087
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,280
 So he left the lid bit of it open so that he was fine.

1088
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,080
 He could breathe.

1089
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,960
 But suddenly, when they were in the corridors,

1090
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,040
 they could hear UEFA people, and he got really nervous.

1091
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,320
 The kit guy got really nervous.

1092
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,200
 So he slammed the lid down on top of the laundry basket.

1093
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,440
 Problem is, Mourinho is claustrophobic and freaked out inside.

1094
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,440
 And he thought he was dying, and he was just thrashing about.

1095
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,160
 And eventually, when they got out, they opened it,

1096
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,040
 and he was like, and came out, and it was a big scene for him.

1097
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,400
 Yeah.

1098
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,080
 The problem was he ended up on the Isle of Wight in Queen Victoria.

1099
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,280
 Well, who the hell are you?

1100
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,600
 Such a good story.

1101
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,600
 Wow. Did you also have that as research for the laundry section?

1102
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,320
 I did. Yeah.

1103
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,200
 Yeah.

1104
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,640
 Yeah. You've got to double that up.

1105
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,520
 James and Anna, I think it's fair to say that you're the two

1106
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,800
 of this podcasting team who are more interested in football.

1107
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,080
 Yeah.

1108
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,200
 If we're ranking.

1109
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,840
 Well, Anna's a Newcastle fan, but you know, not far.

1110
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,840
 Yeah. You can't really call it football now.

1111
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,400
 That kind of bit.

1112
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,040
 That's from a tram there found over there.

1113
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,040
 OK. Well, I'm going to look up all these references later.

1114
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,840
 So thanks for those.

1115
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,080
 But are you guys familiar with the idea that it's harder

1116
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,800
 to play against 10 men than 11?

1117
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,000
 Is this the thing that people say?

1118
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,440
 People say it. Usually you're expected to win against 10 men

1119
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,800
 because they have one fewer player, but a lot of teams do struggle.

1120
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,360
 Interesting.

1121
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:25,840
 OK.

1122
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,760
 I've never run. Is it the psychology of it?

1123
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,280
 Well, it's either that or this is just from what I've read.

1124
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,040
 It's that a team with 10 players retreats,

1125
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,680
 and so they're going to be guarding the ball very carefully and all of this.

1126
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,320
 But anyway, it's been studied and it's absolutely nonsense.

1127
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,080
 It's much easier to win more points and more goals against 10 men

1128
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,520
 than it is against 11.

1129
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,040
 The stats. That's what the stats say.

1130
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,320
 Thanks for the sense.

1131
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,960
 Yeah.

1132
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,880
 It's pretty hard to play against 15 men.

1133
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,320
 This was a problem that Arsenal had in a game against Dynamo Moscow in 1945.

1134
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,280
 It was a friendly game, so not too bad.

1135
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,760
 But it was played in extremely heavy fog

1136
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,480
 so that no one could really see what was happening on the pitch.

1137
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,440
 And at one stage, the Moscow Dynamo played made a substitution,

1138
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,960
 but they didn't take a player off.

1139
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,840
 They just brought someone on, but no one noticed.

1140
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,360
 The fans who are watching reckon that one stage,

1141
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,600
 they had 15 players on the pitch at one stage.

1142
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,480
 Arsenal had a player set off,

1143
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,320
 and the player snuck back onto the pitch for the rest of the game.

1144
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,400
 And in the end, Arsenal lost 4-3.

1145
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,440
 But probably one of the reasons was because their goalkeeper knocked himself out,

1146
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,520
 accidentally running into a goal post,

1147
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,200
 which he couldn't see because of the fog.

1148
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,800
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts.

1149
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,160
