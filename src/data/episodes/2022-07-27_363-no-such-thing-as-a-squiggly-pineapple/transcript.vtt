 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.800
 you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.000
 Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around our

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.360
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:45.440
 here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Anna. My fact this week is that 19 states

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.520
 in the USA have banned the banning of clotheslines. It's a double ban. Does that mean clotheslines

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.560
 as in things you put clothes on or is this like a wrestling term where you kind of almost

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.480
 decapitate someone? Surely the wrestling move is covered by other legislation.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.760
 In wrestling are you allowed to strangle people with a clothesline?

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.840
 No, well yeah, you are. You are. I mean, you know, that's modern wrestling.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.120
 It's a metaphorical clothesline that I'm talking about. It's a forearm, yeah. You open up your arm,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.520
 you run towards them and you hit them across the neck with your arm and that's the clothesline.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 It's like, it's a type of tackle in American football, I think, and then they turn it into

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.360
 a wrestling move. Interesting. See, I knew about the, you know, sometimes someone will

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.920
 turn up with a steel chair or hit someone else with a table, but I didn't know there was a laundry

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.520
 rack or a laundry line that could also be drafted into service in wrestling matches,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.280
 if this makes more sense. Yeah, me neither. All my research on clotheslines did not come

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.840
 across the wrestling move. Stuck to clotheslines themselves and they're quite controversial,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.240
 turns out. So a lot of rental associations, housing associations ban them because they're

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.040
 sort of unsightly. They've got a bad image. They sort of were historically associated with

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.760
 poverty in the fifties when people were getting electronic washing machines and dryers. So it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.920
 was like, if you hung your clothes out, it showed you're not in a posh neighborhood.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.720
 And so lots of housing associations say, don't do it. But of course, with the environmental

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.840
 movement, everyone's gone, what are you talking about? It's much better to hang your clothes out

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.920
 on a clothesline. And so about 2012, there was this big movement, and a bunch of states, Arizona,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.360
 Maryland, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, et cetera, said you're not allowed to ban them anymore.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.840
 It is weird when you think about it, though, it's the only thing that's really intimate to us that

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.080
 we just take out of the house to show everyone. You know, we're not showing it to them on purpose,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.400
 but I don't hang my books outside or the contents of my fridge for people to see what my diet's like.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.120
 Yeah, but you've got to stop washing your books. It's just odd, you know, we hang underwear outside.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.920
 I get it. I get the banning of it. Yeah, but then after Second World War, when they were trying

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.920
 to get more women in the workplace, it was kind of a new form of modern living where, you know,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.320
 everything was done by machines and stuff like this, especially in America. And so,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.600
 and also they wanted to sell electricity. So they kind of thought that really it's almost a

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.240
 patriotic duty to have a machine doing all your washing rather than your wife doing all your

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.680
 washing in America. And if you had it hanging outside, it was like a symbol that you were

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.440
 part of the old times. When people used to do that, you weren't part of the new times,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.600
 but it's slightly different in the UK because less than half of people in the UK have a tumble

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.120
 dryer, whereas in America, it's like, I don't know, like 80% or something like that. Yeah, it's huge.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.760
 I was a money-saving expert in the UK and maybe this was you, Dan. There was someone who said,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.440
 "I've just moved to a new place and I'm the only person who hangs my laundry on the balcony."

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.720
 Is it okay? And the first response was, "Not acceptable at all. Who wants to see your

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.800
 shabby clothes hanging out on the balcony? Do you think the architect envisions that?

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.560
 Clothes on balconies are the same as broken cars in front gardens. Have some pride in where you live.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.680
 I really like that. So this gets called the right to dry, which is a catchy phrase,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.320
 but like Anna says, most, lots of states, nearly half of them are banned it, but Utah hasn't. Utah

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.320
 has passed laws which allow local authorities to forbid people from banning clothes lines,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.160
 but they have not passed a law themselves. So they have legalized the banning of the ban,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.640
 but they have not just banned banning directly. So abused. Sorry, they've legalized the banning

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.280
 of the ban. They've said it's okay to ban people from banning them. They've passed laws saying,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.800
 "Local authorities in Utah can ban bans, but they haven't stepped in themselves and banned bans

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.200
 directly." It feels like you can remove at least two of the bans from that sentence. I'm not sure.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.240
 I've tried. It doesn't work. It's exactly as I said. Oh, yeah.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.480
 Do you know the most powerful room in America is a laundry room?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.160
 The White House. Yeah.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.920
 Yeah. Well, it used to be. It used to be a laundry room. So Franklin Roosevelt actually moved the

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.040
 Oval Office from where it used to be. It used to be located in the center of the White House,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.360
 and then you prefer to have it put more by windows, and there was an obvious room for it to go to,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.960
 and that's the room where they used to hang all of the laundry in and dry it up there.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.320
 He had that removed, and then the Oval Office was placed there.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.240
 Oh, it doesn't smell nearly as nice now, presumably. That would have been what attracted him to the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.120
 room. Very disappointing when they took the clean laundry out.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.400
 When you see that center shot of a president behind the desk, they have to crop it because

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.720
 just next to him, there's a clothes horse. It's just packed with everyone's washing.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.000
 Clothes house. Do you guys call it a clothes house? That kind of thing. What do you call it,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.280
 Andy? I just like a laundry rack. Laundry rack. Hannah, what do you call them?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.080
 Clothes ass. Mine's a bit smaller than your average ones.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.600
 Because I call them clothes maiden, and I was googling this because I wanted to know where

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.800
 the word came from, and then from my Google, it seemed to imply that this is not what anyone

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.360
 else calls it. I've never heard of clothes maiden. Definitely the sexiest version.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.760
 Well, it's so strange. It's like, you know, when you have these words that you think are so common

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.400
 and everyone uses them, and then you say them, and then everyone's like, what on earth are you

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.200
 talking about? Well, this is it. But maiden is like what people in Lancashire would call,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.600
 I think, what Dan called a clothes horse, and Andy called a clothes rack, and we gloss over

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.120
 what Anna called it. And I think, I can't find out why they're called maidens, but I reckon

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.680
 it's because in a spinning machine, you would have two bits of wood that held the kind of spool,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.920
 and they were called a maiden, or they were called maidens, and they would stick upwards,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.680
 and then they would have a bar coming across them, and then you would hang things on there.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.520
 And I reckon that that's why they call it, because obviously Lancashire was like a spinning area.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.280
 Oh, that's cool. It wasn't the case that historically unmarried women used to stand

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.120
 with their arms outstretched for hours on end with clothes draped over them.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.720
 It was a simpler time and a happier time. Do you know why laundry smells nice?

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.000
 Specifically air-dried, because you put soap in your clothes.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.800
 The soap helps, definitely. But that's specifically, I think, the difference between air-dried,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.040
 line-dried towels supposedly smell nicer than machine-dried towels or whatever.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.680
 And scientists last year published a paper examining at the molecular level why these

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.880
 smells so damn good. And they got a load of samples, and they used ultrapurified water,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.280
 and then they hung the things out to dry, and then they sealed them in a bag for 15 hours

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.520
 once they were dry, and then sampled the air that was being given off by these things,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.240
 and compared the chemical profiles and la, la, la. And after things have been out in the sun,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.120
 they emit specific organic molecules. And one of them is called octanal, and one of them is called,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:56.160
 I think it's pronounced non-anal, non-anal, but it's not non-anal. And non-anal smells of roses,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.920
 apparently. And it's possible that exposure to ozone outdoors transforms these chemicals

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.680
 and makes them smell lovely. Non-anal smells of roses. Do you think, if it was cold,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.320
 anything other than non-anal, it would still smell as sweet?

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.560
 I understand that reference. Thank you.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.720
 It's from Anna Corellina.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:29.440
 It's the final line of Anna Corellina. You know, you were saying, James, that it was the

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.080
 electricity movement, this push for electricity that meant people weren't supposed to hang their

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.920
 clothes out anymore. Do you know who the face of electricity was in the 1950s?

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:44.160
 Not Edison. He was dead long ago. 50s, yeah. Yeah, his face looked awful by that point.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.560
 Is it like a John Wayne? Is it like a famous person? Yes, actually, you're really close with

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.320
 John Wayne. Think of the budget version of John Wayne. Oh, I know, Reagan. Yeah, it was Reagan.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:01.120
 Very strong. Oh, how sad that I said budget version of John Wayne, and you did get Reagan from that.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.240
 So he must have loved the Oval Office. He would have felt right at home in there.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.520
 Maybe that's why he went for president. Although, actually, no, he wouldn't have liked it,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.280
 because he was all about anti-clothesline. So he was the face of the live better

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.760
 electrically campaign. And there are great adverts you can watch online, which show him

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.080
 with his wife and his child sitting around a table and his wife just talking about

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.680
 how great it is that she doesn't have to slave over various things anymore,

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.480
 because she now has an electric souffle maker, an electric coffee percolator,

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.000
 an electric combined toaster and grill, a lot of stuff that we do not have anymore

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.400
 as standard in our homes. So cool. You know what I would have done if I was the advertising

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.840
 executive for that? I would have had him with a weapon, which fired bolts of electricity that

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.880
 turned things electric. So they'd be like an old kettle, and he'd get his weapon and fire some

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.040
 electricity at it, and it would turn into an electric kettle. And he would be called Ronald

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:05.280
 Reagan. That is good. There's a career in marketing and advertising opening out before us,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.360
 and I like to see it. It's hard to see you go, but you're going on.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:16.720
 Can imagine you guys sending me off a one-way ticket to Saatchi and Saatchi,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.640
 and then me arriving at the front door and them going, "Sorry, we don't know what you're on about."

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.840
 We've just given you a big piece of slate with Ronald Reagan written on the front of it.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:32.160
 Speaking of electric and laundry, you can now get a smart clothes peg,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.960
 which is pretty exciting. Oh, that is exciting. Yeah.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.480
 What's it do? It detects UV light and humidity and temperature,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.960
 and then it tells you when it's going to rain. And it also takes you-

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.600
 Is it just one, or do you need to put it on each of your different-

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.200
 I can't imagine that you'd need to buy 100. 40 pegs yelling at you, "Ah, it's going to rain!"

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.440
 I don't think, yeah, because it texts you when the clothes are dry. So if you've got 150 of these,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.080
 I think you get 150 texts saying it clothes the dry. Yeah, because if one of your clothes is dry,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.960
 there's a decent chance the rest of them are at least nearly dry.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.040
 Exactly. Unless your garden is so big or your laundry is so extensive.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.120
 That's really cool. I wonder if hackers could get into those smart,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.160
 because usually when you have a smart thing, the hackers can get into it.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.800
 Well, and find out what kind of nickers you wear.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.120
 Wear, you know, the internet. That's the kind of thing the internet's into, isn't it?

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.560
 I've read. Are you all right?

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.040
 But I think some clothes do take much longer to dry than others,

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.000
 so I think you would need one for each item. Oh, gosh, Hannah.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.920
 Surely you just put the smart peg on the thing that takes longest to dry.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.640
 Oh, God, I've wasted so much money on a thousand smart things.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.720
 Do you, when you're doing the laundry and you put stuff outside,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.640
 you just go out and you take one thing. Oh, this is dry. I'll take this then.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.400
 Every five minutes. I'm not going to the garden.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.120
 You know, washing detergent can be quite dangerous in war.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.240
 So the army actually has a list of banned detergents that they're not allowed to use,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.800
 because they contain optical brightness. So imagine you wash, you was saying,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.080
 but if you use Dazz and your clothes are white or the white, you're going to be spotted in.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:12.720
 No, this is, this is all to do with sort of, you know, infrared and so on.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.600
 You know, if you have optical brightness in it, it'll go slightly fluorescent,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.680
 your clothing, and that can be picked up by night vision goggles and so on.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.760
 So they have a very strict list of what you're allowed to wash your clothes in.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.280
 Wow. So funny.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.600
 But that is another idea for James to take to Sachi and Sachi, I think, for the next Dazz ad.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.520
 I think so bright that you will die in all situations.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.480
 Oh, yeah. So the ad is just one, there's like 50 of them,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.480
 and they all get gunned down except for the one guy who then holds up a Dazz box.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.080
 It says, don't get shot.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.080
 He's the one who does get shot.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.200
 Oh, the Dazz guy is dead.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.880
 Dazz man's dead.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.840
 What you actually need is loads of, like people in a battle, loads of different sides,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.520
 and then they all want to give up. And so they all get a white flag,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.960
 but nine of them are really dirty white flags because they don't use Dazz,

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.320
 but then one person has used Dazz and they have a really shiny white flag,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.520
 and they're the ones that survive.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.880
 That is good.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.720
 Is the white flag means I surrender?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.360
 I surrender.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.000
 Is a dirty flag mean fuck you? What are you going to do?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.160
 What are you going to do?

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.280
 Clear signal.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.920
 I don't deserve clemency because I have no hygiene.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.240
 I've used this flag so many times, it's dirty.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:33.440
 I don't think Dazz have advertised on British TV for some years now,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.560
 but if they've been saving up in their war chest for the next big campaign, this is it.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.320
 This is the thing.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.320
 I can't believe this fact that I'm about to say,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.680
 but Queen Victoria had a special train for her laundry.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:56.880
 So there used to be a royal laundry in Richmond in London,

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.800
 or did one and a half tons of laundry a day, so not all hers.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.160
 It was, you know, Paris.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.160
 She was large by the end of her life though.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.000
 It's true, but she wore a lot of layers.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:08.640
 Yeah.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.360
 But basically wherever she was, apart from if she was in Scotland,

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.080
 which would have been insane for the laundry to come down from there.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.760
 But even if she was on the Isle of Wight, or if she was at Windsor,

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.560
 or her London Palace, Buckingham Palace, I guess,

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.920
 the railway handed over all these items.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.320
 And I've seen sources saying, and this is the thing I really can't believe,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.560
 that it was a special miniature train, which took her laundry.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.560
 She would have had to build a special railway line,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.000
 like a special narrow gauge railway line for a miniature train with her pants.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.760
 And I cannot believe that.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.680
 She should have just got a washing machine in both of her palaces.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.480
 She wouldn't have to keep shipping it back.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.520
 All right, Ronald Reagan.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.160
 There was, speaking of railways,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.920
 we as a group have discussed the Underground Railroad before a few times,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.680
 but it's never been on this, I don't think.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.440
 And that was the idea that you would take enslaved people from the South America,

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.960
 and you would sneak them out of places where slavery was legal,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.120
 and you would get them to places where they were safe.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.160
 And there is a theory, or there's a story that you'll see a lot online,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.240
 that people got messages through quilts on the Underground Railroad.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:25.360
 And that is that you would put quilts on washing lines all the way along,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.240
 and then you would see it.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.920
 And if it had like a zigzag pattern,

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.760
 you'd know that this was a safe way to go.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.280
 And if it had like a striped pattern,

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.920
 it'd be like, we'll turn left here and stuff like that.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.480
 And this story is all over the internet,

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.720
 but according to National Geographic,

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.000
 quilt historians and Underground Railroad experts

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.080
 have questioned the study's methodology of the original study.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.360
 And apparently it was invented by a woman called Azala McDaniel-Williams,

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.280
 who was a quilt salesperson in the 1990s,

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.040
 and wrote a book about quilts.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.120
 And she came up with this idea that this happened in the Underground Railroad.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.360
 And it's not, it does make sense that you can send,

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.400
 there are examples of people sending messages using washing lines

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.960
 that happen in the American Civil War, I think.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.080
 But this particular thing, I think, possibly not true.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:12.800
 That's a shame.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.600
 It's a bit, it's a, it's someone trying to

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.680
 make the quilt a bigger part of world history.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.320
 I think so.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.240
 It's probably against inequality than it really is.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.320
 It's a bit like, what was that mosquito expert that then had wine something?

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.680
 Timothy C. Weingard.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.680
 Yeah, she is like the Timothy C. Weingard of quilts.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.200
 Oh, I love that man.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.720
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.920
 And that is my fact.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.800
 My fact this week is that Canadian engineers are part of a secret order

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.800
 designed by Rudyard Kipling.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:55.680
 This is, this is called the ritual of the calling of an engineer.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:02.320
 And it is a secret ritual that most, not all, but most are asked to take part in

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.120
 once they're sort of graduating to be officially a professional engineer.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.760
 And this little ritual started in the early 1900s.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:17.040
 And the people who set it up wanted a really good thing to read out at the ceremony.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.560
 And they couldn't do it on their own.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.200
 So in 1922, they approached Rudyard Kipling,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.640
 author of the Jungle Book, and they asked him to write this thing.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.880
 And it's still going on to this day.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:32.080
 You can still see, and this is how you know if a Canadian engineer is part of this secret order,

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.600
 look at the pinky finger.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.520
 And if there's an iron ring on it, they are part of this secret sect.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.440
 And there's not too much that we know about it, by the way.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.520
 It is genuinely, they have the ceremony.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.720
 No friends are allowed to come.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.000
 No partners are allowed to come.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.600
 And only a few people have spoken about it publicly

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.080
 telling us what goes on at these ceremonies.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.360
 And it all sounds really tame, not dark at all, like really boring.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.040
 I don't know why they don't just tell us about it.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.360
 Maybe, Dan, the people who came out, like the one or two people who've told you about it and said,

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.040
 "Oh, yeah, it's really tame."

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.960
 I mean, that's what they want you to think, isn't it?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.600
 Exactly.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.000
 Yeah.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.800
 Very true.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.600
 Very true.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.120
 There's a very dangerous cabal going on in Canada.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.920
 We need to break it open.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.000
 It's amazing that they just got the most famous writer in the world at the time,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 as he was, to do this for them.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.120
 They're so powerful, aren't they, these Canadian engineers.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.720
 It's like, not surprising.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.000
 They probably could have got anyone.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.720
 Really?

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.080
 Yeah, you're right.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:31.840
 My very good friend is an engineer and she worked in Canada for a year last year, a year before last.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.920
 And so I messaged her about this and she finds it pretty gross.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.880
 So she's like, it's kind of disgusting because you go into the office

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.600
 and everyone else has this weird ring on their pinky.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.480
 And she also seemed to have an issue with the fact that

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.360
 kind of anyone can get it according to her.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.320
 So you don't actually have to be chartered.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.560
 You only have to have graduated from university.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.760
 In the UK, you don't get anything to your chartered, much longer process.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.560
 And then you get an A3 certificate, not the same.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.000
 So it's kind of like piece of piss.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.080
 She was like, any engineers can get it, by the way,

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.000
 even the ones who design air conditioning units.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.840
 Well, Anna, it sounds like your friend is simultaneously very angry this exists

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.760
 and very angry she's not part of the club.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.800
 So she has a certificate.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.080
 I don't know what else she needs.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.880
 But yeah, as you say, Andy, he was a really popular writer in that time.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.760
 So it is bizarre that he was writing for them.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.640
 Yeah.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.520
 I think I had someone said, I think he was probably the richest

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.240
 classic author that Britain's ever had.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.520
 He was so bloody successful.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.800
 He bought himself a mansion with his proceeds.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.600
 There was one single story which ended up earning 31.5 million pounds.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.080
 No, hang on.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.800
 Wow. Rich and Asma, eat your heart out.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.400
 That is.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.760
 And that's a short story.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.880
 That's what he wrote in those days.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.400
 That can't be in the money of the time,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.880
 because you would have been able to buy the entire country with that.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.320
 Sorry, it's the equivalent of 31.5 million, 250,000 pounds.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.600
 Which story?

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.120
 Well, it's a slight sheet.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.640
 It's called The Absent-Minded Beggar.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.720
 And it was the Daily Mail was running a charity fundraising thing

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.280
 as part of an appeal to give money to soldiers in the ball.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.520
 And this is 1899.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.960
 And Kipling wrote this poem, sent it to them and said,

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.920
 "Use this as you see fit to raise as much money as you can."

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.680
 And so they did.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.720
 And all the proceeds that were raised from it went to the war effort.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.160
 But it really took off.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.200
 It was a sensation.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.960
 So it was a music hall.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.720
 Anthem, Arthur Sullivan of Gilbert and Sullivan put music to it.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.960
 And people bloody loved it.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.360
 Cool.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.080
 Yeah.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.760
 He did a lot of that kind of writing with a slight element

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.920
 of influencing public opinion behind it.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.120
 As in he was a campaigner.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.640
 He seemed to dislike a lot of things and a lot of people.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:53.600
 So he is viewed variously as either a really, these days,

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.600
 extremely old fashioned, jingoistic, imperialist, colonialist, racist,

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.640
 lots and lots of heavy criticism.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.000
 Kind of kicked off by George Orwell,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.160
 who pointed out that people have been hating Kipling.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.480
 Pretty much since he was writing, since he was really popular,

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.520
 lots of people have really disliked Fredrick Kipling.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.480
 But then again, he also has written these fabulous books,

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.960
 which are very observant about human nature and all this stuff.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.640
 So it kind of keeps the reputation going.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.720
 But one of the things that he wrote was the phrase known unto God,

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.200
 which went on gravestones of unidentified servicemen after the war ended.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.520
 And he lost his only son in the First World War.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.440
 And he was on the Imperial War Graves Commission.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.560
 He played a big role in that.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.400
 And that was the phrase that he thought was most fitting.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.760
 He was always arguing that rich families

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.680
 shouldn't be able to erect loads of statues to their own children,

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.640
 because he thought that everyone who died in the war

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.360
 really should have an equal remembrance.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.280
 And that was a huge thing.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.040
 There was a family called the Sessles,

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.160
 who were one of the richest families in the whole of Britain.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.760
 And he really stood up against them,

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.080
 because they wanted to do these statues.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.080
 And he was like, "No, everyone should have the same."

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.920
 Oh, that's interesting.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.000
 But yeah, he was a massive racist.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.480
 So that's another thing.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.040
 I mean, he really, he was a white supremacist.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.240
 So yeah.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.400
 He's such an interesting character.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.520
 So his first language is Hindi, born in India,

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.760
 cause like first years in India.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.400
 And said apparently he wasn't very good at English when he learned it,

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.880
 because they learned it in translation from Hindi.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.480
 So you'd learn it in like a really stilted sing song way.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.280
 And he said that when he came to Britain,

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.440
 so he came to Britain when he was about six

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.800
 and was sent away by his parents.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.120
 And then he returned to India when he was 17.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.760
 And he wrote that when he returned,

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.160
 he found himself speaking in vernacular sentences,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.920
 whose meaning I knew not.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.680
 He just found words coming out of his mouth

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.440
 that he remembered from his childhood,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.400
 not even knowing what he was saying, apparently, bizarre.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.280
 Yeah.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.080
 He came up with the phrase "the oldest profession"

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.200
 to mean prostitution.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.120
 So lots of people said, "Oh, that's the oldest profession."

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.400
 But before Kipling,

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.920
 they were talking about lots of different professions.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.440
 So there was, you know, tailors were described as the oldest profession.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.040
 That's probably the first time anyone said,

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.000
 "This is the oldest profession."

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.520
 So that's the oldest, oldest profession.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.240
 Murderers were claimed as being the oldest profession,

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.760
 arguably not a profession, but still.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.160
 And there was this weird crossover period

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.560
 where lots of people were still quite innocent of the phrase.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.960
 So, but we're using it and then other people would think,

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.720
 "Oh, I'm not sure that's what you mean."

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.640
 So graduating cadets might be told,

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.360
 "You are now entering the oldest profession in the world."

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.000
 And not, you know, the old buffer who was doing a ceremony

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.280
 might not realize what he was saying.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.720
 That was a bit...

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.800
 Apparently, he coined a few other terms and words.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.440
 So some of the words include "lunchless."

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.440
 Yeah, classic.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.600
 That describes someone who has no lunch.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.400
 Brilliant.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.680
 Just so you know.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.600
 Genius, wasn't it? Genius of coined words.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.400
 He was.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.920
 Apparently, he coined "writer."

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.360
 Apparently, that's his.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.600
 That's the first use of "writer."

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.800
 Oh, that's a biggie, actually.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.640
 It is for you, Andy,

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.360
 but most people don't use it quite as often as you do.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.000
 The sun rarely sets on a date

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.240
 when I have it said "writer" at least a few times.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.680
 "Squidgy" as well, and "stinky."

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.240
 Promise.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.720
 Did he too?

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.040
 Because I know he coined "squiggly" as well,

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.600
 and it seems like a cheat to coin "squidgy" and "squiggly."

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.440
 I don't know if you count one, if you've done the other.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.920
 Oh, that's very different words.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.080
 They, one of them, described something that's soft

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.880
 and the other one described something that goes in lots of directions.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.440
 Yeah.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.560
 That's a good point, actually.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.240
 You wouldn't say I've just enjoyed a lovely moist squiggly bit of sponge cake

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:30.640
 would you?

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.120
 No, you wouldn't say I've just drawn a squidgy line.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.920
 No.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.960
 But we all say "writer."

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:42.320
 He was so famous that towns named themselves after him.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.680
 So there were two towns in, I think, Michigan,

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.920
 which named themselves Rudyard and Kipling after him.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.160
 And there's a place in Saskatchewan called Kipling,

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.680
 and that is an interesting place for us

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.680
 because it's the town where a Canadian blogger called Kyle MacDonald

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.080
 traded his way from a paperclip up to a house.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.120
 Do you remember this guy?

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.480
 I do, yeah.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.120
 He started with a paperclip and traded it for loads and loads of things.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.280
 This was in about the early 2000s, and he ended up with a house in Kipling.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.920
 And the town now has, to commemorate it,

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.840
 with the world's largest paperclip.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.400
 They've got a 15-foot-old paperclip to commemorate that.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.440
 That's cool.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.160
 Well, of course, as we said before, he was named after a place,

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.240
 a place where his parents met Rudyard Lake.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.160
 Also quite an interesting place because that was a massive tourist attraction.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.400
 So that's a lake in Staffordshire.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.080
 And I discovered that, as well as being the reason that Rudyard's called Rudyard,

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.360
 it was also the place where the African blondin,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.080
 as he called himself, a guy called Carlos Trower,

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.480
 in 1864 walked a tightrope 100 feet up above the lake.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:44.880
 Wow.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.760
 And it sounds great.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.720
 And thousands of people used to go to this place every day, apparently.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.000
 So I think apparently 20,000 visitors a day

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.960
 would visit this tourist attraction at its peak.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.720
 And they watched him and he did it carrying an 11-year-old boy.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.760
 He did it backwards and forwards with his hands and feet shackled,

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.480
 which I've got no idea how you walk a tightrope like that.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.680
 And then at one point he was in the middle of the tightrope above the lake

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.400
 and then he went back to the edge, picked up a stove,

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.200
 brought it back to the middle and cooked himself ham and eggs.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.440
 Which I don't, I also don't know how you cook

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.360
 on a stove in the middle of a tightrope.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.280
 Isn't he the guy who he did Niagara Falls as well, isn't he?

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:21.920
 Blondin.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.120
 Blondin did Niagara Falls.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:23.760
 That was the Blondin, yeah, yeah.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.560
 He named himself.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.680
 What's this guy's name?

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.480
 Oh, great.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.560
 Okay, about, because Blondin also cooked in his walks as well, didn't he?

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.000
 So he's a total tribute act.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:32.160
 Yeah.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:32.800
 That's really cool.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.920
 He's a tribute act, but over a lake in Staffordshire,

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.440
 as opposed to over Niagara Falls, which I don't know,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.360
 I really like Staffordshire as a county,

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.920
 but I'm not sure it has quite the same gravitas.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.640
 It's not quite.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.720
 Yeah, but if you're a tribute band, you don't play the O2.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.040
 You play the poorly arms, you know?

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:51.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.000
 No, but there is another thing that happened at Lake Rudyard,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.400
 which is that Matthew Webb, who the first person to swim the English Channel,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.440
 he went to Lake Rudyard to host a grand aquatic fate

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.680
 where he recreated his channel swim.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.880
 Again, I have no idea how impressive that would have actually been,

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.480
 watching him to splash around in a lake for a bit.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.200
 I wonder what the difference is between recreating a swim across the channel

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.080
 and just swimming.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.960
 Like, how does he make it?

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.240
 Does he put, like, a cross-channel ferry next to him or what?

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.080
 You're absolutely right.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.760
 There's details that are frustratingly vague, because this was...

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.760
 You'd have to have people generate waves.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.160
 He probably had lots of people in there kicking and splashing,

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.360
 because it's very strong currents.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.800
 Put a few poos in there.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.360
 Put a few poos.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.160
 I'm sure they had, then, 20,000 visitors, Jay.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.520
 Some of those tourists are kids.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.160
 That's true.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.880
 Skippling often associated with swastikas,

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:52.720
 because he was very much into them, obviously growing up in India.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.240
 And they were a symbol of peace, et cetera,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.880
 until those dastardly Nazis got in on the act in the '30s.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.560
 But there was a guy in 1984 called Tom Driver who ran a bookshop.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.320
 And he wrote to the Kippling Journal,

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.080
 saying that whenever anyone comes into his shop,

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.120
 all they ask about is Kippling and the swastikas.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.920
 Because they had lots of old editions,

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.720
 and the old editions of Kippling all had the swastika on them,

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.200
 and then later editions didn't have them anymore, of course.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.840
 And he said, "We have recently kept a record,

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.040
 and we average once a day when a visitor asks us

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.440
 some question about Kippling and the swastika."

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.160
 That is insane.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.520
 "Usually at the back of it is a thought that Kippling was a Nazi."

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:40.560
 And he said that they always tell them that this is an old peace sign,

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.120
 and that's it.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.160
 And he said, "Yeah, but that's what basically every single day

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.120
 someone was coming in saying, 'Why are the swastikas on this?'"

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.000
 I've got a couple of pre-1933 Kipplings,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.520
 and they have the swastika on them.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.960
 "Yeah, well, I did my dissertation on Kippling."

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.920
 So, yeah.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.720
 Oh, wow.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.800
 Oh, you didn't let on.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.640
 That's sort of cheating, isn't it?

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.360
 Sorry, yeah.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.840
 Very much cheating in advance in preparation for this podcast.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.600
 It didn't take me any time.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.640
 Next week, we'll be doing scanning, tunneling microscopes,

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.800
 which was what my dissertation was on.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.400
 Good luck.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:23.280
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.120
 My fact is that when McDonald's launched the Filet-O-Fish sandwich,

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.680
 its main competition was the Hula Burger,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.200
 which was a slice of pineapple in a bun with cheese.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.000
 Yeah.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.400
 Yeah.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.200
 It was popular.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.440
 It was so unpopular.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.160
 Basically, there was a bit of Cincinnati,

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.560
 where 87% of the population were Catholic.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.560
 And as a result, didn't meet meat on Fridays.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:49.040
 And as a result, the Cincinnati McDonald's took zero money on Fridays,

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.760
 because they didn't have any alternatives to their burgers.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.560
 And the owner said, "Right, I have come up with an idea

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.400
 called the Filet-O-Fish sandwich.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.880
 It's going to revolutionise the way we trade on Fridays.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.840
 It's going to be great."

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.720
 And he really needed this,

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.920
 because he was a kind of franchise holder,

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.160
 so he needed the business to work money.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.680
 And Ray Crock, the founder, said, he said in quotes,

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.760
 "You're always coming up here with a bunch of crap."

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.280
 Didn't like the idea for the Filet-O-Fish.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.760
 He said, "My idea is much better.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.120
 The Hula Burger.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.520
 We'll take a slice of pineapple, we'll grill it,

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.040
 put some cheese on it, put it in a bun."

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.400
 Sportingly, Ray Crock didn't just steamroller the owner,

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.200
 who was called Lou Grun.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.560
 He said, "Look, we'll have a competition.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.240
 Good Friday, 1962.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.920
 Demand for meat going to be very, very low,

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.960
 because of all the Christians.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.160
 So we will stock both in certain stores on a given day,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.840
 and we will see who wins.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.400
 And the Filet-O-Fish sold 350,

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.840
 and the Hula Burger sold six."

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.040
 And so they went with the Filet-O-Fish.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.480
 And when did you say this was?

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.080
 This was '62.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.240
 So this was really the heyday of pineapple and cheese

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.600
 being a fashionable dish.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.640
 And even then.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.080
 Yeah, you're right.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.600
 The canapes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.560
 It just didn't work.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.880
 You've got to put it on a stick.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.000
 I mean, it sounds good to me.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.280
 Does it sound bad to you guys?

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.560
 I wouldn't mind it.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.080
 It doesn't sound filling, I think.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.680
 I think the problem is the slightly grainy texture

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.120
 of the bread with the smooth texture of the pineapple.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.000
 I'm really, one of my biggest fads is textures.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.680
 I really struggle with certain textures,

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.160
 and I think that would be the main problem, yeah.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.040
 Interesting.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.640
 That might be why you hate mushrooms so much,

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.520
 because they do have a very distinctive texture.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.080
 That is why meat jelly, stuff like that,

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.760
 I can't deal with that.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.080
 Oh, I didn't know that you didn't like meat jelly.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.440
 That's pies ruined for you.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.280
 It's basically all of Russian cuisine

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.320
 ruined for me as well.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.160
 It's like, yeah.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.680
 I think jelly should be sweet, personally.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.560
 And I think my McDonald's should be savory.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.800
 So you're on the filet-of-fish side.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.800
 I think I am, really, yeah.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.960
 Because I think, Dan, even though I agree with you, look,

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.600
 if someone put in front of me pineapple and cheese in a bun,

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.560
 I would eat it.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.920
 But if someone gave me the choice,

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.280
 I'd definitely go filet-of-fish.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.920
 Would you, do you think you'd choose the pineapple?

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.240
 No, no.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.240
 I'm just saying there's a lot of options on the menu,

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.320
 and it doesn't stick out as a weird McDonald's one for me.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.080
 It just might not be as popular

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.040
 as one of their biggest, most popular burgers.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.560
 Also, Catholics tend to eat fish on Fridays,

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.480
 as opposed to eating pineapples on Fridays.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.880
 So if it was for the Catholics.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.720
 Yeah, you're right.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.920
 I see that now.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.480
 Yeah.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.760
 You don't see Jesus having two pineapples and 12 loaves,

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.600
 do you, between the 5,000?

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.720
 He would have only fed the 200 if they'd had the choice.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.600
 But maybe that was a secret.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.680
 Maybe there was another messiah at the stall next to him.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:31.680
 Yeah.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.180
 Yeah.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.840
 Pineapple tie-up.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.680
 Oh, that's a cut scene from Life of Brian, surely.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.720
 But yeah, pineapples, they were massive, weren't they?

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.440
 Well, they were the same size as they are today,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.000
 or similar size, but they were really popular.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.040
 And it was because they were so difficult to grow,

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.320
 and so they just became really exclusive.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:54.640
 Yeah.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.600
 And you couldn't grow them here.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.240
 That was really hard to grow them here, wasn't it?

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.720
 So it was a sort of code that you were incredibly wealthy.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.920
 And so you can kind of date whole bits of British design

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.440
 and architecture to when they were built,

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.520
 because if it's got a pineapple on,

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.360
 it's probably from that time in the 18th century

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.960
 that everyone was obsessed with pineapples.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.240
 Gate posts and railings.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.040
 Yeah.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.040
 But all of this stuff, by the way,

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.760
 I just want to give a shout-out to Fran Bowman's book,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.080
 which is called The Pineapple King of Fruits,

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.240
 which is possibly my favorite book on a single,

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.280
 tiny, weird subject that I've ever read in my entire life.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.720
 So people should definitely read it.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.000
 But she basically says that once you learn

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.520
 how amazingly popular pineapples were for this short time,

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.760
 wherever you go, you'll start seeing pineapples,

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.400
 because like Candy says, they're absolutely everywhere.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:44.640
 Yeah.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.360
 It's really sad.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.280
 And I can't believe we've never said before,

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.800
 but people used to rent them.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.920
 So if you couldn't afford them, which a lot of people couldn't.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.000
 So there was, again, it was a brief time.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 I think it was the start of the 18th century.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.840
 They would cost sort of £10,000 in today's money,

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.800
 as much as a carriage.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.920
 So you'd rent one for a night,

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.920
 and you'd carry it around like a bag,

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.880
 or you'd put it on your table if you're hosting a dinner party.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.760
 And I think it was Fran Bowman who pointed out,

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.120
 it was terrifying if you were the servant

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.880
 who had to transport the pineapple around,

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.120
 because that's the equivalent of carrying a briefcase

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.480
 stuffed with banknotes.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.120
 Yeah.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.000
 But who's going to know that you've got a pineapple under your cloak?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.720
 It's not, you wouldn't just randomly mug someone

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.920
 in the hope that they'd have a pineapple.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.280
 That's jackpot for the mugger.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.440
 Didn't the rich used to hire people to sleep with their pineapples?

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.440
 Was that a thing, am I making that up?

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.400
 Yeah, they used to protect their pineapples at night.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.560
 Yeah, from any poachers or any animals.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.560
 Yeah, exactly, if you were growing them.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.760
 What do you say am I making that up?

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.920
 Have you read that somewhere?

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.280
 We don't know if you're making it up.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.160
 Well, I read Fran Bowman's book years and years ago,

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.520
 and it's a memory from that, James, just bringing that up.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.360
 I know Charles II used to sleep with a pineapple.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.440
 He'd sleep with anything, though.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.400
 He'd sleep with anything.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.760
 He'd sleep with a pineapple.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:04.560
 Yeah, well, you know his mistress, Barbara Villiers.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.400
 He called her my sweet pineapple.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.840
 Okay, okay.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.760
 So, yeah, he slept with a pineapple.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.440
 Barbara Villiers, amazing, isn't she?

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.880
 She kind of became the king's favourite mistress,

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.400
 and then after the king died,

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.080
 she just went completely off the rails.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.080
 And at one stage, the absolute worst thing that she did

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.200
 was biting the penis off a recently exhumed bishop.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.880
 I think as far as going off the rails is concerned,

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.680
 I mean, Pete Dockers, he's got a lot to learn, hasn't he?

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.480
 What if he'd run out of pineapple?

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.320
 Charles II, he also commissioned a painting of himself

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.400
 being given a pineapple by his gardener.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.240
 That's how much he loved pineapples.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.400
 And it was kind of to prove a point.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.000
 So, he ordered a pineapple because the French ambassador was there,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.720
 and Barbados was an English colony at the time,

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.080
 and they were arguing over who got to own the nearby island of St Kitt's,

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.760
 and he was basically asserting primacy,

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.680
 because you could grow pineapples in Barbados,

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.640
 and he was saying, "Look, we can do this with our pineapples here,

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.360
 so it makes sense that we should have this neighbouring bit of land as well."

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.400
 And I think that was why he commissioned a painting of himself

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.480
 just getting a pineapple off his gardener.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.680
 Wow, it was a little bit of an art-pureaus.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.400
 I was thinking how awful it must have been

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.720
 when the very first king received pineapple,

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.320
 that was King Ferdinand.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.440
 So, pineapple was brought to Europe after Columbus's voyages,

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.560
 the late 15th century, and King Ferdinand of Spain

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.680
 was the first person to eat one,

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.800
 and he said the flavour exceeds all other fruit,

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.920
 but it was the only one that survived the trip.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.840
 And so, imagine how awful that is.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.360
 You know, when you run out of something delicious,

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.120
 and you have to go back to the shop,

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.920
 it's the most delicious thing you've ever tasted in your life,

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.560
 and that's it.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.280
 Because they all, like, he did have loads of them,

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.640
 but they all just ended up squishy and rotten, didn't they?

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.920
 Apart from one of them,

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.480
 which makes me think that perhaps the one

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.520
 probably wasn't in the absolute best condition.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.560
 If all the others have got,

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.600
 it's a bit like they're washing on your line going dry.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.640
 If all the others are rotten,

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.400
 then that one's probably a bit rotten as well.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.320
 All the others went squidgy,

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.320
 but this one happened to go squiggly.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.360
 This is weird.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.040
 You two are typo.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.880
 Have you guys ever been on a cruise?

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.520
 Yep.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.320
 No.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.040
 Okay, so James, you're the only one who's been on a cruise.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.000
 When you were on the cruise,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.720
 did you ever see on anyone else's door

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.480
 a sticker with a pineapple on it?

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.760
 No, I didn't go on a very high-class cruise,

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.800
 it has to be said.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.360
 Oh, that's fine,

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.640
 because this doesn't apply on high-class cruise.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.520
 Oh, God.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.000
 This is the...

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.400
 There is a myth among the cruising community

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.760
 that this indicates,

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.600
 or if someone has a pineapple magnet or whatever,

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.640
 or something like that,

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.000
 that they are swingers

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.600
 and they are interested in having a good time.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.120
 Is that right?

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.440
 But, well, I don't know.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.960
 Because when I went on the cruise,

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.720
 the whole time I was sat on the deck

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.800
 reading Fran Bowman's book about pineapples.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.320
 So God knows what they all thought of me.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.920
 Yeah, the thing is, the system is a poor one,

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.680
 because obviously, I mean, assuming it,

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.720
 this is not complete bollocks,

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.600
 which it may well be.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.520
 But you would only see a few doors, don't you?

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.480
 Because you normally, you know,

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.440
 you have your corridor,

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.720
 and then you go up to the...

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.080
 Yeah, but if you're a swinger,

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.840
 you probably check in a few more doors

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.600
 than the average person, aren't you?

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.000
 That's a good point.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:14.880
 I think so.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.200
 Yeah.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.480
 You walk up a couple of corridors.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.080
 You don't know who's behind the door, either.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.680
 I mean, the worst thing would be,

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.960
 if you've got the sticker on your door,

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.720
 and someone knocks on the door, you open it,

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.360
 and they say, "Oh, sorry, I think I've got the wrong."

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.280
 Sorry, nothing, never mind.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.520
 You probably dress as like a...

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.360
 I was going to say cabin boy,

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.440
 but more like a waiter or something.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.800
 And so you have that out.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.480
 Like, if they knock on the door,

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.400
 and you don't fancy them, you can say,

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:44.480
 "Oh, sorry, I just come to collect your room service."

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:44.880
 That's good.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.600
 I think that's the best possible solution,

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.480
 but that feels like a long...

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.600
 Now, you've got to pack your cabin boy outfit

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.960
 when you're going on a cruise.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.560
 I just think so many things have to come together

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.760
 at once to make this work,

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.200
 that I can't believe it's ever happened

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.880
 in the history of the universe.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.640
 It's like, you have to be...

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.840
 There have to be other swingers on the boat.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.200
 You have to be on the right corridor.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.120
 You have to know about the pineapple rule,

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.040
 and they have to be attractive enough for you to accept.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.040
 If anyone's listening,

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.520
 if you've ever had a successful pineapple-based cruise experience,

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.200
 we want to hear about it.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.960
 Yeah.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.760
 Hey, I was looking into other ways

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.640
 of presenting pineapple for meals,

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.200
 and I came across a dessert I've never heard of before.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.960
 Have you guys heard of candle salad?

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.720
 Have you ever had a candle salad?

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.840
 No, I haven't.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.600
 I'm part of the electric generation,

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.840
 so I just plug my salad in at the wall.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.560
 So, candle salad, it's a fruit salad,

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.360
 although you do have lettuce in it as well as the base,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.680
 but the idea is you take a ring of pineapple,

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:49.040
 and you place through the ring of pineapple at the base a banana,

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.920
 a peeled banana, so it sits up through...

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.560
 I can see why the swingers would like this kind of thing.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.840
 It has a red cherry on the top,

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.680
 and then, and by the way,

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.200
 this supposedly is for children.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.320
 This is a great way to get kids to eat fruit.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.680
 It's got this cherry on the top.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.240
 It's a banana sticking up through the pineapple,

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:13.200
 and you use either mayonnaise on it or cottage cheese.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.840
 I swear to God, you do not put mayonnaise on it.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.760
 It's always good having you on for a day.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.200
 I swear to God, you put it on,

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.000
 and you put it right at the tip of the banana.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.800
 What are you talking about?

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.400
 It's a kid's food,

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.440
 and it looks like probably erect penis.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.000
 That's just orgasm.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.440
 Stop feeding this to your children.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.000
 Yeah.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.040
 Come on, Dan, which soft play area have you been to

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.960
 where they give you this halfway through?

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.720
 Dan is no longer allowed to go to any soft play areas.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.840
 Where are you getting it from?

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.280
 I never saw this in my childhood, put it this way,

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.720
 and I was a Catholic.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:55.200
 It was big in the 1920s in America,

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.920
 and it still is around,

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.000
 and if you Google it, there's plenty of pictures.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.440
 People love popping their pictures up

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.720
 to show you how their candle salad looks,

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.800
 and it has a full-on Wikipedia article telling about its history.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.240
 It's a real thing.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.160
 Everything's got a Wikipedia article, mate.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.520
 There's always some nut job out there

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.120
 willing to find a Wikipedia article.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.880
 How do you balance a cherry on a banana?

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.840
 With clotted cream or whatever it was.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.800
 Yeah, with mayonnaise.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.520
 With mayonnaise.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.560
 James, mayonnaise.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:24.880
 Sorry.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.000
 That's the implausible bit.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.800
 I was just trying to think of anything, Seemony.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.240
 I couldn't remember what it was.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.480
 Cottage cheese makes a lot of sense.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.400
 Cottage cheese famously goes with pineapple.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.000
 Mayonnaise, like I say, it's top video to your kids.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:45.920
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.600
 and that is James.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.800
 Okay, my fact this week

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.800
 is that there is a professional footballer called Naughty Naughty.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.400
 He has never been sent off.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:00.720
 I mean, the headline that could have been Naughty Naughty Naughty.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.560
 Might still be because he's very young.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.640
 Well, he is young compared to me.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.400
 He was born in 1994.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.760
 How old does that make?

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.480
 Yeah, he's pretty young.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.120
 He's young.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:15.040
 So, basically, this guy,

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.960
 I known about him for a little while.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.520
 He was played for Chelsea as a youth player,

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.160
 and then he's played for a few non-league teams

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.680
 like Charlie and Dover.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.600
 But recently he's gone to play for Queen of the South in Scotland,

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.920
 and last week he scored against Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.200
 And I was watching Gillette Soccer Saturday with Jeff Stelling,

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.600
 and Jeff Stelling said that this guy called Naughty Naughty

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.720
 had never been sent off.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.200
 And I checked, and as far as I can see, it's true.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.240
 And, you know, we get a lot of our facts from books

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.320
 or from scientific papers or stuff like this,

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.480
 and I just thought, why can't you get facts

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.880
 from Gillette Soccer Saturday on Sky Sports?

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.400
 Quite right.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.720
 Facts you can find facts anywhere, can't you?

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.320
 I've always said there should be an opposite of normative determinism.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.520
 I reckon I've said this in the podcast,

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.040
 and if he's not evidence of that,

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.320
 then I don't know what is.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:05.200
 Yeah.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.160
 So on football was being sent off.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:08.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.400
 So I thought Naughty Naughty never has been.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.080
 There have been some wonderful soundings off

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.200
 in the history of English football.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:13.920
 My God.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:19.920
 So the earliest ever sending off was a Sunday League match in 2000,

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.640
 and it was between Cross Farm Park Celtic

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.040
 and Taunton East Reach Wanderers, right?

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.200
 The referee blew his whistle at the start of the match,

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.120
 very close to a player called Lee Todd,

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.680
 who was a part-time bricklayer who had his back turned.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.440
 The referee blew his whistle very, very loud.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.160
 Todd exclaimed, "Fuck me, that was loud."

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.640
 The referee stopped the game two seconds in

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.240
 and sent him off for abusive language.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.120
 And it's just a glorious story.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.120
 Like, there are so many crunchy details about it.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.040
 Like, he was also banned for 35 days and fined £27.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.240
 Twenty-seven.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:50.720
 Really?

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.760
 £27.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.280
 But then in the meeting about that,

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.880
 he went, "Fuck me, that's not very much."

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.360
 Another 35 days, mate.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:01.920
 And he was tracked down 20 years after this match.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.240
 Last year, he was tracked down by the website SportBible,

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.280
 and he's still slightly annoyed about it.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.960
 He said, "Fuck me. I mean, if anything,

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.320
 he was wearing it himself."

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.360
 True. Yeah, yeah.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.080
 Unless it could, like, maybe the referee took it as a request.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.000
 He did have a pineapple stick on the back of his shirt.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.240
 Do you know what the record for being booked

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.440
 with a yellow card is?

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.560
 How quickly that was done.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:29.360
 It was three seconds, and that was Vinnie Jones,

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.160
 who most people globally will know as an actor,

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.080
 but used to be a professional footballer.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.680
 Yeah, he was booked after three seconds,

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.520
 and he beat the previous record for a yellow card by two seconds.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.320
 So it was a five-second was the previous record,

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.240
 and that was held by Vinnie Jones.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.320
 They smashed his own record.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.920
 Yeah, the red card was invented by referee Ken Aston

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.400
 after the 1966 World Cup.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.680
 You could be sent off before then,

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.200
 but they didn't have card system,

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.520
 because what happened was,

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.240
 in the quarter-final of the World Cup,

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.960
 which was between England and, I think, Argentina,

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.840
 it said in the newspapers the next day

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.480
 that both of the Charlton brothers had been booked,

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.240
 but they didn't remember it happening.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:14.240
 And so England went to FIFA and said,

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.000
 "It says in the newspapers that we've been booked,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.920
 but we have no idea what happened."

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.400
 And it turned out they had been and they hadn't noticed.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.520
 But then Ken Aston, having seen this happen,

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.240
 thought, "Well, we need a more obvious symbol

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.600
 of someone being sent off."

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.640
 And apparently he was driving down Kensington High Street,

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.320
 and he saw a traffic light,

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.640
 and the yellow, he thought, meant, "Take it easy,

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.080
 and the red is to stop."

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.920
 And so he thought, "Well, that's a good idea.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.120
 Let's have yellow and red cards."

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.360
 So I guess the traffic lights aren't yellow,

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.240
 they're amber, are they?

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.160
 So they should be amber and red cards, maybe.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.320
 But it's literally a light bulb moment,

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.840
 because what do you have in traffic lights?

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.800
 You have light bulbs.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:51.920
 It's light bulbs.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.520
 But it's also an extremely obvious theft to us now,

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.320
 as in it's so obvious that, I don't know.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.400
 What do you mean to get red and yellow and green?

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.680
 Well, I heard about that, Ken Aston.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.280
 You should be given, everyone should be given

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.880
 a green card at the start of the match.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.000
 That would be a really nice card.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:08.640
 Put them into America.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:13.120
 That was before the 1994 World Cup in America.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.320
 They all had to have a green card.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:19.120
 In the match with the most ever red cards given,

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.400
 only one person was sent off.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.160
 Oh, really? Why?

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.360
 Riddle me.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.320
 That? This was quite…

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.240
 And it's a good corner, his opening business.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:33.360
 It was Valentine's Day, and they all got a load of red cards,

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.200
 which said, "Happy Valentine's Day" on them.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.080
 That's such a good answer, James.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.760
 And I'm going to give you a bonus point for that,

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.960
 but it's not correct.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:44.800
 36 people got red cards, but it was in 2011.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.400
 And it's vaguely famous.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.800
 The referee was this guy called Damian Rubino.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.040
 And one player was sent off in the first half,

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.640
 because he just got two yellows.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.080
 And he returned in the second half to stand in the crowd

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.720
 in his home clothes and cheer the teams on.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.800
 And then at the end of the match,

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.560
 this guy had been sent off in the first half,

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.760
 came onto the pitch,

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.000
 and just punched one of the opposition players in the face

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.240
 for reasons unknown to anyone.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.600
 But there's a huge brawl start.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.880
 So everyone chased him.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.320
 He fled to the locker room.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.000
 Everyone's favourite place to be.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 And then there was a big fight in there,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.240
 and then they came back out into the pitch, big fight there.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.920
 And eventually the referees gave red cards to everyone on both teams,

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.120
 plus all subs, plus a coach or two as well.

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.680
 But he was into, he's been interviewed this ref,

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.960
 and he was like, "I've got no idea why this guy

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.320
 just jumped out of the stands when he punched someone in the face."

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.600
 And years later, he bumped into him at another match.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.400
 And the guy said, "Sorry about that incident.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.960
 We actually had some personal beef off the pitch."

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.320
 I don't know what to talk about, but yeah.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.400
 We never know what it was.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.240
 We'll never know.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.280
 We can only speculate.

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.880
 Yeah. A woman has got to be about a four.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.120
 The first woman to ever be sent off an official football match

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.960
 for fighting was called Lily Parr.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.960
 She is very famous.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.400
 She played for the Dick Kerr ladies,

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.080
 who are some factory workers from Preston,

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.600
 who we might have mentioned before, actually.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.880
 Yeah, we must have.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.120
 Probably the most successful women's team of all time.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.400
 Anyway, she had a shot that was so hard,

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.280
 she once broke the arm of a professional male goalkeeper.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.160
 That's how good she was.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.280
 She scored more than a thousand goals during her career,

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.880
 more than a thousand goals, 34 of which were in her first season

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.720
 when she was only 14 years old.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.480
 Oh, wow.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.920
 How good does she sound?

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.720
 What a prodigy.

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.640
 They did used to play with bowling balls back then.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.200
 So much easier to break an arm.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.040
 Is Nanny a famous player?

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.000
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.360
 Played for United.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.600
 Luis de Cunha is his name,

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.840
 and Nanny's name is Played for United, as James says.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.040
 In 2013, he was sent off in a match against Real Madrid,

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.440
 and watching at home, one of the United fans was so outraged

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.840
 and enraged by this that he phoned the police.

00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:58.960
 He called 999.

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:05.040
 And he was the young lad, I think he called.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.040
 He was just so angry about this setting off.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.800
 He thought a crime has been committed.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.280
 And then the police turned up and the car was going,

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.720
 "Nanny, Nanny, Nanny."

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:17.600
 If he didn't get a red for time wasting, then that's…

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.880
 He apologized later on.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.880
 He said it was bad judgment to phoned the old bill.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:28.640
 I found a naughty manager, naughty football manager.

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.440
 Someone very famous, Jose Mourinho.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.680
 So Jose Mourinho was given a two-match band once,

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.840
 and he found that horrible because he wasn't able to consult

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.400
 with his team in the locker rooms.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.480
 So he snuck in, and he managed to give his team a big talk.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.600
 But then the problem was he got in there early, so he wasn't seen.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.000
 But by the time he'd finished with his team,

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.400
 the whole place was crowded with UEFA people,

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.240
 and he needed to somehow get out.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:01.200
 So they popped a kit man, popped Jose Mourinho in a laundry basket.

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.120
 No.

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.600
 And wheeled him out.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.280
 So he left the lid bit of it open so that he was fine.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.080
 He could breathe.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.960
 But suddenly, when they were in the corridors,

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.040
 they could hear UEFA people, and he got really nervous.

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.320
 The kit guy got really nervous.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.200
 So he slammed the lid down on top of the laundry basket.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.440
 Problem is, Mourinho is claustrophobic and freaked out inside.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.440
 And he thought he was dying, and he was just thrashing about.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.160
 And eventually, when they got out, they opened it,

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.040
 and he was like, and came out, and it was a big scene for him.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.400
 Yeah.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.080
 The problem was he ended up on the Isle of Wight in Queen Victoria.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.280
 Well, who the hell are you?

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.600
 Such a good story.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.600
 Wow. Did you also have that as research for the laundry section?

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.320
 I did. Yeah.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.200
 Yeah.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.640
 Yeah. You've got to double that up.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.520
 James and Anna, I think it's fair to say that you're the two

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.800
 of this podcasting team who are more interested in football.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.080
 Yeah.

00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.200
 If we're ranking.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.840
 Well, Anna's a Newcastle fan, but you know, not far.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.840
 Yeah. You can't really call it football now.

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.400
 That kind of bit.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.040
 That's from a tram there found over there.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.040
 OK. Well, I'm going to look up all these references later.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:09.840
 So thanks for those.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.080
 But are you guys familiar with the idea that it's harder

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.800
 to play against 10 men than 11?

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.000
 Is this the thing that people say?

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.440
 People say it. Usually you're expected to win against 10 men

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.800
 because they have one fewer player, but a lot of teams do struggle.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.360
 Interesting.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:25.840
 OK.

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.760
 I've never run. Is it the psychology of it?

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.280
 Well, it's either that or this is just from what I've read.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.040
 It's that a team with 10 players retreats,

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.680
 and so they're going to be guarding the ball very carefully and all of this.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.320
 But anyway, it's been studied and it's absolutely nonsense.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:42.080
 It's much easier to win more points and more goals against 10 men

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.520
 than it is against 11.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.040
 The stats. That's what the stats say.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.320
 Thanks for the sense.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:46.960
 Yeah.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.880
 It's pretty hard to play against 15 men.

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:54.320
 This was a problem that Arsenal had in a game against Dynamo Moscow in 1945.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.280
 It was a friendly game, so not too bad.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.760
 But it was played in extremely heavy fog

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.480
 so that no one could really see what was happening on the pitch.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:07.440
 And at one stage, the Moscow Dynamo played made a substitution,

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.960
 but they didn't take a player off.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.840
 They just brought someone on, but no one noticed.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.360
 The fans who are watching reckon that one stage,

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.600
 they had 15 players on the pitch at one stage.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.480
 Arsenal had a player set off,

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:24.320
 and the player snuck back onto the pitch for the rest of the game.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:28.400
 And in the end, Arsenal lost 4-3.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:33.440
 But probably one of the reasons was because their goalkeeper knocked himself out,

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.520
 accidentally running into a goal post,

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.200
 which he couldn't see because of the fog.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.800
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.160
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.920
