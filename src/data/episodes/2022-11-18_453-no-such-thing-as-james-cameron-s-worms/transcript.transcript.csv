00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everybody, Dan and Andy here. We've got a couple of quick, exciting announcements before the show begins."
00:00:05,00:00:11,"That's right, we just want to let you know that this December we are going to be playing two live shows,"
00:00:11,00:00:15,"our final shows of the year, the Christmas shows, we're going to be at the Bloomsbury Theatre on the 10th of December,"
00:00:15,00:00:20,and we're going to be at our old Stumpin' Ground up the creek on the 14th of December.
00:00:20,00:00:24,"Yes, they're going to be so much fun. They're going to be Christmassy, as Dan says."
00:00:24,00:00:29,"There's going to be a live podcast in each of them, plus an extra bonus half bursting with your fix,"
00:00:29,00:00:35,"with special festive things. Dan's going to do his tinsel, twizzle trick, James is going to eat a sprout."
00:00:35,00:00:39,And I will show you how to make eggnog. It's going to be a fabulous time.
00:00:39,00:00:46,"That's right. I cannot guarantee any of that will happen. However, what we can guarantee is an awesome, rock and roll night of nerd comedy."
00:00:46,00:00:51,"So do come along to that. And if you can't make it, but you're thinking, hey, I want to still celebrate Christmas in some way with fish."
00:00:51,00:00:53,"Well, we've got some exciting presents for you."
00:00:53,00:00:58,"Yes, we have launched a new range of lovely merchandise."
00:00:58,00:01:03,We've got beautiful new t-shirts. We've got a fabulous pin bound set.
00:01:03,00:01:11,"We've got the official fish book, which is a gorgeous guide to fish, and it's full of facts and games and puzzles and articles and stupid stuff."
00:01:11,00:01:15,"We put that together for our tour earlier this year, and we think it's really great."
00:01:15,00:01:19,All of these things are available now at no such thing as a fish dot com slash shop.
00:01:19,00:01:22,There's a special bundle where you can get all three.
00:01:22,00:01:27,"If you are a fish fan or if you have a fish fan in your life and you think they'd like this as a Christmas present,"
00:01:27,00:01:29,we think this makes the perfect thing.
00:01:29,00:01:31,It's all available globally.
00:01:31,00:01:34,"And if you order it now, it'll be there in time for Christmas."
00:01:34,00:01:36,That's right. So head to know such thing as a fish dot com.
00:01:36,00:01:38,You'll find links to those two December live shows.
00:01:38,00:01:44,You'll also find links to everything that we've just spoken about in terms of t-shirts and badges and bundles.
00:01:44,00:01:45,Do get the show tickets.
00:01:45,00:01:51,Do buy some Christmas items and do enjoy the following episode.
00:01:51,00:02:09,On with the show. On with the podcast.
00:02:09,00:02:13,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish,"
00:02:13,00:02:18,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:02:18,00:02:23,"My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin."
00:02:23,00:02:28,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days."
00:02:28,00:02:31,And in a particular order here we go.
00:02:31,00:02:35,"Starting with fact number one, that is James."
00:02:35,00:02:43,"OK, my fact this week is that the IK people of Uganda are the standard textbook example of a selfish society"
00:02:43,00:02:45,where members only look after themselves.
00:02:45,00:02:49,It turns out they've just been misunderstood this whole time.
00:02:49,00:02:52,It's so funny.
00:02:52,00:02:55,"And normally when you say something as a textbook example of something, it's just a figure of speech."
00:02:55,00:02:59,And actually these people are used in textbooks about selfishness.
00:02:59,00:03:01,They are by anthropologists.
00:03:01,00:03:06,So this comes from a study in the 60s by a guy called Colin Turnbull.
00:03:06,00:03:09,"He published a book that described these people called the IK people,"
00:03:09,00:03:15,"sometimes known as the IK people as extraordinarily unfriendly, uncharitable and mean."
00:03:15,00:03:17,And he called them the Loveless People.
00:03:17,00:03:19,"It was really quite, it makes quite bad reading."
00:03:19,00:03:20,Yeah.
00:03:20,00:03:26,"But then later on, a few more anthropologists came round and they looked into what he'd written"
00:03:26,00:03:31,"and found out that he was probably, one, might have just made stuff up."
00:03:31,00:03:34,"But two, it was during a famine that he went to study them."
00:03:34,00:03:40,"And obviously when you're under the stress of a famine, you might act differently than you might do under normal circumstances."
00:03:40,00:03:43,"Hey, if I have a cup of tea, not delivered on time, I'd turn into a monster."
00:03:43,00:03:45,That's true.
00:03:45,00:03:49,"But this is, when we say a few years later, am I right in saying it was decades later that finally?"
00:03:49,00:03:50,Because then that's the problem.
00:03:50,00:03:56,"No one went back to study the IK people and to find out that it was just they were having a bad couple of years, basically."
00:03:56,00:03:57,He knew that.
00:03:57,00:04:03,"And actually, as a Turnbull defender, his whole thing, his whole thesis is,"
00:04:03,00:04:08,this is an example of what happens to human beings when they're having a really bad time.
00:04:08,00:04:13,"He says, for instance, the IK, like the rest of us, are kind, lighthearted, generous and jolly when they can afford to be."
00:04:13,00:04:16,But they were very hungry at this stage.
00:04:16,00:04:19,"Therefore, they had to abandon superficial luxuries and be mean."
00:04:19,00:04:22,"Yes, he's saying all humans are like the IK."
00:04:22,00:04:23,We're all capable of this.
00:04:23,00:04:28,But is he then also misrepresented when he made a suggestion to the leaders of Uganda
00:04:28,00:04:36,that they should all be taken off to different bits of Uganda in groups of 10 so that they could effectively stop existing?
00:04:36,00:04:38,"Yeah, no, he's not misrepresented. That's a bad idea."
00:04:38,00:04:43,"Yeah, in answer to your question, the reason why people didn't carry on studying them"
00:04:43,00:04:46,is because the IK people themselves were really upset about this book
00:04:46,00:04:48,because they were told about it and they didn't trust any...
00:04:48,00:04:49,Why?
00:04:49,00:04:51,"Yeah, exactly. They were sensitive as well."
00:04:51,00:04:58,They didn't trust any more white people to come and study them at any stage for the next 30 years because of this one book.
00:04:58,00:05:02,"Yeah, I've got to say, the write-ups they got were so extreme."
00:05:02,00:05:08,They were described as a haunting flower of evil in the corner of civilisation's garden.
00:05:08,00:05:09,"Yeah, not good."
00:05:09,00:05:12,So lots of other writers then wrote more about them.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"So there was a writer called Lewis Thomas who was a pathologist who wrote,"
00:05:15,00:05:19,"""They breed without love and they defecate on one another's doorsteps."""
00:05:19,00:05:24,"I mean, if someone had written that about me, I would not invite them round for decades."
00:05:24,00:05:29,Was that in Turnbill's book or did he just add the defecating on doorsteps as an extra?
00:05:29,00:05:34,I actually think it might have been because another person came called Bernt Hyner
00:05:34,00:05:38,who basically wrote the text saying everything that Turnbill wrote was wrong.
00:05:38,00:05:42,"He said that the yick told him that if Turnbill was ever to come back,"
00:05:42,00:05:44,they would force him to eat his own feces.
00:05:44,00:05:49,Nice! That's a very good fitting punishment for what you've gained.
00:05:49,00:05:51,Eat your words. Eat your terms more like.
00:05:51,00:05:54,It's so unfair because these are some of the poorest people on the planet.
00:05:54,00:05:59,"Is it, you know, you've lined up 100 people, they're right at the other end of it in terms of the resources they have."
00:05:59,00:06:04,"And they couldn't do anything right to sort of rectify it, other than, you know, because they stopped people coming in."
00:06:04,00:06:05,Other than the feces thing.
00:06:05,00:06:06,"Yeah, other than the feces thing."
00:06:06,00:06:07,He's just got to wait for that moment.
00:06:07,00:06:11,"But I mean, it's just like, you know, like whenever no such thing as a fish is mentioned on Google,"
00:06:11,00:06:14,"some of us have a ping that goes off and we see a mention, right?"
00:06:14,00:06:18,"Any time they're like, ""Hey, yick, you're in a new book. Are we really?"""
00:06:18,00:06:22,"All they say about us, ""Oh, that stuff again. Yeah, okay."""
00:06:22,00:06:26,"But then, as James says, it's sort of been disproved by other studies, hasn't it?"
00:06:26,00:06:31,"And I think the latest one is by a woman called Catherine Townsend who looked at them and said,"
00:06:31,00:06:34,"""They behave when you do the dictator test with them,"
00:06:34,00:06:38,"which is where you basically give someone in a group a bunch of resources."""
00:06:38,00:06:41,I can't remember what they gave them. Smarties or something.
00:06:41,00:06:42,"Sort of money, basically."
00:06:42,00:06:44,And it's not whether you share them with people.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"And yeah, you ask how much you want to share it with people,"
00:06:46,00:06:48,and then they did it in accordance with all other beings.
00:06:48,00:06:53,"And so, Catherine Townsend's thesis is that humans aren't innately really bad,"
00:06:53,00:06:58,"because as soon as the famine goes away, this culture of niceness recovers."
00:06:58,00:06:59,So it's obviously always there.
00:06:59,00:07:02,"It's just like in extreme circumstances, you just physically can't do it anymore."
00:07:02,00:07:05,Is it possible? I don't want to slander the ick people at all.
00:07:05,00:07:07,I'm just curious.
00:07:07,00:07:10,"Is it at all possible that when Catherine Townsend went there,"
00:07:10,00:07:13,"that it would be like going to North Korea and them showing you around,"
00:07:13,00:07:15,"going, ""Look at what a wonderful place this is!"""
00:07:15,00:07:16,And everyone is-- Hang on a second.
00:07:16,00:07:18,"Wait, rip off Dan's mask."
00:07:18,00:07:20,"Oh, my God. It's Colin Turnbull."
00:07:20,00:07:22,Hello!
00:07:22,00:07:26,I think they have other things to worry about
00:07:26,00:07:29,than trying to ingratiate themselves to westerners.
00:07:29,00:07:32,"Turnbull gave some words in his work,"
00:07:32,00:07:36,"like from the ick language, which is called ""e-chai-tuad."""
00:07:36,00:07:39,But it turns out that a lot of the ones that he put in were wrong.
00:07:39,00:07:43,"And it appears that he went through his whole time with the ick people,"
00:07:43,00:07:46,saying a reply rather than a greeting whenever he met anyone.
00:07:46,00:07:48,So it's like the equivalent of going down the street
00:07:48,00:07:51,"and whenever you see someone, you know, you're going, ""Bye, thanks!"""
00:07:51,00:07:57,Which is very passive-aggressive.
00:07:57,00:07:59,"Yeah, don't worry about me."
00:07:59,00:08:01,"Yeah, you just get on with your life, mate."
00:08:01,00:08:03,That's where they were rude to him.
00:08:03,00:08:07,"And this is also because he claimed that the person, Lameja,"
00:08:07,00:08:09,who was a guy who he hung out with a lot
00:08:09,00:08:11,"and who taught him the ick language,"
00:08:11,00:08:14,and he said Lameja is an example of a true ick.
00:08:14,00:08:16,He's like a fundamental ick person.
00:08:16,00:08:19,"And then, Heiner, when he came back, you know, 20, 30 years later,"
00:08:19,00:08:22,said they told him Lameja was not an ick person at all.
00:08:22,00:08:24,He'd come from a completely different tribe.
00:08:24,00:08:26,And actually about half the people in Turnbull's book
00:08:26,00:08:28,come from different tribes.
00:08:28,00:08:29,"Oh, wow."
00:08:29,00:08:32,And they said Lameja couldn't really speak ick very well.
00:08:32,00:08:33,He could speak sort of passable ick.
00:08:33,00:08:36,So God knows what kind of nonsense he was saying.
00:08:36,00:08:38,Do you want to learn some itche twad?
00:08:38,00:08:40,Yeah. What's that?
00:08:40,00:08:41,This is the language of the ick people.
00:08:41,00:08:42,"Oh, nice. OK, yeah, yeah."
00:08:42,00:08:44,"So the word ""dan""."
00:08:44,00:08:46,Oh. Do you know what that means?
00:08:46,00:08:47,Cool dude.
00:08:47,00:08:48,"Is that, is that feces?"
00:08:48,00:08:54,We have our own bit of nominative determinism on this show.
00:08:54,00:08:56,Can you give it to us in an English sentence?
00:08:56,00:08:58,"Replace ""dan"" in and see if we can."
00:08:58,00:09:03,"OK, ""Dan told me a fact and I replied to him, 'Dan.'"""
00:09:03,00:09:05,Bullshit.
00:09:05,00:09:08,It means exactly or precisely.
00:09:08,00:09:10,"Oh, what about this one?"
00:09:10,00:09:12,"""I looked over into the distance"
00:09:12,00:09:15,"and I saw an Anna prancing by."""
00:09:15,00:09:17,"Oh, drunk."
00:09:17,00:09:22,"They're not, they haven't based the language on us."
00:09:22,00:09:24,I'll say gazellef.
00:09:24,00:09:27,"""It's a male kudu, so pretty close."""
00:09:27,00:09:30,"Yeah, and what about this one?"
00:09:30,00:09:33,"""I poured some muzz over my plants."""
00:09:33,00:09:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:35,00:09:37,Amazing.
00:09:37,00:09:40,Is it water?
00:09:40,00:09:41,It isn't.
00:09:41,00:09:43,It's a cactus-like tree which you burn
00:09:43,00:09:45,and you use the ashes as fertilizer.
00:09:45,00:09:46,"Oh, wow."
00:09:46,00:09:48,"Who is your stand-in next week, actually?"
00:09:48,00:09:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:51,00:09:53,That's great.
00:09:53,00:09:55,"This, Kotlin Turnbull, I just want to,"
00:09:55,00:09:56,while we're sort of saying that he's not
00:09:56,00:09:59,the worst person because this does make him feel
00:09:59,00:10:02,like he sort of absolutely ruined a group of people.
00:10:02,00:10:05,"He also studied a group in Zaire, a group of pygmies,"
00:10:05,00:10:08,and he wrote a brilliant book about them
00:10:08,00:10:10,"and he did recordings of their music in Zaire,"
00:10:10,00:10:11,of the pygmies.
00:10:11,00:10:12,He collected some of their songs
00:10:12,00:10:16,and he commercially released a few from other tribes as well.
00:10:16,00:10:18,But the one that he did with the Zaire pygmies
00:10:18,00:10:20,"was ""Girls Singing an Initiation Song."""
00:10:20,00:10:22,"And that now, as a result of Kotlin Turnbull,"
00:10:22,00:10:26,is going to last for millions of years into the universe
00:10:26,00:10:29,because it was included on the Voyager 2 Golden Diss.
00:10:29,00:10:30,"Oh, was it?"
00:10:30,00:10:32,"And that's down to, yeah, Kotlin Turnbull."
00:10:32,00:10:34,"But he probably mistranslated it and it's actually saying,"
00:10:34,00:10:36,"""Fuck you, aliens, don't come back."""
00:10:36,00:10:41,Earth invaded due to him accidentally including a reply
00:10:41,00:10:43,instead of a greeting.
00:10:43,00:10:44,"We're fine, thanks."
00:10:44,00:10:46,We're good.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"The Ike people have some fun ceremonies,"
00:10:48,00:10:49,right to passage.
00:10:49,00:10:50,Come on.
00:10:50,00:10:54,"So one is the beer of the axes,"
00:10:54,00:10:55,which actually is not that fun
00:10:55,00:10:57,"if it was me, but it would be fun for you guys."
00:10:57,00:11:00,And that's basically where to thank the men
00:11:00,00:11:03,for doing all the farming and harvesting all the fields.
00:11:03,00:11:04,They can demand beer from the women
00:11:04,00:11:07,and they all go and gather in the big village center.
00:11:07,00:11:10,And then every woman has to bring this big vat of beer
00:11:10,00:11:11,and all the men get to drink it.
00:11:11,00:11:12,That sounds cool.
00:11:12,00:11:14,"Yeah, I don't think..."
00:11:14,00:11:17,It doesn't say that they stop the women from participating.
00:11:17,00:11:18,So I'm sure they can get pissed as well.
00:11:18,00:11:20,There's another ceremony they have called
00:11:20,00:11:21,"""The Blessing of the Seeds,"""
00:11:21,00:11:23,"which is, again, good for me,"
00:11:23,00:11:25,but not so good for the rest of you.
00:11:25,00:11:27,Everyone goes to a special tree.
00:11:27,00:11:28,They bring their seeds for the year
00:11:28,00:11:29,and the seeds get blessed.
00:11:29,00:11:32,"And then, again, there's loads and loads of beer."
00:11:32,00:11:33,"And everyone gets to drink the beer,"
00:11:33,00:11:35,but it goes in age order.
00:11:35,00:11:37,So the oldest person gets to drink first
00:11:37,00:11:38,and no one's allowed to drink
00:11:38,00:11:40,until the oldest person's had theirs.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"Oh, that's great."
00:11:41,00:11:43,You're going to regret that
00:11:43,00:11:44,because pride will make you down it all.
00:11:44,00:11:48,"And in an hour's time, you're feeling an idiot."
00:11:48,00:11:51,I'm as young as I've always been.
00:11:51,00:11:53,"So Ike weddings,"
00:11:53,00:11:54,"the very start of the wedding,"
00:11:54,00:11:57,they have a thing called the smearing.
00:11:57,00:11:59,Can you guess what the smearing is?
00:11:59,00:12:01,"It's when you test for a cervical cancer, isn't it?"
00:12:01,00:12:02,Yeah.
00:12:02,00:12:07,Is it like an anointment?
00:12:07,00:12:09,"You know, because in the coronation,"
00:12:09,00:12:10,don't we smear our monarchs
00:12:10,00:12:12,with some ceremonial stuff?
00:12:12,00:12:13,That's pretty much right.
00:12:13,00:12:14,So the couple sits side by side
00:12:14,00:12:17,and they're rubbed with oil by an old woman.
00:12:17,00:12:19,- Lovely. - So it's pretty much that.
00:12:19,00:12:21,The bride then brings the groom to a tree
00:12:21,00:12:23,and he has to throw a spear at it
00:12:23,00:12:25,and has to hit the tree.
00:12:25,00:12:26,And then they go back to the house
00:12:26,00:12:28,and the bride needs to make like a stew for everyone.
00:12:28,00:12:31,So it's kind of to show that his skills are in hunting
00:12:31,00:12:33,and her skills are in the household stuff.
00:12:33,00:12:35,And the groom has to pay a payment
00:12:35,00:12:37,for touching the bride's breasts.
00:12:37,00:12:41,- Is that a pay per touch or is it a?
00:12:41,00:12:41,- It's a one off.
00:12:41,00:12:42,- It's a one off.
00:12:42,00:12:43,"It's like all the times I've previously touched them,"
00:12:43,00:12:45,"I'm paying off and now,"
00:12:45,00:12:46,"or is it I'm paying in advance,"
00:12:46,00:12:48,I'm going to get to touch these breasts forever.
00:12:48,00:12:49,- I think the understanding is
00:12:49,00:12:51,that you won't have touched them at that stage
00:12:51,00:12:52,and you're paying for the opportunity
00:12:52,00:12:53,to touch them for the first
00:12:53,00:12:55,and hopefully future touch.
00:12:55,00:12:57,(all laughing)
00:12:57,00:12:59,"- And the last time, thank you very much."
00:12:59,00:13:00,"- And then you can't rent,"
00:13:00,00:13:02,"I don't think it's like a pay per month thing,"
00:13:02,00:13:03,"is it, it's all at once."
00:13:03,00:13:04,- I think it's 2.99 a month
00:13:04,00:13:07,"but if you pay for the full year, it's a lot of money."
00:13:07,00:13:09,"- If you stick in the offercode fish,"
00:13:09,00:13:11,you'll get those breasts for this one pound 50 a month.
00:13:11,00:13:16,"Just on selfishness and the opposite,"
00:13:16,00:13:17,but mostly selfishness.
00:13:17,00:13:20,"Someone around this table,"
00:13:20,00:13:22,probably going to be more selfish than the rest of us.
00:13:22,00:13:22,- It's you.
00:13:22,00:13:25,(all laughing)
00:13:25,00:13:26,- Yes.
00:13:26,00:13:28,- Is it women?
00:13:28,00:13:29,- It's something to do with what's happened
00:13:29,00:13:31,to all of us in the last 24 hours.
00:13:31,00:13:35,"- Oh, Dan had a full English breakfast before he got here."
00:13:35,00:13:36,"- Weirdly, it is Dan,"
00:13:36,00:13:37,but it's not because he had a full English breakfast
00:13:37,00:13:38,before he got here.
00:13:38,00:13:39,"- Oh, really?"
00:13:39,00:13:43,"- Okay, listeners, you've just been let into some insight."
00:13:43,00:13:45,Apparently the most controversial thing I've ever done
00:13:45,00:13:48,is had a full English breakfast before today's recording.
00:13:48,00:13:50,"- It's not because of your breakfast, Dan."
00:13:50,00:13:51,That's the good news.
00:13:51,00:13:53,(all laughing)
00:13:53,00:13:54,"- What else is Dan,"
00:13:54,00:13:56,how much do you know about Dan's last 24 hours?
00:13:56,00:13:57,Do we all know this about Dan?
00:13:57,00:13:59,- And what could possibly top my full English breakfast?
00:13:59,00:14:01,"- We can also mine it by what we know about Dan,"
00:14:01,00:14:02,which is that Dan-
00:14:02,00:14:03,"- Okay, his hair is very scruffy right now."
00:14:03,00:14:06,"So are you saying, like, if you don't shower, maybe-"
00:14:06,00:14:07,- It's not a showering thing.
00:14:07,00:14:08,"- What Dan's done that I haven't, have you?"
00:14:08,00:14:10,"- We've all done this in the last 24 hours,"
00:14:10,00:14:13,but Dan probably done a bit less than the rest of us of it.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"Sleep, Dan, you've got a new baby."
00:14:15,00:14:16,You've probably had a bit less sleep
00:14:16,00:14:18,"than us in the last 24 hours, I guess."
00:14:18,00:14:19,"I mean, you've got to, you know,"
00:14:19,00:14:21,create time for that full English breakfast.
00:14:21,00:14:23,(all laughing)
00:14:23,00:14:26,"Sleeplessness, we think, makes you more selfish."
00:14:26,00:14:27,"- It makes you more hungry, I know that much."
00:14:27,00:14:28,- Yeah.
00:14:28,00:14:31,(all laughing)
00:14:31,00:14:34,"No, so basically, they looked at this database"
00:14:34,00:14:35,"of charitable donations,"
00:14:35,00:14:36,and they didn't do it with individual surveys.
00:14:36,00:14:39,They looked at three million charitable donations
00:14:39,00:14:40,and the days on which they happened.
00:14:40,00:14:43,And one of the days was after the clocks changed.
00:14:43,00:14:44,"- Oh yeah, really?"
00:14:44,00:14:46,"- So, you know, you switch, you change the clocks"
00:14:46,00:14:48,and half the year you get an hour less sleep.
00:14:48,00:14:51,And donations dropped quite substantially
00:14:51,00:14:54,the day after people had just a little bit less sleep.
00:14:54,00:14:55,"So that's the theory, you know?"
00:14:55,00:14:56,"- 'Cause I always think, you know,"
00:14:56,00:14:59,"those chuggers who try and get money off you,"
00:14:59,00:15:01,I always feel like if I have less energy
00:15:01,00:15:02,"to kind of walk straight past them,"
00:15:02,00:15:04,then I'm more likely to give them stuff.
00:15:04,00:15:06,"- Oh, so you're the opposite of that."
00:15:06,00:15:07,"- I feel like it, I might not give you, but."
00:15:07,00:15:10,"- Less energy to walk, if you're not so collapsing."
00:15:10,00:15:12,You can't put one foot in front of the other.
00:15:12,00:15:12,- They don't even net.
00:15:12,00:15:13,(all laughing)
00:15:13,00:15:15,"- They do, like maybe three of them"
00:15:15,00:15:16,are coming from different directions.
00:15:16,00:15:19,"It's like, you know those, is it humpback whales"
00:15:19,00:15:21,that they hunt by making bubbles around the fish
00:15:21,00:15:23,so that fish can't escape?
00:15:23,00:15:25,That's how I feel with those guys.
00:15:25,00:15:29,"- Actually, on animals and selfishness,"
00:15:29,00:15:31,it's very hard to find out selfish animals
00:15:31,00:15:34,because you try every way of Googling most selfish animal
00:15:34,00:15:35,"and obviously everyone says,"
00:15:35,00:15:39,"""Oh, humans are the most selfish animal aren't they?"""
00:15:39,00:15:42,"And, you know, I think maybe we need to look a bit deeper."
00:15:42,00:15:46,"So, Adele penguins, I think do a funny thing,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,which is disputed by a zoo that has them
00:15:48,00:15:50,and insists they don't.
00:15:50,00:15:53,"But, Adele penguins, when they all flock to the water's edge,"
00:15:53,00:15:55,you've probably seen them standing on the edge
00:15:55,00:15:56,of an ice flow or something.
00:15:56,00:15:58,"And they all gather at the water's edge,"
00:15:58,00:16:01,"but they're all too nervous to be the first one to jump in,"
00:16:01,00:16:03,as you would because there might be a big old leopard seal
00:16:03,00:16:05,or something under the water.
00:16:05,00:16:07,"So, you see them shuffling closer and closer"
00:16:07,00:16:09,and then they wait for either one of them to fall in
00:16:09,00:16:11,"to check that they don't get eaten,"
00:16:11,00:16:14,or they do sometimes push each other in.
00:16:14,00:16:17,- And you can see videos of...
00:16:17,00:16:20,- Like with a sneaky flipper on the bum kind of pushing in.
00:16:20,00:16:20,- That's so funny.
00:16:20,00:16:21,"- A little bit of, yeah, tripping over."
00:16:21,00:16:23,"- Yeah, haven't we seen videos of a penguin putting its foot out"
00:16:23,00:16:26,and one tripping over as it's walking by?
00:16:26,00:16:27,- I feel like I've seen that. - Is that Charlie Chaplin?
00:16:27,00:16:28,That's Charlie Chaplin.
00:16:28,00:16:30,"- I haven't, but I want to."
00:16:30,00:16:31,- Are you guys...
00:16:31,00:16:32,Do you guys give money to charity ever?
00:16:32,00:16:33,- Yeah.
00:16:33,00:16:34,- Right.
00:16:34,00:16:35,"- No, I refuse."
00:16:35,00:16:36,"- Okay, well..."
00:16:36,00:16:36,- That's a joke.
00:16:36,00:16:41,- Sorry if the chuggers outside Pinsbury Park Station
00:16:41,00:16:42,are listening.
00:16:42,00:16:43,"No, I don't."
00:16:44,00:16:46,"Okay, so this is a really interesting thing."
00:16:46,00:16:50,"In aggregate, people don't tend to like charitable people"
00:16:50,00:16:52,as much as they like other kinds.
00:16:52,00:16:53,"Okay, so..."
00:16:53,00:16:55,- So does that mean I have to stop on my direct debit
00:16:55,00:16:56,so that people like me?
00:16:56,00:16:58,- I'm afraid that's what's been standing between you
00:16:58,00:17:00,and the universal popularity.
00:17:00,00:17:03,"No, this is a study, again, Yale and Oxford this time around,"
00:17:03,00:17:05,"and it was in 2018, and people were asked,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,they were given some people and choices over
00:17:07,00:17:10,"whether they'd like to hang out with these people or not, right?"
00:17:10,00:17:12,"So they created a scenario, right?"
00:17:13,00:17:16,Granny has won $500 in the lottery.
00:17:16,00:17:19,Should she give that to her grandson
00:17:19,00:17:21,who needs to fix his car?
00:17:21,00:17:23,Or should she give it to a malaria charity?
00:17:23,00:17:27,"Now, obviously overall, it probably does more good"
00:17:27,00:17:28,"being given to the charity,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,but people were way more likely to say
00:17:30,00:17:33,that if they were looking for a friend or a spouse
00:17:33,00:17:36,"or whatever, they would like grandson, car, Granny."
00:17:36,00:17:37,Yeah.
00:17:37,00:17:38,- That's interesting because that 500 quid
00:17:38,00:17:41,"goes into a huge pot at the charity,"
00:17:41,00:17:44,"but then to the guy who needs his car fixing,"
00:17:44,00:17:47,it solves all of his problems immediately.
00:17:47,00:17:49,- It solves all of his problems.
00:17:49,00:17:50,I bet he's got other personal problems.
00:17:50,00:17:51,"- Well, he doesn't know anything about that."
00:17:51,00:17:55,All we know about this guy is that his car's broken.
00:17:55,00:17:56,"- No, and you can finally drive"
00:17:56,00:17:58,to the Malaria Research Institute
00:17:58,00:18:00,where he can continue his work.
00:18:00,00:18:04,"Unfortunately, there's no money to fund his ideas."
00:18:04,00:18:11,"Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:18:11,00:18:12,and that is my fact.
00:18:12,00:18:15,"My fact this week is that in 1797,"
00:18:15,00:18:17,an author was so criticized
00:18:17,00:18:19,for the lack of punctuation in his book
00:18:19,00:18:21,"that in its next printing,"
00:18:21,00:18:22,he included a page at the end
00:18:22,00:18:24,of nothing but full stops commas
00:18:24,00:18:26,and exclamation marks for the readers
00:18:26,00:18:28,to slot in wherever they liked.
00:18:28,00:18:29,- Amazing.
00:18:29,00:18:30,- Yeah.
00:18:30,00:18:32,And it's a really beautiful page at the back.
00:18:32,00:18:34,It's sort of all the full stops are grouped together
00:18:34,00:18:35,in one chunk. - It's better in the audio book
00:18:35,00:18:38,"that page, just like silence."
00:18:38,00:18:40,How would you do an exclamation mark?
00:18:40,00:18:41,"You go, ooh."
00:18:41,00:18:43,- Yeah.
00:18:43,00:18:44,How do you do a comma?
00:18:44,00:18:46,Can't work out and pronounce that.
00:18:46,00:18:47,"- It's just a lot of silence, I think,"
00:18:47,00:18:49,"for the full stops in the commas, isn't there?"
00:18:49,00:18:49,"- Okay, yeah."
00:18:49,00:18:51,"- And suddenly there's a, oh."
00:18:51,00:18:57,"- So this is a text as the fact says, 1797,"
00:18:57,00:18:59,and it was by a guy called Timothy Dexter
00:18:59,00:19:02,who was an eccentric American businessman
00:19:02,00:19:05,who led a life that is so bizarre
00:19:05,00:19:08,that it's possibly in no way true.
00:19:08,00:19:12,It's just someone who had myth built upon him and so on.
00:19:12,00:19:13,But one thing we do know for sure
00:19:13,00:19:15,is that he published a book called
00:19:15,00:19:17,"A Pickle for the Knowing Ones,"
00:19:17,00:19:20,and it is a book in which he basically downloaded his brain.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"He just said, here's all my thoughts"
00:19:22,00:19:24,"about things, my opinions and so on,"
00:19:24,00:19:26,"but he failed to put any punctuation in,"
00:19:26,00:19:28,rendering it completely unreadable
00:19:28,00:19:30,for anyone who wanted to make sense of it.
00:19:30,00:19:33,"So criticism came in, and in the second printing,"
00:19:33,00:19:34,"and it's a self-published book, by the way."
00:19:34,00:19:35,- Okay.
00:19:35,00:19:36,"- The second run of the self-publication,"
00:19:36,00:19:38,he just added this extra page.
00:19:38,00:19:39,- Very funny.
00:19:39,00:19:39,"- Yeah, that's cool."
00:19:39,00:19:41,"- Has any, I didn't read,"
00:19:41,00:19:43,I think I read a couple of pages of A Pickle
00:19:43,00:19:44,for the Knowing Ones.
00:19:44,00:19:44,- I read a few censuses.
00:19:44,00:19:45,"- Yeah, me too."
00:19:45,00:19:46,- How the hell?
00:19:46,00:19:48,- But people seem to say it's a combination
00:19:48,00:19:52,of total nonsense and some quite wise sort of observations
00:19:52,00:19:54,"about, it's sort of about his thoughts on human beings"
00:19:54,00:19:57,"and how to live and all that stuff, isn't it?"
00:19:57,00:20:00,"- Well, one write-up of it, soon after it was written,"
00:20:00,00:20:03,said it was a jumble of letters promiscuously gathered together
00:20:03,00:20:06,and that readers will find it difficult to determine
00:20:06,00:20:08,whether most to laugh at the consummate folly
00:20:08,00:20:11,or despise the vulgarity and profanity of the writer.
00:20:11,00:20:13,And that was in his actual obituary.
00:20:13,00:20:16,"In 1806, normally they shook the pill a bit."
00:20:16,00:20:18,"- I know, I read the death notice"
00:20:18,00:20:21,in the Rutland Weekly Herald when he died.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"And it was really short, it just said,"
00:20:23,00:20:26,he was a man of great property and a perfect ignoramus.
00:20:26,00:20:27,- Ooh.
00:20:27,00:20:29,- They literally just died this guy.
00:20:29,00:20:30,- Wow.
00:20:30,00:20:32,"- I wonder, like, the books of the time,"
00:20:32,00:20:35,"this was published in 1802, but in the late 1700s,"
00:20:35,00:20:38,there were a lot of books that were kind of bizarre
00:20:38,00:20:41,and maybe was he following in a tradition of surrealism?
00:20:41,00:20:43,"Like Lawrence Stern's ""Tristan Shandy"" was published"
00:20:43,00:20:44,in the late 1700s.
00:20:44,00:20:46,"- Yeah, I know."
00:20:46,00:20:48,"- And his book would have things like,"
00:20:48,00:20:50,there'd be a blank page or it would have a page
00:20:50,00:20:52,that was entirely black or there was a chapter
00:20:52,00:20:55,"entirely missing because he said this chapter was so good,"
00:20:55,00:20:57,it just makes all the other chapters look bad
00:20:57,00:20:59,as I've decided not to include it.
00:20:59,00:21:00,"- It was, yeah."
00:21:00,00:21:01,- The message that he put at the front
00:21:01,00:21:02,"of the new edition where he said,"
00:21:02,00:21:03,"""I've put punctuation in the back,"""
00:21:03,00:21:05,is so full of misspellings.
00:21:05,00:21:06,Do you think it must be intentional?
00:21:06,00:21:11,"He says, ""I put in enough,"" like A, space, N, U, F."
00:21:11,00:21:15,"And for some reason put that in quote marks,"
00:21:15,00:21:17,"which seems like a knowing, ha ha,"
00:21:17,00:21:18,I'm deliberately misspelling that.
00:21:18,00:21:21,So I put in enough here that they may pepper and salt
00:21:21,00:21:25,"as they please, P-E-P-E-R-S-O-L-T."
00:21:25,00:21:27,- What a great position to be in as a human
00:21:27,00:21:29,that just no one knows whether you meant it or not.
00:21:29,00:21:32,"And it works in your favor either way basically, yeah?"
00:21:32,00:21:33,"- Well, that's what happens when you're really,"
00:21:33,00:21:35,"really rich, which he was."
00:21:35,00:21:36,"- Which he was, wasn't he?"
00:21:36,00:21:38,- And how did he get rich?
00:21:38,00:21:40,It's so confusing because he seemed
00:21:40,00:21:42,to make all these investments that works.
00:21:42,00:21:44,"Like, I think he invested in the first ever"
00:21:44,00:21:46,clay pipe making factory.
00:21:46,00:21:48,One of his more sensible ones that made money.
00:21:48,00:21:51,He invested in some government bonds at a good time.
00:21:51,00:21:54,"But outside of that, he did bizarre stuff."
00:21:54,00:21:56,Like the famous thing that was always written
00:21:56,00:21:58,"about him at the time is that he,"
00:21:58,00:22:01,and I think this did happen or it seems like people
00:22:01,00:22:02,"who remembered him said it happened at least,"
00:22:02,00:22:06,is that he was persuaded by people pranking him
00:22:06,00:22:08,"to try and sell warming pans,"
00:22:08,00:22:11,like bed warming pans to the West Indies.
00:22:11,00:22:13,"And, you know, I thought, ha, ha, ha, it's so hot there."
00:22:13,00:22:14,"And also I think that he was,"
00:22:14,00:22:16,he was persuaded to sell mittens there.
00:22:16,00:22:19,And it was brilliant because he went
00:22:19,00:22:20,and sold the warming pans and they had
00:22:20,00:22:22,a big molasses industry.
00:22:22,00:22:24,And apparently they sold really well as ladles
00:22:24,00:22:26,in the molasses industry to people
00:22:26,00:22:27,who could scoop treacle into vats.
00:22:27,00:22:28,- Yeah.
00:22:28,00:22:29,- It can't be true.
00:22:29,00:22:30,- That bit can't be true.
00:22:30,00:22:31,- It can't be true.
00:22:31,00:22:35,"The warming pans also, some red woolen pajamas went with him."
00:22:35,00:22:39,And the story is that there was a Norwegian in Havana
00:22:39,00:22:41,who had a load of timber and he couldn't get rid
00:22:41,00:22:44,"of his timber, but in Norway at that time,"
00:22:44,00:22:47,there was a real fashion for red woolen pajamas.
00:22:47,00:22:51,"And so he sold all of these pajamas for the Norwegians,"
00:22:51,00:22:52,"swapped them for all this lumber,"
00:22:52,00:22:54,and then took the lumber a bit further south
00:22:54,00:22:55,where he could sell all that
00:22:55,00:22:56,and made an absolute fortune from that as well.
00:22:56,00:22:57,- That's good.
00:22:57,00:22:58,I like that.
00:22:58,00:23:02,I read a book about Timothy Dexter for the research
00:23:02,00:23:03,of this and it's quite rare that you get to read
00:23:03,00:23:06,a whole book when you're doing these weekly shows.
00:23:06,00:23:07,So that was very exciting.
00:23:07,00:23:08,It's by William Cleves Todd.
00:23:08,00:23:10,It's about 13 pages long.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"So that was quite useful, but it was such a good read."
00:23:13,00:23:15,"It reads like an incredible New York Times article,"
00:23:15,00:23:17,this book.
00:23:17,00:23:19,But one thing he mentions of the book is the house
00:23:19,00:23:21,"that he lived in after he started making his money,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,"which was a Newbury port, Massachusetts."
00:23:23,00:23:26,"And my God, outside the front of it,"
00:23:26,00:23:27,it's pretty spectacular.
00:23:27,00:23:30,There were these columns on which he had wooden carved
00:23:30,00:23:32,figures of prominence standing up there.
00:23:32,00:23:35,"So it'd be George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,"
00:23:35,00:23:37,"him, he put himself up there"
00:23:37,00:23:40,and claiming himself to be someone of huge prominence.
00:23:40,00:23:41,- It looks really cool.
00:23:41,00:23:42,- It looks amazing.
00:23:42,00:23:44,"- You can see, obviously, paintings on there."
00:23:44,00:23:45,"You know, people would stop and look,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,these giant wooden statues.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"And he seemed to have animals statues as well,"
00:23:49,00:23:52,like some dogs and what looked like some pigs.
00:23:52,00:23:53,Hard to tell.
00:23:53,00:23:54,"- Two lions, I believe as well, at the front."
00:23:54,00:23:55,- Some lions.
00:23:55,00:23:59,But then did you see what he wrote under his own
00:23:59,00:24:01,"big statue, which is like the biggest one"
00:24:01,00:24:03,"right in the middle, was Lord Timothy Dexter."
00:24:03,00:24:05,He always called himself Lord.
00:24:05,00:24:08,"Lord Timothy Dexter of Newbury port, Massachusetts,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,"first in the East, first in the West,"
00:24:10,00:24:13,and the greatest philosopher in the Western world.
00:24:13,00:24:15,So he was a humble guy.
00:24:15,00:24:16,- He was a humble guy.
00:24:16,00:24:18,"- I think about him calling himself Lord, sorry,"
00:24:18,00:24:18,on that.
00:24:18,00:24:19,I only saw this in one place.
00:24:19,00:24:22,It was in the Boston Globe in 1921.
00:24:22,00:24:23,"But according to them,"
00:24:23,00:24:26,they said that Lord was his wife's maiden name.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"And so that's how he said, you know,"
00:24:28,00:24:30,"he was like, oh, I'm going to take her maiden name."
00:24:30,00:24:31,I'm going to put it at the front of my name.
00:24:31,00:24:33,And I'm going to be called Lord Timothy Dexter.
00:24:33,00:24:35,- What a feminist.
00:24:35,00:24:36,- That's really good feminist.
00:24:36,00:24:37,- It's such a fraudster.
00:24:37,00:24:38,"And the story,"
00:24:38,00:24:41,"which I'm sure you guys all saw as well,"
00:24:41,00:24:42,about his funeral.
00:24:42,00:24:43,- Oh yeah.
00:24:43,00:24:46,- Where he staged his own funeral
00:24:46,00:24:47,for the benefit of the town
00:24:47,00:24:49,because he wanted to see how people would react.
00:24:49,00:24:51,"So he put it about that he was dead,"
00:24:51,00:24:52,"invited all the gentle folk,"
00:24:52,00:24:54,got someone to play a clergyman.
00:24:54,00:24:56,And then his got his coffin
00:24:56,00:24:58,"and his coffin was deposited in the, you know,"
00:24:58,00:24:59,family vault or whatever.
00:24:59,00:25:01,And he thought his wife had not played her part properly
00:25:01,00:25:03,because she hadn't cried enough during it.
00:25:03,00:25:04,She was in on it.
00:25:04,00:25:05,- So she was in on it.
00:25:05,00:25:06,"- Yeah, I read accounts where it was like,"
00:25:06,00:25:08,"oh, she didn't cry enough and he was furious."
00:25:08,00:25:12,"And then he beat her for, you know, not crying enough."
00:25:12,00:25:14,"Actually, he beat her for not acting enough."
00:25:14,00:25:15,- Yeah.
00:25:15,00:25:16,"- That's, I mean, you know."
00:25:16,00:25:17,- She didn't commit to the bit.
00:25:17,00:25:18,Come on.
00:25:18,00:25:18,You've all got to be in on it.
00:25:18,00:25:19,- I think God knows it.
00:25:19,00:25:20,- It sounds great.
00:25:20,00:25:22,You've got to this funeral.
00:25:22,00:25:23,It's been very lavish.
00:25:23,00:25:26,He had his coffin drawn in on white horse pulled chariot
00:25:26,00:25:29,and then descending into the grave.
00:25:29,00:25:31,And then they have a huge feast afterwards.
00:25:31,00:25:34,"And then it was disturbed by, yeah, the sight of him."
00:25:34,00:25:36,"And what I think was a bit of a pantomime, it seems like."
00:25:36,00:25:40,I think it might have been a set up punch and Judy style.
00:25:40,00:25:41,"- Oh, you think that was faked?"
00:25:41,00:25:43,"- From what I was reading from, I think it was actually."
00:25:43,00:25:45,- He did hit her with a load of sausages.
00:25:45,00:25:46,Didn't he?
00:25:46,00:25:48,(all laughing)
00:25:48,00:25:49,"- It's very hard to say,"
00:25:49,00:25:52,but people who knew him say it might have been faked.
00:25:52,00:25:55,"- I mean, all of it seems to be made up, you know?"
00:25:55,00:25:56,- Only that bit staged.
00:25:56,00:25:57,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:57,00:25:58,"- He wasn't eccentric, sometimes eccentric."
00:25:58,00:25:59,- He was a wealthy eccentric.
00:25:59,00:26:00,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:00,00:26:01,- Lots of it was true.
00:26:01,00:26:02,"I mean, the house was definitely true."
00:26:02,00:26:03,I think the funeral definitely happened.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"- Like, for instance, there's a thing from his lifetime"
00:26:05,00:26:08,I read in the Vermont Journal from 1801
00:26:08,00:26:11,talking about how he had a boat and it needed staying.
00:26:11,00:26:14,"Okay, so he needs ropes, basically, he needs extra ropes."
00:26:14,00:26:15,He didn't really know what that meant.
00:26:15,00:26:18,So he went to town and he bought a load of whale bone
00:26:18,00:26:20,and then brought it back and gave it to the boat guy.
00:26:20,00:26:23,"And the boat guy said, ""Well, this is not, I need the ropes."""
00:26:23,00:26:24,I had only whale bone.
00:26:24,00:26:27,"And so he went back into Boston and he said,"
00:26:27,00:26:29,"""Well, I've got all this whale bone, can I sell it to you?"""
00:26:29,00:26:31,"And the thing was, he bought so much,"
00:26:31,00:26:34,the price had absolutely rocketed.
00:26:34,00:26:36,"And so when he sold it back to the whale bone community,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,he got double what he paid for it.
00:26:38,00:26:38,- That's amazing.
00:26:38,00:26:39,- That's very funny.
00:26:39,00:26:42,"- Wow, that's what I'm doing with Ben Elton memorabilia"
00:26:42,00:26:44,"on eBay, hoovering it all up."
00:26:44,00:26:46,And one day it'll be worth a fortune.
00:26:46,00:26:49,"- Is that because the ship needed staying,"
00:26:49,00:26:49,which I've never heard of.
00:26:49,00:26:50,- That's the rope thing.
00:26:50,00:26:54,But stays is a word for the whale bone struts in a dress.
00:26:54,00:26:55,I thought all the supports in it.
00:26:55,00:26:55,- Is that right?
00:26:55,00:26:57,"- I think stays are in a corset, maybe."
00:26:57,00:27:00,- I actually couldn't work out how he'd made that mistake.
00:27:00,00:27:02,"- I think stays are the bits in the corset, which..."
00:27:02,00:27:03,- Where are we going?
00:27:03,00:27:04,I got confused.
00:27:04,00:27:05,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:27:05,00:27:06,- People chat.
00:27:06,00:27:07,- There's a story as well that he heard
00:27:07,00:27:09,that the king of England had a poet laureate.
00:27:09,00:27:11,"And so he thought, ""Well, I'd like one of those as well."""
00:27:11,00:27:14,And so he hired someone just to follow him around
00:27:14,00:27:16,and just to capture his daily wisdom
00:27:16,00:27:18,"and to turn it into people, pros."
00:27:18,00:27:19,- Yeah.
00:27:19,00:27:20,"- I mean, that was definitely true."
00:27:20,00:27:21,Jonathan Plummer.
00:27:21,00:27:22,- Jonathan Plummer.
00:27:22,00:27:24,- He sort of became a famous person in his own right.
00:27:24,00:27:25,"He was a fishmonger, wasn't he?"
00:27:25,00:27:26,- Really?
00:27:26,00:27:27,"- Yeah, yeah, he was a fishmonger."
00:27:27,00:27:30,"And I think he made him wear a black suit covered in stars,"
00:27:30,00:27:32,which sounds so cool.
00:27:32,00:27:33,- Sounds very wizardy.
00:27:33,00:27:35,"- Yeah, and he was crowned with parsley."
00:27:35,00:27:37,"- Yes, that's right."
00:27:37,00:27:38,- He sounded like a really sad character.
00:27:38,00:27:40,He wrote an autobiography of his own by his poetry
00:27:40,00:27:44,"and he described himself as persecuted, despised"
00:27:44,00:27:46,and hated by everyone and suffering
00:27:46,00:27:49,from such offensive breath that no one could go near him.
00:27:49,00:27:51,Occasioned by Qatar of the Nose.
00:27:51,00:27:54,"- Sorry, did he write that in his own autobiography?"
00:27:54,00:27:55,- That's the author's blurb at the back.
00:27:55,00:27:58,(laughing)
00:27:58,00:28:00,"- Yeah, he also, he swore off young women"
00:28:00,00:28:03,after he wrote so many poems for so many young women
00:28:03,00:28:05,he fancied and they all rejected him.
00:28:05,00:28:08,So he turned up vigorous and antiquated virgins
00:28:08,00:28:09,"as he described them,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,but they actually all rejected him as well.
00:28:11,00:28:13,- Oh no.
00:28:13,00:28:14,- That was the two vigorous.
00:28:14,00:28:16,He should have gone less vigorous.
00:28:16,00:28:19,- You're a slightly anemic elderly virgin.
00:28:19,00:28:20,- Passive.
00:28:20,00:28:21,- Yeah.
00:28:21,00:28:23,"- Gosh, this is it."
00:28:23,00:28:26,"You're sure about this dating profile, are you?"
00:28:26,00:28:29,(laughing)
00:28:29,00:28:31,"Just on punctuation, as this is about"
00:28:31,00:28:35,his Timothy Dexter's inserted punctuation.
00:28:35,00:28:40,"So I didn't know that Aristophanes invented punctuation,"
00:28:40,00:28:43,but not the famous Aristophanes.
00:28:43,00:28:44,A slightly different guy.
00:28:44,00:28:46,- The playwright who wrote the clouds
00:28:46,00:28:47,"and all that stuff, right?"
00:28:47,00:28:48,"- Bingo, yes."
00:28:48,00:28:49,- Not him.
00:28:49,00:28:50,"- Someone completely different, yeah."
00:28:50,00:28:50,- 200 years later.
00:28:50,00:28:51,I know.
00:28:51,00:28:52,- What a fact.
00:28:52,00:28:53,- Your minds are all been blown.
00:28:53,00:28:54,(laughing)
00:28:54,00:28:56,- Did that Aristophanes have any punctuation in his poem
00:28:56,00:28:57,or did this guy come along and put them into his?
00:28:57,00:28:58,"- He would have been before, right?"
00:28:58,00:29:02,- I think actually punctuation Aristophanes
00:29:02,00:29:04,is 200 years later.
00:29:04,00:29:04,- Yeah.
00:29:04,00:29:05,- Yeah.
00:29:05,00:29:06,- But that's great because if that poem now
00:29:06,00:29:07,"has punctuation in it,"
00:29:07,00:29:09,that's a collaboration between two Aristophanes.
00:29:09,00:29:10,- Yeah.
00:29:10,00:29:11,- Just 200 years apart.
00:29:11,00:29:12,- I love it.
00:29:12,00:29:13,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:13,00:29:15,"- It was really very basic, his system."
00:29:15,00:29:17,It was just dots you could put at the top or the middle
00:29:17,00:29:18,or a bottom of a line.
00:29:18,00:29:21,And then there were pauses basically.
00:29:21,00:29:23,There were pauses of three different lengths.
00:29:23,00:29:25,"But their names were the comma, the colon,"
00:29:25,00:29:27,and the periodos.
00:29:27,00:29:29,And that's where all those names come from.
00:29:29,00:29:30,- Interesting.
00:29:30,00:29:31,- Isn't that cool?
00:29:31,00:29:32,- That is cool.
00:29:32,00:29:33,- Yeah.
00:29:33,00:29:36,- So then Isadora Seville came along after that.
00:29:36,00:29:37,"The famous one, not a different one."
00:29:37,00:29:40,(laughing)
00:29:40,00:29:43,And he kind of took Aristophanes' idea
00:29:43,00:29:45,and kind of standardised it.
00:29:45,00:29:50,"And he had a dot at the top of the line for a long stop,"
00:29:50,00:29:53,a dot in the middle of the line for a slightly shorter one
00:29:53,00:29:56,and a dot at the bottom of the line for a very short stop.
00:29:56,00:29:59,And the one at the top sort of migrated down
00:29:59,00:30:01,and eventually became full stop.
00:30:01,00:30:02,The one in the middle became the colon
00:30:02,00:30:04,and the one at the bottom became a modern comma.
00:30:04,00:30:05,"- Oh, wow."
00:30:05,00:30:08,- The one at the top leapfrocks the one in the middle
00:30:08,00:30:09,to go to the bottom.
00:30:09,00:30:10,- I did.
00:30:10,00:30:11,- And do we have evidence over the hundreds of years
00:30:11,00:30:14,of it gradually sneaking down one millisecond?
00:30:14,00:30:14,- I think we probably do.
00:30:14,00:30:15,"- I think we do, yeah."
00:30:15,00:30:16,- Wow.
00:30:16,00:30:18,"How do we know that rather than doing that,"
00:30:18,00:30:20,it didn't bump into the other one
00:30:20,00:30:22,when it got there and knocked that one further down?
00:30:22,00:30:24,"- Oh, it could have done, yeah, yeah."
00:30:24,00:30:27,They have some punctuation in the Quran.
00:30:27,00:30:30,"Even though in the early days of Islam,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,there was no punctuation in Arabic.
00:30:32,00:30:35,But the pausal signs are known as al-amat al-wakaf.
00:30:35,00:30:38,And they are different types of stopping
00:30:38,00:30:41,that will kind of make the text seem more beautiful.
00:30:41,00:30:42,"Because obviously the Quran,"
00:30:42,00:30:44,"it's supposed to be very beautiful when you say it, right?"
00:30:44,00:30:46,"And so if you see different ones,"
00:30:46,00:30:49,it might say it is better to stop now.
00:30:49,00:30:51,"You may stop if you want to,"
00:30:51,00:30:54,or you absolutely must stop at this stage.
00:30:54,00:30:56,We said they quite like that idea of punctuation
00:30:56,00:30:58,where it kind of gives you advice
00:30:58,00:30:59,rather than telling you what to do.
00:30:59,00:31:02,"- Absolutely, 'cause I often think"
00:31:02,00:31:04,"where the technical punctuation needs to go,"
00:31:04,00:31:06,when sometimes when you're trying to write something
00:31:06,00:31:09,"that's a joke, the punctuation can really mess up"
00:31:09,00:31:10,the flow of the sentence.
00:31:10,00:31:11,"You think, no, just let me put the comma here."
00:31:11,00:31:12,"I know it doesn't belong there,"
00:31:12,00:31:15,but that's where you'd want the beat to be
00:31:15,00:31:18,"in your free-styler, not a pedant."
00:31:18,00:31:20,"- Yeah, exactly, you're a dexter, a modern day dexter."
00:31:20,00:31:21,- A modern day dexter.
00:31:21,00:31:22,- Yeah.
00:31:22,00:31:23,- Do any of you--
00:31:23,00:31:24,- Serial killer.
00:31:24,00:31:25,(laughing)
00:31:25,00:31:28,(upbeat music)
00:31:28,00:31:33,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:31:33,00:31:34,That is Anna.
00:31:34,00:31:36,My fact this week is that Christians
00:31:36,00:31:39,"watch less porn on Sundays,"
00:31:39,00:31:41,but they do make up for it throughout the rest of the week.
00:31:41,00:31:44,(laughing)
00:31:44,00:31:46,- Gosh.
00:31:46,00:31:48,- Gotta even it out.
00:31:48,00:31:49,- Is that what it meant in the Bible
00:31:49,00:31:51,when it said that on the seventh day he rested?
00:31:51,00:31:52,Is that--
00:31:52,00:31:54,"- Yeah, 'cause you're knackered, aren't you,"
00:31:54,00:31:56,after six days of that?
00:31:56,00:31:58,- Yeah.
00:31:58,00:32:00,"- You obviously haven't studied Genesis that hard,"
00:32:00,00:32:03,but it's day one to six is all porn watching.
00:32:03,00:32:03,- Nice.
00:32:03,00:32:07,"- I read this in the Joseph Henrich book,"
00:32:07,00:32:08,"""The Weirdest People in the World,"""
00:32:08,00:32:11,"which is a brilliant, quite famous book, yeah, yeah."
00:32:11,00:32:13,"Joseph Henrich, the guy who came up with the concept"
00:32:13,00:32:17,"of weird, which is Western educated, industrialized,"
00:32:17,00:32:18,"rich, and democratic."
00:32:18,00:32:20,"And that's what every single one of us is,"
00:32:20,00:32:23,and almost every single person listening will be.
00:32:23,00:32:25,"- Sorry, that's not what it actually,"
00:32:25,00:32:26,that's not where we get the word weird from.
00:32:26,00:32:27,He's just--
00:32:27,00:32:28,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:32:28,00:32:30,"God, God, God. - Sorry, yep."
00:32:30,00:32:33,And it's all a book about how we base
00:32:33,00:32:35,so much of our assumptions on human behavior
00:32:35,00:32:37,"on what we are, which is all of these things."
00:32:37,00:32:40,"And when I say rich, I just mean literally anyone"
00:32:40,00:32:42,who lives in a Western country that has a welfare state.
00:32:42,00:32:45,"So anyway, it's in his book, which is full of interesting"
00:32:45,00:32:48,"stuff, and he writes a bit about monotheistic religions,"
00:32:48,00:32:51,"and he says, yeah, there was a study that monitored"
00:32:51,00:32:53,"poor news across the United States,"
00:32:53,00:32:55,"and in the more Christian states,"
00:32:55,00:32:58,"then there was a big dip in poor news on a Sunday,"
00:32:58,00:33:01,"and it sort of was still quite low on a Monday,"
00:33:01,00:33:03,"but it gradually crept up throughout the week,"
00:33:03,00:33:06,"and it was reaching real highs the following Saturday,"
00:33:06,00:33:07,"and then it plummeted again on a Sunday,"
00:33:07,00:33:10,and it averaged out as the exact same poor news
00:33:10,00:33:13,"as non-Christian states, so they just spread it out differently."
00:33:13,00:33:15,- Is there a real scramble on Saturday night
00:33:15,00:33:16,as you head up to 12 a.m.?
00:33:16,00:33:19,"- So yeah, could you get it out of the way?"
00:33:19,00:33:20,"- Okay, wow."
00:33:20,00:33:21,"- And this obviously is the Sunday effect,"
00:33:21,00:33:22,"so I guess you go to church on Sunday,"
00:33:22,00:33:25,"you get reminded that you have to behave very morally,"
00:33:25,00:33:26,"you're not supposed to watch porn,"
00:33:26,00:33:28,"God doesn't like that kind of thing,"
00:33:28,00:33:31,"and then you forget about it, don't use six days later."
00:33:31,00:33:32,- Wow. - Interesting.
00:33:32,00:33:35,"And a similar thing happens with charity giving as well,"
00:33:35,00:33:37,"I think, with Christians and Muslims."
00:33:37,00:33:39,"- Well, you don't do it on a Sunday?"
00:33:39,00:33:42,"Surely it would be the inverse, you do do it on a Sunday."
00:33:42,00:33:44,"- I mean, it is the other way around, obviously, yes."
00:33:44,00:33:45,(all laughing)
00:33:45,00:33:47,"- Oh, I'm feeling so lovely and relaxed now,"
00:33:47,00:33:49,"I think I can make some charity donations, great."
00:33:49,00:33:52,(all laughing)
00:33:52,00:33:54,"- There was even actually a study in Morocco done,"
00:33:54,00:33:57,"which looked at when the call to prayer was audible,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,"people would give to charity,"
00:33:59,00:34:01,"but it would literally only last a few minutes,"
00:34:01,00:34:04,"so giving to charity would peak for a few minutes,"
00:34:04,00:34:05,"if you don't get there. - We're so suggestable,"
00:34:05,00:34:07,"aren't we? - I know, classic."
00:34:07,00:34:09,"- 'Cause if you ran, let's say, a cold calling thing"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"for charity, you know, I'm ringing up from,"
00:34:11,00:34:14,"you know, like, I can't think of a single charity now,"
00:34:14,00:34:17,"but if you played the call to prayer in the background,"
00:34:17,00:34:18,then that would presumably be a way
00:34:18,00:34:20,of getting more people to give.
00:34:20,00:34:21,"- Really, so if your car broken down"
00:34:21,00:34:23,"and you're ringing your grandmother,"
00:34:23,00:34:24,(all laughing)
00:34:24,00:34:26,can I borrow 500 quid?
00:34:26,00:34:28,"You wanna play them, do us in--"
00:34:28,00:34:30,"- Do it outside the mosque, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:30,00:34:32,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:34:32,00:34:34,"- Put that mosquito down, granny."
00:34:34,00:34:37,(all laughing)
00:34:37,00:34:38,"- Wow. - God, so just back"
00:34:38,00:34:41,"to the headline fact, I'm just picturing on Sunday,"
00:34:41,00:34:44,"all these guys at church sitting at the pews going,"
00:34:44,00:34:45,"""Would you get up till last night?"""
00:34:45,00:34:46,(all laughing)
00:34:46,00:34:49,"""Oh, it's just at home, yeah, me too."""
00:34:49,00:34:52,"- Me too, yeah, oh, it's the same."
00:34:52,00:34:53,"- ""You may now shake hands with the person."""
00:34:53,00:34:57,"No, thank you. (all laughing)"
00:34:57,00:35:00,"- The Sunday effect is very powerful, you know,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,"and it's largely, I think it's almost exclusively"
00:35:02,00:35:04,"a religious thing, you know, there's less of it,"
00:35:04,00:35:06,"sexually, but still, I mean, loads in this country,"
00:35:06,00:35:07,"loads around the world, I found this,"
00:35:07,00:35:11,"in Tonga, you're not allowed to bake bread on a Sunday"
00:35:11,00:35:13,unless there's been a natural disaster.
00:35:13,00:35:14,- Is that right? - Yeah.
00:35:14,00:35:15,- Gosh.
00:35:15,00:35:18,"- And this was a little past in 2016, it's really strange,"
00:35:18,00:35:19,so-- - It makes sense that
00:35:19,00:35:21,stupid laws like that go out of the window
00:35:21,00:35:23,"when you've got a natural disaster, doesn't it?"
00:35:23,00:35:26,- Sundays have been messed up for me quite a bit
00:35:26,00:35:29,"due to religion, since becoming a dad,"
00:35:29,00:35:34,because I like to take my boys on the weekend to toy shops
00:35:34,00:35:36,"and one of the biggest, if not the biggest independent"
00:35:36,00:35:38,"toy shop in the country is called The Entertainer,"
00:35:38,00:35:41,"which is fantastic, it's got so many of my favorite toys,"
00:35:41,00:35:43,"sorry, their favorite toys in there,"
00:35:43,00:35:46,and I didn't realize this old limited edition
00:35:46,00:35:48,"Ringo Stardoll, still."
00:35:48,00:35:49,"- Oh, it's a Ben Elton Barbie."
00:35:49,00:35:51,(all laughing)
00:35:51,00:35:55,"- Oh my God, a matching, a Ben Elton Barbie."
00:35:55,00:35:57,"Please get onto it, Michelle."
00:35:57,00:36:01,"- Shiny suit, old school microphone, what else?"
00:36:01,00:36:03,- What about the Tory government in the '80s?
00:36:03,00:36:05,- Pull the string on his back.
00:36:05,00:36:07,"- Socialist opinions, go out."
00:36:07,00:36:08,Perfect for any child.
00:36:08,00:36:11,"- So it's shut on Sundays because the creator of it,"
00:36:11,00:36:14,"a man called Gary Grant, has made it so"
00:36:14,00:36:16,"because he's religious and he doesn't allow for it to be,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,and also you can't get Harry Potter toys there
00:36:18,00:36:21,because he thinks Harry Potter encourages witchcraft
00:36:21,00:36:22,"and that's very un-Christian,"
00:36:22,00:36:23,"so if you want your Harry Potter toys,"
00:36:23,00:36:24,you don't go there.
00:36:24,00:36:25,- 'Cause Harry Potter has been very big
00:36:25,00:36:28,"over the last decade, more than that in fact,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,and the number of witches around
00:36:30,00:36:31,is absolutely through the roof.
00:36:31,00:36:32,- It's gone crazy.
00:36:32,00:36:33,- It's awful. - He's doing his bit.
00:36:33,00:36:36,"- Yeah, you can't walk 10 meters down the street."
00:36:36,00:36:39,- Before you get turned into a frog these days.
00:36:39,00:36:42,"- So Gary Grant, the shop started in Amisham."
00:36:42,00:36:44,He bought it from someone and took it over.
00:36:44,00:36:46,"- Amisham, we should say, outskirts of London."
00:36:46,00:36:47,"- Outskirts of London, yeah."
00:36:47,00:36:49,- It's in the UK. - It's in the UK.
00:36:49,00:36:50,- It's in the UK.
00:36:50,00:36:52,- I'd say it's not globally famous.
00:36:52,00:36:53,"- Oh, okay."
00:36:53,00:36:53,"- If there are like,"
00:36:53,00:36:55,"most people listening, for instance,"
00:36:55,00:36:57,it's unlikely that we're familiar with Amisham.
00:36:57,00:37:00,"- So he's, I looked into it just to see,"
00:37:00,00:37:02,is it a particularly religious place?
00:37:02,00:37:04,I looked at notable people from there.
00:37:04,00:37:07,"So the people I found there are Tim Rice,"
00:37:07,00:37:08,"who wrote Jesus Christ Superstar,"
00:37:08,00:37:11,"and Joseph, and it's a very biblical sort of work."
00:37:11,00:37:14,"Katie Brand, the comedian, who used to be very religious."
00:37:14,00:37:17,He used to talk in tongues and all that sort of stuff.
00:37:17,00:37:18,"- Yeah, okay. - It's actually something."
00:37:18,00:37:22,"Cindy Gallo, who started a company called"
00:37:22,00:37:25,"Make Love Not Porn, which is less religious,"
00:37:25,00:37:28,but on topic for the porn not being watched here.
00:37:28,00:37:28,- What is that?
00:37:28,00:37:30,"- I think it's about sort of positive sex,"
00:37:30,00:37:33,"and personal sex rather than, yeah, yeah."
00:37:33,00:37:35,"- It's saying that sex is a wonderful, natural thing,"
00:37:35,00:37:38,"and it's good for you, fun, it's loving,"
00:37:38,00:37:39,and it can be all these wonderful things.
00:37:39,00:37:40,"- Yeah, okay, okay."
00:37:40,00:37:43,- And she sells stuff in The Entertainer.
00:37:43,00:37:45,- She's got the dolls.
00:37:45,00:37:49,They're quite a lot bigger than the Ben Elton Barbie.
00:37:49,00:37:50,"And then last of all,"
00:37:50,00:37:52,"there is the Welsh International Footballer,"
00:37:52,00:37:54,"Simon Church, who is not religious."
00:37:54,00:37:55,"- Of course, Dan."
00:37:55,00:37:57,Have you gone through the phone book under Amisham?
00:37:57,00:37:59,"I don't know, I know that doesn't exist."
00:37:59,00:38:01,What is this weird conspiracy theory of putting out?
00:38:01,00:38:02,- It's just interesting when you notice
00:38:02,00:38:04,there's a lot of Christian connections.
00:38:04,00:38:07,"- Seeming of massively famous sports people,"
00:38:07,00:38:08,"like, what was he called?"
00:38:08,00:38:11,"- Simon Church. - Simon Church, good grief."
00:38:11,00:38:15,The one famous person who was religious
00:38:15,00:38:17,"was Jonathan Edwards, who still, I think,"
00:38:17,00:38:19,has the World Triple Jump record.
00:38:19,00:38:21,- Okay.
00:38:21,00:38:22,"- If not, he had it quite recently,"
00:38:22,00:38:24,but he was such a devout Christian
00:38:24,00:38:26,that he refused to jump on Sundays.
00:38:26,00:38:28,- What a great way to beat him.
00:38:28,00:38:29,"- Wait, wait, wait."
00:38:29,00:38:33,"Would he hop and skip, but not jump?"
00:38:33,00:38:35,- He refused to compete on Sundays.
00:38:35,00:38:37,"I don't know if during his normal life,"
00:38:37,00:38:38,he was a lot to jump up and down on.
00:38:38,00:38:39,"- And here comes Jonathan Edwards,"
00:38:39,00:38:41,"absolutely plowing into the hurdles,"
00:38:41,00:38:43,as he does every Sunday.
00:38:43,00:38:46,He's now dragging 14 hurdles behind him.
00:38:46,00:38:49,"- Man, he's going to have this."
00:38:49,00:38:50,- So what would happen?
00:38:50,00:38:53,"- Well, he just, in the 1991 World Championships,"
00:38:53,00:38:54,he just didn't compete.
00:38:54,00:38:55,"He would have probably won the weight,"
00:38:55,00:38:57,but he didn't want to do it 'cause it was on a Sunday.
00:38:57,00:38:59,"And he went on to host Songs of Praise,"
00:38:59,00:39:00,so he's quite famous.
00:39:00,00:39:01,- Did he?
00:39:01,00:39:02,- Yeah.
00:39:02,00:39:03,- Did not know that.
00:39:03,00:39:06,"- And he became an atheist when, this is quite ironic,"
00:39:06,00:39:09,so he was reading about the road to Damascus
00:39:09,00:39:12,"when Saint Paul became a Catholic, okay?"
00:39:12,00:39:15,Saint Paul converted when he saw a light
00:39:15,00:39:18,on the road to Damascus and it made him turn round
00:39:18,00:39:19,and stop being a tax collector
00:39:19,00:39:21,"and become an apostle of Jesus, right?"
00:39:21,00:39:22,"- Yeah, okay."
00:39:22,00:39:25,"- But he, Jonathan Edwards, read that Saint Paul"
00:39:25,00:39:27,might have had an epileptic fit
00:39:27,00:39:29,"and not seen a light after all,"
00:39:29,00:39:32,and he became an atheist after reading that explanation.
00:39:32,00:39:35,"So ironically, he'd read about the road to Damascus"
00:39:35,00:39:38,and had like a reverse road to Damascus moment.
00:39:38,00:39:39,"- Yeah, brilliant."
00:39:39,00:39:41,- Was he too old to still compete at this point?
00:39:41,00:39:43,"- He was, yeah, that was after he'd..."
00:39:43,00:39:46,"- What a shame, doubly piss you off, wasn't it?"
00:39:46,00:39:47,When Sundays are now available to you.
00:39:47,00:39:50,"- Yeah, I could have had that in 1991."
00:39:50,00:39:52,- And who's this bursting onto the track?
00:39:52,00:39:54,"My goodness, an elderly Jonathan Edwards."
00:39:54,00:39:56,"He's behind everyone else, he's losing badly."
00:39:56,00:39:57,He's lost.
00:39:57,00:40:04,"- In 1686, there was a treatise written by a clergyman"
00:40:04,00:40:07,"called John Baptiste Thierre, and it was very famous,"
00:40:07,00:40:09,"big deal, and this was around the time"
00:40:09,00:40:12,when people thought laughing was really bad
00:40:12,00:40:16,and he gave such strict rules on when you're allowed to laugh.
00:40:16,00:40:20,"So he said, ""You're only ever allowed to laugh discreetly"
00:40:20,00:40:24,"""and never on work days, Sundays."""
00:40:24,00:40:26,So that does cover quite a lot of the day.
00:40:26,00:40:31,"""Lent days, advent, or holy days."""
00:40:31,00:40:35,"- So you're basically, you've got about 30 Saturdays"
00:40:35,00:40:36,and you're allowed to.
00:40:36,00:40:37,- Go like your sister.
00:40:37,00:40:39,"Well, you're not masturbating on a Saturday,"
00:40:39,00:40:40,so I suppose you've got time.
00:40:40,00:40:41,"- You are, aren't you?"
00:40:41,00:40:42,That's your big day.
00:40:42,00:40:44,"Got between laughing and masturbating,"
00:40:44,00:40:46,but that's a hell of a day.
00:40:46,00:40:48,- Can you do them simultaneously?
00:40:48,00:40:49,- You're gonna have to.
00:40:49,00:40:50,- What are you doing in there?
00:40:50,00:40:50,- I'm laughing.
00:40:50,00:40:53,"- Don't come in, I'm laughing."
00:40:53,00:40:55,(laughing)
00:40:55,00:40:57,(upbeat music)
00:40:57,00:41:02,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:41:02,00:41:04,and that is Andy.
00:41:04,00:41:06,- My fact is that at least four seconds
00:41:06,00:41:09,of the film Avatar was funded by Wayne Rooney.
00:41:12,00:41:14,- But it's just that bit where there's an amazing strike
00:41:14,00:41:17,"on goal, isn't there, by one of the Navi people,"
00:41:17,00:41:18,and then it's back to the plot line.
00:41:18,00:41:19,- So amazing.
00:41:19,00:41:20,"- For any international listeners,"
00:41:20,00:41:21,Wayne Rooney is a big footballer.
00:41:21,00:41:22,"He's probably, he might be globally famous."
00:41:22,00:41:24,"- He plays in America, yeah."
00:41:24,00:41:25,"- I did, okay, okay."
00:41:25,00:41:26,- At least the Americans might know him.
00:41:26,00:41:27,"- Well, he's a footballer,"
00:41:27,00:41:29,formerly nicknamed the spud-faced nipper.
00:41:29,00:41:32,(laughing)
00:41:32,00:41:34,"- I am a big football fan,"
00:41:34,00:41:36,and I've never come across that nickname.
00:41:36,00:41:37,- I think it's the one thing I heard about him
00:41:37,00:41:40,"in probably, you know, 2002, and it's just stuck."
00:41:41,00:41:43,"Anyway, this is from a book by a colleague of mine,"
00:41:43,00:41:45,"actually, from Private Eye called Richard Brooks,"
00:41:45,00:41:47,"and the book is called The Great Tax Robbery,"
00:41:47,00:41:52,and this is about a tax scheme that was set up
00:41:52,00:41:57,"which included investing in movies,"
00:41:57,00:42:01,and it meant you could claim a large amount of tax off.
00:42:01,00:42:03,"So Mr. Rooney put in at least 100,000 pounds,"
00:42:03,00:42:05,"'cause I think that was, sorry."
00:42:05,00:42:08,- There's just Colin who's spud-faced.
00:42:08,00:42:10,- Try and make up to him after that sanderous Colin.
00:42:10,00:42:11,- Sorry.
00:42:11,00:42:15,"- He put 100,000 pounds in the scheme,"
00:42:15,00:42:17,"and the film is 162 minutes long,"
00:42:17,00:42:21,"and it costs 237 million pounds, I think."
00:42:21,00:42:23,"Oh, maybe dollars."
00:42:23,00:42:24,"Anyway, the math works out roughly at that."
00:42:24,00:42:27,"Oh, hang on, a pound is worth a dollar these days, fine."
00:42:27,00:42:28,- A time of record.
00:42:28,00:42:31,"- Yeah, and sadly, we'll probably never know"
00:42:31,00:42:32,which four seconds.
00:42:32,00:42:36,I did actually write to Wayne Rooney's people
00:42:36,00:42:38,asking which four seconds.
00:42:38,00:42:42,"- They don't allocate money to, what?"
00:42:42,00:42:44,- There isn't a specific four seconds.
00:42:44,00:42:48,"- I just thought maybe for special investors,"
00:42:48,00:42:50,"they would say, oh, this is what you're,"
00:42:50,00:42:51,this is what it's helped fund.
00:42:51,00:42:53,"- Like if it was a Kickstarter, they might say,"
00:42:53,00:42:56,"well, your 100 grand went to this four seconds."
00:42:56,00:42:57,"- Exactly, or you know,"
00:42:57,00:42:59,funded the development of this particular animal
00:42:59,00:43:00,in the Avatar jungle.
00:43:00,00:43:02,"And then that bit in Avatar, isn't there,"
00:43:02,00:43:04,"when Bob Geldoff actually took back his 100,000,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,"and it's just missing four seconds, isn't it,"
00:43:06,00:43:08,during the film?
00:43:08,00:43:10,"- Yeah, they haven't got back to me yet, but, right."
00:43:10,00:43:12,"- If you go on this scheme, they have on their website,"
00:43:12,00:43:13,"which still exists,"
00:43:13,00:43:16,it shows all of the movies that they invested in.
00:43:16,00:43:17,- Really?
00:43:17,00:43:19,"- And they include Sean of the Dead,"
00:43:19,00:43:21,Sharknado 2.
00:43:21,00:43:22,- Brilliant.
00:43:22,00:43:24,- And a movie called Brooklyn.
00:43:24,00:43:25,And the interesting thing about that
00:43:25,00:43:28,"is that David Beckham was also an investor,"
00:43:28,00:43:30,and he has a son called Brooklyn.
00:43:30,00:43:31,- True.
00:43:31,00:43:33,- So he gave some money for Brooklyn
00:43:33,00:43:35,and also created another Brooklyn.
00:43:35,00:43:36,- Brilliant.
00:43:36,00:43:37,- Very nice.
00:43:37,00:43:38,- Nice.
00:43:38,00:43:39,"- Great movie, by the way."
00:43:39,00:43:40,- Coincidence.
00:43:40,00:43:41,- But they didn't think the scheme was still going.
00:43:41,00:43:42,I thought it'd been kind of shut down.
00:43:42,00:43:45,"- Well, they have a website with all the different movies."
00:43:45,00:43:46,"- Oh, fair enough, yeah."
00:43:46,00:43:47,"- And so there was a big list of people,"
00:43:47,00:43:48,it's not just Wayne Rooney.
00:43:48,00:43:50,"- It's not just Wayne Rooney, really."
00:43:50,00:43:53,"- No, but so like David Beckham, Andrew Lloyd Webber,"
00:43:53,00:43:56,"there's, I saw him in the park the other day."
00:43:56,00:43:59,"- Yeah, I wonder where this anecdote is going,"
00:43:59,00:44:00,probably no way.
00:44:00,00:44:01,"- Oh, absolutely, no way, yeah."
00:44:01,00:44:04,"Actually, Dan mentioned Tim Rice a while ago,"
00:44:04,00:44:05,"and I thought about jumping in with it then,"
00:44:05,00:44:09,but I'm so glad I held fire.
00:44:09,00:44:11,"- No, there is a good anecdote with this,"
00:44:11,00:44:12,'cause you did mention it.
00:44:12,00:44:17,"- Yeah, yeah, he was, his dog was terrorizing a Gosling."
00:44:17,00:44:19,- Ryan Gosling.
00:44:19,00:44:22,"- Yeah, Ryan Gosling is a real Freddy cat."
00:44:22,00:44:24,"No, no, no, his dog was barking at a tiny,"
00:44:24,00:44:27,"tiny baby Gosling, and I was so shocked"
00:44:27,00:44:28,"that it was Andrew Lloyd Webber that I forgot to say,"
00:44:28,00:44:31,"oh, I think actually it's meant to be on a leash in this bit."
00:44:31,00:44:34,And I wouldn't have had this.
00:44:34,00:44:36,"- I've seen the main point, which is that I mentioned"
00:44:36,00:44:38,"on the show that he hated the movie ""Cats"" so much"
00:44:38,00:44:41,that he went out and bought a dog and pissed him off so much.
00:44:41,00:44:42,And you've now seen the dog.
00:44:42,00:44:45,"- I've seen the dog, yeah, it's a nice dog."
00:44:45,00:44:46,"- Well, that's not very nice."
00:44:46,00:44:48,Doesn't look like it was terrorizing a baby goose.
00:44:48,00:44:49,- Just doing what dogs do.
00:44:49,00:44:52,"It's the owner's fault, it's never a problem dog,"
00:44:52,00:44:53,it's a problem owner.
00:44:53,00:44:54,"- You're right, blame the parents."
00:44:54,00:44:58,"- So Bob Geldorf and David Beckham, Roy Keane."
00:44:58,00:45:01,(laughing)
00:45:01,00:45:04,"- Wanna slug off Roy Keane now, I think, good luck."
00:45:04,00:45:06,- Geldorf reckons he owns a brief second.
00:45:06,00:45:09,"So maybe his 100,000 was used on catering or something"
00:45:09,00:45:12,and then a tiny bit for the film.
00:45:12,00:45:13,- Lots of men.
00:45:13,00:45:16,Do you think women aren't as prone to investing in shit films
00:45:16,00:45:18,just as a way of avoiding paying taxes recently?
00:45:18,00:45:19,"- Yeah, I don't know."
00:45:19,00:45:20,- Could be.
00:45:20,00:45:24,- Is the biggest grossing movie of all time
00:45:24,00:45:25,technically a shit film?
00:45:25,00:45:27,- I was maybe had a shark knee doing my head.
00:45:27,00:45:28,"- Oh, how dare you."
00:45:28,00:45:29,That's a brilliant film.
00:45:29,00:45:29,"- ""Shutnait"" or two?"
00:45:29,00:45:30,"- Oh, even better."
00:45:30,00:45:32,Is that what we're talking about?
00:45:32,00:45:32,"Yeah, yeah."
00:45:32,00:45:35,"- For example, ""The Sequel"" being better than the original."
00:45:35,00:45:37,"- Just like ""Terminator"" and ""Alien""."
00:45:37,00:45:39,"Although ""Alien"", ""Alien"" was James Cameron as well,"
00:45:39,00:45:40,wasn't it? - It was.
00:45:40,00:45:41,"- James Cameron, this is, again,"
00:45:41,00:45:43,"the thing about ""Avatar"" is it's the biggest film"
00:45:43,00:45:45,"of all time, the biggest grossing film of all time,"
00:45:45,00:45:47,"and I think maybe ""Avengers"" might be in it."
00:45:47,00:45:49,- It did for a while.
00:45:49,00:45:50,"- So then it re-overtook, didn't it?"
00:45:50,00:45:51,- It's a really interesting story.
00:45:51,00:45:53,"Sorry to derail your second hand here,"
00:45:53,00:45:54,"but when it came out initially,"
00:45:54,00:45:56,it came out in China in 3D
00:45:56,00:45:59,and there was this big controversy.
00:45:59,00:46:00,"- Sorry, which one are you talking about?"
00:46:00,00:46:01,"- ""Avatar"" the first movie."
00:46:01,00:46:02,"There was a big controversy,"
00:46:02,00:46:04,which it's really hard to get to the bottom
00:46:04,00:46:05,"of what really happened,"
00:46:05,00:46:07,but a lot of the 3D showings of it in China
00:46:07,00:46:09,were pulled from the cinemas.
00:46:09,00:46:11,And the story goes that the reason that happened is
00:46:11,00:46:12,"China had a domestic film,"
00:46:12,00:46:14,"which was ""Confucius"" with Chaoyang Fat,"
00:46:14,00:46:17,which they wanted to really dominate the box office
00:46:17,00:46:18,"and ""Avatar"" was doing that."
00:46:18,00:46:21,"So they took the 3D movie out and left the 2D in,"
00:46:21,00:46:23,but it really hurt their box office amount in China.
00:46:23,00:46:26,It still became the biggest box office hit of all time
00:46:26,00:46:30,"until the ""Avengers"" end game came along and overtook it."
00:46:30,00:46:32,"However, in the lead-up for ""Avatar"" the second movie,"
00:46:32,00:46:34,"which is coming out this year,"
00:46:34,00:46:35,they put a re-release of the original.
00:46:35,00:46:38,"And in China specifically,"
00:46:38,00:46:42,"where the box office has now boosted it back over ""Avengers""."
00:46:42,00:46:44,"- Do you think, did James come and have a sly word"
00:46:44,00:46:47,"with Xi Jinping on the side and say, ""Look, mate,"
00:46:47,00:46:47,"do me a favor?"""
00:46:47,00:46:49,- Do me a sly word.
00:46:49,00:46:51,"- The China thing, by the way,"
00:46:51,00:46:53,"the place where it's based is,"
00:46:53,00:46:55,"I haven't seen ""Avatar"", but is it called Pandora?"
00:46:55,00:46:56,"- Yeah, Pandora."
00:46:56,00:47:00,"So it's based, apparently, on a place called Zhangjiajie,"
00:47:00,00:47:01,which is in China.
00:47:01,00:47:03,It's a national forest park.
00:47:03,00:47:05,"And in fact, it was the first in China."
00:47:05,00:47:07,"And it's got these amazing pillars,"
00:47:07,00:47:11,"like there's a place in Greece called Monastero,"
00:47:11,00:47:11,"which is more famous,"
00:47:11,00:47:14,which is like the kind of big bits of rock
00:47:14,00:47:16,that just kind of stick up from the ground.
00:47:16,00:47:21,"Anyway, supposedly Pandora was based on this area."
00:47:21,00:47:22,"And in this area,"
00:47:22,00:47:25,they also have the world's tallest lift.
00:47:25,00:47:26,(all laughing)
00:47:26,00:47:27,"- The world's tallest outdoor lift, I should say."
00:47:27,00:47:29,"- Okay, so I've got a question."
00:47:29,00:47:32,"Is it the shaft that's tallest, or is it the lift?"
00:47:32,00:47:33,"When you say the tallest lift,"
00:47:33,00:47:35,is it lift a giraffe could walk into and be fine?
00:47:35,00:47:37,"- I honestly haven't written down which it is,"
00:47:37,00:47:38,but I'm pretty shocked.
00:47:38,00:47:41,It's taller than any buildings in London.
00:47:41,00:47:43,"It's taller than the shard, for instance."
00:47:43,00:47:45,It's 326 meters high.
00:47:45,00:47:48,The shard is 309 meters high.
00:47:48,00:47:49,I'm assuming that is the shaft.
00:47:49,00:47:51,"- That's probably the shaft, not the lift."
00:47:51,00:47:52,'Cause imagine the shaft.
00:47:52,00:47:53,- If that's the--
00:47:53,00:47:55,"- Well, it might just be one floor it's going up,"
00:47:55,00:47:58,but it happens to be very taller.
00:47:58,00:47:59,"- But though it is, it's the shaft."
00:47:59,00:48:00,- That's so cool.
00:48:00,00:48:02,- And it's so that you can get up to a viewing platform
00:48:02,00:48:04,to see the area.
00:48:04,00:48:07,"- But Shangjia Ji, which is the mountain range,"
00:48:07,00:48:08,"they've named one of the columns,"
00:48:08,00:48:09,"Avatar Hallelujah Mountain,"
00:48:09,00:48:10,and it's because of the film.
00:48:10,00:48:13,So China had a very problematic relationship
00:48:13,00:48:15,"with this film initially, and it's really come good."
00:48:15,00:48:17,- 'Cause they did say that one of the reasons
00:48:17,00:48:20,they might have pulled it is because the Chinese people
00:48:20,00:48:24,"might have empathized with the blue people in Avatar,"
00:48:24,00:48:27,and it might have shown them their own plight.
00:48:27,00:48:28,'Cause like a lot of Chinese people
00:48:28,00:48:30,were being kicked out of the houses
00:48:30,00:48:32,"so they could build new cities, all that kind of thing."
00:48:32,00:48:35,- An Avatar is about a colonial invasion
00:48:35,00:48:36,"of blue people, isn't it?"
00:48:36,00:48:38,"- Yes, it is."
00:48:38,00:48:40,There are these things in the world of Avatar.
00:48:40,00:48:45,"They're called the Banshee, and they're basically dragons."
00:48:45,00:48:46,I'm just saying that quietly
00:48:46,00:48:48,because James Cameron very strongly denies
00:48:48,00:48:50,"that they're dragons, but yeah."
00:48:50,00:48:52,"- And he can't hear softly, so can you."
00:48:52,00:48:54,(laughing)
00:48:54,00:48:55,- He's lost so much hearing
00:48:55,00:48:57,from filming Aliens and Terminator 2.
00:48:57,00:48:59,"No, but they're, you know, they're--"
00:48:59,00:49:00,- What can they do?
00:49:00,00:49:01,"Can they breathe fire and fly,"
00:49:01,00:49:02,and they have tails and they're like lizards?
00:49:02,00:49:04,"- The last three things, not the first one."
00:49:04,00:49:05,I don't think they breathe fire.
00:49:05,00:49:06,"Anyway, I mean, they're pretty dragon."
00:49:06,00:49:07,"- I mean, one's called Puff."
00:49:07,00:49:09,(laughing)
00:49:09,00:49:13,- But they had to come up with an entire workout
00:49:13,00:49:15,for the cast so they could ride
00:49:15,00:49:18,these fictional CGI animals
00:49:18,00:49:20,because he wanted them to have a very realistic style.
00:49:20,00:49:22,"You know, they were filming all this motion capture stuff,"
00:49:22,00:49:24,kind of the golem-y style of filming.
00:49:24,00:49:25,- Yeah.
00:49:25,00:49:28,- So they created the Banshee Buns of Steel workout
00:49:28,00:49:31,so that they could be filmed riding these things.
00:49:31,00:49:32,- That's cool.
00:49:32,00:49:34,"- And when they filmed them, they, you know,"
00:49:34,00:49:35,you might get the actors.
00:49:35,00:49:38,"So Zoe Saldana is one of the two stars of it,"
00:49:38,00:49:41,and she has to jump onto one of these things
00:49:41,00:49:42,at various points in the film.
00:49:42,00:49:43,"And, you know, you might think,"
00:49:43,00:49:46,"oh, we'll just film her jumping onto a saddle"
00:49:46,00:49:47,or a vaulting horse or whatever
00:49:47,00:49:49,that would just use that motion capture.
00:49:49,00:49:51,They actually filmed her jumping onto a massive stuntman
00:49:51,00:49:54,"wearing a saddle because they want,"
00:49:54,00:49:55,James Cameron was so insistent.
00:49:55,00:49:57,"He wanted the real, you know,"
00:49:57,00:49:59,"I want her to be jumping onto a living being, you know,"
00:49:59,00:50:02,they get that flex of the movement.
00:50:02,00:50:04,"- Sorry, where was the stuntman wearing a saddle?"
00:50:04,00:50:06,"'Cause he'd have to be on all fours, in which case--"
00:50:06,00:50:07,- He must have been on all fours.
00:50:07,00:50:08,"- Must have been, yeah."
00:50:08,00:50:09,- But then he's very small.
00:50:09,00:50:10,She has to crouch down to climb onto him.
00:50:10,00:50:12,Or was he wearing it on his head
00:50:12,00:50:14,and then she has to vault onto him.
00:50:14,00:50:15,- He had stilts on each.
00:50:15,00:50:17,"Yeah, I know what you're saying."
00:50:17,00:50:19,He could have been on a platform.
00:50:19,00:50:21,"- Maybe he was on a platform, yeah."
00:50:21,00:50:22,"- Yeah, no, great point."
00:50:22,00:50:23,I haven't seen footage of it.
00:50:23,00:50:24,I've only read descriptions.
00:50:24,00:50:27,- He sounds like he was quite an atrocious director
00:50:27,00:50:30,"to work for in that sort of, he really pushed people"
00:50:30,00:50:32,and was really rude and he got his way.
00:50:32,00:50:34,"And if you didn't do things and you were in a lot of trouble,"
00:50:34,00:50:36,one thing that he would do is he would wear a hat
00:50:36,00:50:38,"on the first day of filming,"
00:50:38,00:50:41,"which would have on it, H-M-F-I-C."
00:50:41,00:50:43,And that would stand for head motherfucker in charge.
00:50:43,00:50:47,"And the idea was, don't get in my way."
00:50:47,00:50:49,- Kate Winslet said she would never work with him again
00:50:49,00:50:52,because of how much he pushed her on the Titanic movie.
00:50:52,00:50:53,"He should almost drowned, for example,"
00:50:53,00:50:55,even though she's in the latest avatar.
00:50:55,00:50:56,- She had the door.
00:50:56,00:50:57,(all laughing)
00:50:57,00:51:01,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:51:01,00:51:02,- We should probably talk a little bit about
00:51:02,00:51:04,"how, why it was such a big deal, I suppose,"
00:51:04,00:51:07,'cause it was so groundbreaking in the technology it used.
00:51:07,00:51:08,It sounds really cool to act on
00:51:08,00:51:10,because actors were so used to having to wear
00:51:10,00:51:12,these really hefty prosthetics
00:51:12,00:51:13,if they wanted to play anything
00:51:13,00:51:15,that didn't look exactly like a human.
00:51:15,00:51:19,"So they, I think it was inspired by Spider-Man 2"
00:51:19,00:51:22,where Alfred Molina plays the villain.
00:51:22,00:51:24,And he was the-- - Doctor Octopus.
00:51:24,00:51:25,"- Yeah, Doctor Octopus."
00:51:25,00:51:28,And they first used motion capture on his face
00:51:28,00:51:31,"by putting lots of little beads all over it,"
00:51:31,00:51:32,like reflective beads.
00:51:32,00:51:36,And then a camera films all of those reflective beads.
00:51:36,00:51:39,And automatically they can pick up the data
00:51:39,00:51:40,"of exactly how they move,"
00:51:40,00:51:42,depending on what facial expressions you make.
00:51:42,00:51:44,And then a computer can regenerate
00:51:44,00:51:46,those exact facial expressions.
00:51:46,00:51:50,"- If you smile, then it makes your octopus man smile."
00:51:50,00:51:50,- Exactly.
00:51:50,00:51:52,"- But in a really realistic way,"
00:51:52,00:51:54,because otherwise they're just stretching a smile
00:51:54,00:51:58,"on a computer screen, it looks terrible, you know, yeah."
00:51:58,00:52:00,- And it's really cool because it actually means
00:52:00,00:52:02,that you don't have to have a camera in the right place ever
00:52:02,00:52:05,because the computers are capturing
00:52:05,00:52:07,every single angle of your movement.
00:52:07,00:52:10,"You can decide later on when you're doing the computer,"
00:52:10,00:52:12,"you know, computer generated film editing,"
00:52:12,00:52:13,which angle you want.
00:52:13,00:52:14,"You'd be like, ""Actually, I want the camera"
00:52:14,00:52:16,"on this side of them."""
00:52:16,00:52:17,And the computer's got all the data
00:52:17,00:52:19,for how your face moves. - That's so clever.
00:52:19,00:52:20,I hadn't thought of that.
00:52:20,00:52:21,There's one big problem with Avatar.
00:52:21,00:52:22,- Oh yeah?
00:52:22,00:52:24,- The breasts.
00:52:24,00:52:25,- No one's paid to touch them.
00:52:25,00:52:27,(laughing)
00:52:27,00:52:29,- I read a report of the science of Avatar
00:52:29,00:52:31,"and whether, you know, whether this world"
00:52:31,00:52:33,could exist in all of these aspects.
00:52:33,00:52:35,"And there was one very snotty line in it that said,"
00:52:35,00:52:39,"the females, female navi, aliens, even have breasts,"
00:52:39,00:52:43,even though Cameron admits they aren't placental mammals.
00:52:43,00:52:44,- That's a good point.
00:52:44,00:52:46,"- What a, what a, what a blood hole."
00:52:46,00:52:48,"- That is, yeah. - Well, because he was"
00:52:48,00:52:50,"very careful, he had all these years to put it together."
00:52:50,00:52:54,"So the main, like he had a botanist on set"
00:52:54,00:52:57,who did all of the naming of the plants.
00:52:57,00:52:59,He had a linguistics expert professor come in
00:52:59,00:53:02,"and write the language, which was up to 1,000 words"
00:53:02,00:53:03,for the movie.
00:53:03,00:53:04,"In fact, you know, it was really odd."
00:53:04,00:53:06,"He did so many from scratch things,"
00:53:06,00:53:08,language and botanist.
00:53:08,00:53:10,But then the sounds that they used for the animals
00:53:10,00:53:12,were taken from Jurassic Park.
00:53:12,00:53:13,"So when you hit, not all of them,"
00:53:13,00:53:15,"but when you hear a bunch of the nuts, yeah."
00:53:15,00:53:17,So they use the T-Rex and they use the Raptor
00:53:17,00:53:19,when it's in the kitchen.
00:53:19,00:53:21,- Did they have famous people in it?
00:53:21,00:53:25,"- Yeah, Zoe Saldana and the Time Worthington wasn't."
00:53:25,00:53:26,"- They weren't kind of mega stars,"
00:53:26,00:53:28,but they were sort of reasonably well known.
00:53:28,00:53:29,- Worthington was homeless at the time.
00:53:29,00:53:31,He was living in his car when he did the audition.
00:53:31,00:53:32,- I read that as well.
00:53:32,00:53:33,"And I wondered if they decided, okay,"
00:53:33,00:53:36,we're going to spend all of our money on this stuff.
00:53:36,00:53:38,Let's get slightly shit erected.
00:53:38,00:53:39,'Cause it doesn't matter.
00:53:39,00:53:41,We're going to put dots on their faces anyway.
00:53:41,00:53:42,"And the sound bit,"
00:53:42,00:53:44,let's just take the stuff from Jurassic Park.
00:53:44,00:53:45,That was fine.
00:53:45,00:53:47,Like they had to save money here.
00:53:47,00:53:49,- How do they get to $200 million?
00:53:49,00:53:51,Just all making everyone blue.
00:53:51,00:53:51,- Those are dots.
00:53:51,00:53:53,So many stickers.
00:53:53,00:53:54,"- One other thing that's spent money on,"
00:53:54,00:53:56,"the cigarette, so Sigourney Weaver is in it."
00:53:56,00:53:58,And she's obviously brilliant.
00:53:58,00:54:00,And she's in it and her character smokes.
00:54:00,00:54:03,But the cigarettes in the film are CGI cigarettes.
00:54:03,00:54:04,And I tried to find out why.
00:54:04,00:54:05,And I read a few articles about this
00:54:05,00:54:06,that I found no explanation.
00:54:06,00:54:09,She held a toothpick and did not see the light.
00:54:09,00:54:11,- Does she just not smoke maybe?
00:54:11,00:54:13,- I can't imagine Sigourney Weaver not smoking.
00:54:13,00:54:15,I can't picture it.
00:54:15,00:54:17,"No, and then he got in loads of trouble"
00:54:17,00:54:19,for depicting smoking in the film.
00:54:19,00:54:21,Various anti-smoking groups said
00:54:21,00:54:23,this is very irresponsible to show
00:54:23,00:54:25,anyone as cool as Sigourney Weaver smoking.
00:54:25,00:54:27,"And he said, but people do smoke."
00:54:27,00:54:30,"- It shows a lot of trust from the actors, doesn't it?"
00:54:30,00:54:33,"That if he's like, yeah, that thing in your hand,"
00:54:33,00:54:35,I'm going to definitely make it a cigarette.
00:54:35,00:54:37,I'm not going to make it anything else.
00:54:37,00:54:39,- Wobble it around a bit and then put it up your bum.
00:54:39,00:54:41,It won't be a cigarette.
00:54:41,00:54:45,"- There's not going to be a tiny dismembered penis, is there?"
00:54:45,00:54:46,- I wasn't thinking that.
00:54:46,00:54:48,I was thinking like a kazoo or something.
00:54:48,00:54:51,"But like, yeah, any kind of thing."
00:54:51,00:54:53,"You don't know, like, that's what I mean."
00:54:53,00:54:56,"If you do a normal movie, you've done your scene"
00:54:56,00:54:58,and you know that that scene is going to be how it is.
00:54:58,00:55:00,"But they could have put anything on your face, couldn't they?"
00:55:00,00:55:01,"- Yeah, they could."
00:55:01,00:55:03,"In fact, I imagine it would be the press of a button"
00:55:03,00:55:06,to redo the entirety of Avatar.
00:55:06,00:55:07,But they're all worms.
00:55:07,00:55:08,(laughing)
00:55:08,00:55:10,- That would be great.
00:55:10,00:55:15,"- Okay, that's it."
00:55:15,00:55:16,That is all of our facts.
00:55:16,00:55:17,Thank you so much for listening.

00:56:18,00:56:21,(laughing)
