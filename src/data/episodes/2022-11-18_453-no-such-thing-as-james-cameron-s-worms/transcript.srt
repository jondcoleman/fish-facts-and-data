00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
 Hi everybody, Dan and Andy here. We've got a couple of quick, exciting announcements before the show begins.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,040
 That's right, we just want to let you know that this December we are going to be playing two live shows,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,960
 our final shows of the year, the Christmas shows, we're going to be at the Bloomsbury Theatre on the 10th of December,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,280
 and we're going to be at our old Stumpin' Ground up the creek on the 14th of December.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,080
 Yes, they're going to be so much fun. They're going to be Christmassy, as Dan says.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,360
 There's going to be a live podcast in each of them, plus an extra bonus half bursting with your fix,

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,560
 with special festive things. Dan's going to do his tinsel, twizzle trick, James is going to eat a sprout.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,120
 And I will show you how to make eggnog. It's going to be a fabulous time.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,160
 That's right. I cannot guarantee any of that will happen. However, what we can guarantee is an awesome, rock and roll night of nerd comedy.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,720
 So do come along to that. And if you can't make it, but you're thinking, hey, I want to still celebrate Christmas in some way with fish.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,800
 Well, we've got some exciting presents for you.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,760
 Yes, we have launched a new range of lovely merchandise.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,040
 We've got beautiful new t-shirts. We've got a fabulous pin bound set.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:11,680
 We've got the official fish book, which is a gorgeous guide to fish, and it's full of facts and games and puzzles and articles and stupid stuff.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,400
 We put that together for our tour earlier this year, and we think it's really great.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,760
 All of these things are available now at no such thing as a fish dot com slash shop.

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,400
 There's a special bundle where you can get all three.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,560
 If you are a fish fan or if you have a fish fan in your life and you think they'd like this as a Christmas present,

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,840
 we think this makes the perfect thing.

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,160
 It's all available globally.

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,080
 And if you order it now, it'll be there in time for Christmas.

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,760
 That's right. So head to know such thing as a fish dot com.

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,960
 You'll find links to those two December live shows.

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,040
 You'll also find links to everything that we've just spoken about in terms of t-shirts and badges and bundles.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,840
 Do get the show tickets.

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,440
 Do buy some Christmas items and do enjoy the following episode.

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:02:09,680
 On with the show. On with the podcast.

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,880
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish,

29
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,000
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,680
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,800
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,960
 And in a particular order here we go.

33
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,160
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:43,000
 OK, my fact this week is that the IK people of Uganda are the standard textbook example of a selfish society

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,640
 where members only look after themselves.

36
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,680
 It turns out they've just been misunderstood this whole time.

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,360
 It's so funny.

38
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,720
 And normally when you say something as a textbook example of something, it's just a figure of speech.

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,800
 And actually these people are used in textbooks about selfishness.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
 They are by anthropologists.

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,080
 So this comes from a study in the 60s by a guy called Colin Turnbull.

42
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,400
 He published a book that described these people called the IK people,

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,280
 sometimes known as the IK people as extraordinarily unfriendly, uncharitable and mean.

44
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,400
 And he called them the Loveless People.

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,760
 It was really quite, it makes quite bad reading.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,400
 Yeah.

47
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,240
 But then later on, a few more anthropologists came round and they looked into what he'd written

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,000
 and found out that he was probably, one, might have just made stuff up.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,880
 But two, it was during a famine that he went to study them.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,720
 And obviously when you're under the stress of a famine, you might act differently than you might do under normal circumstances.

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,840
 Hey, if I have a cup of tea, not delivered on time, I'd turn into a monster.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,160
 That's true.

53
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,240
 But this is, when we say a few years later, am I right in saying it was decades later that finally?

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,440
 Because then that's the problem.

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,320
 No one went back to study the IK people and to find out that it was just they were having a bad couple of years, basically.

56
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,480
 He knew that.

57
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,800
 And actually, as a Turnbull defender, his whole thing, his whole thesis is,

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,680
 this is an example of what happens to human beings when they're having a really bad time.

59
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,800
 He says, for instance, the IK, like the rest of us, are kind, lighthearted, generous and jolly when they can afford to be.

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,240
 But they were very hungry at this stage.

61
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,120
 Therefore, they had to abandon superficial luxuries and be mean.

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,040
 Yes, he's saying all humans are like the IK.

63
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,320
 We're all capable of this.

64
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,280
 But is he then also misrepresented when he made a suggestion to the leaders of Uganda

65
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:36,200
 that they should all be taken off to different bits of Uganda in groups of 10 so that they could effectively stop existing?

66
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,440
 Yeah, no, he's not misrepresented. That's a bad idea.

67
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,280
 Yeah, in answer to your question, the reason why people didn't carry on studying them

68
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,440
 is because the IK people themselves were really upset about this book

69
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,520
 because they were told about it and they didn't trust any...

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,160
 Why?

71
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,360
 Yeah, exactly. They were sensitive as well.

72
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,520
 They didn't trust any more white people to come and study them at any stage for the next 30 years because of this one book.

73
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,560
 Yeah, I've got to say, the write-ups they got were so extreme.

74
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,120
 They were described as a haunting flower of evil in the corner of civilisation's garden.

75
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,080
 Yeah, not good.

76
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,440
 So lots of other writers then wrote more about them.

77
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,800
 So there was a writer called Lewis Thomas who was a pathologist who wrote,

78
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,280
 "They breed without love and they defecate on one another's doorsteps."

79
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,160
 I mean, if someone had written that about me, I would not invite them round for decades.

80
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,240
 Was that in Turnbill's book or did he just add the defecating on doorsteps as an extra?

81
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,360
 I actually think it might have been because another person came called Bernt Hyner

82
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,840
 who basically wrote the text saying everything that Turnbill wrote was wrong.

83
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,360
 He said that the yick told him that if Turnbill was ever to come back,

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,760
 they would force him to eat his own feces.

85
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,200
 Nice! That's a very good fitting punishment for what you've gained.

86
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,680
 Eat your words. Eat your terms more like.

87
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,880
 It's so unfair because these are some of the poorest people on the planet.

88
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,960
 Is it, you know, you've lined up 100 people, they're right at the other end of it in terms of the resources they have.

89
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,520
 And they couldn't do anything right to sort of rectify it, other than, you know, because they stopped people coming in.

90
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,680
 Other than the feces thing.

91
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,640
 Yeah, other than the feces thing.

92
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
 He's just got to wait for that moment.

93
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,440
 But I mean, it's just like, you know, like whenever no such thing as a fish is mentioned on Google,

94
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,400
 some of us have a ping that goes off and we see a mention, right?

95
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,440
 Any time they're like, "Hey, yick, you're in a new book. Are we really?"

96
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,440
 All they say about us, "Oh, that stuff again. Yeah, okay."

97
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,280
 But then, as James says, it's sort of been disproved by other studies, hasn't it?

98
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,840
 And I think the latest one is by a woman called Catherine Townsend who looked at them and said,

99
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,320
 "They behave when you do the dictator test with them,

100
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,680
 which is where you basically give someone in a group a bunch of resources."

101
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,280
 I can't remember what they gave them. Smarties or something.

102
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,240
 Sort of money, basically.

103
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,040
 And it's not whether you share them with people.

104
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
 And yeah, you ask how much you want to share it with people,

105
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,880
 and then they did it in accordance with all other beings.

106
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,520
 And so, Catherine Townsend's thesis is that humans aren't innately really bad,

107
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,360
 because as soon as the famine goes away, this culture of niceness recovers.

108
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,840
 So it's obviously always there.

109
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,760
 It's just like in extreme circumstances, you just physically can't do it anymore.

110
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,800
 Is it possible? I don't want to slander the ick people at all.

111
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,240
 I'm just curious.

112
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,320
 Is it at all possible that when Catherine Townsend went there,

113
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,440
 that it would be like going to North Korea and them showing you around,

114
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,560
 going, "Look at what a wonderful place this is!"

115
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,880
 And everyone is-- Hang on a second.

116
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,360
 Wait, rip off Dan's mask.

117
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,280
 Oh, my God. It's Colin Turnbull.

118
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,480
 Hello!

119
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,680
 I think they have other things to worry about

120
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,520
 than trying to ingratiate themselves to westerners.

121
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,560
 Turnbull gave some words in his work,

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,360
 like from the ick language, which is called "e-chai-tuad."

123
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,240
 But it turns out that a lot of the ones that he put in were wrong.

124
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,160
 And it appears that he went through his whole time with the ick people,

125
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,680
 saying a reply rather than a greeting whenever he met anyone.

126
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,600
 So it's like the equivalent of going down the street

127
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,280
 and whenever you see someone, you know, you're going, "Bye, thanks!"

128
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,960
 Which is very passive-aggressive.

129
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,120
 Yeah, don't worry about me.

130
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,560
 Yeah, you just get on with your life, mate.

131
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,320
 That's where they were rude to him.

132
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,920
 And this is also because he claimed that the person, Lameja,

133
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,720
 who was a guy who he hung out with a lot

134
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,560
 and who taught him the ick language,

135
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,280
 and he said Lameja is an example of a true ick.

136
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,160
 He's like a fundamental ick person.

137
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,400
 And then, Heiner, when he came back, you know, 20, 30 years later,

138
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,480
 said they told him Lameja was not an ick person at all.

139
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,040
 He'd come from a completely different tribe.

140
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,800
 And actually about half the people in Turnbull's book

141
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,480
 come from different tribes.

142
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,760
 Oh, wow.

143
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,080
 And they said Lameja couldn't really speak ick very well.

144
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,920
 He could speak sort of passable ick.

145
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,000
 So God knows what kind of nonsense he was saying.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,160
 Do you want to learn some itche twad?

147
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,040
 Yeah. What's that?

148
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,520
 This is the language of the ick people.

149
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,760
 Oh, nice. OK, yeah, yeah.

150
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
 So the word "dan".

151
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,160
 Oh. Do you know what that means?

152
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,280
 Cool dude.

153
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,680
 Is that, is that feces?

154
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,280
 We have our own bit of nominative determinism on this show.

155
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
 Can you give it to us in an English sentence?

156
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,160
 Replace "dan" in and see if we can.

157
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,400
 OK, "Dan told me a fact and I replied to him, 'Dan.'"

158
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,640
 Bullshit.

159
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,240
 It means exactly or precisely.

160
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,720
 Oh, what about this one?

161
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
 "I looked over into the distance

162
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,440
 and I saw an Anna prancing by."

163
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,320
 Oh, drunk.

164
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,800
 They're not, they haven't based the language on us.

165
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
 I'll say gazellef.

166
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,640
 "It's a male kudu, so pretty close."

167
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,520
 Yeah, and what about this one?

168
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,320
 "I poured some muzz over my plants."

169
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,720
 [LAUGHTER]

170
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,120
 Amazing.

171
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,640
 Is it water?

172
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,320
 It isn't.

173
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,640
 It's a cactus-like tree which you burn

174
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
 and you use the ashes as fertilizer.

175
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,800
 Oh, wow.

176
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,760
 Who is your stand-in next week, actually?

177
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,080
 [LAUGHTER]

178
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,160
 That's great.

179
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,040
 This, Kotlin Turnbull, I just want to,

180
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,840
 while we're sort of saying that he's not

181
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,120
 the worst person because this does make him feel

182
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,400
 like he sort of absolutely ruined a group of people.

183
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,840
 He also studied a group in Zaire, a group of pygmies,

184
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,280
 and he wrote a brilliant book about them

185
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,680
 and he did recordings of their music in Zaire,

186
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,640
 of the pygmies.

187
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,800
 He collected some of their songs

188
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,360
 and he commercially released a few from other tribes as well.

189
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,640
 But the one that he did with the Zaire pygmies

190
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,520
 was "Girls Singing an Initiation Song."

191
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,560
 And that now, as a result of Kotlin Turnbull,

192
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,280
 is going to last for millions of years into the universe

193
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,240
 because it was included on the Voyager 2 Golden Diss.

194
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,120
 Oh, was it?

195
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,080
 And that's down to, yeah, Kotlin Turnbull.

196
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,560
 But he probably mistranslated it and it's actually saying,

197
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
 "Fuck you, aliens, don't come back."

198
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,080
 Earth invaded due to him accidentally including a reply

199
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,440
 instead of a greeting.

200
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,200
 We're fine, thanks.

201
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,040
 We're good.

202
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,760
 The Ike people have some fun ceremonies,

203
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,840
 right to passage.

204
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,760
 Come on.

205
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,000
 So one is the beer of the axes,

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,480
 which actually is not that fun

207
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,880
 if it was me, but it would be fun for you guys.

208
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,120
 And that's basically where to thank the men

209
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,160
 for doing all the farming and harvesting all the fields.

210
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,720
 They can demand beer from the women

211
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,800
 and they all go and gather in the big village center.

212
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,520
 And then every woman has to bring this big vat of beer

213
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,880
 and all the men get to drink it.

214
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,720
 That sounds cool.

215
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,120
 Yeah, I don't think...

216
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,440
 It doesn't say that they stop the women from participating.

217
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,920
 So I'm sure they can get pissed as well.

218
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,400
 There's another ceremony they have called

219
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,440
 "The Blessing of the Seeds,"

220
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,040
 which is, again, good for me,

221
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,360
 but not so good for the rest of you.

222
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,080
 Everyone goes to a special tree.

223
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,480
 They bring their seeds for the year

224
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,960
 and the seeds get blessed.

225
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,000
 And then, again, there's loads and loads of beer.

226
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,400
 And everyone gets to drink the beer,

227
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,200
 but it goes in age order.

228
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,240
 So the oldest person gets to drink first

229
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,400
 and no one's allowed to drink

230
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,240
 until the oldest person's had theirs.

231
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,880
 Oh, that's great.

232
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,080
 You're going to regret that

233
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,840
 because pride will make you down it all.

234
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,640
 And in an hour's time, you're feeling an idiot.

235
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,080
 I'm as young as I've always been.

236
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,880
 So Ike weddings,

237
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,960
 the very start of the wedding,

238
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,360
 they have a thing called the smearing.

239
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,520
 Can you guess what the smearing is?

240
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,360
 It's when you test for a cervical cancer, isn't it?

241
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
 Yeah.

242
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,480
 Is it like an anointment?

243
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,200
 You know, because in the coronation,

244
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,840
 don't we smear our monarchs

245
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,360
 with some ceremonial stuff?

246
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,240
 That's pretty much right.

247
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,920
 So the couple sits side by side

248
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,440
 and they're rubbed with oil by an old woman.

249
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,760
 - Lovely. - So it's pretty much that.

250
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
 The bride then brings the groom to a tree

251
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,960
 and he has to throw a spear at it

252
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,440
 and has to hit the tree.

253
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,720
 And then they go back to the house

254
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,960
 and the bride needs to make like a stew for everyone.

255
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,680
 So it's kind of to show that his skills are in hunting

256
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,760
 and her skills are in the household stuff.

257
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,400
 And the groom has to pay a payment

258
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,240
 for touching the bride's breasts.

259
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,080
 - Is that a pay per touch or is it a?

260
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,920
 - It's a one off.

261
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,760
 - It's a one off.

262
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,680
 It's like all the times I've previously touched them,

263
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,280
 I'm paying off and now,

264
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,800
 or is it I'm paying in advance,

265
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,200
 I'm going to get to touch these breasts forever.

266
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,360
 - I think the understanding is

267
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,080
 that you won't have touched them at that stage

268
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,640
 and you're paying for the opportunity

269
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,680
 to touch them for the first

270
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,200
 and hopefully future touch.

271
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,040
 (all laughing)

272
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,200
 - And the last time, thank you very much.

273
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,280
 - And then you can't rent,

274
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,040
 I don't think it's like a pay per month thing,

275
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,000
 is it, it's all at once.

276
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,680
 - I think it's 2.99 a month

277
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,520
 but if you pay for the full year, it's a lot of money.

278
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,360
 - If you stick in the offercode fish,

279
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,960
 you'll get those breasts for this one pound 50 a month.

280
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,680
 Just on selfishness and the opposite,

281
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,880
 but mostly selfishness.

282
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,160
 Someone around this table,

283
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,120
 probably going to be more selfish than the rest of us.

284
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,960
 - It's you.

285
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,280
 (all laughing)

286
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,120
 - Yes.

287
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,640
 - Is it women?

288
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,680
 - It's something to do with what's happened

289
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,600
 to all of us in the last 24 hours.

290
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,400
 - Oh, Dan had a full English breakfast before he got here.

291
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,240
 - Weirdly, it is Dan,

292
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,720
 but it's not because he had a full English breakfast

293
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,560
 before he got here.

294
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,400
 - Oh, really?

295
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,480
 - Okay, listeners, you've just been let into some insight.

296
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,720
 Apparently the most controversial thing I've ever done

297
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,680
 is had a full English breakfast before today's recording.

298
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,080
 - It's not because of your breakfast, Dan.

299
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,320
 That's the good news.

300
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,840
 (all laughing)

301
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,680
 - What else is Dan,

302
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,200
 how much do you know about Dan's last 24 hours?

303
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,040
 Do we all know this about Dan?

304
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,400
 - And what could possibly top my full English breakfast?

305
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,760
 - We can also mine it by what we know about Dan,

306
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,600
 which is that Dan-

307
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,800
 - Okay, his hair is very scruffy right now.

308
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,560
 So are you saying, like, if you don't shower, maybe-

309
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,400
 - It's not a showering thing.

310
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,960
 - What Dan's done that I haven't, have you?

311
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,440
 - We've all done this in the last 24 hours,

312
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,280
 but Dan probably done a bit less than the rest of us of it.

313
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,320
 Sleep, Dan, you've got a new baby.

314
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,440
 You've probably had a bit less sleep

315
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,240
 than us in the last 24 hours, I guess.

316
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
 I mean, you've got to, you know,

317
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,280
 create time for that full English breakfast.

318
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,440
 (all laughing)

319
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,040
 Sleeplessness, we think, makes you more selfish.

320
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,880
 - It makes you more hungry, I know that much.

321
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,720
 - Yeah.

322
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,160
 (all laughing)

323
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,080
 No, so basically, they looked at this database

324
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
 of charitable donations,

325
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,840
 and they didn't do it with individual surveys.

326
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,120
 They looked at three million charitable donations

327
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,880
 and the days on which they happened.

328
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,800
 And one of the days was after the clocks changed.

329
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,640
 - Oh yeah, really?

330
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,200
 - So, you know, you switch, you change the clocks

331
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,960
 and half the year you get an hour less sleep.

332
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,400
 And donations dropped quite substantially

333
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,240
 the day after people had just a little bit less sleep.

334
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,800
 So that's the theory, you know?

335
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,840
 - 'Cause I always think, you know,

336
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,000
 those chuggers who try and get money off you,

337
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,120
 I always feel like if I have less energy

338
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,880
 to kind of walk straight past them,

339
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,760
 then I'm more likely to give them stuff.

340
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,280
 - Oh, so you're the opposite of that.

341
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,880
 - I feel like it, I might not give you, but.

342
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,200
 - Less energy to walk, if you're not so collapsing.

343
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,040
 You can't put one foot in front of the other.

344
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,880
 - They don't even net.

345
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,720
 (all laughing)

346
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,120
 - They do, like maybe three of them

347
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,760
 are coming from different directions.

348
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,280
 It's like, you know those, is it humpback whales

349
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,840
 that they hunt by making bubbles around the fish

350
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,680
 so that fish can't escape?

351
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,800
 That's how I feel with those guys.

352
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,480
 - Actually, on animals and selfishness,

353
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,760
 it's very hard to find out selfish animals

354
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,680
 because you try every way of Googling most selfish animal

355
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,840
 and obviously everyone says,

356
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,080
 "Oh, humans are the most selfish animal aren't they?"

357
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,240
 And, you know, I think maybe we need to look a bit deeper.

358
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,640
 So, Adele penguins, I think do a funny thing,

359
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,760
 which is disputed by a zoo that has them

360
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,440
 and insists they don't.

361
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,800
 But, Adele penguins, when they all flock to the water's edge,

362
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,200
 you've probably seen them standing on the edge

363
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,520
 of an ice flow or something.

364
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,720
 And they all gather at the water's edge,

365
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,600
 but they're all too nervous to be the first one to jump in,

366
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,520
 as you would because there might be a big old leopard seal

367
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,320
 or something under the water.

368
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,560
 So, you see them shuffling closer and closer

369
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,720
 and then they wait for either one of them to fall in

370
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,760
 to check that they don't get eaten,

371
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,320
 or they do sometimes push each other in.

372
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,040
 - And you can see videos of...

373
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,080
 - Like with a sneaky flipper on the bum kind of pushing in.

374
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,920
 - That's so funny.

375
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
 - A little bit of, yeah, tripping over.

376
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
 - Yeah, haven't we seen videos of a penguin putting its foot out

377
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,240
 and one tripping over as it's walking by?

378
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,560
 - I feel like I've seen that. - Is that Charlie Chaplin?

379
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,400
 That's Charlie Chaplin.

380
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,200
 - I haven't, but I want to.

381
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,280
 - Are you guys...

382
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,760
 Do you guys give money to charity ever?

383
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,600
 - Yeah.

384
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,440
 - Right.

385
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,280
 - No, I refuse.

386
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,120
 - Okay, well...

387
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,960
 - That's a joke.

388
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,640
 - Sorry if the chuggers outside Pinsbury Park Station

389
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,480
 are listening.

390
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,320
 No, I don't.

391
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
 Okay, so this is a really interesting thing.

392
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,600
 In aggregate, people don't tend to like charitable people

393
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,520
 as much as they like other kinds.

394
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,360
 Okay, so...

395
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,040
 - So does that mean I have to stop on my direct debit

396
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,240
 so that people like me?

397
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,400
 - I'm afraid that's what's been standing between you

398
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,520
 and the universal popularity.

399
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,160
 No, this is a study, again, Yale and Oxford this time around,

400
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,680
 and it was in 2018, and people were asked,

401
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,880
 they were given some people and choices over

402
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,000
 whether they'd like to hang out with these people or not, right?

403
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,680
 So they created a scenario, right?

404
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,320
 Granny has won $500 in the lottery.

405
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,320
 Should she give that to her grandson

406
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,040
 who needs to fix his car?

407
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,600
 Or should she give it to a malaria charity?

408
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,560
 Now, obviously overall, it probably does more good

409
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,760
 being given to the charity,

410
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,680
 but people were way more likely to say

411
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,160
 that if they were looking for a friend or a spouse

412
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,520
 or whatever, they would like grandson, car, Granny.

413
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,360
 Yeah.

414
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,960
 - That's interesting because that 500 quid

415
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,760
 goes into a huge pot at the charity,

416
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,920
 but then to the guy who needs his car fixing,

417
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,280
 it solves all of his problems immediately.

418
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,040
 - It solves all of his problems.

419
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,760
 I bet he's got other personal problems.

420
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,880
 - Well, he doesn't know anything about that.

421
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,280
 All we know about this guy is that his car's broken.

422
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,680
 - No, and you can finally drive

423
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,200
 to the Malaria Research Institute

424
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,440
 where he can continue his work.

425
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,120
 Unfortunately, there's no money to fund his ideas.

426
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:11,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two,

427
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,880
 and that is my fact.

428
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,720
 My fact this week is that in 1797,

429
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,600
 an author was so criticized

430
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,640
 for the lack of punctuation in his book

431
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,000
 that in its next printing,

432
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,480
 he included a page at the end

433
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,600
 of nothing but full stops commas

434
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,560
 and exclamation marks for the readers

435
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,760
 to slot in wherever they liked.

436
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,600
 - Amazing.

437
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,440
 - Yeah.

438
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,120
 And it's a really beautiful page at the back.

439
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,680
 It's sort of all the full stops are grouped together

440
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,960
 in one chunk. - It's better in the audio book

441
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,760
 that page, just like silence.

442
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,360
 How would you do an exclamation mark?

443
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,520
 You go, ooh.

444
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,080
 - Yeah.

445
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,720
 How do you do a comma?

446
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,080
 Can't work out and pronounce that.

447
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,280
 - It's just a lot of silence, I think,

448
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,040
 for the full stops in the commas, isn't there?

449
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,880
 - Okay, yeah.

450
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,120
 - And suddenly there's a, oh.

451
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,080
 - So this is a text as the fact says, 1797,

452
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,680
 and it was by a guy called Timothy Dexter

453
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,400
 who was an eccentric American businessman

454
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,480
 who led a life that is so bizarre

455
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,520
 that it's possibly in no way true.

456
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,000
 It's just someone who had myth built upon him and so on.

457
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,400
 But one thing we do know for sure

458
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,680
 is that he published a book called

459
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,200
 A Pickle for the Knowing Ones,

460
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,760
 and it is a book in which he basically downloaded his brain.

461
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,880
 He just said, here's all my thoughts

462
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
 about things, my opinions and so on,

463
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,760
 but he failed to put any punctuation in,

464
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,640
 rendering it completely unreadable

465
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,720
 for anyone who wanted to make sense of it.

466
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,000
 So criticism came in, and in the second printing,

467
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,680
 and it's a self-published book, by the way.

468
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,520
 - Okay.

469
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,840
 - The second run of the self-publication,

470
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,280
 he just added this extra page.

471
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,120
 - Very funny.

472
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,960
 - Yeah, that's cool.

473
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,440
 - Has any, I didn't read,

474
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,280
 I think I read a couple of pages of A Pickle

475
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,120
 for the Knowing Ones.

476
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,940
 - I read a few censuses.

477
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,780
 - Yeah, me too.

478
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,620
 - How the hell?

479
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,880
 - But people seem to say it's a combination

480
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,560
 of total nonsense and some quite wise sort of observations

481
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,920
 about, it's sort of about his thoughts on human beings

482
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,240
 and how to live and all that stuff, isn't it?

483
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,280
 - Well, one write-up of it, soon after it was written,

484
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,680
 said it was a jumble of letters promiscuously gathered together

485
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,000
 and that readers will find it difficult to determine

486
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
 whether most to laugh at the consummate folly

487
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,120
 or despise the vulgarity and profanity of the writer.

488
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,240
 And that was in his actual obituary.

489
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,640
 In 1806, normally they shook the pill a bit.

490
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,560
 - I know, I read the death notice

491
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,520
 in the Rutland Weekly Herald when he died.

492
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,080
 And it was really short, it just said,

493
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,880
 he was a man of great property and a perfect ignoramus.

494
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,720
 - Ooh.

495
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,280
 - They literally just died this guy.

496
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,620
 - Wow.

497
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,120
 - I wonder, like, the books of the time,

498
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,840
 this was published in 1802, but in the late 1700s,

499
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,080
 there were a lot of books that were kind of bizarre

500
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,000
 and maybe was he following in a tradition of surrealism?

501
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,520
 Like Lawrence Stern's "Tristan Shandy" was published

502
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,920
 in the late 1700s.

503
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,400
 - Yeah, I know.

504
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,000
 - And his book would have things like,

505
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,160
 there'd be a blank page or it would have a page

506
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,480
 that was entirely black or there was a chapter

507
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,920
 entirely missing because he said this chapter was so good,

508
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,760
 it just makes all the other chapters look bad

509
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,160
 as I've decided not to include it.

510
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,000
 - It was, yeah.

511
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 - The message that he put at the front

512
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,480
 of the new edition where he said,

513
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,920
 "I've put punctuation in the back,"

514
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,480
 is so full of misspellings.

515
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,880
 Do you think it must be intentional?

516
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,880
 He says, "I put in enough," like A, space, N, U, F.

517
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,160
 And for some reason put that in quote marks,

518
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,080
 which seems like a knowing, ha ha,

519
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,680
 I'm deliberately misspelling that.

520
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,840
 So I put in enough here that they may pepper and salt

521
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,400
 as they please, P-E-P-E-R-S-O-L-T.

522
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,000
 - What a great position to be in as a human

523
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,400
 that just no one knows whether you meant it or not.

524
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,400
 And it works in your favor either way basically, yeah?

525
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,920
 - Well, that's what happens when you're really,

526
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,960
 really rich, which he was.

527
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,800
 - Which he was, wasn't he?

528
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,040
 - And how did he get rich?

529
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,120
 It's so confusing because he seemed

530
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,320
 to make all these investments that works.

531
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,040
 Like, I think he invested in the first ever

532
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,160
 clay pipe making factory.

533
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,320
 One of his more sensible ones that made money.

534
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,680
 He invested in some government bonds at a good time.

535
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,360
 But outside of that, he did bizarre stuff.

536
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,240
 Like the famous thing that was always written

537
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,320
 about him at the time is that he,

538
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,120
 and I think this did happen or it seems like people

539
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
 who remembered him said it happened at least,

540
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,120
 is that he was persuaded by people pranking him

541
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,520
 to try and sell warming pans,

542
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,440
 like bed warming pans to the West Indies.

543
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,600
 And, you know, I thought, ha, ha, ha, it's so hot there.

544
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,920
 And also I think that he was,

545
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,840
 he was persuaded to sell mittens there.

546
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,560
 And it was brilliant because he went

547
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,640
 and sold the warming pans and they had

548
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
 a big molasses industry.

549
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,400
 And apparently they sold really well as ladles

550
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
 in the molasses industry to people

551
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,840
 who could scoop treacle into vats.

552
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,680
 - Yeah.

553
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,520
 - It can't be true.

554
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,360
 - That bit can't be true.

555
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,200
 - It can't be true.

556
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,720
 The warming pans also, some red woolen pajamas went with him.

557
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,560
 And the story is that there was a Norwegian in Havana

558
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,640
 who had a load of timber and he couldn't get rid

559
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,960
 of his timber, but in Norway at that time,

560
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,960
 there was a real fashion for red woolen pajamas.

561
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,080
 And so he sold all of these pajamas for the Norwegians,

562
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,360
 swapped them for all this lumber,

563
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,160
 and then took the lumber a bit further south

564
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,240
 where he could sell all that

565
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,960
 and made an absolute fortune from that as well.

566
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,800
 - That's good.

567
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,880
 I like that.

568
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,480
 I read a book about Timothy Dexter for the research

569
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,960
 of this and it's quite rare that you get to read

570
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,080
 a whole book when you're doing these weekly shows.

571
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,120
 So that was very exciting.

572
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,920
 It's by William Cleves Todd.

573
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,240
 It's about 13 pages long.

574
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,480
 So that was quite useful, but it was such a good read.

575
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,880
 It reads like an incredible New York Times article,

576
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,600
 this book.

577
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
 But one thing he mentions of the book is the house

578
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,240
 that he lived in after he started making his money,

579
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,400
 which was a Newbury port, Massachusetts.

580
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,160
 And my God, outside the front of it,

581
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,200
 it's pretty spectacular.

582
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,240
 There were these columns on which he had wooden carved

583
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,000
 figures of prominence standing up there.

584
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,120
 So it'd be George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,

585
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,320
 him, he put himself up there

586
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,800
 and claiming himself to be someone of huge prominence.

587
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
 - It looks really cool.

588
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,640
 - It looks amazing.

589
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,520
 - You can see, obviously, paintings on there.

590
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,720
 You know, people would stop and look,

591
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,320
 these giant wooden statues.

592
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,760
 And he seemed to have animals statues as well,

593
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,200
 like some dogs and what looked like some pigs.

594
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,040
 Hard to tell.

595
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,840
 - Two lions, I believe as well, at the front.

596
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,880
 - Some lions.

597
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,160
 But then did you see what he wrote under his own

598
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,120
 big statue, which is like the biggest one

599
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,680
 right in the middle, was Lord Timothy Dexter.

600
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,560
 He always called himself Lord.

601
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,200
 Lord Timothy Dexter of Newbury port, Massachusetts,

602
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
 first in the East, first in the West,

603
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,040
 and the greatest philosopher in the Western world.

604
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,200
 So he was a humble guy.

605
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,240
 - He was a humble guy.

606
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,040
 - I think about him calling himself Lord, sorry,

607
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,880
 on that.

608
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,720
 I only saw this in one place.

609
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,640
 It was in the Boston Globe in 1921.

610
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,480
 But according to them,

611
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,240
 they said that Lord was his wife's maiden name.

612
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,320
 And so that's how he said, you know,

613
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,120
 he was like, oh, I'm going to take her maiden name.

614
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,600
 I'm going to put it at the front of my name.

615
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,960
 And I'm going to be called Lord Timothy Dexter.

616
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,280
 - What a feminist.

617
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,640
 - That's really good feminist.

618
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,720
 - It's such a fraudster.

619
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,560
 And the story,

620
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,520
 which I'm sure you guys all saw as well,

621
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,920
 about his funeral.

622
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,760
 - Oh yeah.

623
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,600
 - Where he staged his own funeral

624
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,920
 for the benefit of the town

625
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,520
 because he wanted to see how people would react.

626
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,240
 So he put it about that he was dead,

627
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,800
 invited all the gentle folk,

628
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,600
 got someone to play a clergyman.

629
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,120
 And then his got his coffin

630
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,200
 and his coffin was deposited in the, you know,

631
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,640
 family vault or whatever.

632
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,920
 And he thought his wife had not played her part properly

633
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,520
 because she hadn't cried enough during it.

634
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,360
 She was in on it.

635
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,200
 - So she was in on it.

636
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,760
 - Yeah, I read accounts where it was like,

637
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,560
 oh, she didn't cry enough and he was furious.

638
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,880
 And then he beat her for, you know, not crying enough.

639
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,800
 Actually, he beat her for not acting enough.

640
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,640
 - Yeah.

641
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,480
 - That's, I mean, you know.

642
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,320
 - She didn't commit to the bit.

643
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,140
 Come on.

644
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,980
 You've all got to be in on it.

645
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,820
 - I think God knows it.

646
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,660
 - It sounds great.

647
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,200
 You've got to this funeral.

648
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,440
 It's been very lavish.

649
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,920
 He had his coffin drawn in on white horse pulled chariot

650
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,280
 and then descending into the grave.

651
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,640
 And then they have a huge feast afterwards.

652
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,200
 And then it was disturbed by, yeah, the sight of him.

653
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,800
 And what I think was a bit of a pantomime, it seems like.

654
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,480
 I think it might have been a set up punch and Judy style.

655
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,800
 - Oh, you think that was faked?

656
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,640
 - From what I was reading from, I think it was actually.

657
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,280
 - He did hit her with a load of sausages.

658
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,120
 Didn't he?

659
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,200
 (all laughing)

660
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,400
 - It's very hard to say,

661
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,000
 but people who knew him say it might have been faked.

662
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,480
 - I mean, all of it seems to be made up, you know?

663
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,640
 - Only that bit staged.

664
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

665
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,800
 - He wasn't eccentric, sometimes eccentric.

666
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,620
 - He was a wealthy eccentric.

667
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,460
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

668
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,300
 - Lots of it was true.

669
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,140
 I mean, the house was definitely true.

670
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,200
 I think the funeral definitely happened.

671
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,600
 - Like, for instance, there's a thing from his lifetime

672
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,080
 I read in the Vermont Journal from 1801

673
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,600
 talking about how he had a boat and it needed staying.

674
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,200
 Okay, so he needs ropes, basically, he needs extra ropes.

675
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,440
 He didn't really know what that meant.

676
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,560
 So he went to town and he bought a load of whale bone

677
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,680
 and then brought it back and gave it to the boat guy.

678
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,320
 And the boat guy said, "Well, this is not, I need the ropes."

679
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,560
 I had only whale bone.

680
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,120
 And so he went back into Boston and he said,

681
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,840
 "Well, I've got all this whale bone, can I sell it to you?"

682
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,880
 And the thing was, he bought so much,

683
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,160
 the price had absolutely rocketed.

684
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,460
 And so when he sold it back to the whale bone community,

685
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,140
 he got double what he paid for it.

686
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,980
 - That's amazing.

687
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,820
 - That's very funny.

688
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,280
 - Wow, that's what I'm doing with Ben Elton memorabilia

689
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,640
 on eBay, hoovering it all up.

690
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,720
 And one day it'll be worth a fortune.

691
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,040
 - Is that because the ship needed staying,

692
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,880
 which I've never heard of.

693
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,720
 - That's the rope thing.

694
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,160
 But stays is a word for the whale bone struts in a dress.

695
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,000
 I thought all the supports in it.

696
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,840
 - Is that right?

697
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,160
 - I think stays are in a corset, maybe.

698
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,800
 - I actually couldn't work out how he'd made that mistake.

699
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,960
 - I think stays are the bits in the corset, which...

700
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,800
 - Where are we going?

701
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,640
 I got confused.

702
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,480
 - Yeah, yeah.

703
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,320
 - People chat.

704
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,240
 - There's a story as well that he heard

705
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,120
 that the king of England had a poet laureate.

706
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,480
 And so he thought, "Well, I'd like one of those as well."

707
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,080
 And so he hired someone just to follow him around

708
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,120
 and just to capture his daily wisdom

709
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,520
 and to turn it into people, pros.

710
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,360
 - Yeah.

711
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,680
 - I mean, that was definitely true.

712
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,520
 Jonathan Plummer.

713
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,360
 - Jonathan Plummer.

714
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
 - He sort of became a famous person in his own right.

715
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,920
 He was a fishmonger, wasn't he?

716
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,760
 - Really?

717
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,840
 - Yeah, yeah, he was a fishmonger.

718
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,840
 And I think he made him wear a black suit covered in stars,

719
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,440
 which sounds so cool.

720
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,280
 - Sounds very wizardy.

721
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,960
 - Yeah, and he was crowned with parsley.

722
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,080
 - Yes, that's right.

723
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,400
 - He sounded like a really sad character.

724
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,760
 He wrote an autobiography of his own by his poetry

725
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,200
 and he described himself as persecuted, despised

726
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,680
 and hated by everyone and suffering

727
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,360
 from such offensive breath that no one could go near him.

728
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,040
 Occasioned by Qatar of the Nose.

729
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,480
 - Sorry, did he write that in his own autobiography?

730
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,900
 - That's the author's blurb at the back.

731
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,360
 (laughing)

732
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,800
 - Yeah, he also, he swore off young women

733
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,000
 after he wrote so many poems for so many young women

734
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,160
 he fancied and they all rejected him.

735
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,080
 So he turned up vigorous and antiquated virgins

736
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,600
 as he described them,

737
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,920
 but they actually all rejected him as well.

738
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,000
 - Oh no.

739
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,120
 - That was the two vigorous.

740
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,280
 He should have gone less vigorous.

741
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,800
 - You're a slightly anemic elderly virgin.

742
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,640
 - Passive.

743
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,480
 - Yeah.

744
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,200
 - Gosh, this is it.

745
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,100
 You're sure about this dating profile, are you?

746
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,000
 (laughing)

747
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,520
 Just on punctuation, as this is about

748
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,040
 his Timothy Dexter's inserted punctuation.

749
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,040
 So I didn't know that Aristophanes invented punctuation,

750
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,160
 but not the famous Aristophanes.

751
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,240
 A slightly different guy.

752
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,440
 - The playwright who wrote the clouds

753
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,520
 and all that stuff, right?

754
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,360
 - Bingo, yes.

755
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,200
 - Not him.

756
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,040
 - Someone completely different, yeah.

757
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,880
 - 200 years later.

758
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,720
 I know.

759
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,560
 - What a fact.

760
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,400
 - Your minds are all been blown.

761
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,240
 (laughing)

762
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,200
 - Did that Aristophanes have any punctuation in his poem

763
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,720
 or did this guy come along and put them into his?

764
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,960
 - He would have been before, right?

765
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,780
 - I think actually punctuation Aristophanes

766
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,040
 is 200 years later.

767
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,880
 - Yeah.

768
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,720
 - Yeah.

769
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,560
 - But that's great because if that poem now

770
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,480
 has punctuation in it,

771
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,440
 that's a collaboration between two Aristophanes.

772
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
 - Yeah.

773
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,520
 - Just 200 years apart.

774
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,360
 - I love it.

775
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,200
 Yeah, yeah.

776
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,280
 - It was really very basic, his system.

777
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,720
 It was just dots you could put at the top or the middle

778
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,920
 or a bottom of a line.

779
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,440
 And then there were pauses basically.

780
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,240
 There were pauses of three different lengths.

781
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,920
 But their names were the comma, the colon,

782
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,440
 and the periodos.

783
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,960
 And that's where all those names come from.

784
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,800
 - Interesting.

785
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,640
 - Isn't that cool?

786
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,480
 - That is cool.

787
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,320
 - Yeah.

788
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,280
 - So then Isadora Seville came along after that.

789
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,760
 The famous one, not a different one.

790
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,040
 (laughing)

791
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,280
 And he kind of took Aristophanes' idea

792
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,360
 and kind of standardised it.

793
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,360
 And he had a dot at the top of the line for a long stop,

794
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,080
 a dot in the middle of the line for a slightly shorter one

795
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,320
 and a dot at the bottom of the line for a very short stop.

796
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,400
 And the one at the top sort of migrated down

797
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,120
 and eventually became full stop.

798
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,720
 The one in the middle became the colon

799
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,800
 and the one at the bottom became a modern comma.

800
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,640
 - Oh, wow.

801
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,680
 - The one at the top leapfrocks the one in the middle

802
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,520
 to go to the bottom.

803
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,360
 - I did.

804
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,760
 - And do we have evidence over the hundreds of years

805
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,080
 of it gradually sneaking down one millisecond?

806
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,920
 - I think we probably do.

807
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,760
 - I think we do, yeah.

808
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,600
 - Wow.

809
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,880
 How do we know that rather than doing that,

810
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,360
 it didn't bump into the other one

811
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,040
 when it got there and knocked that one further down?

812
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,640
 - Oh, it could have done, yeah, yeah.

813
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,560
 They have some punctuation in the Quran.

814
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,320
 Even though in the early days of Islam,

815
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,360
 there was no punctuation in Arabic.

816
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,840
 But the pausal signs are known as al-amat al-wakaf.

817
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,600
 And they are different types of stopping

818
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,240
 that will kind of make the text seem more beautiful.

819
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,280
 Because obviously the Quran,

820
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,640
 it's supposed to be very beautiful when you say it, right?

821
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,840
 And so if you see different ones,

822
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,800
 it might say it is better to stop now.

823
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,520
 You may stop if you want to,

824
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,560
 or you absolutely must stop at this stage.

825
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,720
 We said they quite like that idea of punctuation

826
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,480
 where it kind of gives you advice

827
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,760
 rather than telling you what to do.

828
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,320
 - Absolutely, 'cause I often think

829
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,360
 where the technical punctuation needs to go,

830
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,160
 when sometimes when you're trying to write something

831
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,240
 that's a joke, the punctuation can really mess up

832
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,440
 the flow of the sentence.

833
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,800
 You think, no, just let me put the comma here.

834
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,720
 I know it doesn't belong there,

835
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,200
 but that's where you'd want the beat to be

836
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,120
 in your free-styler, not a pedant.

837
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,800
 - Yeah, exactly, you're a dexter, a modern day dexter.

838
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,640
 - A modern day dexter.

839
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,960
 - Yeah.

840
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,800
 - Do any of you--

841
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,640
 - Serial killer.

842
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,980
 (laughing)

843
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,560
 (upbeat music)

844
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

845
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,640
 That is Anna.

846
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,720
 My fact this week is that Christians

847
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,080
 watch less porn on Sundays,

848
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,900
 but they do make up for it throughout the rest of the week.

849
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,160
 (laughing)

850
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,620
 - Gosh.

851
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,120
 - Gotta even it out.

852
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,440
 - Is that what it meant in the Bible

853
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,600
 when it said that on the seventh day he rested?

854
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,440
 Is that--

855
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,920
 - Yeah, 'cause you're knackered, aren't you,

856
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,520
 after six days of that?

857
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,080
 - Yeah.

858
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,040
 - You obviously haven't studied Genesis that hard,

859
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,120
 but it's day one to six is all porn watching.

860
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,960
 - Nice.

861
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,360
 - I read this in the Joseph Henrich book,

862
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,520
 "The Weirdest People in the World,"

863
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,320
 which is a brilliant, quite famous book, yeah, yeah.

864
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,000
 Joseph Henrich, the guy who came up with the concept

865
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,080
 of weird, which is Western educated, industrialized,

866
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,720
 rich, and democratic.

867
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,920
 And that's what every single one of us is,

868
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,460
 and almost every single person listening will be.

869
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,560
 - Sorry, that's not what it actually,

870
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,920
 that's not where we get the word weird from.

871
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,760
 He's just--

872
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,600
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

873
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,080
 God, God, God. - Sorry, yep.

874
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,040
 And it's all a book about how we base

875
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,240
 so much of our assumptions on human behavior

876
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,960
 on what we are, which is all of these things.

877
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,000
 And when I say rich, I just mean literally anyone

878
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,560
 who lives in a Western country that has a welfare state.

879
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,440
 So anyway, it's in his book, which is full of interesting

880
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,280
 stuff, and he writes a bit about monotheistic religions,

881
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,680
 and he says, yeah, there was a study that monitored

882
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,800
 poor news across the United States,

883
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,960
 and in the more Christian states,

884
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,520
 then there was a big dip in poor news on a Sunday,

885
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,680
 and it sort of was still quite low on a Monday,

886
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,440
 but it gradually crept up throughout the week,

887
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,080
 and it was reaching real highs the following Saturday,

888
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,680
 and then it plummeted again on a Sunday,

889
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,240
 and it averaged out as the exact same poor news

890
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,040
 as non-Christian states, so they just spread it out differently.

891
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
 - Is there a real scramble on Saturday night

892
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,720
 as you head up to 12 a.m.?

893
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,000
 - So yeah, could you get it out of the way?

894
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,040
 - Okay, wow.

895
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,800
 - And this obviously is the Sunday effect,

896
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,960
 so I guess you go to church on Sunday,

897
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,320
 you get reminded that you have to behave very morally,

898
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,560
 you're not supposed to watch porn,

899
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,000
 God doesn't like that kind of thing,

900
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,200
 and then you forget about it, don't use six days later.

901
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,600
 - Wow. - Interesting.

902
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,200
 And a similar thing happens with charity giving as well,

903
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,840
 I think, with Christians and Muslims.

904
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,880
 - Well, you don't do it on a Sunday?

905
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,160
 Surely it would be the inverse, you do do it on a Sunday.

906
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,160
 - I mean, it is the other way around, obviously, yes.

907
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,880
 (all laughing)

908
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,320
 - Oh, I'm feeling so lovely and relaxed now,

909
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,720
 I think I can make some charity donations, great.

910
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,080
 (all laughing)

911
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,440
 - There was even actually a study in Morocco done,

912
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,760
 which looked at when the call to prayer was audible,

913
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,280
 people would give to charity,

914
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,080
 but it would literally only last a few minutes,

915
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,320
 so giving to charity would peak for a few minutes,

916
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,680
 if you don't get there. - We're so suggestable,

917
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,560
 aren't we? - I know, classic.

918
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,760
 - 'Cause if you ran, let's say, a cold calling thing

919
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,840
 for charity, you know, I'm ringing up from,

920
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,840
 you know, like, I can't think of a single charity now,

921
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,520
 but if you played the call to prayer in the background,

922
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,680
 then that would presumably be a way

923
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,000
 of getting more people to give.

924
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,880
 - Really, so if your car broken down

925
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,240
 and you're ringing your grandmother,

926
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,880
 (all laughing)

927
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,640
 can I borrow 500 quid?

928
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,160
 You wanna play them, do us in--

929
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,800
 - Do it outside the mosque, yeah, yeah, yeah.

930
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

931
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,080
 - Put that mosquito down, granny.

932
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,320
 (all laughing)

933
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,600
 - Wow. - God, so just back

934
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,360
 to the headline fact, I'm just picturing on Sunday,

935
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,320
 all these guys at church sitting at the pews going,

936
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,600
 "Would you get up till last night?"

937
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,960
 (all laughing)

938
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,360
 "Oh, it's just at home, yeah, me too."

939
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,080
 - Me too, yeah, oh, it's the same.

940
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,960
 - "You may now shake hands with the person."

941
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,720
 No, thank you. (all laughing)

942
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,000
 - The Sunday effect is very powerful, you know,

943
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,440
 and it's largely, I think it's almost exclusively

944
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,280
 a religious thing, you know, there's less of it,

945
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,360
 sexually, but still, I mean, loads in this country,

946
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,960
 loads around the world, I found this,

947
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,160
 in Tonga, you're not allowed to bake bread on a Sunday

948
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,120
 unless there's been a natural disaster.

949
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,680
 - Is that right? - Yeah.

950
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,520
 - Gosh.

951
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,000
 - And this was a little past in 2016, it's really strange,

952
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,200
 so-- - It makes sense that

953
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,320
 stupid laws like that go out of the window

954
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,760
 when you've got a natural disaster, doesn't it?

955
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,640
 - Sundays have been messed up for me quite a bit

956
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,880
 due to religion, since becoming a dad,

957
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,000
 because I like to take my boys on the weekend to toy shops

958
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,680
 and one of the biggest, if not the biggest independent

959
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,440
 toy shop in the country is called The Entertainer,

960
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,520
 which is fantastic, it's got so many of my favorite toys,

961
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,920
 sorry, their favorite toys in there,

962
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,240
 and I didn't realize this old limited edition

963
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,080
 Ringo Stardoll, still.

964
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,760
 - Oh, it's a Ben Elton Barbie.

965
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,920
 (all laughing)

966
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,360
 - Oh my God, a matching, a Ben Elton Barbie.

967
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,640
 Please get onto it, Michelle.

968
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,200
 - Shiny suit, old school microphone, what else?

969
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,400
 - What about the Tory government in the '80s?

970
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,000
 - Pull the string on his back.

971
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,480
 - Socialist opinions, go out.

972
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,320
 Perfect for any child.

973
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,120
 - So it's shut on Sundays because the creator of it,

974
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,120
 a man called Gary Grant, has made it so

975
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,440
 because he's religious and he doesn't allow for it to be,

976
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,320
 and also you can't get Harry Potter toys there

977
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,080
 because he thinks Harry Potter encourages witchcraft

978
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
 and that's very un-Christian,

979
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,600
 so if you want your Harry Potter toys,

980
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,440
 you don't go there.

981
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,800
 - 'Cause Harry Potter has been very big

982
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,280
 over the last decade, more than that in fact,

983
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,000
 and the number of witches around

984
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,760
 is absolutely through the roof.

985
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,600
 - It's gone crazy.

986
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,840
 - It's awful. - He's doing his bit.

987
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,800
 - Yeah, you can't walk 10 meters down the street.

988
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,720
 - Before you get turned into a frog these days.

989
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,680
 - So Gary Grant, the shop started in Amisham.

990
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,880
 He bought it from someone and took it over.

991
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,800
 - Amisham, we should say, outskirts of London.

992
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,880
 - Outskirts of London, yeah.

993
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,480
 - It's in the UK. - It's in the UK.

994
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,800
 - It's in the UK.

995
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,160
 - I'd say it's not globally famous.

996
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,000
 - Oh, okay.

997
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,840
 - If there are like,

998
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,280
 most people listening, for instance,

999
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,880
 it's unlikely that we're familiar with Amisham.

1000
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,440
 - So he's, I looked into it just to see,

1001
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,000
 is it a particularly religious place?

1002
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,160
 I looked at notable people from there.

1003
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,080
 So the people I found there are Tim Rice,

1004
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,360
 who wrote Jesus Christ Superstar,

1005
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,480
 and Joseph, and it's a very biblical sort of work.

1006
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,440
 Katie Brand, the comedian, who used to be very religious.

1007
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,080
 He used to talk in tongues and all that sort of stuff.

1008
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,680
 - Yeah, okay. - It's actually something.

1009
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,000
 Cindy Gallo, who started a company called

1010
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Make Love Not Porn, which is less religious,

1011
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 but on topic for the porn not being watched here.

1012
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,840
 - What is that?

1013
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,280
 - I think it's about sort of positive sex,

1014
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,040
 and personal sex rather than, yeah, yeah.

1015
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,360
 - It's saying that sex is a wonderful, natural thing,

1016
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,120
 and it's good for you, fun, it's loving,

1017
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,520
 and it can be all these wonderful things.

1018
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,560
 - Yeah, okay, okay.

1019
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,120
 - And she sells stuff in The Entertainer.

1020
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,920
 - She's got the dolls.

1021
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,200
 They're quite a lot bigger than the Ben Elton Barbie.

1022
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,240
 And then last of all,

1023
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,080
 there is the Welsh International Footballer,

1024
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,520
 Simon Church, who is not religious.

1025
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
 - Of course, Dan.

1026
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,720
 Have you gone through the phone book under Amisham?

1027
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,400
 I don't know, I know that doesn't exist.

1028
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,720
 What is this weird conspiracy theory of putting out?

1029
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,920
 - It's just interesting when you notice

1030
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,920
 there's a lot of Christian connections.

1031
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,720
 - Seeming of massively famous sports people,

1032
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,680
 like, what was he called?

1033
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,480
 - Simon Church. - Simon Church, good grief.

1034
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,200
 The one famous person who was religious

1035
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,800
 was Jonathan Edwards, who still, I think,

1036
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,960
 has the World Triple Jump record.

1037
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,000
 - Okay.

1038
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,840
 - If not, he had it quite recently,

1039
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,240
 but he was such a devout Christian

1040
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,800
 that he refused to jump on Sundays.

1041
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,640
 - What a great way to beat him.

1042
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,480
 - Wait, wait, wait.

1043
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,200
 Would he hop and skip, but not jump?

1044
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,080
 - He refused to compete on Sundays.

1045
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,240
 I don't know if during his normal life,

1046
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,960
 he was a lot to jump up and down on.

1047
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,920
 - And here comes Jonathan Edwards,

1048
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,600
 absolutely plowing into the hurdles,

1049
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,880
 as he does every Sunday.

1050
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,280
 He's now dragging 14 hurdles behind him.

1051
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,520
 - Man, he's going to have this.

1052
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,360
 - So what would happen?

1053
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,280
 - Well, he just, in the 1991 World Championships,

1054
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,240
 he just didn't compete.

1055
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,880
 He would have probably won the weight,

1056
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,840
 but he didn't want to do it 'cause it was on a Sunday.

1057
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,560
 And he went on to host Songs of Praise,

1058
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,800
 so he's quite famous.

1059
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,640
 - Did he?

1060
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,480
 - Yeah.

1061
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,320
 - Did not know that.

1062
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,640
 - And he became an atheist when, this is quite ironic,

1063
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,640
 so he was reading about the road to Damascus

1064
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,640
 when Saint Paul became a Catholic, okay?

1065
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,520
 Saint Paul converted when he saw a light

1066
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,040
 on the road to Damascus and it made him turn round

1067
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,920
 and stop being a tax collector

1068
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,960
 and become an apostle of Jesus, right?

1069
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,800
 - Yeah, okay.

1070
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,280
 - But he, Jonathan Edwards, read that Saint Paul

1071
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,120
 might have had an epileptic fit

1072
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,240
 and not seen a light after all,

1073
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,960
 and he became an atheist after reading that explanation.

1074
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,720
 So ironically, he'd read about the road to Damascus

1075
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,200
 and had like a reverse road to Damascus moment.

1076
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,560
 - Yeah, brilliant.

1077
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,920
 - Was he too old to still compete at this point?

1078
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,760
 - He was, yeah, that was after he'd...

1079
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,000
 - What a shame, doubly piss you off, wasn't it?

1080
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,640
 When Sundays are now available to you.

1081
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,480
 - Yeah, I could have had that in 1991.

1082
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,000
 - And who's this bursting onto the track?

1083
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,080
 My goodness, an elderly Jonathan Edwards.

1084
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,680
 He's behind everyone else, he's losing badly.

1085
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,520
 He's lost.

1086
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,240
 - In 1686, there was a treatise written by a clergyman

1087
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,600
 called John Baptiste Thierre, and it was very famous,

1088
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,520
 big deal, and this was around the time

1089
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,000
 when people thought laughing was really bad

1090
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,160
 and he gave such strict rules on when you're allowed to laugh.

1091
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,560
 So he said, "You're only ever allowed to laugh discreetly

1092
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,640
 "and never on work days, Sundays."

1093
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,440
 So that does cover quite a lot of the day.

1094
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,680
 "Lent days, advent, or holy days."

1095
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,280
 - So you're basically, you've got about 30 Saturdays

1096
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,920
 and you're allowed to.

1097
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,760
 - Go like your sister.

1098
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,400
 Well, you're not masturbating on a Saturday,

1099
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,680
 so I suppose you've got time.

1100
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,520
 - You are, aren't you?

1101
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,760
 That's your big day.

1102
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,240
 Got between laughing and masturbating,

1103
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,680
 but that's a hell of a day.

1104
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,160
 - Can you do them simultaneously?

1105
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,000
 - You're gonna have to.

1106
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,080
 - What are you doing in there?

1107
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,920
 - I'm laughing.

1108
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,360
 - Don't come in, I'm laughing.

1109
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,120
 (laughing)

1110
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,720
 (upbeat music)

1111
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,920
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1112
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,720
 and that is Andy.

1113
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,680
 - My fact is that at least four seconds

1114
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,840
 of the film Avatar was funded by Wayne Rooney.

1115
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,760
 - But it's just that bit where there's an amazing strike

1116
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,000
 on goal, isn't there, by one of the Navi people,

1117
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,480
 and then it's back to the plot line.

1118
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,320
 - So amazing.

1119
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
 - For any international listeners,

1120
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,440
 Wayne Rooney is a big footballer.

1121
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,960
 He's probably, he might be globally famous.

1122
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,000
 - He plays in America, yeah.

1123
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,160
 - I did, okay, okay.

1124
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,400
 - At least the Americans might know him.

1125
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,840
 - Well, he's a footballer,

1126
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,960
 formerly nicknamed the spud-faced nipper.

1127
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,800
 (laughing)

1128
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,360
 - I am a big football fan,

1129
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,240
 and I've never come across that nickname.

1130
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,680
 - I think it's the one thing I heard about him

1131
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,680
 in probably, you know, 2002, and it's just stuck.

1132
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,880
 Anyway, this is from a book by a colleague of mine,

1133
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,920
 actually, from Private Eye called Richard Brooks,

1134
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920
 and the book is called The Great Tax Robbery,

1135
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,420
 and this is about a tax scheme that was set up

1136
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,520
 which included investing in movies,

1137
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,040
 and it meant you could claim a large amount of tax off.

1138
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,760
 So Mr. Rooney put in at least 100,000 pounds,

1139
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,680
 'cause I think that was, sorry.

1140
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,440
 - There's just Colin who's spud-faced.

1141
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,760
 - Try and make up to him after that sanderous Colin.

1142
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,600
 - Sorry.

1143
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,480
 - He put 100,000 pounds in the scheme,

1144
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
 and the film is 162 minutes long,

1145
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,720
 and it costs 237 million pounds, I think.

1146
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,080
 Oh, maybe dollars.

1147
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,800
 Anyway, the math works out roughly at that.

1148
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,800
 Oh, hang on, a pound is worth a dollar these days, fine.

1149
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,640
 - A time of record.

1150
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,800
 - Yeah, and sadly, we'll probably never know

1151
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,640
 which four seconds.

1152
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,160
 I did actually write to Wayne Rooney's people

1153
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,840
 asking which four seconds.

1154
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,760
 - They don't allocate money to, what?

1155
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,600
 - There isn't a specific four seconds.

1156
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,080
 - I just thought maybe for special investors,

1157
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,400
 they would say, oh, this is what you're,

1158
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,520
 this is what it's helped fund.

1159
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,560
 - Like if it was a Kickstarter, they might say,

1160
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,200
 well, your 100 grand went to this four seconds.

1161
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,200
 - Exactly, or you know,

1162
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,480
 funded the development of this particular animal

1163
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
 in the Avatar jungle.

1164
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,120
 And then that bit in Avatar, isn't there,

1165
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,720
 when Bob Geldoff actually took back his 100,000,

1166
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,680
 and it's just missing four seconds, isn't it,

1167
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,720
 during the film?

1168
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,720
 - Yeah, they haven't got back to me yet, but, right.

1169
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,960
 - If you go on this scheme, they have on their website,

1170
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,800
 which still exists,

1171
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,280
 it shows all of the movies that they invested in.

1172
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,120
 - Really?

1173
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,720
 - And they include Sean of the Dead,

1174
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,280
 Sharknado 2.

1175
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,120
 - Brilliant.

1176
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,040
 - And a movie called Brooklyn.

1177
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,640
 And the interesting thing about that

1178
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,360
 is that David Beckham was also an investor,

1179
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,160
 and he has a son called Brooklyn.

1180
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,000
 - True.

1181
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,520
 - So he gave some money for Brooklyn

1182
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,680
 and also created another Brooklyn.

1183
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,520
 - Brilliant.

1184
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,360
 - Very nice.

1185
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,360
 - Nice.

1186
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,200
 - Great movie, by the way.

1187
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,040
 - Coincidence.

1188
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,280
 - But they didn't think the scheme was still going.

1189
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,800
 I thought it'd been kind of shut down.

1190
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,200
 - Well, they have a website with all the different movies.

1191
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,400
 - Oh, fair enough, yeah.

1192
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,920
 - And so there was a big list of people,

1193
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,880
 it's not just Wayne Rooney.

1194
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,520
 - It's not just Wayne Rooney, really.

1195
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,600
 - No, but so like David Beckham, Andrew Lloyd Webber,

1196
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,760
 there's, I saw him in the park the other day.

1197
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,040
 - Yeah, I wonder where this anecdote is going,

1198
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,360
 probably no way.

1199
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,800
 - Oh, absolutely, no way, yeah.

1200
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,000
 Actually, Dan mentioned Tim Rice a while ago,

1201
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,480
 and I thought about jumping in with it then,

1202
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,680
 but I'm so glad I held fire.

1203
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,920
 - No, there is a good anecdote with this,

1204
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,920
 'cause you did mention it.

1205
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,080
 - Yeah, yeah, he was, his dog was terrorizing a Gosling.

1206
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,400
 - Ryan Gosling.

1207
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,840
 - Yeah, Ryan Gosling is a real Freddy cat.

1208
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,920
 No, no, no, his dog was barking at a tiny,

1209
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,080
 tiny baby Gosling, and I was so shocked

1210
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,520
 that it was Andrew Lloyd Webber that I forgot to say,

1211
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,800
 oh, I think actually it's meant to be on a leash in this bit.

1212
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,320
 And I wouldn't have had this.

1213
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,280
 - I've seen the main point, which is that I mentioned

1214
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,960
 on the show that he hated the movie "Cats" so much

1215
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,320
 that he went out and bought a dog and pissed him off so much.

1216
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,640
 And you've now seen the dog.

1217
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,400
 - I've seen the dog, yeah, it's a nice dog.

1218
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,960
 - Well, that's not very nice.

1219
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,560
 Doesn't look like it was terrorizing a baby goose.

1220
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,640
 - Just doing what dogs do.

1221
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,360
 It's the owner's fault, it's never a problem dog,

1222
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,200
 it's a problem owner.

1223
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,040
 - You're right, blame the parents.

1224
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,960
 - So Bob Geldorf and David Beckham, Roy Keane.

1225
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,160
 (laughing)

1226
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,200
 - Wanna slug off Roy Keane now, I think, good luck.

1227
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,320
 - Geldorf reckons he owns a brief second.

1228
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,680
 So maybe his 100,000 was used on catering or something

1229
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,360
 and then a tiny bit for the film.

1230
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,200
 - Lots of men.

1231
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,160
 Do you think women aren't as prone to investing in shit films

1232
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,760
 just as a way of avoiding paying taxes recently?

1233
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,600
 - Yeah, I don't know.

1234
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,440
 - Could be.

1235
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,200
 - Is the biggest grossing movie of all time

1236
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,200
 technically a shit film?

1237
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,400
 - I was maybe had a shark knee doing my head.

1238
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,240
 - Oh, how dare you.

1239
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,080
 That's a brilliant film.

1240
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,920
 - "Shutnait" or two?

1241
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,760
 - Oh, even better.

1242
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,000
 Is that what we're talking about?

1243
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,840
 Yeah, yeah.

1244
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,040
 - For example, "The Sequel" being better than the original.

1245
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,160
 - Just like "Terminator" and "Alien".

1246
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,440
 Although "Alien", "Alien" was James Cameron as well,

1247
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,280
 wasn't it? - It was.

1248
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,240
 - James Cameron, this is, again,

1249
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,560
 the thing about "Avatar" is it's the biggest film

1250
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,880
 of all time, the biggest grossing film of all time,

1251
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,680
 and I think maybe "Avengers" might be in it.

1252
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,040
 - It did for a while.

1253
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,360
 - So then it re-overtook, didn't it?

1254
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,760
 - It's a really interesting story.

1255
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,440
 Sorry to derail your second hand here,

1256
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,760
 but when it came out initially,

1257
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,880
 it came out in China in 3D

1258
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,320
 and there was this big controversy.

1259
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,160
 - Sorry, which one are you talking about?

1260
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,160
 - "Avatar" the first movie.

1261
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,200
 There was a big controversy,

1262
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,000
 which it's really hard to get to the bottom

1263
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,040
 of what really happened,

1264
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,960
 but a lot of the 3D showings of it in China

1265
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,320
 were pulled from the cinemas.

1266
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,320
 And the story goes that the reason that happened is

1267
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,520
 China had a domestic film,

1268
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,760
 which was "Confucius" with Chaoyang Fat,

1269
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,000
 which they wanted to really dominate the box office

1270
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,320
 and "Avatar" was doing that.

1271
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,040
 So they took the 3D movie out and left the 2D in,

1272
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,800
 but it really hurt their box office amount in China.

1273
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,680
 It still became the biggest box office hit of all time

1274
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,160
 until the "Avengers" end game came along and overtook it.

1275
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,880
 However, in the lead-up for "Avatar" the second movie,

1276
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,280
 which is coming out this year,

1277
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,960
 they put a re-release of the original.

1278
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,280
 And in China specifically,

1279
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,360
 where the box office has now boosted it back over "Avengers".

1280
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,480
 - Do you think, did James come and have a sly word

1281
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,080
 with Xi Jinping on the side and say, "Look, mate,

1282
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,920
 do me a favor?"

1283
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,240
 - Do me a sly word.

1284
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,280
 - The China thing, by the way,

1285
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,360
 the place where it's based is,

1286
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,560
 I haven't seen "Avatar", but is it called Pandora?

1287
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,400
 - Yeah, Pandora.

1288
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,960
 So it's based, apparently, on a place called Zhangjiajie,

1289
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,920
 which is in China.

1290
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,480
 It's a national forest park.

1291
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,680
 And in fact, it was the first in China.

1292
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,360
 And it's got these amazing pillars,

1293
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,000
 like there's a place in Greece called Monastero,

1294
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,840
 which is more famous,

1295
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,520
 which is like the kind of big bits of rock

1296
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,720
 that just kind of stick up from the ground.

1297
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,000
 Anyway, supposedly Pandora was based on this area.

1298
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,120
 And in this area,

1299
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,200
 they also have the world's tallest lift.

1300
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,320
 (all laughing)

1301
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,840
 - The world's tallest outdoor lift, I should say.

1302
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,440
 - Okay, so I've got a question.

1303
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,600
 Is it the shaft that's tallest, or is it the lift?

1304
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,640
 When you say the tallest lift,

1305
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,680
 is it lift a giraffe could walk into and be fine?

1306
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,480
 - I honestly haven't written down which it is,

1307
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,920
 but I'm pretty shocked.

1308
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,160
 It's taller than any buildings in London.

1309
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,200
 It's taller than the shard, for instance.

1310
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,720
 It's 326 meters high.

1311
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,000
 The shard is 309 meters high.

1312
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,720
 I'm assuming that is the shaft.

1313
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,600
 - That's probably the shaft, not the lift.

1314
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,840
 'Cause imagine the shaft.

1315
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,680
 - If that's the--

1316
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,400
 - Well, it might just be one floor it's going up,

1317
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,520
 but it happens to be very taller.

1318
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,720
 - But though it is, it's the shaft.

1319
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,560
 - That's so cool.

1320
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,360
 - And it's so that you can get up to a viewing platform

1321
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,280
 to see the area.

1322
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,040
 - But Shangjia Ji, which is the mountain range,

1323
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,160
 they've named one of the columns,

1324
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,760
 Avatar Hallelujah Mountain,

1325
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,680
 and it's because of the film.

1326
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,080
 So China had a very problematic relationship

1327
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,920
 with this film initially, and it's really come good.

1328
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,920
 - 'Cause they did say that one of the reasons

1329
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,960
 they might have pulled it is because the Chinese people

1330
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,960
 might have empathized with the blue people in Avatar,

1331
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,320
 and it might have shown them their own plight.

1332
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,880
 'Cause like a lot of Chinese people

1333
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,480
 were being kicked out of the houses

1334
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,680
 so they could build new cities, all that kind of thing.

1335
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,520
 - An Avatar is about a colonial invasion

1336
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,520
 of blue people, isn't it?

1337
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,160
 - Yes, it is.

1338
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,120
 There are these things in the world of Avatar.

1339
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:45,120
 They're called the Banshee, and they're basically dragons.

1340
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,240
 I'm just saying that quietly

1341
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,400
 because James Cameron very strongly denies

1342
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,320
 that they're dragons, but yeah.

1343
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,120
 - And he can't hear softly, so can you.

1344
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,040
 (laughing)

1345
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,120
 - He's lost so much hearing

1346
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,720
 from filming Aliens and Terminator 2.

1347
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,280
 No, but they're, you know, they're--

1348
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,120
 - What can they do?

1349
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,120
 Can they breathe fire and fly,

1350
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,840
 and they have tails and they're like lizards?

1351
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,360
 - The last three things, not the first one.

1352
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,320
 I don't think they breathe fire.

1353
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,680
 Anyway, I mean, they're pretty dragon.

1354
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,760
 - I mean, one's called Puff.

1355
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,720
 (laughing)

1356
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,960
 - But they had to come up with an entire workout

1357
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,720
 for the cast so they could ride

1358
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,320
 these fictional CGI animals

1359
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,760
 because he wanted them to have a very realistic style.

1360
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,800
 You know, they were filming all this motion capture stuff,

1361
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,800
 kind of the golem-y style of filming.

1362
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,880
 - Yeah.

1363
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,760
 - So they created the Banshee Buns of Steel workout

1364
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,360
 so that they could be filmed riding these things.

1365
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,200
 - That's cool.

1366
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,360
 - And when they filmed them, they, you know,

1367
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,800
 you might get the actors.

1368
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,800
 So Zoe Saldana is one of the two stars of it,

1369
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,320
 and she has to jump onto one of these things

1370
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,720
 at various points in the film.

1371
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,680
 And, you know, you might think,

1372
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,200
 oh, we'll just film her jumping onto a saddle

1373
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,720
 or a vaulting horse or whatever

1374
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,280
 that would just use that motion capture.

1375
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,880
 They actually filmed her jumping onto a massive stuntman

1376
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,360
 wearing a saddle because they want,

1377
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,640
 James Cameron was so insistent.

1378
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,200
 He wanted the real, you know,

1379
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,800
 I want her to be jumping onto a living being, you know,

1380
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,440
 they get that flex of the movement.

1381
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,840
 - Sorry, where was the stuntman wearing a saddle?

1382
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,760
 'Cause he'd have to be on all fours, in which case--

1383
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,600
 - He must have been on all fours.

1384
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,440
 - Must have been, yeah.

1385
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,280
 - But then he's very small.

1386
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,640
 She has to crouch down to climb onto him.

1387
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,120
 Or was he wearing it on his head

1388
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,280
 and then she has to vault onto him.

1389
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,440
 - He had stilts on each.

1390
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,440
 Yeah, I know what you're saying.

1391
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,080
 He could have been on a platform.

1392
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,200
 - Maybe he was on a platform, yeah.

1393
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,120
 - Yeah, no, great point.

1394
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,160
 I haven't seen footage of it.

1395
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,240
 I've only read descriptions.

1396
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,640
 - He sounds like he was quite an atrocious director

1397
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,280
 to work for in that sort of, he really pushed people

1398
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,560
 and was really rude and he got his way.

1399
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,840
 And if you didn't do things and you were in a lot of trouble,

1400
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,680
 one thing that he would do is he would wear a hat

1401
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,240
 on the first day of filming,

1402
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,120
 which would have on it, H-M-F-I-C.

1403
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,880
 And that would stand for head motherfucker in charge.

1404
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,000
 And the idea was, don't get in my way.

1405
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,120
 - Kate Winslet said she would never work with him again

1406
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,200
 because of how much he pushed her on the Titanic movie.

1407
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,920
 He should almost drowned, for example,

1408
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,520
 even though she's in the latest avatar.

1409
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,600
 - She had the door.

1410
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,840
 (all laughing)

1411
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,120
 - Yeah, that's true.

1412
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,640
 - We should probably talk a little bit about

1413
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,720
 how, why it was such a big deal, I suppose,

1414
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,120
 'cause it was so groundbreaking in the technology it used.

1415
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,320
 It sounds really cool to act on

1416
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,240
 because actors were so used to having to wear

1417
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,200
 these really hefty prosthetics

1418
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,160
 if they wanted to play anything

1419
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,080
 that didn't look exactly like a human.

1420
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,400
 So they, I think it was inspired by Spider-Man 2

1421
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,560
 where Alfred Molina plays the villain.

1422
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,120
 And he was the-- - Doctor Octopus.

1423
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,600
 - Yeah, Doctor Octopus.

1424
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,960
 And they first used motion capture on his face

1425
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,280
 by putting lots of little beads all over it,

1426
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,760
 like reflective beads.

1427
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,680
 And then a camera films all of those reflective beads.

1428
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,320
 And automatically they can pick up the data

1429
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,560
 of exactly how they move,

1430
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,640
 depending on what facial expressions you make.

1431
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,800
 And then a computer can regenerate

1432
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,560
 those exact facial expressions.

1433
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,000
 - If you smile, then it makes your octopus man smile.

1434
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,840
 - Exactly.

1435
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,320
 - But in a really realistic way,

1436
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,920
 because otherwise they're just stretching a smile

1437
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,520
 on a computer screen, it looks terrible, you know, yeah.

1438
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,000
 - And it's really cool because it actually means

1439
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,560
 that you don't have to have a camera in the right place ever

1440
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,400
 because the computers are capturing

1441
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,880
 every single angle of your movement.

1442
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,440
 You can decide later on when you're doing the computer,

1443
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,800
 you know, computer generated film editing,

1444
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,880
 which angle you want.

1445
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,960
 You'd be like, "Actually, I want the camera

1446
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,080
 on this side of them."

1447
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,600
 And the computer's got all the data

1448
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,080
 for how your face moves. - That's so clever.

1449
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,200
 I hadn't thought of that.

1450
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,880
 There's one big problem with Avatar.

1451
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,720
 - Oh yeah?

1452
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,040
 - The breasts.

1453
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,480
 - No one's paid to touch them.

1454
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,320
 (laughing)

1455
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,920
 - I read a report of the science of Avatar

1456
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,680
 and whether, you know, whether this world

1457
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,200
 could exist in all of these aspects.

1458
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,640
 And there was one very snotty line in it that said,

1459
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,720
 the females, female navi, aliens, even have breasts,

1460
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,360
 even though Cameron admits they aren't placental mammals.

1461
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,680
 - That's a good point.

1462
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,840
 - What a, what a, what a blood hole.

1463
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,520
 - That is, yeah. - Well, because he was

1464
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,640
 very careful, he had all these years to put it together.

1465
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,240
 So the main, like he had a botanist on set

1466
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,280
 who did all of the naming of the plants.

1467
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,560
 He had a linguistics expert professor come in

1468
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,520
 and write the language, which was up to 1,000 words

1469
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,800
 for the movie.

1470
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,880
 In fact, you know, it was really odd.

1471
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,640
 He did so many from scratch things,

1472
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,560
 language and botanist.

1473
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,320
 But then the sounds that they used for the animals

1474
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,280
 were taken from Jurassic Park.

1475
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,960
 So when you hit, not all of them,

1476
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,720
 but when you hear a bunch of the nuts, yeah.

1477
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,960
 So they use the T-Rex and they use the Raptor

1478
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,360
 when it's in the kitchen.

1479
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,040
 - Did they have famous people in it?

1480
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,040
 - Yeah, Zoe Saldana and the Time Worthington wasn't.

1481
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,440
 - They weren't kind of mega stars,

1482
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,520
 but they were sort of reasonably well known.

1483
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,720
 - Worthington was homeless at the time.

1484
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,120
 He was living in his car when he did the audition.

1485
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,120
 - I read that as well.

1486
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,760
 And I wondered if they decided, okay,

1487
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,280
 we're going to spend all of our money on this stuff.

1488
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,120
 Let's get slightly shit erected.

1489
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,000
 'Cause it doesn't matter.

1490
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,560
 We're going to put dots on their faces anyway.

1491
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,880
 And the sound bit,

1492
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,960
 let's just take the stuff from Jurassic Park.

1493
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,960
 That was fine.

1494
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,800
 Like they had to save money here.

1495
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,480
 - How do they get to $200 million?

1496
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,040
 Just all making everyone blue.

1497
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,960
 - Those are dots.

1498
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,240
 So many stickers.

1499
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,480
 - One other thing that's spent money on,

1500
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,320
 the cigarette, so Sigourney Weaver is in it.

1501
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,240
 And she's obviously brilliant.

1502
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,400
 And she's in it and her character smokes.

1503
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,040
 But the cigarettes in the film are CGI cigarettes.

1504
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,440
 And I tried to find out why.

1505
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,840
 And I read a few articles about this

1506
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,800
 that I found no explanation.

1507
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,320
 She held a toothpick and did not see the light.

1508
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,520
 - Does she just not smoke maybe?

1509
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,680
 - I can't imagine Sigourney Weaver not smoking.

1510
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,240
 I can't picture it.

1511
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,000
 No, and then he got in loads of trouble

1512
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,680
 for depicting smoking in the film.

1513
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,720
 Various anti-smoking groups said

1514
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,240
 this is very irresponsible to show

1515
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,040
 anyone as cool as Sigourney Weaver smoking.

1516
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,160
 And he said, but people do smoke.

1517
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,000
 - It shows a lot of trust from the actors, doesn't it?

1518
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,640
 That if he's like, yeah, that thing in your hand,

1519
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,800
 I'm going to definitely make it a cigarette.

1520
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,320
 I'm not going to make it anything else.

1521
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,480
 - Wobble it around a bit and then put it up your bum.

1522
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,480
 It won't be a cigarette.

1523
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,440
 - There's not going to be a tiny dismembered penis, is there?

1524
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,840
 - I wasn't thinking that.

1525
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,560
 I was thinking like a kazoo or something.

1526
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,440
 But like, yeah, any kind of thing.

1527
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,440
 You don't know, like, that's what I mean.

1528
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,120
 If you do a normal movie, you've done your scene

1529
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,480
 and you know that that scene is going to be how it is.

1530
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,920
 But they could have put anything on your face, couldn't they?

1531
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,760
 - Yeah, they could.

1532
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,640
 In fact, I imagine it would be the press of a button

1533
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,240
 to redo the entirety of Avatar.

1534
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,480
 But they're all worms.

1535
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,720
 (laughing)

1536
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,040
 - That would be great.

1537
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:15,400
 - Okay, that's it.

1538
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,400
 That is all of our facts.

1539
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,920

1558
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,200
 where people chat and share things

1559
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,200
 that they like about the show.

1560
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,040
 It's really fun.

1561
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,680
 Check it out. - Or don't like.

1562
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,080
 - You know. - Well, they get--

1563
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:02,920
 - I think you hate about the show.

1564
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,760
 - They get kicked off.

1565
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,920
 - Come and slag off fish.

1566
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,880
 For just $2.49 a month, you get to touch Dan's boobs.

1567
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,120
 - Anyway, if you don't want to do that,

1568
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,240
 you can always just come back here,

1569
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,520
 'cause we come free of charge, as well.

1570
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,600
 Once a week, where you get your podcasts.

1571
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,960
 - Shut up guys. - Shut up guys.

1572
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,240
 (laughing)

1573
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,480
 - All right, I'm getting out of here.

1574
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,840
 Bye, see you next week.

1575
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,420
 (upbeat music)

1576
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,000
 (upbeat music)

1577
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,420
 (upbeat music)

1578
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,000
 (upbeat music)

1579
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,940
 (upbeat music)

1580
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,520
 (gentle music)
