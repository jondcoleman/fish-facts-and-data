00:00:04,00:00:09,Hi everyone and welcome to the last episode of Gnosis Like This Fish before Christmas.
00:00:09,00:00:14,We're getting really close to Christmas now so obviously very very much in the last minute
00:00:14,00:00:21,stocking filler area but if you have very odd shaped stockings then maybe you would like to
00:00:21,00:00:25,buy some of our books because probably from some online retailers you'll be able to get them just
00:00:25,00:00:31,in time if you're listening to this on Friday or Saturday so let me remind you what we have.
00:00:31,00:00:35,Andrew Hunter Murray has written a number of novels but his latest one is A Beginner's
00:00:35,00:00:40,"Guides to Breaking and Entering. It is a book that shows off everything you love about Andy,"
00:00:40,00:00:46,"it's very funny, very witty and at the same time has his classic thriller structure as they all do,"
00:00:46,00:00:52,"all of his books. Dan Schreiber has a book called Impossible Things, it is a children's book and"
00:00:52,00:00:57,it is a way to get your children to think like Dan Schreiber. Is that the kind of thing you
00:00:57,00:01:02,"want? Well let's be honest it is, he has a unique brain and his books are absolutely amazing and"
00:01:02,00:01:07,it really gets kids interested in everything that's going on around them and if you're an
00:01:07,00:01:11,adult which you probably are if you're listening to this then you can get the theory of everything
00:01:11,00:01:16,else which is his adult's version of that book. When I say adult I mean it's for adults not that
00:01:16,00:01:23,"it has anything naughty in it, it is complete family friendly fun. Of course Anna and I also"
00:01:23,00:01:28,"have a book it's called A Load of All Balls, doesn't sound very family friendly does it but it is our"
00:01:28,00:01:32,look at the world of sports. If you've got any difficulty buying for relatives but you know
00:01:32,00:01:37,that they like any kind of sport then this is one to get for them because it is a classic
00:01:37,00:01:43,QI thing of all the kind of weird facts that even the biggest sports fan in your family will not know
00:01:43,00:01:47,and actually even if you don't like sports we know that you will like this because there's a
00:01:47,00:01:53,book full of facts and it really gives you an idea of why humans like this thing that a lot of us
00:01:53,00:01:58,really find quite impenetrable. Anyway so that's the books from the three of us get them now they're
00:01:58,00:02:03,the perfect present for any fish fan in your life but don't worry if you can't or don't want to get
00:02:03,00:02:08,those it's absolutely no problem all we really want is that you listen to and enjoy the podcast
00:02:08,00:02:13,which is free and which will always be free so there's nothing more to say I suppose then Merry
00:02:13,00:02:23,Christmas hope you have a great time over the next couple of weeks and on with the podcast
00:02:37,00:02:44,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:02:44,00:02:47,this week coming to you live from Melbourne
00:02:47,00:02:58,"My name is Dan Schreiber I am sitting here with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James"
00:02:58,00:03:03,Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:03:03,00:03:10,from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with fact number one
00:03:10,00:03:17,and that is Anna. My fact this week is that to get a good close-up photo in the early 1900s
00:03:17,00:03:25,your camera had to be 20 feet long which was tough to take in hand luggage we've got a photo of it
00:03:25,00:03:30,up on the screen a black and white photo we do so there's a picture here of the two people who had
00:03:30,00:03:35,to operate this camera who were David and Marion Fairchild I think we mentioned them briefly on
00:03:35,00:03:41,the show before she was Alexander Graham Bell's daughter and this is around 1913 and David really
00:03:41,00:03:46,wanted to take some close-ups of insects he thought they were very very beautiful uh creepy
00:03:46,00:03:50,crawlies and he was annoyed that the only way you could look at them close-up was by killing
00:03:50,00:03:53,them squashing them drying them out and putting them in a book so he was like let's try take some
00:03:53,00:04:00,pictures but in order to get the magnification you need this incredibly long extension tube
00:04:00,00:04:05,or you did when the tech was a little bit simpler and so you've got the lens at one end
00:04:05,00:04:11,which person number one is having to hold and then at the very other end of the camera you
00:04:11,00:04:17,have the person who takes the photo and eventually you get an insect in very high definition well
00:04:17,00:04:22,these insects living can I ask Anna they were not it was actually quite amazing what they did so
00:04:22,00:04:25,yeah so it wasn't I thought at first how lovely he wanted to keep them alive to photograph them
00:04:25,00:04:30,no he just didn't want them dried out so Marianne actually came up because I've already needed an
00:04:30,00:04:35,exposure of 80 seconds yeah which are no insects no matter how well trained is going to sit there
00:04:35,00:04:39,I can't sit there they might be asleep right they might be asleep they might be asleep sorry I've
00:04:39,00:04:43,seen insects stay still for long periods of time but these ones were deceased and the way they did
00:04:43,00:04:49,it was Marianne would cover a block of wood with a layer of candle wax and then she'd put a leaf
00:04:49,00:04:54,on top so it looks like it's in a realistic position because insects hang out on leaves
00:04:54,00:04:58,and then with a little pin made a few holes for each foot of the insect in the leaf
00:04:58,00:05:02,and the feet would stick to the wax underneath and so then it would look like they were naturally
00:05:02,00:05:07,just standing on this leaf right okay there are some other ways of doing it these days if you
00:05:07,00:05:12,have forums of how to photograph insects they come up with ideas one idea is to put them in the
00:05:12,00:05:17,freezer for 20 minutes and that will keep them still but it won't kill them right which is good
00:05:17,00:05:22,another one is if you let's say it's one that doesn't fly if you put it on a table and then put
00:05:22,00:05:27,vapor rub fix vapor rub around it then it won't be able to get out of there and so it'll just stay
00:05:27,00:05:30,in that little I thought you were going to say they're superstitious and they won't step over
00:05:30,00:05:36,it's like summoning a demon that's okay they just slip around and one of the earliest this wasn't
00:05:36,00:05:41,photography but one of the earliest close-up books was Robert Huck's micrographia so that
00:05:41,00:05:47,will have been what 17th century I guess and he drew lots of pictures of tiny insects that he could
00:05:47,00:05:51,see through these new lenses that have been invented and the way that he did it was that he
00:05:51,00:05:59,would give a fly a quarter of a pint of brandy oh no sorry what do you mean give a fly a quarter of
00:05:59,00:06:07,all right lightweight if even Anna is quibbling over the you know I'm not sure I can wouldn't he
00:06:07,00:06:12,would he drop them in it yeah he would put them in it oh no he probably could have gone for a bit
00:06:12,00:06:17,less brandy but maybe yeah the photos by the way that they took so it published in the book called
00:06:17,00:06:22,the book of monsters and they are terrifying and what it really gives you for the first time
00:06:22,00:06:28,anyone really had it was the sort of point of view of say like an ant coming up against a giant
00:06:28,00:06:34,cockroach or a worm and it's terrifying the insect world is it's scary in black and white when it's
00:06:34,00:06:41,big it is they named the camera which is quite nice oh they call it long tom did you guys come
00:06:41,00:06:48,across Frank Percy Smith no okay I was looking up pioneers of insect photography um a crowded field
00:06:48,00:06:55,I think Frank Percy Smith is the other one 1880 to 1945 was his lifespan and he got okay
00:06:55,00:07:00,I'm just going to read out a quote I found Frank Percy Smith got his big break after he was so bored
00:07:00,00:07:07,at his day job that he adopted a pet blue bottle keeping it on a tiny lead and feeding it milk
00:07:07,00:07:13,that's so amazing now do we mean feeding it or submerging it in milk I was just thinking
00:07:13,00:07:17,we were chatting today Anna because I've been playing golf and there's loads of flies everywhere
00:07:17,00:07:22,and you said that a single fly followed you for about 45 minutes when you're walking to the
00:07:22,00:07:26,I didn't know the information about my private life was going to be brought to the table today
00:07:26,00:07:31,yes it was trying to domesticate itself I think it was and you were rejecting its overtures that's
00:07:31,00:07:36,very sad all the way down St Kilda road it's very annoying but he genuinely he had a pet fly
00:07:36,00:07:39,yeah he just had a pet blue bottle on his deck I mean that's I feel like people should be more
00:07:39,00:07:44,staggered about this yeah I mean he had it on a lead and he had a lead anyway how long did it live
00:07:44,00:07:50,sauce does not relate um but he he took close-up photos of the fly drinking its milk in the morning
00:07:50,00:07:55,okay um and he showed it to a film distributor who specialized in insects a guy called Charles Urban
00:07:55,00:08:00,and um this was in the 1900s he was so he was a young man at the time and he he's he would film
00:08:00,00:08:07,amazing footage of a fly juggling uh like a ball or a piece of corn or some twine really big bigger
00:08:07,00:08:12,than it was like much bigger than it was and it turned out the way he had done this okay it's
00:08:12,00:08:18,not great but what he had done was he had glued it upside down to something so his legs were all
00:08:18,00:08:24,sticking in the air and then put a little piece of fluff or whatever on it and it just bats it around
00:08:24,00:08:29,with his legs and it looks very very amusingly like it's juggling um the fly would be dead by now
00:08:29,00:08:33,anyway I think it's important to say that and um wait how was it bashing something around with
00:08:33,00:08:37,his legs if it's dead no no no it was alive at the time yeah he glued it upside down to the thing so
00:08:37,00:08:41,it would at least just saying that it's not offensive because the fly's dead but he will have
00:08:41,00:08:47,hundreds and hundreds of thousands of relatives exactly yeah many of them in tonight but he's
00:08:47,00:08:51,saying they're all waiting for you at the stage door right um but he's this was the little thing
00:08:51,00:08:56,but he said about his work he said I've always endeavored to administer the powder of instruction
00:08:56,00:09:02,in the jam of entertainment what a good motto for is it like the powder is the medicine like giving
00:09:02,00:09:07,your dog some some medicine or whatever I see yeah when he was a child Frank Percy Smith he was so
00:09:07,00:09:13,into nature uh that he lay down on a frozen lake with his head in a hole looking at the things that
00:09:13,00:09:18,were happening underneath the water and his friend found him like that and he'd become frozen to the
00:09:18,00:09:25,ice and had to be freed no really my goodness that's amazing um I've got a thing on early
00:09:25,00:09:31,photography here and I have a little riddle for you and I guess only you as well um which is 1837
00:09:31,00:09:39,the first ever photo is taken it's called boulevard de temple and in it you see the photographer is
00:09:39,00:09:44,looking down over a sort of promenade there's a big road and there's just one human there okay
00:09:44,00:09:48,so that's all you see it's the first photo so far as we know of a human in a photo
00:09:48,00:09:56,however the photo was basically taken during rush hour so there should have been horses there
00:09:56,00:10:04,should have been lots of people why is it just one man vampire's I guess yeah I've got it I've
00:10:04,00:10:10,got it now hang on please guys please let's see if the guy with the microphone can get it first
00:10:12,00:10:18,right the man the man who what did appear in the photo was a scuba diver who was stuck in a tree
00:10:18,00:10:26,and yes so it's because of the exposure exactly took seven minutes to get the exposure done right
00:10:26,00:10:31,he's still living statue he wasn't living statue he was having his shoe polished so he's standing
00:10:31,00:10:36,with one leg up which is clearly having the shoe polished and everyone else all the horses all the
00:10:36,00:10:39,everything that was going the people they just didn't connect with the photo because they weren't
00:10:39,00:10:45,in one spot for so long can I ask the guy who was polishing his shoes was he sort of doing this
00:10:45,00:10:49,you get you get a bit of him he's slightly there so he almost makes it into the first ever photo
00:10:49,00:10:56,of a human but that's it it looks like a desolate area with just one person and it's wow yeah you see
00:10:56,00:11:02,the jam of entertainment was the quiz and the powder of instruction was the information I think
00:11:02,00:11:08,that's what we do it's what we do it's what the largest camera on the planet yeah we're doing a
00:11:08,00:11:13,very long camera here long tom the largest camera on the planet was built in 1900 specifically to
00:11:13,00:11:19,take a photo the largest photo in the world large camera large photo what was it to photograph
00:11:19,00:11:26,oh okay was it a large building it was a large object the galaxy a moving object smaller than
00:11:26,00:11:33,the galaxy okay what was new and sexy and cool in 1900 more or less motor cars a bit older
00:11:33,00:11:39,but moving but moving I think yeah it was the handsomest train on the planet oh was that its
00:11:39,00:11:44,name or a train yeah it was it was blurbed as like this was the the pr around it was this is the
00:11:44,00:11:48,coolest most gorgeous train you'll ever see and it was it was called the Alton Limited built in
00:11:48,00:11:54,Illinois and the big deal was it was symmetrical that apparently I have no idea what previous
00:11:54,00:11:59,trains look like apparently completely like bulging on one side and they fell off the tracks a lot
00:11:59,00:12:03,yeah basically everything was the same length and height in it and that was amazing and they
00:12:03,00:12:06,had to make a single photo plate you know those plates that old photographers have dipped in it
00:12:06,00:12:10,was eight feet wide and four and a half feet tall it was like there was a giant needed to drop it
00:12:10,00:12:14,into the camera and the camera was 20 feet long as well and they got the shot that's very cool that's
00:12:14,00:12:21,awesome yeah love that good shot it's fine that doesn't say much for the handsomest train
00:12:23,00:12:30,here's a little quiz for you there is a thing called the Nikon Small World Photo Micrography
00:12:30,00:12:34,competition and it's a competition where you take photos of very very small things
00:12:34,00:12:41,and whichever is the most beautiful wint okay okay so in 1975 the winner was a photo of oxalic acid
00:12:41,00:12:51,crystals that were magnified 100 times okay so that's 1975 100 times in 2024 how many times
00:12:51,00:12:57,magnified was the winner so it's 100 times in 1975 okay it's either going to be 50 quadrillion or it's
00:12:57,00:13:05,going to be like twice as magnified yeah that's it 102 no um 100 times magnified 1975 yeah i'll say 100
00:13:05,00:13:10,uh i'll say half a million 500 000 times it's in between of the two extremities that you were
00:13:10,00:13:17,going for because it's actually still 100 so it was 100 in 1975 and it was 100 in 2024 and they
00:13:17,00:13:24,haven't been able to improve it since then really and the reason is physics it's just physics these
00:13:24,00:13:29,are not like electron microscopes or scanning tunneling microscopes or these special things that
00:13:29,00:13:35,physicists have these have got to be light photographs and once you get smaller than 100
00:13:35,00:13:41,times magnified the very light itself starts to diffract into each other and you can't see things
00:13:41,00:13:45,really right and even if you push your fingers out was an out was on the screen of your iphone
00:13:45,00:13:54,eventually believe it or not you will reach a limit wow that's so funny that's so it's an
00:13:54,00:14:02,annoying quiz which is why he said it i understand okay here's another early uh former photography
00:14:02,00:14:08,that was experimented with have you guys heard of thoughtography thought yeah thought photography
00:14:08,00:14:12,picturing parts of your brain and working out what people are thinking about from the neural
00:14:12,00:14:18,activity no it's uh it's basically psychic photography you have to stare at what you want
00:14:18,00:14:27,to be appearing on the photo and then gradually it comes onto the photo except it doesn't well tell
00:14:27,00:14:34,that to urie geller who is able to photograph himself with the lens cap on the camera although
00:14:34,00:14:38,for some reason he only takes photos of his forehead i can't work out why that is but um
00:14:38,00:14:44,but that's urie geller's our source is he uh yep oh no switch source cool well how about how about
00:14:44,00:14:53,this one optography octography yeah octo octography okay octo okay um so eight sided photographs
00:14:53,00:14:59,this is no i didn't actually look up the etymology um it's this was something that was actually
00:14:59,00:15:03,practiced in the late 1800s that they thought might be a thing it was when someone if they'd been
00:15:03,00:15:09,murdered you would take a photo of their eyes because they believed that the eyes captured
00:15:09,00:15:15,the final image it ever saw and they would see the murderer sort of like in the in the eye going
00:15:15,00:15:24,or whatever and they would then go that's martin and and fuss it's optography i think with a p right
00:15:24,00:15:29,that would make more sense wouldn't it unless people had eight eyes back then only spy does it
00:15:29,00:15:35,work yeah and it's always either an old woman or a bird that's the culprit i i remember reading
00:15:35,00:15:41,about this and i think so many people believed it that there were murders where they removed the
00:15:41,00:15:46,eyes because they thought the eyes would give them a yeah that's dark murderers dark murderers
00:15:46,00:15:59,it is time for fact number two and that is my fact my fact this week is that
00:15:59,00:16:06,in america there is a secret society called the order of the occult hand whose sole mission
00:16:06,00:16:12,is to sneak a very specific phrase into newspapers and we have no idea what that phrase is
00:16:12,00:16:23,so this is this started back in 1965 an american journalist called joseph flanders put into a
00:16:23,00:16:27,report that he was writing about where there was a murder and these words came up and said
00:16:27,00:16:33,it was as if some occult hand had moved pawn after pawn until they were in the right with
00:16:33,00:16:40,a w i think yeah how does it make sense when it's the other one it doesn't you could have
00:16:40,00:16:44,could have murdered in a newsagents which has moved palm after palm
00:16:44,00:16:54,how did they get the corpse onto the top shelf man found dead in penthouse the other kind of penthouse
00:16:54,00:17:06,so it was as if some occult hand had moved pawn after pawn until they were in the right place
00:17:06,00:17:11,and then tragedy and so that phrase made it in there that uh that little phrase about the occult
00:17:11,00:17:14,hand and he went to the pub and his buddies were giving him crap about this saying what that was
00:17:14,00:17:18,such a funny ridiculous thing and they decided we're going to start a secret society whereas
00:17:18,00:17:24,many journalists are going to try and slip that exact phrasing it was as if some occult hand had
00:17:24,00:17:29,dot dot dot into it and that was good because it was so pretentious yeah exactly it was just
00:17:29,00:17:35,such a ridiculous thing to write and so for 40 odd years it kept appearing in newspapers
00:17:35,00:17:39,and it started to be a thing where editors would find out that people were doing that
00:17:39,00:17:44,and so when it came to a final proofread of the articles that were going out they had to do
00:17:44,00:17:49,an occult hand check to make sure that the phrase hadn't been slipped into it and we only know what
00:17:49,00:17:55,the phrase is because in 2006 it got properly outed so instead of it dismantling they have
00:17:55,00:18:00,a new phrase now and we don't know what that is right so in the newspapers globally there is one
00:18:00,00:18:04,particular phrase that will still be appearing and until we know what that is it's going to be
00:18:04,00:18:13,their secret it's not trump has won the election is it imagine um yeah it is fantastic and newspaper
00:18:13,00:18:17,language is very you know specific about this kind of stuff so obviously the headlines you miss out a
00:18:17,00:18:22,lot of conjunctions and prepositions you miss out anything which slows down the phrase yeah
00:18:22,00:18:28,ideally dog bites man not a dog has bitten a man exactly exactly that and so it's obviously it makes
00:18:28,00:18:33,it spicier and more exciting and draws the reader in which is the whole point but sometimes you get
00:18:33,00:18:38,headlines which don't quite work as a result so there was a headline from 2014 Patrick Stewart
00:18:38,00:18:46,surprises fan with life-threatening illness which what a bastard
00:18:46,00:18:52,i'm afraid you won't live long in prosper
00:18:52,00:19:00,i like there are lots of things that are sort of concealed in newspapers aren't there lots of
00:19:00,00:19:06,kind of within fleet street jokes um often they happen when there's a bit of a disagreement between
00:19:06,00:19:11,the journalists who are writing this stuff and the owners of a newspaper and often those journalists
00:19:11,00:19:17,don't like those owners so in 2001 for instance Stephen Pollard was sacked from the express and
00:19:17,00:19:22,the express had recently been taken over by a guy called Richard Desmond and Pollard's last article
00:19:22,00:19:28,was just a very innocuous commentary on organic farming but the first letters of each sentence
00:19:28,00:19:36,spelled out fuck you Desmond she's very good and i also james may you got do you guys have top gear
00:19:37,00:19:45,james yeah james may of top gear fame in 1992 he was fired from auto car magazine because he
00:19:45,00:19:50,been asked to write 42 pages of like a roundup of the cars of the year and he had to do a little
00:19:50,00:19:56,review of each car and i think he thought this is a very tedious task but it's 42 pages of reviews
00:19:56,00:20:01,so he had to come up with a very long kind of a cross stick so the first letter of each review
00:20:01,00:20:06,spelled out so you think it's really good yeah you should try making the bloody thing up it's a real
00:20:06,00:20:12,pain in the arse wow that's really good we had to read quite a lot of old articles for this and
00:20:12,00:20:17,one of the ones that i get this is a bit non-sequitur but i read this amazing article in the new york
00:20:17,00:20:24,times about the grunge movement in seattle okay this is in 1992 and it had a list of grunge terms
00:20:24,00:20:28,and i just thought i could do a little quiz all right and see if you could say where they are
00:20:28,00:20:36,so in seattle in the 90s early 90s what was a cob nobler cob nobler oh uh shoe shiner shoe shiner
00:20:36,00:20:43,no i didn't really have so many shoe shines in seattle in the early night not for a dime sir
00:20:43,00:20:52,is it what you um is it what you call the little um thing that you stick into the
00:20:52,00:20:59,corner of the cob like it's a little knob oh i see no it's just a word for a loser um okay uh lame
00:20:59,00:21:04,stain lame lame stain sounds like another word for a loser it's another word for a loser uh wax
00:21:04,00:21:11,slacks uh all right james we get it you don't like hanging out with this um the trousers some kind
00:21:11,00:21:17,of yeah all drip jeans and swinging on the flippity flop oh that's just being a cool guy hanging out
00:21:17,00:21:26,it is is it hanging out that is honestly that's that's amazing andy you could have been in early
00:21:26,00:21:34,90s seattle in the grunge scene apart from the fact that they were all made up oh they were made up
00:21:34,00:21:39,by uh people who didn't like the fact that their scene was getting into the national press and so
00:21:39,00:21:44,they did a fake interview where they made up all of these words and it got into the times
00:21:44,00:21:49,and it was years later when they found out that it was that these were all fake and the new york
00:21:49,00:21:55,times dismissed the prank as irritating oh they really care about the this sort of accuracy of
00:21:55,00:21:59,everything they sort of check everything so many times i do think this phrase like what this phrase
00:21:59,00:22:03,might be is interesting yeah because they'll have been smuggling it in they will have been
00:22:03,00:22:10,concealing the powder of instruction in the jam of entertainment yes we might
00:22:10,00:22:14,the way i feel about it yeah yeah this is food for thought isn't it that's what's called purple
00:22:14,00:22:19,pros that's what journalists often refer to so this was a thing it's a style off the back of a
00:22:19,00:22:26,quote of a roman poet hoarse someone would basically patch purple onto their clothing
00:22:26,00:22:32,in order to make them look more rich but it was so badly done it was so obvious and so trying to be
00:22:32,00:22:37,pretentious that you would notice it immediately and for journalists uses purple pros yeah yeah
00:22:37,00:22:42,that's where i was from yeah um we should talk about australian hackery as well okay as australia
00:22:42,00:22:48,is home to you know great newspapers and and a great newspaper family
00:22:48,00:22:57,i'm so glad he's like that no sorry um who was that was that your elizabeth murdoch
00:22:57,00:23:06,um great australian headlines uh the northern territory news i i imagine it's
00:23:06,00:23:11,oh yeah mostly read in the northern territory but you know if you if you if you do subscribe
00:23:11,00:23:17,you will have doubtless been delighted by the 2013 headline why i stuck a cracker up my clacker
00:23:17,00:23:23,which was a first person account by a man who put a firework up his bottom
00:23:23,00:23:29,and it won its writer awokely which i gather is the highest award in australian journalism
00:23:30,00:23:37,is the Aussie Pulitzer as far as i can tell what is i haven't heard of that awokely oh well
00:23:37,00:23:43,so this before was about putting things into newspapers or tricking a newspaper of course
00:23:43,00:23:50,newspapers can trick their readers as well and it often happens on april the first usually quite
00:23:50,00:23:55,irritating i think actually there's someone who fell for the old spaghetti tree
00:23:57,00:24:04,but some of the like some of the worst april fools tricks in 1998 on the first of april in
00:24:04,00:24:11,iraq the newspaper that was owned by saddam hussein's son uday said that president clinton had decided
00:24:11,00:24:23,to lift all sanctions against iraq it was funny if you were there it is mental and then the next
00:24:23,00:24:33,day they had to admit they were joking ah gotcha no good um in 1927 uh princeton their internal
00:24:33,00:24:38,newspaper the daily prinstonian uh they revealed that the university was going to begin admitting
00:24:38,00:24:48,women oh can't believe anyone fell for that one and then in 1864 there was the evening star of
00:24:48,00:24:53,hislington they announced there was going to be a grand exhibition of donkeys at the agricultural
00:24:53,00:24:58,hall yeah and so the next day everyone went to see the donkeys and of course they were the donkeys
00:24:58,00:25:03,themselves oh i thought that's quite a good one that's very good i thought it was going to be that
00:25:03,00:25:07,people all brought their donkeys the next day like a load of donkey keepers would fell for it as well
00:25:07,00:25:11,but it doesn't sound like that happened no if you've got a donkey you probably can't do things
00:25:11,00:25:15,at one day's notice you probably have a plan if someone announces as an exhibition of something
00:25:15,00:25:20,you can't bring your own version if you see there's an art exhibition on make to disagree
00:25:20,00:25:26,make to disagree i frequently frequently take my sketches to the gallery i'd be turned up at cold
00:25:26,00:25:32,play with his guitar the other day no one could tell the difference um uh
00:25:32,00:25:44,it is time for fact number three that is james okay my fact this week is that 18th century king
00:25:44,00:25:55,of sweden gustav the third was into larping mm now so larping um live action roleplay for the
00:25:55,00:26:00,uninitiated but that is where you pretend to be someone from history so what's his excuse because
00:26:00,00:26:08,he's from history yeah but interestingly at the time he was from the present yeah right right it's
00:26:08,00:26:13,like so who was he dressing was he dressing up as someone further back from history can't can't
00:26:13,00:26:18,that's how time works yeah i mean that's like something i should have asked i don't know what
00:26:18,00:26:25,happened there how's a weird glitch uh so this is something i read at the museum of world culture
00:26:25,00:26:31,in gothenberg when we played gothenberg quite recently and he was a king who was really into
00:26:31,00:26:38,the arts and he knew that it would be good for promoting the monarchy and so he started these
00:26:38,00:26:42,festivals where there was loads of jousting tournaments and masquerades and stuff like that
00:26:42,00:26:49,that wasn't new but what was new is that he and his other royals would take part and they would act
00:26:49,00:26:56,out um battles from the past and show how great the monarchy was right and it's not that i made
00:26:56,00:27:02,up but i didn't sex it up by saying larping yeah no how could you um it was that is specifically
00:27:02,00:27:07,what it said in the gothenberg museum that it was larping okay but he didn't call it larping no no
00:27:07,00:27:12,because the initials would be different in swedish wouldn't they yeah that's what he said do we know
00:27:12,00:27:18,who he dressed up as specifically or uh it will have been his former relatives relatives yeah
00:27:18,00:27:24,ancestors his ancestors yeah okay right and this is the really so he was such a thespy king
00:27:24,00:27:27,basically i mean you know royalty is already full of pageantry and flummary and you know we
00:27:27,00:27:37,know you guys love that but um but his love of larp killed him he was uh i mean it really genuinely
00:27:37,00:27:43,did he was he he was at a look out nerds is what are you saying sorry go on he was at a masquerade
00:27:43,00:27:47,ball uh which he was excited about throwing you know everyone was in masks and dressed up and all
00:27:47,00:27:52,that he was in costume he was clearly identifiable as the king because he had a very notable star
00:27:52,00:27:57,medallion on his breast so he was clear who he was uh he had received multiple warnings not to go by
00:27:57,00:28:01,letter saying someone's going to kill you slash we're going to kill you slash don't go oh really
00:28:01,00:28:05,yeah he's at loads he got at the very end of supper just before the ball started he got one
00:28:05,00:28:11,final letter saying someone's going to try and kill you disregarded it went along anyway uh and was
00:28:11,00:28:16,and was was attacked who's delivering the letter like like as in i think it was a spies warning
00:28:16,00:28:20,that i've uncovered some kind of plot everyone's in masks though aren't they so it could have been
00:28:20,00:28:25,anyone yeah that's true except that we know who it was yeah we did well yeah we know who was um killed
00:28:25,00:28:33,for it don't we point a it was Jacob Johan and castrom whoa um we can't it's always the one you
00:28:33,00:28:41,least suspect csi Stockholm 1792 we can't keep making encouraging noises after every fact that
00:28:41,00:28:48,we say yeah that's my thing back off no b the assassination itself was extraordinary i i'm
00:28:48,00:28:52,actually kind of obsessed with Gustav III and i think he's an amazing person if a bit of a weirdo
00:28:52,00:28:57,and one of the things i love is how the assassination went down so it's 1792
00:28:57,00:29:04,and this guy Jacob comes with a cavalry pistol a big pistol and it's loaded with two balls or
00:29:04,00:29:11,bullets uh a bunch of nails 14 assorted scraps of lead and iron and he put the muzzle straight
00:29:11,00:29:16,into Gustav's back it was you know it was point blank pulled the trigger Gustav staggered but
00:29:16,00:29:22,didn't even fall over and the the assassin was so shocked he dropped all of his weapons he had
00:29:22,00:29:28,two guns on him and a knife and he dropped them all and uh Gustav had a hole so big in his back
00:29:28,00:29:35,you could put your whole fist in up to your wrist wow he still lived for two more weeks he did and
00:29:35,00:29:40,he's cool about it he tried to walk to hospital to start with as well and then he was like fuck
00:29:40,00:29:48,"and and they got him a chair and he was in Australia, he was in Australia, fuck mate,"
00:29:48,00:29:51,put a fist in that
00:29:51,00:29:59,he wasn't to role play but not that much into role play
00:29:59,00:30:05,and then he and then he sat back down on his chair and they carried the chair to where he was
00:30:05,00:30:09,getting medical attention that's one of those things where because it was such a documented
00:30:09,00:30:15,moment you can go visit the masquerade clothes that he's wearing that he was wearing in a museum
00:30:15,00:30:19,and they've still got supposedly the chair which is bloodstained and so on that you can visit as
00:30:19,00:30:24,well as like relics of Gustav and have you heard what he said when he was told who did it oh shit
00:30:24,00:30:33,mate it was in yeah it was that bonza what did he say he he was told who the culprit was because
00:30:33,00:30:39,they caught the assassin and he just said and he's got a fist-sized wrist deep hole in his back at
00:30:39,00:30:44,this point and he just says i don't want to know the names it's only their political plan i should
00:30:44,00:30:48,like to know about some time or other because i'm curious to see whether there was anything sensible
00:30:48,00:30:58,in it wow what a guy well and castrum was publicly flogged his right hand was cut off his head was
00:30:58,00:31:08,removed and his corpse was cut into quarters wow until he apologized and he had two accomplices
00:31:08,00:31:12,who were stripped of their titles and expelled from the country and they were called ribbing and
00:31:12,00:31:21,horn what ribbing ribbing ribbing and horn good no no further questions one more thing on masquerade
00:31:21,00:31:26,bowls really quickly just because we're on the topic there was a moral panic in the uk even about
00:31:26,00:31:32,masquerade bowls in the 18th century because they become really really popular in the upper class
00:31:32,00:31:38,and the bishop of london said that it was a plot devised by the french to neutralize the beauty
00:31:38,00:31:47,of english women okay so it's not the only way those disgusting french people can get any sex in
00:31:47,00:31:51,the uk is by everyone wearing masks yeah it makes sense what are you saying what what what is the
00:31:51,00:31:58,tone of sarcasm that i sense here i think it's an interesting point because i in my single days if
00:31:58,00:32:03,you go to a halloween party right everyone looks so hot but they would be not who they were right
00:32:03,00:32:10,it'd be like wow look at that skeleton she's awesome and and then she took up her outfit you put on a
00:32:10,00:32:21,lot of weight but there was a study that showed that uh people found during the covid pandemic
00:32:21,00:32:27,times that wearing a mask enhanced the hotness of the face people mistake oh really glamour yeah
00:32:27,00:32:38,exactly misty mystery hygiene sanitizer but i genuinely i i scored a date on her at a halloween
00:32:38,00:32:44,party and then we went on the actual date and like unfortunately ironically she was frightened
00:32:44,00:32:49,more on the date yeah when you turned up and i preferred her as a tetris block it was uh which
00:32:49,00:33:00,one the square no she was the l nice yeah um just a little bit more just have the third please
00:33:00,00:33:08,sorry to go sorry i know we're doing dan's dating history but he was incredibly interesting he was
00:33:08,00:33:13,the third swedish monarch to die of being shot in 160 years right apart from his father who
00:33:13,00:33:21,died after eating 14 helpings of sembler buns um just loved loved buns but he he did so many
00:33:21,00:33:26,different i mean he was a despot he he took over and he he rolled government back he was he was
00:33:26,00:33:32,anti-democratic but he banned torture and contributed to culture so he did a lot of self-promotion
00:33:32,00:33:38,and one of the most interesting things he did was he he was engaged at the age of five uh too young
00:33:38,00:33:43,to be married to be sorry here to be married to another five-year-old right oh that's not too
00:33:43,00:33:49,that princess from Denmark yes princess Sophia Magdalena of Denmark and then when they were 20
00:33:49,00:33:55,they got married but he wasn't there so you could do this thing of getting married by proxy yeah in
00:33:55,00:33:59,the old days if you were marrying another ruler then they were busy because they were on a campaign
00:33:59,00:34:03,or something yeah you would just have someone else step in so the bride's half-brother Frederick
00:34:03,00:34:08,played the role of the groom just at the ceremony just sort of in a purely ceremonial function
00:34:08,00:34:14,and only half brother exactly and then she came to Sweden and they properly got married um but they
00:34:14,00:34:19,did have to have a kind of um love tutor as in they they needed to be slightly taught the facts of
00:34:19,00:34:25,life uh because for 10 years they did not consummate the marriage and um they had to have a coach
00:34:25,00:34:33,who was Count Adolf Frederick Munch Alfvölkula who was the that's that sounds like a sexy Dracula
00:34:34,00:34:36,Count Fulkula
00:34:36,00:34:41,I want to suck you up nevermind
00:34:41,00:34:51,but there were rumors that Count Adolf was the father but when they eventually did have a child
00:34:51,00:34:56,and spread by his mom so Perot Gustav's mom Gustav's mom thought he was impotent was like he can't
00:34:56,00:35:02,perform sexually no way did he father that child and spread the rumor where even even in his own
00:35:02,00:35:08,diary Count Adolf unfortunate name said that he was obliged to physically touch and guide them
00:35:08,00:35:14,to the right positions because somewhat mysteriously he said they had both had anatomical problems
00:35:14,00:35:22,which caused some trouble what were they I must know um but yeah the mum was like my son is
00:35:22,00:35:26,bad in bed there's no way he's rather that child I bet it belongs to the count
00:35:27,00:35:32,Gustav the third he gave us the sweet you know the vegetable the sweet
00:35:32,00:35:37,it came from him because he's Swedish what what do you mean when you say gave us
00:35:37,00:35:43,well I'm going to explain but it's literal um so there was a guy called Patrick Miller who
00:35:43,00:35:48,invented a new kind of paddle steamer and he tried to sell it this feels like a start of a very long
00:35:48,00:35:54,story now we have to go back to Patrick Miller
00:35:54,00:36:00,you'll see why he's imported much later
00:36:00,00:36:06,so Patrick Miller I'm on tanto experience even if that one else is he tries to sell
00:36:06,00:36:12,his paddle steamer to Denmark and Denmark said we don't need your paddle steamer
00:36:12,00:36:18,but Denmark was at war with sweden at the time and so Miller went to sweden and said do you want
00:36:18,00:36:22,our paddle steamer and they said yes great we love paddle steamers so he sent the paddle
00:36:22,00:36:27,steamer over to sweden and by the time it got there the war had already finished this is like
00:36:27,00:36:34,grandpa simpson's story does he go to shelbyville with an onion in his pocket it was the fashion
00:36:34,00:36:44,at the time Andy okay so they got this pointless paddle steamer but he was really happy Gustav
00:36:44,00:36:50,and so he sent Patrick Miller a gold snuff box and a painting of the paddle steamer
00:36:50,00:36:59,and a swedish flag and a swede and the swede came with finally
00:36:59,00:37:06,and the um the swede came with some seeds that said plant me and he planted them and from then on
00:37:06,00:37:12,the uk could grow its own swedes right and because they came from sweden we called them swedes
00:37:12,00:37:14,and is anyone still here because i'm not sure
00:37:14,00:37:24,it is our it's time for our final fact and that is
00:37:24,00:37:29,Andy my fact is that some people have tattoos on the inside of their bottoms
00:37:29,00:37:39,um this is really interesting yeah so fashion not fashion the reverse necessity um
00:37:40,00:37:46,is that the reverse of controversial controversial yeah okay this is really interesting there is a
00:37:46,00:37:50,thing called endoscopic tattooing uh and it's colon tattooing so it's tattooing you know right
00:37:50,00:37:56,inside your bottom and the reason is that some people have lesions they have areas of unusual
00:37:56,00:38:01,tissue inside their bottoms and they might become dangerous in future years they're not now but they
00:38:01,00:38:05,need to be monitored you know if they if they change it's like having you know a mole that you're
00:38:05,00:38:09,keeping an eye on just in case it changes or anything yeah so they need to be kept an eye on
00:38:09,00:38:15,and for that they need to be marked and so this this in 2022 the american chemical society launched
00:38:15,00:38:19,a new ink that was going to be used for endoscopic tattooing so that's how i found this fact um
00:38:19,00:38:23,and basically it marks just sort of next to it because you can't mark the area itself but you
00:38:23,00:38:28,mark look here's the size here's the shape here's and there's a kind of whole code language of
00:38:28,00:38:32,what you are showing with this tattoo so that any future doctor can have a look at it and say
00:38:32,00:38:36,ah that's okay it hasn't changed or oh it has we need to might need to do something here so it's
00:38:36,00:38:44,just a brilliant area of do you know how do they get the pen up there like is it how do they do it
00:38:44,00:38:50,it's very hard to draw the dolphin with um i actually don't know i think i think it's like
00:38:50,00:38:55,endoscopes it's not the endoscope yeah it's endoscopes and it's very common and it's and it
00:38:55,00:38:59,serves a few purposes it's you know it's it's sometimes marks a site for surgical removal if
00:38:59,00:39:04,there's something that's been decided has to come out anyway um sometimes it says like here's a place
00:39:04,00:39:09,for follow-up to just check this out we've done some surgery just check it out but it is um it is
00:39:09,00:39:15,very cool i was very surprised to find a reddit thread about it from a surgeon who i guess operates
00:39:15,00:39:22,on areas that might have been previously tattooed to take away certain things and a big thing in this
00:39:22,00:39:29,industry is not tattooing the rectum so you you tattoo further up the colon but rectum don't
00:39:29,00:39:34,need to do it and the reddit thread the headline was please don't tattoo the rectum don't worry
00:39:34,00:39:39,we will find a tumor if it's there the tattoo gets in the way and makes everything hard to see
00:39:39,00:39:43,and dissect please which i was just very surprised that surgeons are using reddit as a way to say to
00:39:43,00:39:49,other surgeons please stop tattooing people's rectum that's so interesting there is i mean
00:39:49,00:39:54,there are people who will have tattoos down there for fashion reasons yeah uh there's a guy called
00:39:54,00:40:00,randy candy uh who will ink you anywhere you want and he'll give you a discount if you choose to do
00:40:00,00:40:09,it on your bum hole uh he's i don't want it yeah but sometimes if you don't have quite so much money
00:40:09,00:40:17,beggars can't be choosers can they andy you want to have i love mum somewhere um he's had he's done
00:40:17,00:40:23,like an enormous spider exiting someone's body oh cool that was extremely cheap he says basically
00:40:23,00:40:30,the weirder it gets the cheaper it becomes did you guys hear uh of the project whole glory in
00:40:30,00:40:35,2016 now whole glory this was it's not as bad as it sounds um there's a tattoo artist called scott
00:40:35,00:40:40,campbell who said anyone who puts their arm through this hole will get a tattoo all right you can't
00:40:40,00:40:47,decide what it's of which oh i see thank god you get no communication you just put and it was in
00:40:47,00:40:52,an art gallery that it happened so you would put your arm through and he was a sort of very famous
00:40:52,00:40:57,and decorated tattoo artist and did he do it like sometimes it was good and sometimes it was bad
00:40:57,00:41:02,that's right some of them were spelt well some of them were just one in five was like swastikas
00:41:04,00:41:11,i don't think i don't think he did that on swastikas um oh yes it's always good to drop them in um
00:41:11,00:41:18,if you were given the chance of having a swastika face tattoo yeah or losing your dominant hand
00:41:18,00:41:23,having it amputated which would you choose um i'm allowed to put a big eye patch on over the
00:41:23,00:41:28,tattoo for example what is it over your eye your whole face your whole face i'm sorry it's the
00:41:28,00:41:34,whole thing i think balaclava i think yeah the mystery that the mystery that dan was talking
00:41:34,00:41:39,about you know who's that guy why why do you think most people would say what did you i don't
00:41:39,00:41:44,even think i've read a study yeah 70 of people would rather have their dominant hand amputated
00:41:44,00:41:48,than have a swastika face tattoo that's fascinating yeah wow and it makes sense and
00:41:48,00:41:53,what a weird thing to cheer but yes yeah yeah it does make sense yeah okay well how about a wrong
00:41:53,00:41:58,tattoo i really like these so there's a this year uh an england football supporter was so
00:41:58,00:42:06,confident about england's chances in the euro's football that he got england euro 2024 winners
00:42:06,00:42:11,and the picture of the cup tattooed on his leg he's called dan thomas he's a data consultant
00:42:11,00:42:17,ironically and he he predicted a win for england in the final he said they're gonna win two one
00:42:17,00:42:22,and he one might remember england lost two one and he said he will get it altered after they
00:42:22,00:42:29,win in 2028 that's good so confident you can always get the word not tattooed above that
00:42:29,00:42:35,i like the person i've read about is probably a mate of this guy but um this is a guy called
00:42:35,00:42:42,tom washington he's from grinsby he got a lifetime ban from the airline jet two as a result of
00:42:42,00:42:48,exposing his pinocchio penis tattoo on the plane and i've seen a photo of it it's actually really
00:42:48,00:42:53,funny so i i don't see what the because he showed he just showed like the top so he didn't he didn't
00:42:53,00:43:00,take out his member what's his name uh what you want me to doubly name him tom washington
00:43:00,00:43:05,yeah yeah i think that's very funny are you lying tom they call him but yeah it's happened
00:43:05,00:43:09,there's an amazing thing so we're talking about medical tattoos basically medical tattoos have
00:43:09,00:43:15,been happening for basically since we've found a properly preserved human so uzi we've mentioned
00:43:15,00:43:20,this before so he was the iceman that was found in the alps yeah exactly and we found tattoos
00:43:20,00:43:24,all over his body and they think that it was almost like acupuncture spots like it was so that
00:43:24,00:43:29,they could spot where he needed to have things done but um all over the world tattoos are used
00:43:29,00:43:35,for similar reasons so there's a tribe in berma called the pakoku and they do a thing where
00:43:35,00:43:41,they're a snake society they play with snakes and they use them for rituals and so on all the time
00:43:41,00:43:45,but they're poisonous snakes and so what they do is they tattoo themselves once a week where they
00:43:45,00:43:50,mix the ink with the venom of the snake and it inoculates them to make sure that if they do get
00:43:50,00:43:54,bitten their body already has it inside so that they're okay and they have to do it as a weekly
00:43:54,00:44:00,ritual to do that so they get tattooed every week because it is mad that our bodies don't destroy
00:44:00,00:44:06,tattoos even you know a tattoo is any foreign object that you inject into your body is bad as
00:44:06,00:44:10,far as your body's concerned and it was quite confusing for a long time that our bodies don't
00:44:10,00:44:17,just get rid of the ink and the reason is much like a lactose intolerant person who loves pizza
00:44:17,00:44:25,the microfages the white blood cells love the taste of tattoo ink but can't digest it so it's so
00:44:25,00:44:29,interesting so if they could digest it well they would literally just eat the ink up you know they'd
00:44:29,00:44:33,be like foreign body inserted into you eat the ink up digest it get rid of it the tattoo would
00:44:33,00:44:38,disappear but they eat the ink and their bodies can't digest it and so it just sits there so when
00:44:38,00:44:44,you're seeing a tattoo you're seeing the stomachs of millions and millions of bacteria with ink inside
00:44:44,00:44:50,them the bacteria with terrible indigestion going how do i get rid of this and then they die and
00:44:50,00:44:55,another bacteria quickly eats the thing that they found in their stomach and it keeps on happening
00:44:55,00:44:58,that amazing that's so cool and makes them even more sexy if anything
00:44:58,00:45:07,the word tattoo comes from Tahitian and we've got it from Captain Cog's first flight so we got it
00:45:07,00:45:16,in English around 1760 1770 and according to the OED the word is onomatopoeic so it comes from the
00:45:16,00:45:24,sound so the tat comes from the tapping of a tattooing instrument into the skin and the ooo comes
00:45:24,00:45:31,from the cry of pain from the person being tattooed brilliant that's amazing that's so good um have
00:45:31,00:45:36,you heard of 3d tattoos no these are brilliant okay these are another medical innovation they're
00:45:36,00:45:40,so good um so i was reading about a woman from the isle of wight who she had to have a hernia
00:45:40,00:45:46,operation and she lost her belly button okay so she felt a bit self-conscious and she decided to
00:45:46,00:45:50,get a 3d tattoo the photos of it are unbelievable i wish i could show you all now i wish i brought a
00:45:50,00:45:56,bit of paper with it printed out because it looks so so realistic isn't there a model with a fake
00:45:56,00:46:00,belly button or not maybe i thought there was a model with no belly button or there's a model
00:46:00,00:46:04,with three belly button no there can't be a model with three belly buttons there's something um but
00:46:04,00:46:07,the recipient said it was so good that her son wanted to sort of put his finger in it because
00:46:07,00:46:12,he couldn't believe it wasn't real it does and it looks unbelievably good i think the thing is
00:46:12,00:46:18,about belly buttons as well is depending on how high or how low they are it can be like a visual
00:46:18,00:46:23,illusion of how long your legs are or how high your torso is so you could deliberately get your
00:46:23,00:46:27,belly button a little bit higher or a little bit maybe not right up there because legs go all the
00:46:27,00:46:34,way up to his nipples so hard because there was that claimed trend wasn't there in somewhere like
00:46:34,00:46:39,china people having belly buttons put on their stomachs higher up yeah that's what we're talking
00:46:39,00:46:44,about yeah unless you have any regrets andy i think you could brought an a4 print out of this belly
00:46:44,00:46:50,button here tonight it wouldn't have made a difference to anyone's lives right good point
00:46:50,00:46:54,another another weird interesting new tattoo that i've never seen before but someone showed us the
00:46:54,00:47:00,other night we went out drinking with one of the old wiggles a couple nights ago sam the former yellow
00:47:00,00:47:06,wiggle and um he's got amazing tattoos he's got a tattoo on one arm which is every country he goes
00:47:06,00:47:10,to whatever is stamped into his passport he gets tattooed onto his arm while he's in the country
00:47:10,00:47:16,so his arm is covered in passport stamps but on his right arm you can't see it it's in uv you get
00:47:16,00:47:21,uv tattoos now which i hadn't heard of but that might be very obvious to a lot of people but yeah
00:47:21,00:47:26,so yeah so you have to go under uv light in order to see it and it comes through um but it's invisible
00:47:26,00:47:32,during the day really awesome so you have to keep going clubbing yeah well he showed me as we were
00:47:32,00:47:46,shooting up heroin in a public toilet and it really pops when you see it but that is it for now
00:47:46,00:47:52,that is all of our facts thank you so much for listening melbourne you've been amazing we will
00:47:52,00:48:08,be back thank you very much for the rest of you we'll see you next week
