 Hi everyone and welcome to the last episode of Gnosis Like This Fish before Christmas.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,960
 We're getting really close to Christmas now so obviously very very much in the last minute

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,040
 stocking filler area but if you have very odd shaped stockings then maybe you would like to

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,760
 buy some of our books because probably from some online retailers you'll be able to get them just

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,440
 in time if you're listening to this on Friday or Saturday so let me remind you what we have.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,760
 Andrew Hunter Murray has written a number of novels but his latest one is A Beginner's

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,800
 Guides to Breaking and Entering. It is a book that shows off everything you love about Andy,

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,320
 it's very funny, very witty and at the same time has his classic thriller structure as they all do,

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,480
 all of his books. Dan Schreiber has a book called Impossible Things, it is a children's book and

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,440
 it is a way to get your children to think like Dan Schreiber. Is that the kind of thing you

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,880
 want? Well let's be honest it is, he has a unique brain and his books are absolutely amazing and

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,520
 it really gets kids interested in everything that's going on around them and if you're an

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,280
 adult which you probably are if you're listening to this then you can get the theory of everything

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,880
 else which is his adult's version of that book. When I say adult I mean it's for adults not that

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,040
 it has anything naughty in it, it is complete family friendly fun. Of course Anna and I also

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,560
 have a book it's called A Load of All Balls, doesn't sound very family friendly does it but it is our

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,880
 look at the world of sports. If you've got any difficulty buying for relatives but you know

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,520
 that they like any kind of sport then this is one to get for them because it is a classic

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,680
 QI thing of all the kind of weird facts that even the biggest sports fan in your family will not know

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,360
 and actually even if you don't like sports we know that you will like this because there's a

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,760
 book full of facts and it really gives you an idea of why humans like this thing that a lot of us

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,560
 really find quite impenetrable. Anyway so that's the books from the three of us get them now they're

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,600
 the perfect present for any fish fan in your life but don't worry if you can't or don't want to get

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,320
 those it's absolutely no problem all we really want is that you listen to and enjoy the podcast

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,360
 which is free and which will always be free so there's nothing more to say I suppose then Merry

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:23,520
 Christmas hope you have a great time over the next couple of weeks and on with the podcast

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,640
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,120
 this week coming to you live from Melbourne

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:58,080
 My name is Dan Schreiber I am sitting here with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,120
 Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

32
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,000
 from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with fact number one

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,760
 and that is Anna. My fact this week is that to get a good close-up photo in the early 1900s

34
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,360
 your camera had to be 20 feet long which was tough to take in hand luggage we've got a photo of it

35
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,880
 up on the screen a black and white photo we do so there's a picture here of the two people who had

36
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,360
 to operate this camera who were David and Marion Fairchild I think we mentioned them briefly on

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,920
 the show before she was Alexander Graham Bell's daughter and this is around 1913 and David really

38
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,240
 wanted to take some close-ups of insects he thought they were very very beautiful uh creepy

39
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,160
 crawlies and he was annoyed that the only way you could look at them close-up was by killing

40
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,760
 them squashing them drying them out and putting them in a book so he was like let's try take some

41
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,000
 pictures but in order to get the magnification you need this incredibly long extension tube

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,280
 or you did when the tech was a little bit simpler and so you've got the lens at one end

43
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,280
 which person number one is having to hold and then at the very other end of the camera you

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,200
 have the person who takes the photo and eventually you get an insect in very high definition well

45
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,080
 these insects living can I ask Anna they were not it was actually quite amazing what they did so

46
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,920
 yeah so it wasn't I thought at first how lovely he wanted to keep them alive to photograph them

47
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,400
 no he just didn't want them dried out so Marianne actually came up because I've already needed an

48
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,680
 exposure of 80 seconds yeah which are no insects no matter how well trained is going to sit there

49
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,200
 I can't sit there they might be asleep right they might be asleep they might be asleep sorry I've

50
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,520
 seen insects stay still for long periods of time but these ones were deceased and the way they did

51
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,760
 it was Marianne would cover a block of wood with a layer of candle wax and then she'd put a leaf

52
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,000
 on top so it looks like it's in a realistic position because insects hang out on leaves

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,560
 and then with a little pin made a few holes for each foot of the insect in the leaf

54
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,800
 and the feet would stick to the wax underneath and so then it would look like they were naturally

55
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,280
 just standing on this leaf right okay there are some other ways of doing it these days if you

56
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,640
 have forums of how to photograph insects they come up with ideas one idea is to put them in the

57
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,840
 freezer for 20 minutes and that will keep them still but it won't kill them right which is good

58
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,720
 another one is if you let's say it's one that doesn't fly if you put it on a table and then put

59
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,440
 vapor rub fix vapor rub around it then it won't be able to get out of there and so it'll just stay

60
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,480
 in that little I thought you were going to say they're superstitious and they won't step over

61
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,560
 it's like summoning a demon that's okay they just slip around and one of the earliest this wasn't

62
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,200
 photography but one of the earliest close-up books was Robert Huck's micrographia so that

63
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,600
 will have been what 17th century I guess and he drew lots of pictures of tiny insects that he could

64
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,760
 see through these new lenses that have been invented and the way that he did it was that he

65
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:59,520
 would give a fly a quarter of a pint of brandy oh no sorry what do you mean give a fly a quarter of

66
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:07,760
 all right lightweight if even Anna is quibbling over the you know I'm not sure I can wouldn't he

67
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,080
 would he drop them in it yeah he would put them in it oh no he probably could have gone for a bit

68
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,040
 less brandy but maybe yeah the photos by the way that they took so it published in the book called

69
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,560
 the book of monsters and they are terrifying and what it really gives you for the first time

70
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,880
 anyone really had it was the sort of point of view of say like an ant coming up against a giant

71
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,640
 cockroach or a worm and it's terrifying the insect world is it's scary in black and white when it's

72
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:41,600
 big it is they named the camera which is quite nice oh they call it long tom did you guys come

73
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,240
 across Frank Percy Smith no okay I was looking up pioneers of insect photography um a crowded field

74
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,920
 I think Frank Percy Smith is the other one 1880 to 1945 was his lifespan and he got okay

75
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,400
 I'm just going to read out a quote I found Frank Percy Smith got his big break after he was so bored

76
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,280
 at his day job that he adopted a pet blue bottle keeping it on a tiny lead and feeding it milk

77
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,040
 that's so amazing now do we mean feeding it or submerging it in milk I was just thinking

78
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,120
 we were chatting today Anna because I've been playing golf and there's loads of flies everywhere

79
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,480
 and you said that a single fly followed you for about 45 minutes when you're walking to the

80
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,640
 I didn't know the information about my private life was going to be brought to the table today

81
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,520
 yes it was trying to domesticate itself I think it was and you were rejecting its overtures that's

82
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,480
 very sad all the way down St Kilda road it's very annoying but he genuinely he had a pet fly

83
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,600
 yeah he just had a pet blue bottle on his deck I mean that's I feel like people should be more

84
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,400
 staggered about this yeah I mean he had it on a lead and he had a lead anyway how long did it live

85
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,960
 sauce does not relate um but he he took close-up photos of the fly drinking its milk in the morning

86
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,680
 okay um and he showed it to a film distributor who specialized in insects a guy called Charles Urban

87
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,480
 and um this was in the 1900s he was so he was a young man at the time and he he's he would film

88
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:07,600
 amazing footage of a fly juggling uh like a ball or a piece of corn or some twine really big bigger

89
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,880
 than it was like much bigger than it was and it turned out the way he had done this okay it's

90
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,960
 not great but what he had done was he had glued it upside down to something so his legs were all

91
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,320
 sticking in the air and then put a little piece of fluff or whatever on it and it just bats it around

92
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,520
 with his legs and it looks very very amusingly like it's juggling um the fly would be dead by now

93
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,600
 anyway I think it's important to say that and um wait how was it bashing something around with

94
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,840
 his legs if it's dead no no no it was alive at the time yeah he glued it upside down to the thing so

95
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,920
 it would at least just saying that it's not offensive because the fly's dead but he will have

96
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,760
 hundreds and hundreds of thousands of relatives exactly yeah many of them in tonight but he's

97
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,840
 saying they're all waiting for you at the stage door right um but he's this was the little thing

98
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,000
 but he said about his work he said I've always endeavored to administer the powder of instruction

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,080
 in the jam of entertainment what a good motto for is it like the powder is the medicine like giving

100
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,040
 your dog some some medicine or whatever I see yeah when he was a child Frank Percy Smith he was so

101
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,680
 into nature uh that he lay down on a frozen lake with his head in a hole looking at the things that

102
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,240
 were happening underneath the water and his friend found him like that and he'd become frozen to the

103
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,040
 ice and had to be freed no really my goodness that's amazing um I've got a thing on early

104
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,920
 photography here and I have a little riddle for you and I guess only you as well um which is 1837

105
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,120
 the first ever photo is taken it's called boulevard de temple and in it you see the photographer is

106
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,560
 looking down over a sort of promenade there's a big road and there's just one human there okay

107
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,960
 so that's all you see it's the first photo so far as we know of a human in a photo

108
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:56,400
 however the photo was basically taken during rush hour so there should have been horses there

109
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:04,560
 should have been lots of people why is it just one man vampire's I guess yeah I've got it I've

110
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,560
 got it now hang on please guys please let's see if the guy with the microphone can get it first

111
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,240
 right the man the man who what did appear in the photo was a scuba diver who was stuck in a tree

112
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:26,000
 and yes so it's because of the exposure exactly took seven minutes to get the exposure done right

113
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,200
 he's still living statue he wasn't living statue he was having his shoe polished so he's standing

114
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,320
 with one leg up which is clearly having the shoe polished and everyone else all the horses all the

115
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,920
 everything that was going the people they just didn't connect with the photo because they weren't

116
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,600
 in one spot for so long can I ask the guy who was polishing his shoes was he sort of doing this

117
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,920
 you get you get a bit of him he's slightly there so he almost makes it into the first ever photo

118
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,160
 of a human but that's it it looks like a desolate area with just one person and it's wow yeah you see

119
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,560
 the jam of entertainment was the quiz and the powder of instruction was the information I think

120
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,960
 that's what we do it's what we do it's what the largest camera on the planet yeah we're doing a

121
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,760
 very long camera here long tom the largest camera on the planet was built in 1900 specifically to

122
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,360
 take a photo the largest photo in the world large camera large photo what was it to photograph

123
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,160
 oh okay was it a large building it was a large object the galaxy a moving object smaller than

124
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,520
 the galaxy okay what was new and sexy and cool in 1900 more or less motor cars a bit older

125
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,600
 but moving but moving I think yeah it was the handsomest train on the planet oh was that its

126
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,160
 name or a train yeah it was it was blurbed as like this was the the pr around it was this is the

127
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,880
 coolest most gorgeous train you'll ever see and it was it was called the Alton Limited built in

128
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,400
 Illinois and the big deal was it was symmetrical that apparently I have no idea what previous

129
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,200
 trains look like apparently completely like bulging on one side and they fell off the tracks a lot

130
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,520
 yeah basically everything was the same length and height in it and that was amazing and they

131
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,800
 had to make a single photo plate you know those plates that old photographers have dipped in it

132
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,880
 was eight feet wide and four and a half feet tall it was like there was a giant needed to drop it

133
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,880
 into the camera and the camera was 20 feet long as well and they got the shot that's very cool that's

134
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,840
 awesome yeah love that good shot it's fine that doesn't say much for the handsomest train

135
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:30,320
 here's a little quiz for you there is a thing called the Nikon Small World Photo Micrography

136
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,960
 competition and it's a competition where you take photos of very very small things

137
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,120
 and whichever is the most beautiful wint okay okay so in 1975 the winner was a photo of oxalic acid

138
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:51,120
 crystals that were magnified 100 times okay so that's 1975 100 times in 2024 how many times

139
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,520
 magnified was the winner so it's 100 times in 1975 okay it's either going to be 50 quadrillion or it's

140
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:05,840
 going to be like twice as magnified yeah that's it 102 no um 100 times magnified 1975 yeah i'll say 100

141
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,400
 uh i'll say half a million 500 000 times it's in between of the two extremities that you were

142
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,440
 going for because it's actually still 100 so it was 100 in 1975 and it was 100 in 2024 and they

143
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,560
 haven't been able to improve it since then really and the reason is physics it's just physics these

144
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,360
 are not like electron microscopes or scanning tunneling microscopes or these special things that

145
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,280
 physicists have these have got to be light photographs and once you get smaller than 100

146
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:41,280
 times magnified the very light itself starts to diffract into each other and you can't see things

147
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,200
 really right and even if you push your fingers out was an out was on the screen of your iphone

148
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:54,880
 eventually believe it or not you will reach a limit wow that's so funny that's so it's an

149
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,080
 annoying quiz which is why he said it i understand okay here's another early uh former photography

150
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:08,880
 that was experimented with have you guys heard of thoughtography thought yeah thought photography

151
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,160
 picturing parts of your brain and working out what people are thinking about from the neural

152
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,320
 activity no it's uh it's basically psychic photography you have to stare at what you want

153
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:27,760
 to be appearing on the photo and then gradually it comes onto the photo except it doesn't well tell

154
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,160
 that to urie geller who is able to photograph himself with the lens cap on the camera although

155
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,240
 for some reason he only takes photos of his forehead i can't work out why that is but um

156
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,160
 but that's urie geller's our source is he uh yep oh no switch source cool well how about how about

157
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:53,120
 this one optography octography yeah octo octography okay octo okay um so eight sided photographs

158
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,120
 this is no i didn't actually look up the etymology um it's this was something that was actually

159
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,600
 practiced in the late 1800s that they thought might be a thing it was when someone if they'd been

160
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,520
 murdered you would take a photo of their eyes because they believed that the eyes captured

161
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,920
 the final image it ever saw and they would see the murderer sort of like in the in the eye going

162
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:24,720
 or whatever and they would then go that's martin and and fuss it's optography i think with a p right

163
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,840
 that would make more sense wouldn't it unless people had eight eyes back then only spy does it

164
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,840
 work yeah and it's always either an old woman or a bird that's the culprit i i remember reading

165
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:41,040
 about this and i think so many people believed it that there were murders where they removed the

166
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,560
 eyes because they thought the eyes would give them a yeah that's dark murderers dark murderers

167
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:59,440
 it is time for fact number two and that is my fact my fact this week is that

168
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,160
 in america there is a secret society called the order of the occult hand whose sole mission

169
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,240
 is to sneak a very specific phrase into newspapers and we have no idea what that phrase is

170
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:23,040
 so this is this started back in 1965 an american journalist called joseph flanders put into a

171
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,680
 report that he was writing about where there was a murder and these words came up and said

172
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,600
 it was as if some occult hand had moved pawn after pawn until they were in the right with

173
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,560
 a w i think yeah how does it make sense when it's the other one it doesn't you could have

174
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,800
 could have murdered in a newsagents which has moved palm after palm

175
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:54,480
 how did they get the corpse onto the top shelf man found dead in penthouse the other kind of penthouse

176
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:06,000
 so it was as if some occult hand had moved pawn after pawn until they were in the right place

177
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,120
 and then tragedy and so that phrase made it in there that uh that little phrase about the occult

178
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,800
 hand and he went to the pub and his buddies were giving him crap about this saying what that was

179
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,960
 such a funny ridiculous thing and they decided we're going to start a secret society whereas

180
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,400
 many journalists are going to try and slip that exact phrasing it was as if some occult hand had

181
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,280
 dot dot dot into it and that was good because it was so pretentious yeah exactly it was just

182
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,360
 such a ridiculous thing to write and so for 40 odd years it kept appearing in newspapers

183
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,840
 and it started to be a thing where editors would find out that people were doing that

184
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,000
 and so when it came to a final proofread of the articles that were going out they had to do

185
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,280
 an occult hand check to make sure that the phrase hadn't been slipped into it and we only know what

186
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,280
 the phrase is because in 2006 it got properly outed so instead of it dismantling they have

187
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,800
 a new phrase now and we don't know what that is right so in the newspapers globally there is one

188
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,880
 particular phrase that will still be appearing and until we know what that is it's going to be

189
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:13,200
 their secret it's not trump has won the election is it imagine um yeah it is fantastic and newspaper

190
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,920
 language is very you know specific about this kind of stuff so obviously the headlines you miss out a

191
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,320
 lot of conjunctions and prepositions you miss out anything which slows down the phrase yeah

192
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,720
 ideally dog bites man not a dog has bitten a man exactly exactly that and so it's obviously it makes

193
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,360
 it spicier and more exciting and draws the reader in which is the whole point but sometimes you get

194
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,480
 headlines which don't quite work as a result so there was a headline from 2014 Patrick Stewart

195
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:46,640
 surprises fan with life-threatening illness which what a bastard

196
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,480
 i'm afraid you won't live long in prosper

197
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:00,560
 i like there are lots of things that are sort of concealed in newspapers aren't there lots of

198
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:06,960
 kind of within fleet street jokes um often they happen when there's a bit of a disagreement between

199
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,680
 the journalists who are writing this stuff and the owners of a newspaper and often those journalists

200
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,200
 don't like those owners so in 2001 for instance Stephen Pollard was sacked from the express and

201
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,640
 the express had recently been taken over by a guy called Richard Desmond and Pollard's last article

202
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,400
 was just a very innocuous commentary on organic farming but the first letters of each sentence

203
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:36,800
 spelled out fuck you Desmond she's very good and i also james may you got do you guys have top gear

204
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:45,840
 james yeah james may of top gear fame in 1992 he was fired from auto car magazine because he

205
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,720
 been asked to write 42 pages of like a roundup of the cars of the year and he had to do a little

206
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,240
 review of each car and i think he thought this is a very tedious task but it's 42 pages of reviews

207
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,040
 so he had to come up with a very long kind of a cross stick so the first letter of each review

208
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,080
 spelled out so you think it's really good yeah you should try making the bloody thing up it's a real

209
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,960
 pain in the arse wow that's really good we had to read quite a lot of old articles for this and

210
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,600
 one of the ones that i get this is a bit non-sequitur but i read this amazing article in the new york

211
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,800
 times about the grunge movement in seattle okay this is in 1992 and it had a list of grunge terms

212
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 and i just thought i could do a little quiz all right and see if you could say where they are

213
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:36,400
 so in seattle in the 90s early 90s what was a cob nobler cob nobler oh uh shoe shiner shoe shiner

214
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,440
 no i didn't really have so many shoe shines in seattle in the early night not for a dime sir

215
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:52,880
 is it what you um is it what you call the little um thing that you stick into the

216
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,040
 corner of the cob like it's a little knob oh i see no it's just a word for a loser um okay uh lame

217
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,800
 stain lame lame stain sounds like another word for a loser it's another word for a loser uh wax

218
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:11,200
 slacks uh all right james we get it you don't like hanging out with this um the trousers some kind

219
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,760
 of yeah all drip jeans and swinging on the flippity flop oh that's just being a cool guy hanging out

220
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:26,160
 it is is it hanging out that is honestly that's that's amazing andy you could have been in early

221
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:34,560
 90s seattle in the grunge scene apart from the fact that they were all made up oh they were made up

222
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,440
 by uh people who didn't like the fact that their scene was getting into the national press and so

223
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,560
 they did a fake interview where they made up all of these words and it got into the times

224
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,280
 and it was years later when they found out that it was that these were all fake and the new york

225
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,840
 times dismissed the prank as irritating oh they really care about the this sort of accuracy of

226
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,920
 everything they sort of check everything so many times i do think this phrase like what this phrase

227
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,200
 might be is interesting yeah because they'll have been smuggling it in they will have been

228
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:10,960
 concealing the powder of instruction in the jam of entertainment yes we might

229
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,960
 the way i feel about it yeah yeah this is food for thought isn't it that's what's called purple

230
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,920
 pros that's what journalists often refer to so this was a thing it's a style off the back of a

231
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:26,080
 quote of a roman poet hoarse someone would basically patch purple onto their clothing

232
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,000
 in order to make them look more rich but it was so badly done it was so obvious and so trying to be

233
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,280
 pretentious that you would notice it immediately and for journalists uses purple pros yeah yeah

234
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,560
 that's where i was from yeah um we should talk about australian hackery as well okay as australia

235
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:48,640
 is home to you know great newspapers and and a great newspaper family

236
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:57,360
 i'm so glad he's like that no sorry um who was that was that your elizabeth murdoch

237
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:06,080
 um great australian headlines uh the northern territory news i i imagine it's

238
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,600
 oh yeah mostly read in the northern territory but you know if you if you if you do subscribe

239
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,680
 you will have doubtless been delighted by the 2013 headline why i stuck a cracker up my clacker

240
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:23,600
 which was a first person account by a man who put a firework up his bottom

241
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,600
 and it won its writer awokely which i gather is the highest award in australian journalism

242
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:37,600
 is the Aussie Pulitzer as far as i can tell what is i haven't heard of that awokely oh well

243
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,440
 so this before was about putting things into newspapers or tricking a newspaper of course

244
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,400
 newspapers can trick their readers as well and it often happens on april the first usually quite

245
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,040
 irritating i think actually there's someone who fell for the old spaghetti tree

246
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,320
 but some of the like some of the worst april fools tricks in 1998 on the first of april in

247
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,920
 iraq the newspaper that was owned by saddam hussein's son uday said that president clinton had decided

248
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:23,840
 to lift all sanctions against iraq it was funny if you were there it is mental and then the next

249
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:33,200
 day they had to admit they were joking ah gotcha no good um in 1927 uh princeton their internal

250
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,800
 newspaper the daily prinstonian uh they revealed that the university was going to begin admitting

251
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:48,480
 women oh can't believe anyone fell for that one and then in 1864 there was the evening star of

252
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,440
 hislington they announced there was going to be a grand exhibition of donkeys at the agricultural

253
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,640
 hall yeah and so the next day everyone went to see the donkeys and of course they were the donkeys

254
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,280
 themselves oh i thought that's quite a good one that's very good i thought it was going to be that

255
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,360
 people all brought their donkeys the next day like a load of donkey keepers would fell for it as well

256
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,440
 but it doesn't sound like that happened no if you've got a donkey you probably can't do things

257
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,760
 at one day's notice you probably have a plan if someone announces as an exhibition of something

258
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,080
 you can't bring your own version if you see there's an art exhibition on make to disagree

259
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,000
 make to disagree i frequently frequently take my sketches to the gallery i'd be turned up at cold

260
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,800
 play with his guitar the other day no one could tell the difference um uh

261
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:44,800
 it is time for fact number three that is james okay my fact this week is that 18th century king

262
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:55,520
 of sweden gustav the third was into larping mm now so larping um live action roleplay for the

263
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,160
 uninitiated but that is where you pretend to be someone from history so what's his excuse because

264
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:08,000
 he's from history yeah but interestingly at the time he was from the present yeah right right it's

265
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,680
 like so who was he dressing was he dressing up as someone further back from history can't can't

266
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,880
 that's how time works yeah i mean that's like something i should have asked i don't know what

267
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,360
 happened there how's a weird glitch uh so this is something i read at the museum of world culture

268
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,040
 in gothenberg when we played gothenberg quite recently and he was a king who was really into

269
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:38,080
 the arts and he knew that it would be good for promoting the monarchy and so he started these

270
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,400
 festivals where there was loads of jousting tournaments and masquerades and stuff like that

271
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:49,200
 that wasn't new but what was new is that he and his other royals would take part and they would act

272
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,320
 out um battles from the past and show how great the monarchy was right and it's not that i made

273
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,320
 up but i didn't sex it up by saying larping yeah no how could you um it was that is specifically

274
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,280
 what it said in the gothenberg museum that it was larping okay but he didn't call it larping no no

275
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,000
 because the initials would be different in swedish wouldn't they yeah that's what he said do we know

276
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,480
 who he dressed up as specifically or uh it will have been his former relatives relatives yeah

277
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,080
 ancestors his ancestors yeah okay right and this is the really so he was such a thespy king

278
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,920
 basically i mean you know royalty is already full of pageantry and flummary and you know we

279
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:37,520
 know you guys love that but um but his love of larp killed him he was uh i mean it really genuinely

280
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,280
 did he was he he was at a look out nerds is what are you saying sorry go on he was at a masquerade

281
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,520
 ball uh which he was excited about throwing you know everyone was in masks and dressed up and all

282
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,080
 that he was in costume he was clearly identifiable as the king because he had a very notable star

283
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,120
 medallion on his breast so he was clear who he was uh he had received multiple warnings not to go by

284
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,760
 letter saying someone's going to kill you slash we're going to kill you slash don't go oh really

285
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,920
 yeah he's at loads he got at the very end of supper just before the ball started he got one

286
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,120
 final letter saying someone's going to try and kill you disregarded it went along anyway uh and was

287
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,000
 and was was attacked who's delivering the letter like like as in i think it was a spies warning

288
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,240
 that i've uncovered some kind of plot everyone's in masks though aren't they so it could have been

289
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,680
 anyone yeah that's true except that we know who it was yeah we did well yeah we know who was um killed

290
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:33,520
 for it don't we point a it was Jacob Johan and castrom whoa um we can't it's always the one you

291
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:41,920
 least suspect csi Stockholm 1792 we can't keep making encouraging noises after every fact that

292
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,160
 we say yeah that's my thing back off no b the assassination itself was extraordinary i i'm

293
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,800
 actually kind of obsessed with Gustav III and i think he's an amazing person if a bit of a weirdo

294
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,520
 and one of the things i love is how the assassination went down so it's 1792

295
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,480
 and this guy Jacob comes with a cavalry pistol a big pistol and it's loaded with two balls or

296
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,120
 bullets uh a bunch of nails 14 assorted scraps of lead and iron and he put the muzzle straight

297
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,320
 into Gustav's back it was you know it was point blank pulled the trigger Gustav staggered but

298
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,080
 didn't even fall over and the the assassin was so shocked he dropped all of his weapons he had

299
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:28,080
 two guns on him and a knife and he dropped them all and uh Gustav had a hole so big in his back

300
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:35,200
 you could put your whole fist in up to your wrist wow he still lived for two more weeks he did and

301
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,880
 he's cool about it he tried to walk to hospital to start with as well and then he was like fuck

302
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:48,880
 and and they got him a chair and he was in Australia, he was in Australia, fuck mate,

303
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,360
 put a fist in that

304
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:59,040
 he wasn't to role play but not that much into role play

305
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:05,200
 and then he and then he sat back down on his chair and they carried the chair to where he was

306
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,680
 getting medical attention that's one of those things where because it was such a documented

307
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,120
 moment you can go visit the masquerade clothes that he's wearing that he was wearing in a museum

308
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,440
 and they've still got supposedly the chair which is bloodstained and so on that you can visit as

309
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,320
 well as like relics of Gustav and have you heard what he said when he was told who did it oh shit

310
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:33,840
 mate it was in yeah it was that bonza what did he say he he was told who the culprit was because

311
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,360
 they caught the assassin and he just said and he's got a fist-sized wrist deep hole in his back at

312
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,640
 this point and he just says i don't want to know the names it's only their political plan i should

313
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,880
 like to know about some time or other because i'm curious to see whether there was anything sensible

314
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:58,400
 in it wow what a guy well and castrum was publicly flogged his right hand was cut off his head was

315
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:08,160
 removed and his corpse was cut into quarters wow until he apologized and he had two accomplices

316
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,880
 who were stripped of their titles and expelled from the country and they were called ribbing and

317
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:21,680
 horn what ribbing ribbing ribbing and horn good no no further questions one more thing on masquerade

318
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,400
 bowls really quickly just because we're on the topic there was a moral panic in the uk even about

319
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,320
 masquerade bowls in the 18th century because they become really really popular in the upper class

320
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,960
 and the bishop of london said that it was a plot devised by the french to neutralize the beauty

321
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:47,120
 of english women okay so it's not the only way those disgusting french people can get any sex in

322
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,920
 the uk is by everyone wearing masks yeah it makes sense what are you saying what what what is the

323
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,240
 tone of sarcasm that i sense here i think it's an interesting point because i in my single days if

324
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,760
 you go to a halloween party right everyone looks so hot but they would be not who they were right

325
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:10,080
 it'd be like wow look at that skeleton she's awesome and and then she took up her outfit you put on a

326
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:21,360
 lot of weight but there was a study that showed that uh people found during the covid pandemic

327
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,920
 times that wearing a mask enhanced the hotness of the face people mistake oh really glamour yeah

328
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:38,560
 exactly misty mystery hygiene sanitizer but i genuinely i i scored a date on her at a halloween

329
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:44,080
 party and then we went on the actual date and like unfortunately ironically she was frightened

330
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,840
 more on the date yeah when you turned up and i preferred her as a tetris block it was uh which

331
00:32:49,840 --> 00:33:00,960
 one the square no she was the l nice yeah um just a little bit more just have the third please

332
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,000
 sorry to go sorry i know we're doing dan's dating history but he was incredibly interesting he was

333
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,600
 the third swedish monarch to die of being shot in 160 years right apart from his father who

334
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:21,040
 died after eating 14 helpings of sembler buns um just loved loved buns but he he did so many

335
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,160
 different i mean he was a despot he he took over and he he rolled government back he was he was

336
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:32,160
 anti-democratic but he banned torture and contributed to culture so he did a lot of self-promotion

337
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,560
 and one of the most interesting things he did was he he was engaged at the age of five uh too young

338
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,200
 to be married to be sorry here to be married to another five-year-old right oh that's not too

339
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,440
 that princess from Denmark yes princess Sophia Magdalena of Denmark and then when they were 20

340
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,440
 they got married but he wasn't there so you could do this thing of getting married by proxy yeah in

341
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,120
 the old days if you were marrying another ruler then they were busy because they were on a campaign

342
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,360
 or something yeah you would just have someone else step in so the bride's half-brother Frederick

343
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,560
 played the role of the groom just at the ceremony just sort of in a purely ceremonial function

344
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,160
 and only half brother exactly and then she came to Sweden and they properly got married um but they

345
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,120
 did have to have a kind of um love tutor as in they they needed to be slightly taught the facts of

346
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:25,280
 life uh because for 10 years they did not consummate the marriage and um they had to have a coach

347
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:33,360
 who was Count Adolf Frederick Munch Alfvölkula who was the that's that sounds like a sexy Dracula

348
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,000
 Count Fulkula

349
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,600
 I want to suck you up nevermind

350
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:51,040
 but there were rumors that Count Adolf was the father but when they eventually did have a child

351
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,400
 and spread by his mom so Perot Gustav's mom Gustav's mom thought he was impotent was like he can't

352
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:02,320
 perform sexually no way did he father that child and spread the rumor where even even in his own

353
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,400
 diary Count Adolf unfortunate name said that he was obliged to physically touch and guide them

354
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,640
 to the right positions because somewhat mysteriously he said they had both had anatomical problems

355
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:22,640
 which caused some trouble what were they I must know um but yeah the mum was like my son is

356
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,400
 bad in bed there's no way he's rather that child I bet it belongs to the count

357
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,000
 Gustav the third he gave us the sweet you know the vegetable the sweet

358
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,120
 it came from him because he's Swedish what what do you mean when you say gave us

359
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:43,040
 well I'm going to explain but it's literal um so there was a guy called Patrick Miller who

360
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,880
 invented a new kind of paddle steamer and he tried to sell it this feels like a start of a very long

361
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,400
 story now we have to go back to Patrick Miller

362
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,080
 you'll see why he's imported much later

363
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:06,880
 so Patrick Miller I'm on tanto experience even if that one else is he tries to sell

364
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,160
 his paddle steamer to Denmark and Denmark said we don't need your paddle steamer

365
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,160
 but Denmark was at war with sweden at the time and so Miller went to sweden and said do you want

366
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,800
 our paddle steamer and they said yes great we love paddle steamers so he sent the paddle

367
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,120
 steamer over to sweden and by the time it got there the war had already finished this is like

368
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:34,560
 grandpa simpson's story does he go to shelbyville with an onion in his pocket it was the fashion

369
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:44,800
 at the time Andy okay so they got this pointless paddle steamer but he was really happy Gustav

370
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,960
 and so he sent Patrick Miller a gold snuff box and a painting of the paddle steamer

371
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:59,120
 and a swedish flag and a swede and the swede came with finally

372
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:06,800
 and the um the swede came with some seeds that said plant me and he planted them and from then on

373
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,400
 the uk could grow its own swedes right and because they came from sweden we called them swedes

374
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
 and is anyone still here because i'm not sure

375
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:24,800
 it is our it's time for our final fact and that is

376
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,120
 Andy my fact is that some people have tattoos on the inside of their bottoms

377
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:39,040
 um this is really interesting yeah so fashion not fashion the reverse necessity um

378
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,000
 is that the reverse of controversial controversial yeah okay this is really interesting there is a

379
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,320
 thing called endoscopic tattooing uh and it's colon tattooing so it's tattooing you know right

380
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,400
 inside your bottom and the reason is that some people have lesions they have areas of unusual

381
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,440
 tissue inside their bottoms and they might become dangerous in future years they're not now but they

382
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,040
 need to be monitored you know if they if they change it's like having you know a mole that you're

383
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,520
 keeping an eye on just in case it changes or anything yeah so they need to be kept an eye on

384
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,120
 and for that they need to be marked and so this this in 2022 the american chemical society launched

385
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,520
 a new ink that was going to be used for endoscopic tattooing so that's how i found this fact um

386
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,760
 and basically it marks just sort of next to it because you can't mark the area itself but you

387
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,240
 mark look here's the size here's the shape here's and there's a kind of whole code language of

388
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,240
 what you are showing with this tattoo so that any future doctor can have a look at it and say

389
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,400
 ah that's okay it hasn't changed or oh it has we need to might need to do something here so it's

390
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:44,720
 just a brilliant area of do you know how do they get the pen up there like is it how do they do it

391
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,320
 it's very hard to draw the dolphin with um i actually don't know i think i think it's like

392
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,280
 endoscopes it's not the endoscope yeah it's endoscopes and it's very common and it's and it

393
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,760
 serves a few purposes it's you know it's it's sometimes marks a site for surgical removal if

394
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,800
 there's something that's been decided has to come out anyway um sometimes it says like here's a place

395
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,680
 for follow-up to just check this out we've done some surgery just check it out but it is um it is

396
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,760
 very cool i was very surprised to find a reddit thread about it from a surgeon who i guess operates

397
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,400
 on areas that might have been previously tattooed to take away certain things and a big thing in this

398
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,440
 industry is not tattooing the rectum so you you tattoo further up the colon but rectum don't

399
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,880
 need to do it and the reddit thread the headline was please don't tattoo the rectum don't worry

400
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,280
 we will find a tumor if it's there the tattoo gets in the way and makes everything hard to see

401
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,600
 and dissect please which i was just very surprised that surgeons are using reddit as a way to say to

402
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,360
 other surgeons please stop tattooing people's rectum that's so interesting there is i mean

403
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:54,400
 there are people who will have tattoos down there for fashion reasons yeah uh there's a guy called

404
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,720
 randy candy uh who will ink you anywhere you want and he'll give you a discount if you choose to do

405
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:09,040
 it on your bum hole uh he's i don't want it yeah but sometimes if you don't have quite so much money

406
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:17,440
 beggars can't be choosers can they andy you want to have i love mum somewhere um he's had he's done

407
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,920
 like an enormous spider exiting someone's body oh cool that was extremely cheap he says basically

408
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,160
 the weirder it gets the cheaper it becomes did you guys hear uh of the project whole glory in

409
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,280
 2016 now whole glory this was it's not as bad as it sounds um there's a tattoo artist called scott

410
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,400
 campbell who said anyone who puts their arm through this hole will get a tattoo all right you can't

411
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:47,440
 decide what it's of which oh i see thank god you get no communication you just put and it was in

412
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,160
 an art gallery that it happened so you would put your arm through and he was a sort of very famous

413
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,520
 and decorated tattoo artist and did he do it like sometimes it was good and sometimes it was bad

414
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,320
 that's right some of them were spelt well some of them were just one in five was like swastikas

415
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:11,840
 i don't think i don't think he did that on swastikas um oh yes it's always good to drop them in um

416
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:18,800
 if you were given the chance of having a swastika face tattoo yeah or losing your dominant hand

417
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,680
 having it amputated which would you choose um i'm allowed to put a big eye patch on over the

418
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,720
 tattoo for example what is it over your eye your whole face your whole face i'm sorry it's the

419
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,640
 whole thing i think balaclava i think yeah the mystery that the mystery that dan was talking

420
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,520
 about you know who's that guy why why do you think most people would say what did you i don't

421
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,000
 even think i've read a study yeah 70 of people would rather have their dominant hand amputated

422
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 than have a swastika face tattoo that's fascinating yeah wow and it makes sense and

423
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,040
 what a weird thing to cheer but yes yeah yeah it does make sense yeah okay well how about a wrong

424
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,720
 tattoo i really like these so there's a this year uh an england football supporter was so

425
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:06,000
 confident about england's chances in the euro's football that he got england euro 2024 winners

426
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,360
 and the picture of the cup tattooed on his leg he's called dan thomas he's a data consultant

427
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:17,440
 ironically and he he predicted a win for england in the final he said they're gonna win two one

428
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,400
 and he one might remember england lost two one and he said he will get it altered after they

429
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,280
 win in 2028 that's good so confident you can always get the word not tattooed above that

430
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,760
 i like the person i've read about is probably a mate of this guy but um this is a guy called

431
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,240
 tom washington he's from grinsby he got a lifetime ban from the airline jet two as a result of

432
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,160
 exposing his pinocchio penis tattoo on the plane and i've seen a photo of it it's actually really

433
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,840
 funny so i i don't see what the because he showed he just showed like the top so he didn't he didn't

434
00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:00,320
 take out his member what's his name uh what you want me to doubly name him tom washington

435
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,360
 yeah yeah i think that's very funny are you lying tom they call him but yeah it's happened

436
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,200
 there's an amazing thing so we're talking about medical tattoos basically medical tattoos have

437
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,520
 been happening for basically since we've found a properly preserved human so uzi we've mentioned

438
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,240
 this before so he was the iceman that was found in the alps yeah exactly and we found tattoos

439
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,960
 all over his body and they think that it was almost like acupuncture spots like it was so that

440
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,440
 they could spot where he needed to have things done but um all over the world tattoos are used

441
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,920
 for similar reasons so there's a tribe in berma called the pakoku and they do a thing where

442
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,120
 they're a snake society they play with snakes and they use them for rituals and so on all the time

443
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,040
 but they're poisonous snakes and so what they do is they tattoo themselves once a week where they

444
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,240
 mix the ink with the venom of the snake and it inoculates them to make sure that if they do get

445
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,480
 bitten their body already has it inside so that they're okay and they have to do it as a weekly

446
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,240
 ritual to do that so they get tattooed every week because it is mad that our bodies don't destroy

447
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,960
 tattoos even you know a tattoo is any foreign object that you inject into your body is bad as

448
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,800
 far as your body's concerned and it was quite confusing for a long time that our bodies don't

449
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,120
 just get rid of the ink and the reason is much like a lactose intolerant person who loves pizza

450
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:25,360
 the microfages the white blood cells love the taste of tattoo ink but can't digest it so it's so

451
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,440
 interesting so if they could digest it well they would literally just eat the ink up you know they'd

452
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,760
 be like foreign body inserted into you eat the ink up digest it get rid of it the tattoo would

453
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,320
 disappear but they eat the ink and their bodies can't digest it and so it just sits there so when

454
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:44,400
 you're seeing a tattoo you're seeing the stomachs of millions and millions of bacteria with ink inside

455
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,560
 them the bacteria with terrible indigestion going how do i get rid of this and then they die and

456
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,040
 another bacteria quickly eats the thing that they found in their stomach and it keeps on happening

457
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,880
 that amazing that's so cool and makes them even more sexy if anything

458
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:07,440
 the word tattoo comes from Tahitian and we've got it from Captain Cog's first flight so we got it

459
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:16,160
 in English around 1760 1770 and according to the OED the word is onomatopoeic so it comes from the

460
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:24,320
 sound so the tat comes from the tapping of a tattooing instrument into the skin and the ooo comes

461
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:31,920
 from the cry of pain from the person being tattooed brilliant that's amazing that's so good um have

462
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,640
 you heard of 3d tattoos no these are brilliant okay these are another medical innovation they're

463
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,480
 so good um so i was reading about a woman from the isle of wight who she had to have a hernia

464
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,560
 operation and she lost her belly button okay so she felt a bit self-conscious and she decided to

465
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,880
 get a 3d tattoo the photos of it are unbelievable i wish i could show you all now i wish i brought a

466
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,880
 bit of paper with it printed out because it looks so so realistic isn't there a model with a fake

467
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,240
 belly button or not maybe i thought there was a model with no belly button or there's a model

468
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,400
 with three belly button no there can't be a model with three belly buttons there's something um but

469
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,600
 the recipient said it was so good that her son wanted to sort of put his finger in it because

470
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,080
 he couldn't believe it wasn't real it does and it looks unbelievably good i think the thing is

471
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:18,000
 about belly buttons as well is depending on how high or how low they are it can be like a visual

472
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,280
 illusion of how long your legs are or how high your torso is so you could deliberately get your

473
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,840
 belly button a little bit higher or a little bit maybe not right up there because legs go all the

474
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:34,880
 way up to his nipples so hard because there was that claimed trend wasn't there in somewhere like

475
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,360
 china people having belly buttons put on their stomachs higher up yeah that's what we're talking

476
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,880
 about yeah unless you have any regrets andy i think you could brought an a4 print out of this belly

477
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,000
 button here tonight it wouldn't have made a difference to anyone's lives right good point

478
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,480
 another another weird interesting new tattoo that i've never seen before but someone showed us the

479
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:00,240
 other night we went out drinking with one of the old wiggles a couple nights ago sam the former yellow

480
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,000
 wiggle and um he's got amazing tattoos he's got a tattoo on one arm which is every country he goes

481
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,640
 to whatever is stamped into his passport he gets tattooed onto his arm while he's in the country

482
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:16,480
 so his arm is covered in passport stamps but on his right arm you can't see it it's in uv you get

483
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,200
 uv tattoos now which i hadn't heard of but that might be very obvious to a lot of people but yeah

484
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,640
 so yeah so you have to go under uv light in order to see it and it comes through um but it's invisible

485
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:32,160
 during the day really awesome so you have to keep going clubbing yeah well he showed me as we were

486
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:46,800
 shooting up heroin in a public toilet and it really pops when you see it but that is it for now

487
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,320
 that is all of our facts thank you so much for listening melbourne you've been amazing we will

488
00:47:52,320 --> 00:48:08,480
