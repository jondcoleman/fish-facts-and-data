00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660
 (phone ringing)

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.240
 (upbeat music)

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.520
 - Hi.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.360
 - Hi, Andy.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.180
 - Hi, Andy.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.020
 - Hey, buddy.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.860
 - Hi, Andy.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.700
 - Hey there.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.520
 - Oh, hello, Anna.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.360
 - What?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.200
 - Yeah, I've been on the podcast

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.040
 for a couple of weeks now, guys,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.860
 and I'm surprised that you're all surprised.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.600
 - This is the first time you've been on Drop As A Line,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.920
 and I like to go into a different mind space

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.760
 with Drop As A Line,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.800
 so this is like the first time I've seen you in months.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.280
 - Oh, right.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.120
 - Dangerous of this.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.120
 - In a different mind space.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.800
 I'm in the same mind space.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.640
 - James is in his own mind palace.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.400
 He's being very modest calling it a mind space.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.720
 He's actually a...

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.200
 Damien is a mental yurt.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.160
 (all laughing)

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.000
 - I'm a mind share.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.360
 It's like those wee workplaces.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.520
 (all laughing)

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.200
 - Oh, well, welcome back, Anna.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.160
 And now let's go through a load of emails

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.240
 that relate to shows that you didn't take part in.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.040
 - Brilliant, at least the complaints.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.760
 - You'll probably have thoughts.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.680
 - Well, maybe you can judge whether we were wrong or right.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.520
 - Oh, yeah.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 - For the ones that--

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.200
 - I would love to do that.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.520
 - You've had things like Spicy Meat Corner

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.240
 and Get Yourself Off the Hook

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.080
 and The I'm Actually of the Week.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.920
 - It's interesting, isn't it?

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.400
 'Cause I sort of blank out everything that happens

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.080
 in shows anyway after I've done them.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.920
 So, no, I wasn't.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.520
 - These are just format points that I've invented

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.800
 that I've been having, frankly,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.560
 a pretty sticky time getting to take.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.400
 - I am.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.520
 Yeah, no, I wasn't here for any of those.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.680
 - Two of those I haven't even heard of

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.000
 before, if that's how it is.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.880
 (all laughing)

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.600
 - Okay, do you want a correction?

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.440
 - Yes, please.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.280
 - All right.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.720
 Sally writes, big fan of the podcast,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.040
 but couldn't let this one go for a second episode.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.640
 Houston, Texas is pronounced Houston and not Houston.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.480
 - Who said it, Houston?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.320
 - Well, I always bring that up,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.920
 but presumably that's cut out

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.640
 just because it's too, it comes up too much,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.440
 but Andy always says Houston,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.160
 and I always say, why are you saying it like that?

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.000
 - Well, apparently I'm saying it right,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.840
 according to Sally.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080
 - Oh, she's saying it's Houston, not Houston.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.520
 - No, she's saying it's Houston.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.880
 - Yeah, like everyone pronounces it.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.520
 - Houston, and I'm saying Houston.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.360
 - Yes.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.000
 - But her surname, she's called Sally Klaus,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.480
 and I actually don't know whether it's Sally Klaus

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.720
 or Sally Klaus.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.560
 - Wow.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.080
 - Sally Klaus.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.240
 - I think we did keep in one mention

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 of Dan complaining about Andy's pronunciation of Houston,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.720
 and that might be why Sally's written in, perhaps.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.400
 I think it's been in once.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.640
 - I feel like I get an easier time on the pronunciation

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.520
 because I pronounce quite a few things wrong, but I don't.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.440
 - You do, let's go through those.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.360
 How do you pronounce those small primates

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.560
 that live on Madagascar with ring tails?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.800
 (laughing)

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.880
 - They're zebras, aren't they?

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.120
 - No, they're primates, Andy.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.040
 - Lima.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.880
 - Limia.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.720
 - Limia.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.560
 - Limia.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.760
 - Limia is what Andy used to say about that.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.040
 - I find you pronounce a lot of things oddly,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.320
 but I would never say wrong,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.520
 but maybe this is just the bias towards the male RP,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.400
 but I find you just have like quirky pronunciation.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.240
 What is it?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.200
 - Well, can I ask, Andy, if you're in America

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.680
 and you're an early settler

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.560
 and you're right at the edge of where settlement is,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.880
 but you're not quite there yet.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.720
 What would you say that edge is called, beginning with F-R?

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.840
 - This is wild that you say this.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.160
 - Front it, front it.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.000
 (laughing)

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.880
 Hey, hey, hey, let's press on and have another email, shall we?

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.320
 - Davey Crockett, King of the Wild,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.000
 as Andy would say, Frontier, but it's Frontier.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.720
 - And you say Frontier, Frontier.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.640
 - No, he keeps saying Frontier.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.160
 I mean, it's not really incorrect.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.320
 - My dog's got three years.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.120
 A left ear, a right ear and a wild Frontier.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.960
 - Exactly.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.680
 - Right, I'll just, that's how I remember it.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.240
 Close to the home, we said right in

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.720
 if you're from Martham in Norfolk.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.560
 - Oh, yes.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.400
 - Yes, I was there for that.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.240
 - You were there for this.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.360
 - Martha, mm.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.520
 - We had a lot of people right in who were not from Martham.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.680
 We had someone from Norwich, Katie Walters.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.680
 - Someone from Leeds.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.680
 (laughing)

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.680
 - Holly Davis, who lived there as a teenager.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.520
 - Doesn't count.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.360
 - Katie Walters points out

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.320
 that Martham has a thatch chip shop.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.000
 (laughing)

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.840
 - That's really cool.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.680
 - It's like cool.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.880
 And that the car's dangerous, doesn't it?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.880
 - Yeah, you're right.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.240
 It must go up every year.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.960
 The carved village sign featuring a Viking

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.320
 and a traditional Norfolk sailing wedding,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.520
 just kind of boat, was made by Harry Carter,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.640
 the nephew of the Egyptologist Howard Carter.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.480
 - Wow, interesting.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.040
 - However, he made over 200 signs,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.200
 so maybe that's not so interesting.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.040
 I think that is interesting.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.880
 - That is interesting.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.160
 - And Holly points out that Martha

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.760
 and his point of West Flag,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.040
 which used to be an island when the Romans were here.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.520
 And then, really excitingly, we hit the jackpot,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.120
 Tilly Holland writes,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.760
 "Hello, my boyfriend has just played me a clip

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.120
 "from no such thing as a captive willy episode."

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.760
 Very excitedly, "I am from Martham."

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.240
 Martham is a strange village, she writes.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.640
 Well, she goes into a lot of detail about it.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.120
 They've got some extraordinary stuff.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.960
 Three churches.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.780
 - Do you think on our next tour,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.000
 we could do a gig in Martham?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.440
 - Well, we could play one of the three churches

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.800
 or one of the two co-ops.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.840
 - Or the chip shop.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.680
 (laughing)

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.560
 - Or the chip shop.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.440
 They've also got a library and a kebab shop

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.800
 and a Turkish barbers, which have the same owner.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.240
 My brother has been having a haircut

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.800
 in which the barber has had to run back to the kebab shop.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.240
 (laughing)

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.080
 - That's great.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.200
 - I imagine they cut your hair

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.920
 with one of those huge knives

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.800
 while you're rotating on your chair.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.760
 (laughing)

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.280
 - And a library, did you say?

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.880
 - I think that's a comma thing.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.720
 I don't think the Turkish chip shop,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.320
 a kebab shop owner also does a library.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.080
 - That would be confusing where you've got one job

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.040
 where all you do is talk to the customer

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.160
 and then you have a job.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.680
 (laughing)

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.640
 - So don't silent.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.080
 Oh, that's really funny.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.040
 That's really good.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.920
 And she also says that Bradley Walsh's brother

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.840
 reportedly lives in the village.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.680
 - Is that right?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.880
 - So one of the villagers must know.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.200
 - Well, in the past, Bradley Walsh has been spotted

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.600
 at one of the annual fairs on Martham Green.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600
 - I see.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.440
 - Huge.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.280
 - That's great.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.800
 - I bet that I used up the Martham Evening Mail

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.960
 would have been headlined for a year, wouldn't it?

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.280
 (laughing)

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.200
 - My head chopped off my bum.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.520
 (laughing)

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.440
 - And in the bottom, Bradley Walsh's seam.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.360
 - Oh dear.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.200
 All right.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.720
 Claudia Murdoch writes,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.920
 I recently listened to your episode, question mark.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.080
 And you mentioned the Wellington Shanty Club.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.240
 - Okay, so that, yes, that was me.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.480
 And that was when we had Lou Sanders on it.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.320
 It was our live show.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.400
 And I mentioned that the guy who did the sea shanty.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.240
 - Bingo.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.040
 - Yeah, or she mentioned, I think it was seasick.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.240
 - Well, you stated that this was the only Shanty Club

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.200
 in Wellington.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200
 And I just wanted to let you know

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.920
 that this is actually incorrect.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.400
 - I couldn't listen to any more of the episode.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.280
 (laughing)

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.600
 - There are two Shanty Clubs.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.440
 - Oh my God.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.280
 - The other one is called the Salty Wailers.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.120
 - Nice.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.960
 - Salty Wailers.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.800
 - That's great.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.640
 - That's great.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.460
 Huge apologies.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.280
 That's great.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.120
 - Imagine that.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.200
 Getting that wrong.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.560
 - Did you say, I shant be listening again?

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.600
 (laughing)

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.400
 - That was a missed opportunity by Claudia there.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.640
 Raise your game, Claudia.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.080
 (laughing)

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.480
 - Here's a nice bonus ball from Anne from Canberra.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.680
 I was prompted to write after hearing David Mitchell's fact

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.760
 about Steven and the white ship disaster

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.320
 as there's a great link to one of your facts

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.360
 in an earlier episode.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.200
 - Oh, lovely.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.020
 - This is cool.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.320
 A bit of like intra-episode tunneling.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.160
 - Yeah.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.000
 - Like this.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.640
 In episode 490, Andy spoke about wool

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.320
 and its adsorbent quality, right?

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.560
 Which is where it sort of has water within it

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.720
 and it's not absorbing it, but it's kind of taking it on.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.040
 - Sounds like an Andy thing to talk about.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.200
 Wool being absorbent.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.600
 - Adsorbent.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.600
 - So not an Andy thing then, sorry.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.640
 (laughing)

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.240
 - I was reminded of this when David Mitchell

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.560
 was talking about the only survivor

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.400
 of the white ship disaster, barrel the butcher.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.400
 There is a theory that the reason the butcher survived

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.160
 was that unlike the other noble passengers

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.240
 in their fancy silks, he was wearing coarse woollen clothing

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.400
 which was water repellent and preserved heat even when wet,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.920
 which wool does.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.920
 So Andy was quite correct when he said

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.920
 that if you fall in a river.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920
 - Oh my God.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.040
 (laughing)

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.720
 - This is all Andy is quite correct.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.560
 Every single email ends with that.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.520
 And he gave us one or two at the start,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.520
 just little fun ones and it was all leading up to this.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.200
 - We move on to the Andy is quite correct section.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.160
 - No one in real life would ever say

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.600
 Andy was quite correct apart from you.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.760
 That's what gives it away.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.760
 - What was, what did you say that if you fell in?

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.040
 - Oh, you didn't finish that sentence.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.360
 Sorry, if you fell in a river that's freezing cold

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.280
 and then you get to dry land, you should be wearing wool

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.800
 'cause it'll help you, it'll help you stay warm.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.360
 Okay, meat, lot of meat, meat judging in the inbox.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.520
 - Okay, so we had a fact about professional meat judging

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.040
 in America that it's a thing you can do in college.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.080
 Leah McConnell just writes to point out

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.560
 the meat judging is pretty big in Australia as well.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.720
 - I think we mentioned that, yeah.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.560
 - I do be okay.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.680
 - My husband's grandfather was a meat judge,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.960
 meat, meat's there and meat judge.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.760
 - Wow, that's cool.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.920
 - Yeah, for any I've been on the show.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.920
 - And he's in, he would have been in Australia, so maybe.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.040
 - That's great, yes, Australia.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.000
 - Lisa Sackreiter is a high school agriculture teacher

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.200
 and says they do lots of it

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.400
 through the Future Farmers of America, the FFA,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.200
 along with poultry judging, livestock judging, dairy products,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.120
 dairy cattle judging, turf judging and others.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.560
 - Is that judging how anti-

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.360
 - No, I don't think it's that, T-U-R-F.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.600
 (laughing)

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.960
 - Oh my God.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.800
 - Oh dear.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.900
 Now, there's a serious message about the meat stuff

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.320
 which is from Ben Lidgate.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.600
 I've been listening to your most recent episode

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.000
 in which Dan talks about retro-clat.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.920
 - Oh yes, yes.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.600
 - So this is backwards talking for Butchers.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.560
 - Yeah, he said it is Butchers Talk Convention

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.920
 in Australia in the 1960s and it angered me so much

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.200
 that I felt compelled to write in for the first time ever,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.320
 despite having listened to you guys

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.600
 since your very first episode.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.440
 - Thanks for listening.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.480
 - You can also thank Dan, as it also finally inspired me

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.640
 to join Club Fish in the hope that I might hear this email

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.000
 read out for some great, what a great idea.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.660
 So, just putting a few little mistakes every episode.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.700
 - New business model, it just pissed people off.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.540
 - Wow.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.860
 - Why do you think I've been saying it Houston all these years?

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.380
 - Is this why people like Piers Morgan exist?

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.220
 So they all got spin-off podcasts

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.860
 where you're allowed to write and then complain.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.580
 They pissed people off solely to get subscribers.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.020
 - So should I tell you what Ben says in his,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.340
 why he's so angry?

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.700
 He says, "I'm a fifth generation butcher."

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.540
 - Wow.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.380
 - "Fifth gen."

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.260
 And the reason that this fact, heavy quotes,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.500
 angered me so much is that Butchers Backslank

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.280
 has been in use in Britain

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.280
 since at least the early 19th century.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.480
 Not only was it not invented in Australia,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.560
 I'd be very surprised if they only started using it

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.920
 in Australia in the '60s,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.120
 as it more than likely came over

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.080
 with British settlers earlier than that,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.800
 unless it came over with the 10-pound poms in the '50s.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.240
 But even then, he's about 10 years out.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.760
 So really thorough demolition problems.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.080
 - Who's this person?

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.400
 - Ben Lidgate.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.480
 - Okay, Ben, I think what we should actually do

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.200
 is discuss this on the next episode,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.400
 which goes out next month.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.420
 So if you want to hear any more about this,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.640
 then make sure you keep subscribing for another month.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.540
 - I love it.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.460
 It's so weird, because effectively,

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.260
 he was so furious with what I said that he had to write in.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.580
 Yet, it's such a great email that I just can't be upset.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.420
 - It's nice.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.260
 - It's really nice.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.100
 I love these letters.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.940
 - There you go.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.940
 - Yeah, thank you, Ben.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.380
 You weren't like this one.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.180
 Raquel Moss writes, "Dear fish."

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.540
 Raquel Moss, yeah, made up.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.380
 - Yeah.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.220
 (laughing)

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.940
 - I'd like to just ask about Addy's novels.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.780
 (laughing)

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.940
 It's been a few months since you've mentioned them.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.100
 - She writes to say, "Just checking in to confirm that yes,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.100
 Dan does give off big wife guy energy."

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.340
 (laughing)

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.040
 - Come on, come on, Moss.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.340
 - It is a black and white.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.820
 As does James, which is completely understandable,

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.260
 because his wife seems rad.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.740
 A helicopter pilot.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.580
 - Wow.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.900
 - Wait, wait, I'm going.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.820
 Not that Dan's wife isn't rad.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.180
 - I'm sure she is.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.120
 I just don't know the details of her radness.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.100
 - Dan, do you want to tell us how rad Phen is?

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:35.940
 - She sucks.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.200
 I hate it, I hate wives.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.040
 - Classic bro.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.780
 - I hate wives.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.660
 Raquel says, "Andy, you're a bit more of an enigma,

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.740
 but I'm sure you're quietly a wife guy in your own way."

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.580
 - I'm not.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.300
 (laughing)

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.820
 - All right, so thank you, Raquel.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.500
 I'm going to sort of do like a--

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.020
 - By the way, just to say,

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.020
 we got a bit of husband girl energy

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.920
 off Anna a few minutes earlier with the,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.860
 my husband's granddad was a meat judge.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.580
 - No, I didn't really do enough.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.140
 38 husbands, me and Joe Brandt,

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.660
 not a good word to say about husbands between us

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.500
 to know what you're talking about.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.060
 - You're never normally mentioned that you're married.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.940
 - No, that was made up that fact a minute ago.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.820
 I had a fictional husband.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.620
 I just really wanted to have something to say

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.660
 about meat judging.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.580
 - Anna knows that it's only one butcher

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.620
 who listens to this show

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.100
 and a bunch of pseudonyms that you've created.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.780
 (laughing)

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.380
 - I've been single-handedly maintaining

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.540
 our ad revenue, Dan, don't.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.900
 (laughing)

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.900
 - It's exhausting running a million salt puppets

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.740
 every week.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.580
 - Oh my God.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.340
 - Have you had to actually subscribe

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.940
 for every one of these salt puppets?

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.500
 - I'm spending 90 grand a month

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.560
 (laughing)

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.940
 on Clownfish alone.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.060
 It's exhausting.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.860
 - Well, he should not get any adverts.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.620
 (laughing)

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.700
 - Grace Jist writes.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.480
 - Just give us the general, you know,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.240
 (laughing)

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.840
 you don't need to read the whole thing down there.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.760
 (laughing)

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.040
 - Sorry, we're back to meat actually.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.640
 'Cause her email is head subject lined all caps.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.760
 Meat judging isn't a sport.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.320
 She says, you'll almost killed me

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.600
 with embarrassment and laughter

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.920
 on my drive to work this morning.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.400
 Meat judging isn't a sport,

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.800
 but a competition for kids in FFA,

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.960
 Future Farmers of America,

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.040
 or 4-H who are interested in livestock farming.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.880
 Never did it myself,

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.600
 but I did do a bit of other livestock judging as a kid.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.640
 It never gets old listening to a handful of Brits

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.560
 try to understand American things.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.960
 - Well, that's interesting.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.360
 - Keep doing it like the idiots we are then.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.520
 - I would say it is a sport.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.240
 - They do it in college.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.080
 - Yeah.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:39.920
 - It doesn't sound like a sport to me.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.840
 I think sport has to have some physical exertion.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.680
 - Chess is a sport?

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.520
 - No, it's not.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.360
 - Yes, chess is a sport.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.720
 - I would say that's what makes chess not a sport.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.600
 - Yeah, but Anna, what makes you an expert on sport?

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.600
 - Oh, James, I'm so glad you've asked.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.360
 Well, I happened to have written a book recently

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.080
 with my good friend and colleague, James Harkin,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.720
 called "Everything to Play For".

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.040
 It's the QI book of sport.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.880
 - Excellent.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.080
 - And chess doesn't feature.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.080
 (laughing)

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.400
 - What if the pieces are so heavy

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.000
 that it is physical exertion to lift them?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.280
 Is that then a sport?

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.720
 - Yeah, maybe chess is a sport for you.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.560
 - Chess boxing.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.400
 - Chess boxing.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.740
 - Yeah.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.280
 We've, Caroline from Svalbard has written.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.120
 - No.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:15.960
 - Yes.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.280
 - Very interested in that.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.120
 - It is so cool.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.480
 We can get emails from all over the world, it's lovely.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.040
 - I think we have one from,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.040
 I can't remember where the other was,

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.520
 somewhere equally far from here.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.520
 Anyway, cut that.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.360
 - Leads.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.200
 (laughing)

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.920
 - It's from Leads.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.000
 - It's far away, you have the long year,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 by and where you're not allowed to die,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.840
 - Well.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.680
 - Currently, 'cause it's too cold.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.320
 - You've fallen right into my trap,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.200
 you little fool.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.040
 (laughing)

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.880
 - Caroline writes.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.400
 (laughing)

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.440
 - Caroline writes.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.320
 (laughing)

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.320
 - Subject line, episode 11.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.960
 (laughing)

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.160
 - I live in Longyear Bayen.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.040
 - In Svalbard, and I was listening to old episodes

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.320
 while out training my dog team.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.880
 - Oh God, you're cool.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.920
 - So a very long overdue correction

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.000
 and some related info on door handles and bears in Svalbard.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.240
 Number one, it is not illegal to die here,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.680
 but you cannot be buried here.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.600
 Not because you freeze,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.240
 but because the permafrost in most cases

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.480
 will bring you back up.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.320
 - Yeah.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.160
 - Yeah.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.000
 - I think that's what we've said, isn't it?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.120
 - Well, maybe.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.680
 Maybe we said that in episode 12.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.400
 (laughing)

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.440
 You can get cremated and bury your ashes here.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.600
 - All right, number two, doorknobs.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.000
 I own a cabin outside town,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.800
 and like in many cabins here,

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.160
 the door opens inwards and the handle upwards.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.960
 The first is to prevent you from snowing in,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.320
 and the second to make it more difficult

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.840
 for bears to get in.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.840
 However, the bears do not always use the handle.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.920
 Again, see picture.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.240
 And the picture is just of a door

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.680
 with a huge panel missing where.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.520
 - Oh wow.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.360
 - The bear has just gone in.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.280
 - Wow.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.640
 - Yeah, anyway, Caroline, Caroline,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.000
 thank you so much for writing.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.840
 - That's awesome.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.680
 - Love that about the handles going up.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.520
 - I'm excited.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.360
 - I know.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.720
 - David Crundwell writes.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.560
 - Good name.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.400
 - Great name.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.240
 - Great name.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.080
 I'm a huge fan of the show,

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:53.920
 and as of this week,

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.000
 also a proud card-carrying clubfish member.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.840
 - Yeah.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.680
 - This isn't a correction,

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.600
 but I thought it may be of some interest

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.040
 that the opposite of the word February,

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.440
 as discussed in episode 502,

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.880
 is in fact the word February.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.800
 - Oh.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.160
 - As the opposite of the song Wonderwall

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.560
 is also the song Wonderwall.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.800
 As James correctly mentioned,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.480
 active noise cancelling in headphones

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.880
 works by receiving an audio signal,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.920
 inverting the phase of this signal,

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.640
 a pattern of compressions and decompressions

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.080
 in air pressure over time,

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.360
 playing the inverted signal into the speakers,

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.320
 cancelling out those compressions and decompressions.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.680
 So Dave actually attached a file

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.440
 of him saying the word February,

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.280
 duplicated it,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.160
 inverted the phrase,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.800
 played them one over the other,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.400
 and the result is silence.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.720
 And I watched the video of him doing it,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.840
 and it sounds like this.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.800
 - That was a really good impression.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.640
 - It was really good.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.600
 (laughing)

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.120
 - So Dave actually did the work,

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.160
 and I'd just like to thank him.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.720
 I'd also like to thank Riffles,

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.600
 who claimed to have sent the sound

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.080
 and just sent the file that was called

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.600
 "Five Seconds of Silence".

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.120
 - Oh, that's clever.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.480
 - The effect was the same in both cases.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.200
 - Yeah, and Swifties will know

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.240
 that Taylor Swift made it to the top of the charts

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.320
 with basically a silent track.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.160
 - Ah.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.000
 - Oh wow.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.640
 - It was an accidental release,

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.120
 and it was just basically, effectively--

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:04.960
 - That sounds rude, doesn't it?

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.800
 - Sounds like a fart.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.640
 (laughing)

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.720
 - Kind of an accidental release.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.120
 But it was silent at least.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:09.960
 (laughing)

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.360
 - But it was also deadly, so--

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.200
 (laughing)

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.040
 - That is what you would call a Swiftie as well.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.000
 (laughing)

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.720
 - Yeah, I think it was either it had white noise

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.880
 or it was something basically that was a non-track in it,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.000
 and it went to the top of the charts

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.440
 because it was attached to the name.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.280
 - You can do a lot of interpretation work on that.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.120
 What does she mean?

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:27.960
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.780
 - Yeah.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.620
 - Brilliant.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.760
 The Incess Zone we're entering now,

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.920
 which we've been in for a couple of months

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.960
 on Drops of the Line, Anna, sorry.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.000
 This is about Iceland and the Incess app, you remember?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.080
 - Oh yeah.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.920
 - And we mentioned it,

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.720
 and some were going to say, "No, that's not true."

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.200
 - Well, it's not true that there's the app.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.200
 - No, we don't have an app that we check our dates

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.440
 for Incess Tone.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.920

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.360
 "to see how closely we're related we are."

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.200
 - Oh, interesting.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.040
 - This is huge.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.880
 - That's huge, so.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.720
 - This is huge.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.960
 - So the way I understood it is

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.160
 that they had this genealogy website,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.560
 and then they had a competition

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.320
 to see who could find the best way

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.080
 of utilizing this data,

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.320
 and then one person came up with the idea

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.520
 of doing the dating app where you bump two phones together

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.400
 and it will tell you if you're related,

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.400
 and it was kind of a joke,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.440
 and if a load of people downloaded it kind of as a joke,

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.980
 but it was never really a proper, proper thing.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.260
 But this actually goes against that evidence, doesn't it?

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.680
 This is actual anecdotal evidence of people using it.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.660
 - Well, no, that could be true as well, right?

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.540
 Your thing is true, the joke thing,

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.380
 but then this person's actually used it, not as a joke.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.100
 - So thank you, Elsa, vindicated.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.940
 - Love it.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.020
 - Yeah, so we'll say that in every episode from now on.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:00.860
 That happens.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.520
 Okay, Aaron Hung writes,

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.820
 "In episode 498, you, Dan, James, and Hannah Fry

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.300
 "had an interesting conversation about conversation.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.700
 "There is, in fact, a whole field of study

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.960
 "called conversation analysis,

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.640
 "which focus on the rigorous, in-depth study

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.440
 "of mundane, everyday conversation,

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.420
 "trying to tease out rules that people follow

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.180
 "when talking."

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.680
 So, for example, since you discussed ending conversations,

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.480
 there's a chapter attached here on that very topic.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.680
 He's said a chapter.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.860
 "The too-long-didn't-read version

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.520
 "is that a conversation usually closes

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.840
 "after a series of steps or pre-closing sequences

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.140
 "that signal a wind down to the conversation.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.680
 "This is arguably why you're abrupt by,

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.200
 "at the end of your drop as a line, is so amusing."

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.280
 (all laughing)

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.680
 - Has it subversed those rules?

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.400
 Has it subversed those rules?

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.560
 That's why it's so amusing, guys.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.860
 - So, we've gone away from,

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.320
 "Andy, this is why you're right,"

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.660
 to now, "Andy, this is why you're so funny."

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.680
 - We're gonna move on to,

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.040
 "Andy, this is why you're so attractive,"

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:53.880
 in a minute.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.100
 (all laughing)

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.740
 "I was so excited this morning to hear you talk

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.900
 "about one of my true loves, Roller Derby."

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.900
 Derby?

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:05.740
 - Derby.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.580
 - Derby.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.000
 "I was so disappointed to hear you not mention

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.880
 "the creative genius of one of the all-time

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.640

 "Twat Rocket has been on my list of favorites

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.160
 "since I saw her skate years ago

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.600
 "and heard the crowd chant her name

 "to the sing-song tune of the hot-pocket commercials

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.680
 "that haunted my childhood."

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.280
 - I don't know that commercial.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.360
 - Me neither.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.600
 I thought, I found the name in my research,

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.640
 "Twat Rocket," which I thought it was,

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.800
 but it turns out it's an American skater,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.480
 she's called "Twat Rocket,"

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.840
 'cause that's how they pronounce "Twat."

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.040
 - Is this why on Twitter,

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.760
 the other day, you asked a lot of Americans

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.240
 how you pronounce--

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.080
 - "Twat."

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.320
 - Do you pronounce the word "Twat," "Twat?"

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.160
 - Yeah.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.760
 - Or "Twat," and people just replied to you,

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.040
 just saying, "Twat, twat, twat, twat."

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.720
 - And it's so nice that finally there was a reason

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.800
 for them to reply to my tweet saying that.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.360
 Yeah, but apparently, the hot-pocket,

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.160
 do you know the hot-pocket?

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.000
 - I guess, I think it's a pop-tart, isn't it?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 - Yeah, pop-tart, right?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.960
 - Did you, can I ask?

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.440
 Did you look onto YouTube to see

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.600
 what the hot-pocket advert was?

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.440
 - I did watch it, yeah.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.280
 - Yeah.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.120
 - Could you sing it?

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:09.960
 Can you sing it?

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.800
 - Like, we wanna hear it, basically.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.120
 - Oh, no, I couldn't do it justice.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.280
 - So we get an idea of what "Twat Rocket" would sound like.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.800
 - Hot-pocket.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.840
 - "Twat Rocket."

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.840
 - Yeah, it's good.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.480
 So, that's Fearless Bueller, thank you for that.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.400
 All right, and last one.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.240
 - Yes.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.240
 - Holly Gittins writes.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.080
 - Yeah.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.240
 - She writes in very kind words,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.040
 and then she says, "I wanted to say how refreshing

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.920
 "I was recently to hear an episode of Drop As A Line

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.840
 "recorded early in the day.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.000
 "I often listened to the podcast

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.120
 "while driving to work, still slightly bleary.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.240
 "I hope not too bleary to drive a car.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.480
 "It's a great way of waking up in the morning,

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.440
 "but it was a lovely change to hear Dan and James

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.400
 "feeling as irritable and generally confused

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.280
 "as I often do by the first few minutes."

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.000
 - I actually think our morning ones

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.720
 are some of our best work on Drop As A Line.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.920
 Have any of you ever had this?

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.600
 When I used to work in a nice five job,

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.560
 and I used to drive in the rush hour every morning,

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.960
 sometimes I'd be at my desk at like 10 o'clock,

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.600
 and not remember how I got there.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.400
 - Oh, you're an autopilot.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.640
 - You're an autopilot the whole way,

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.560
 and you're like, "Oh, last thing I knew I was in bed,

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.280
 "and now I'm here, how did that happen?"

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.280
 - Yeah, that's a bit freaky.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.320
 I think I have had that sometimes.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.960
 It's when you're driving very boring routes.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.720
 - Yeah, it's the same route all the time,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.720
 and it's car to car to car,

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.680
 and you're doing it for 45 minutes or an hour.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.400
 So it's just to say, you don't do anything,

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.760
 you're just like behind a car.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.480
 - Get the radio on, mate.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.640
 - So Holly has a query, she asks,

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.560
 "Have you considered a rolling schedule of recording times?

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.360
 "A late night post-pub recording,

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.440
 "live audio of you all waking up at 2 a.m.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.240
 "to record for no good reason,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.520
 "or even recording immediately after a 40-hour flight

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.000
 "would all be greatly entertaining?"

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.560
 - We did a podcast the night after a British election,

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.800
 can't remember which one,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.760
 where we did it on the morning of.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.960
 I remember my fact or something to do with the Yeti party.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.800
 That's all I--

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.240
 - I think it was 2017, I think it was election special.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.080
 - Yeah.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.920
 - So there was a big--

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.840
 - We got in early so that James could edit it,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.720
 presumably that day, so he could get out that night.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.760
 The one we recorded, we basically recorded a podcast

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.920
 at every single hour of the day,

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.400
 'cause we've done the Comic Relief special

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.120
 where we recorded for 24 hours, right?

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.720
 So we've just ticked your box.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.560
 - Yes.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.240
 - So yeah, this was, Holly was it.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.080
 - Holly, yeah.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.720
 - So Holly can just listen back to the 24 hours,

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.680
 all on YouTube.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.520
 - Yeah.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.560
 - And then you can compare how we were

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.880
 all those different times.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.960
 - I was pretty tired by the end of the Comic Relief thing.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.080
 - I remember I was as well,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.160
 but I remember Anna and Dan really carrying

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.760
 the last two hours, that's my memory of it.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.820
 - We're morning people.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.660
 - I can't remember.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.320
 - We had like a three minute break

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.160
 in between each 35 minute recording.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.840
 And I remember I had my routine so down by the end.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.340
 I'd like, run, put a kettle on, have a pee.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:50.200
 Pour cattle into, I'd tell us more of it.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.040
 (laughing)

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.880
 - On topedus.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.720
 (laughing)

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.360
 Pour cattle, pour you more of it.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.580
 On topedus, wake up, scream.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.520
 (laughing)

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.440
 Have straps on the throat, I'll just scream.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.280
 (laughing)

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.120
 Yeah.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.200
 - I was stressed up.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.120
 I didn't get those breaks

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.560
 'cause I had to do the ads in between.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.400
 I had to sit there and--

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.240
 - You did ads?

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:09.920
 - What are you advertising?

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.760
 - I was just a little side bunny.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.600
 - Side bunny?

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.120
 - Side bunny.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.320
 - Bye bye you book, the theory of everything else.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.960
 My dad's tribe are available in all good bookshops.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.480
 - Are you a Desert Rogers child

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.160
 in a poor corner of the world?

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.360
 You need some entertaining.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.960
 (laughing)

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.080
 - Hey, really quickly, just,

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.400
 you know how sometimes people recognize us

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.920
 by our voice on the street?

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.200
 'Cause, you know, not many people know what our faces are,

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.400
 but they will hear our accents and sometimes get it.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.280
 And Andy, you said that this guy actually wrote in

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.400
 off the back of this incident.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.760
 But I was in South London with Jamie

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.320
 from my dad wrote a porno.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.080
 And we were walking down the street

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.800
 and I was telling Jamie about the fact

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.520
 that's gonna be on the episode

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.760
 that we just recorded about Senna.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.840
 And so I went, I literally said the words to him.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.000
 Yeah, so my fact this week is that in 1984,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.920
 and this guy just turned around

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.960
 and went, Dan, no such thing.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.800
 And as a kind of like, 'cause I've walked past podcasters

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.200
 and had a bit of sort of like,

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.560
 whoa, that's pretty exciting.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.920
 To hear a podcaster use literally the words

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.240
 that you hear in an episode.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.600
 - Are you sure you're not everyday?

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.440
 You sort of pay Jamie to take you out

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.200
 and you just spend all day walking around going,

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.240
 my fact this week, is there anyone,

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.880
 can you see anyone looking around Jamie?

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.720
 No, okay.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.360
 - Let me do that a bit.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.640
 This one was accidental.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.560
 - Yeah, very funny.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.840
 And then we got Neema from that block.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.680
 - Yeah.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.500
 - Oh, really?

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.340
 - Yeah.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.960
 - But apparently not worthy for the show.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.800
 No.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.640
 (laughing)

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.160
 - 'Cause it was saying how nice Dan is.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.800
 (laughing)

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.920
 - I actually have a filter set up for those emails.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.160
 (laughing)

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.400
 - Bye.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.980
 (upbeat music)

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.640
 - That does work.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.480
 - Wow.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.320
 - I can see it now.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.160
 - It's really funny.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.480
 - I've subverted the norms of conversation

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.960
 with that abrupt ending.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.560
 But I now spoil the joke by saying,

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.880
 thank you for listening.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.760
 And we will be available.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.600
 We're in the inbox.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.640
 We're waiting for you.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.800
 We're in there.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.800
 So get in with us by emailing podcast@qi.com.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.800
 And we love hearing from you.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.140
 And bye.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.720
 (upbeat music)

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.300
 (upbeat music)

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.880
 (upbeat music)
