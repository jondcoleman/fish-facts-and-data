1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,240
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,520
 - Hi.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,360
 - Hi, Andy.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,180
 - Hi, Andy.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,020
 - Hey, buddy.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,860
 - Hi, Andy.

8
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,700
 - Hey there.

9
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,520
 - Oh, hello, Anna.

10
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,360
 - What?

11
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,200
 - Yeah, I've been on the podcast

12
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,040
 for a couple of weeks now, guys,

13
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,860
 and I'm surprised that you're all surprised.

14
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,600
 - This is the first time you've been on Drop As A Line,

15
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,920
 and I like to go into a different mind space

16
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,760
 with Drop As A Line,

17
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,800
 so this is like the first time I've seen you in months.

18
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,280
 - Oh, right.

19
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,120
 - Dangerous of this.

20
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,120
 - In a different mind space.

21
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,800
 I'm in the same mind space.

22
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,640
 - James is in his own mind palace.

23
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,400
 He's being very modest calling it a mind space.

24
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,720
 He's actually a...

25
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,200
 Damien is a mental yurt.

26
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,160
 (all laughing)

27
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,000
 - I'm a mind share.

28
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,360
 It's like those wee workplaces.

29
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,520
 (all laughing)

30
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,200
 - Oh, well, welcome back, Anna.

31
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,160
 And now let's go through a load of emails

32
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,240
 that relate to shows that you didn't take part in.

33
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,040
 - Brilliant, at least the complaints.

34
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,760
 - You'll probably have thoughts.

35
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,680
 - Well, maybe you can judge whether we were wrong or right.

36
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,520
 - Oh, yeah.

37
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,360
 - For the ones that--

38
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,200
 - I would love to do that.

39
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,520
 - You've had things like Spicy Meat Corner

40
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,240
 and Get Yourself Off the Hook

41
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,080
 and The I'm Actually of the Week.

42
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,920
 - It's interesting, isn't it?

43
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,400
 'Cause I sort of blank out everything that happens

44
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,080
 in shows anyway after I've done them.

45
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,920
 So, no, I wasn't.

46
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,520
 - These are just format points that I've invented

47
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,800
 that I've been having, frankly,

48
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,560
 a pretty sticky time getting to take.

49
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,400
 - I am.

50
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,520
 Yeah, no, I wasn't here for any of those.

51
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,680
 - Two of those I haven't even heard of

52
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,000
 before, if that's how it is.

53
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,880
 (all laughing)

54
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,600
 - Okay, do you want a correction?

55
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,440
 - Yes, please.

56
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,280
 - All right.

57
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,720
 Sally writes, big fan of the podcast,

58
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,040
 but couldn't let this one go for a second episode.

59
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,640
 Houston, Texas is pronounced Houston and not Houston.

60
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
 - Who said it, Houston?

61
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,320
 - Well, I always bring that up,

62
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,920
 but presumably that's cut out

63
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,640
 just because it's too, it comes up too much,

64
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,440
 but Andy always says Houston,

65
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,160
 and I always say, why are you saying it like that?

66
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,000
 - Well, apparently I'm saying it right,

67
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
 according to Sally.

68
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,080
 - Oh, she's saying it's Houston, not Houston.

69
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,520
 - No, she's saying it's Houston.

70
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,880
 - Yeah, like everyone pronounces it.

71
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,520
 - Houston, and I'm saying Houston.

72
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,360
 - Yes.

73
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,000
 - But her surname, she's called Sally Klaus,

74
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,480
 and I actually don't know whether it's Sally Klaus

75
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,720
 or Sally Klaus.

76
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,560
 - Wow.

77
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,080
 - Sally Klaus.

78
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,240
 - I think we did keep in one mention

79
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,240
 of Dan complaining about Andy's pronunciation of Houston,

80
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,720
 and that might be why Sally's written in, perhaps.

81
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,400
 I think it's been in once.

82
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,640
 - I feel like I get an easier time on the pronunciation

83
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,520
 because I pronounce quite a few things wrong, but I don't.

84
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,440
 - You do, let's go through those.

85
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,360
 How do you pronounce those small primates

86
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
 that live on Madagascar with ring tails?

87
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,800
 (laughing)

88
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,880
 - They're zebras, aren't they?

89
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,120
 - No, they're primates, Andy.

90
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,040
 - Lima.

91
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,880
 - Limia.

92
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,720
 - Limia.

93
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,560
 - Limia.

94
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,760
 - Limia is what Andy used to say about that.

95
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,040
 - I find you pronounce a lot of things oddly,

96
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,320
 but I would never say wrong,

97
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,520
 but maybe this is just the bias towards the male RP,

98
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,400
 but I find you just have like quirky pronunciation.

99
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
 What is it?

100
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,200
 - Well, can I ask, Andy, if you're in America

101
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,680
 and you're an early settler

102
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,560
 and you're right at the edge of where settlement is,

103
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,880
 but you're not quite there yet.

104
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,720
 What would you say that edge is called, beginning with F-R?

105
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,840
 - This is wild that you say this.

106
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,160
 - Front it, front it.

107
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,000
 (laughing)

108
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,880
 Hey, hey, hey, let's press on and have another email, shall we?

109
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,320
 - Davey Crockett, King of the Wild,

110
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,000
 as Andy would say, Frontier, but it's Frontier.

111
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,720
 - And you say Frontier, Frontier.

112
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,640
 - No, he keeps saying Frontier.

113
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,160
 I mean, it's not really incorrect.

114
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,320
 - My dog's got three years.

115
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,120
 A left ear, a right ear and a wild Frontier.

116
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,960
 - Exactly.

117
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,680
 - Right, I'll just, that's how I remember it.

118
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,240
 Close to the home, we said right in

119
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,720
 if you're from Martham in Norfolk.

120
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,560
 - Oh, yes.

121
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,400
 - Yes, I was there for that.

122
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,240
 - You were there for this.

123
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
 - Martha, mm.

124
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,520
 - We had a lot of people right in who were not from Martham.

125
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,680
 We had someone from Norwich, Katie Walters.

126
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
 - Someone from Leeds.

127
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
 (laughing)

128
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
 - Holly Davis, who lived there as a teenager.

129
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,520
 - Doesn't count.

130
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,360
 - Katie Walters points out

131
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,320
 that Martham has a thatch chip shop.

132
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,000
 (laughing)

133
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,840
 - That's really cool.

134
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,680
 - It's like cool.

135
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,880
 And that the car's dangerous, doesn't it?

136
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
 - Yeah, you're right.

137
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,240
 It must go up every year.

138
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,960
 The carved village sign featuring a Viking

139
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,320
 and a traditional Norfolk sailing wedding,

140
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,520
 just kind of boat, was made by Harry Carter,

141
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,640
 the nephew of the Egyptologist Howard Carter.

142
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,480
 - Wow, interesting.

143
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,040
 - However, he made over 200 signs,

144
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,200
 so maybe that's not so interesting.

145
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,040
 I think that is interesting.

146
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,880
 - That is interesting.

147
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,160
 - And Holly points out that Martha

148
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,760
 and his point of West Flag,

149
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,040
 which used to be an island when the Romans were here.

150
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,520
 And then, really excitingly, we hit the jackpot,

151
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,120
 Tilly Holland writes,

152
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,760
 "Hello, my boyfriend has just played me a clip

153
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,120
 "from no such thing as a captive willy episode."

154
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,760
 Very excitedly, "I am from Martham."

155
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,240
 Martham is a strange village, she writes.

156
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,640
 Well, she goes into a lot of detail about it.

157
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,120
 They've got some extraordinary stuff.

158
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,960
 Three churches.

159
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,780
 - Do you think on our next tour,

160
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,000
 we could do a gig in Martham?

161
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,440
 - Well, we could play one of the three churches

162
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,800
 or one of the two co-ops.

163
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,840
 - Or the chip shop.

164
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,680
 (laughing)

165
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,560
 - Or the chip shop.

166
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,440
 They've also got a library and a kebab shop

167
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,800
 and a Turkish barbers, which have the same owner.

168
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,240
 My brother has been having a haircut

169
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,800
 in which the barber has had to run back to the kebab shop.

170
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,240
 (laughing)

171
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,080
 - That's great.

172
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,200
 - I imagine they cut your hair

173
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,920
 with one of those huge knives

174
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,800
 while you're rotating on your chair.

175
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,760
 (laughing)

176
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,280
 - And a library, did you say?

177
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
 - I think that's a comma thing.

178
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
 I don't think the Turkish chip shop,

179
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,320
 a kebab shop owner also does a library.

180
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,080
 - That would be confusing where you've got one job

181
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,040
 where all you do is talk to the customer

182
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,160
 and then you have a job.

183
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,680
 (laughing)

184
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,640
 - So don't silent.

185
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,080
 Oh, that's really funny.

186
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,040
 That's really good.

187
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,920
 And she also says that Bradley Walsh's brother

188
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,840
 reportedly lives in the village.

189
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
 - Is that right?

190
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,880
 - So one of the villagers must know.

191
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,200
 - Well, in the past, Bradley Walsh has been spotted

192
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,600
 at one of the annual fairs on Martham Green.

193
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
 - I see.

194
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,440
 - Huge.

195
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,280
 - That's great.

196
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,800
 - I bet that I used up the Martham Evening Mail

197
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,960
 would have been headlined for a year, wouldn't it?

198
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,280
 (laughing)

199
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,200
 - My head chopped off my bum.

200
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,520
 (laughing)

201
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,440
 - And in the bottom, Bradley Walsh's seam.

202
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,360
 - Oh dear.

203
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,200
 All right.

204
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,720
 Claudia Murdoch writes,

205
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,920
 I recently listened to your episode, question mark.

206
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,080
 And you mentioned the Wellington Shanty Club.

207
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,240
 - Okay, so that, yes, that was me.

208
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,480
 And that was when we had Lou Sanders on it.

209
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,320
 It was our live show.

210
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,400
 And I mentioned that the guy who did the sea shanty.

211
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,240
 - Bingo.

212
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,040
 - Yeah, or she mentioned, I think it was seasick.

213
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,240
 - Well, you stated that this was the only Shanty Club

214
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,200
 in Wellington.

215
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
 And I just wanted to let you know

216
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,920
 that this is actually incorrect.

217
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,400
 - I couldn't listen to any more of the episode.

218
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,280
 (laughing)

219
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,600
 - There are two Shanty Clubs.

220
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,440
 - Oh my God.

221
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,280
 - The other one is called the Salty Wailers.

222
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,120
 - Nice.

223
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,960
 - Salty Wailers.

224
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,800
 - That's great.

225
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,640
 - That's great.

226
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,460
 Huge apologies.

227
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,280
 That's great.

228
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,120
 - Imagine that.

229
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,200
 Getting that wrong.

230
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,560
 - Did you say, I shant be listening again?

231
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,600
 (laughing)

232
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,400
 - That was a missed opportunity by Claudia there.

233
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,640
 Raise your game, Claudia.

234
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,080
 (laughing)

235
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,480
 - Here's a nice bonus ball from Anne from Canberra.

236
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,680
 I was prompted to write after hearing David Mitchell's fact

237
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,760
 about Steven and the white ship disaster

238
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,320
 as there's a great link to one of your facts

239
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,360
 in an earlier episode.

240
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,200
 - Oh, lovely.

241
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,020
 - This is cool.

242
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,320
 A bit of like intra-episode tunneling.

243
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,160
 - Yeah.

244
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,000
 - Like this.

245
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,640
 In episode 490, Andy spoke about wool

246
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,320
 and its adsorbent quality, right?

247
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,560
 Which is where it sort of has water within it

248
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,720
 and it's not absorbing it, but it's kind of taking it on.

249
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,040
 - Sounds like an Andy thing to talk about.

250
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,200
 Wool being absorbent.

251
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,600
 - Adsorbent.

252
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
 - So not an Andy thing then, sorry.

253
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,640
 (laughing)

254
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,240
 - I was reminded of this when David Mitchell

255
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,560
 was talking about the only survivor

256
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,400
 of the white ship disaster, barrel the butcher.

257
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
 There is a theory that the reason the butcher survived

258
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
 was that unlike the other noble passengers

259
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,240
 in their fancy silks, he was wearing coarse woollen clothing

260
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,400
 which was water repellent and preserved heat even when wet,

261
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,920
 which wool does.

262
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
 So Andy was quite correct when he said

263
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
 that if you fall in a river.

264
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
 - Oh my God.

265
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,040
 (laughing)

266
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,720
 - This is all Andy is quite correct.

267
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,560
 Every single email ends with that.

268
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,520
 And he gave us one or two at the start,

269
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,520
 just little fun ones and it was all leading up to this.

270
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,200
 - We move on to the Andy is quite correct section.

271
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,160
 - No one in real life would ever say

272
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,600
 Andy was quite correct apart from you.

273
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,760
 That's what gives it away.

274
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
 - What was, what did you say that if you fell in?

275
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,040
 - Oh, you didn't finish that sentence.

276
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,360
 Sorry, if you fell in a river that's freezing cold

277
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,280
 and then you get to dry land, you should be wearing wool

278
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,800
 'cause it'll help you, it'll help you stay warm.

279
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,360
 Okay, meat, lot of meat, meat judging in the inbox.

280
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,520
 - Okay, so we had a fact about professional meat judging

281
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,040
 in America that it's a thing you can do in college.

282
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

283
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,080
 Leah McConnell just writes to point out

284
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,560
 the meat judging is pretty big in Australia as well.

285
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,720
 - I think we mentioned that, yeah.

286
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,560
 - I do be okay.

287
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,680
 - My husband's grandfather was a meat judge,

288
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,960
 meat, meat's there and meat judge.

289
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,760
 - Wow, that's cool.

290
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,920
 - Yeah, for any I've been on the show.

291
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,920
 - And he's in, he would have been in Australia, so maybe.

292
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,040
 - That's great, yes, Australia.

293
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,000
 - Lisa Sackreiter is a high school agriculture teacher

294
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,200
 and says they do lots of it

295
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,400
 through the Future Farmers of America, the FFA,

296
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,200
 along with poultry judging, livestock judging, dairy products,

297
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,120
 dairy cattle judging, turf judging and others.

298
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,560
 - Is that judging how anti-

299
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,360
 - No, I don't think it's that, T-U-R-F.

300
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,600
 (laughing)

301
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,960
 - Oh my God.

302
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,800
 - Oh dear.

303
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,900
 Now, there's a serious message about the meat stuff

304
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,320
 which is from Ben Lidgate.

305
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,600
 I've been listening to your most recent episode

306
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
 in which Dan talks about retro-clat.

307
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,920
 - Oh yes, yes.

308
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,600
 - So this is backwards talking for Butchers.

309
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,560
 - Yeah, he said it is Butchers Talk Convention

310
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,920
 in Australia in the 1960s and it angered me so much

311
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,200
 that I felt compelled to write in for the first time ever,

312
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,320
 despite having listened to you guys

313
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
 since your very first episode.

314
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,440
 - Thanks for listening.

315
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,480
 - You can also thank Dan, as it also finally inspired me

316
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
 to join Club Fish in the hope that I might hear this email

317
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,000
 read out for some great, what a great idea.

318
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,660
 So, just putting a few little mistakes every episode.

319
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,700
 - New business model, it just pissed people off.

320
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,540
 - Wow.

321
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,860
 - Why do you think I've been saying it Houston all these years?

322
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,380
 - Is this why people like Piers Morgan exist?

323
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,220
 So they all got spin-off podcasts

324
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,860
 where you're allowed to write and then complain.

325
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,580
 They pissed people off solely to get subscribers.

326
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,020
 - So should I tell you what Ben says in his,

327
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,340
 why he's so angry?

328
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,700
 He says, "I'm a fifth generation butcher."

329
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,540
 - Wow.

330
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,380
 - "Fifth gen."

331
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,260
 And the reason that this fact, heavy quotes,

332
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,500
 angered me so much is that Butchers Backslank

333
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,280
 has been in use in Britain

334
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
 since at least the early 19th century.

335
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,480
 Not only was it not invented in Australia,

336
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,560
 I'd be very surprised if they only started using it

337
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,920
 in Australia in the '60s,

338
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,120
 as it more than likely came over

339
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,080
 with British settlers earlier than that,

340
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,800
 unless it came over with the 10-pound poms in the '50s.

341
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,240
 But even then, he's about 10 years out.

342
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,760
 So really thorough demolition problems.

343
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,080
 - Who's this person?

344
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,400
 - Ben Lidgate.

345
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,480
 - Okay, Ben, I think what we should actually do

346
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,200
 is discuss this on the next episode,

347
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
 which goes out next month.

348
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,420
 So if you want to hear any more about this,

349
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,640
 then make sure you keep subscribing for another month.

350
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,540
 - I love it.

351
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,460
 It's so weird, because effectively,

352
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,260
 he was so furious with what I said that he had to write in.

353
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,580
 Yet, it's such a great email that I just can't be upset.

354
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,420
 - It's nice.

355
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,260
 - It's really nice.

356
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,100
 I love these letters.

357
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,940
 - There you go.

358
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,940
 - Yeah, thank you, Ben.

359
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,380
 You weren't like this one.

360
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,180
 Raquel Moss writes, "Dear fish."

361
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,540
 Raquel Moss, yeah, made up.

362
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,380
 - Yeah.

363
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,220
 (laughing)

364
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,940
 - I'd like to just ask about Addy's novels.

365
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,780
 (laughing)

366
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,940
 It's been a few months since you've mentioned them.

367
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,100
 - She writes to say, "Just checking in to confirm that yes,

368
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
 Dan does give off big wife guy energy."

369
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,340
 (laughing)

370
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,040
 - Come on, come on, Moss.

371
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,340
 - It is a black and white.

372
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,820
 As does James, which is completely understandable,

373
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,260
 because his wife seems rad.

374
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,740
 A helicopter pilot.

375
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,580
 - Wow.

376
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,900
 - Wait, wait, I'm going.

377
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,820
 Not that Dan's wife isn't rad.

378
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,180
 - I'm sure she is.

379
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,120
 I just don't know the details of her radness.

380
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,100
 - Dan, do you want to tell us how rad Phen is?

381
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,940
 - She sucks.

382
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,200
 I hate it, I hate wives.

383
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,040
 - Classic bro.

384
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,780
 - I hate wives.

385
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,660
 Raquel says, "Andy, you're a bit more of an enigma,

386
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,740
 but I'm sure you're quietly a wife guy in your own way."

387
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,580
 - I'm not.

388
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,300
 (laughing)

389
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,820
 - All right, so thank you, Raquel.

390
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,500
 I'm going to sort of do like a--

391
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,020
 - By the way, just to say,

392
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,020
 we got a bit of husband girl energy

393
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,920
 off Anna a few minutes earlier with the,

394
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,860
 my husband's granddad was a meat judge.

395
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,580
 - No, I didn't really do enough.

396
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,140
 38 husbands, me and Joe Brandt,

397
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,660
 not a good word to say about husbands between us

398
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,500
 to know what you're talking about.

399
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,060
 - You're never normally mentioned that you're married.

400
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,940
 - No, that was made up that fact a minute ago.

401
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,820
 I had a fictional husband.

402
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,620
 I just really wanted to have something to say

403
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,660
 about meat judging.

404
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,580
 - Anna knows that it's only one butcher

405
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,620
 who listens to this show

406
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,100
 and a bunch of pseudonyms that you've created.

407
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,780
 (laughing)

408
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,380
 - I've been single-handedly maintaining

409
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,540
 our ad revenue, Dan, don't.

410
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,900
 (laughing)

411
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,900
 - It's exhausting running a million salt puppets

412
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,740
 every week.

413
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,580
 - Oh my God.

414
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,340
 - Have you had to actually subscribe

415
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,940
 for every one of these salt puppets?

416
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,500
 - I'm spending 90 grand a month

417
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,560
 (laughing)

418
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,940
 on Clownfish alone.

419
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,060
 It's exhausting.

420
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,860
 - Well, he should not get any adverts.

421
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,620
 (laughing)

422
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,700
 - Grace Jist writes.

423
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,480
 - Just give us the general, you know,

424
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,240
 (laughing)

425
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,840
 you don't need to read the whole thing down there.

426
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,760
 (laughing)

427
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,040
 - Sorry, we're back to meat actually.

428
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,640
 'Cause her email is head subject lined all caps.

429
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,760
 Meat judging isn't a sport.

430
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,320
 She says, you'll almost killed me

431
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,600
 with embarrassment and laughter

432
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,920
 on my drive to work this morning.

433
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,400
 Meat judging isn't a sport,

434
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,800
 but a competition for kids in FFA,

435
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,960
 Future Farmers of America,

436
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,040
 or 4-H who are interested in livestock farming.

437
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,880
 Never did it myself,

438
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,600
 but I did do a bit of other livestock judging as a kid.

439
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,640
 It never gets old listening to a handful of Brits

440
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,560
 try to understand American things.

441
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,960
 - Well, that's interesting.

442
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,360
 - Keep doing it like the idiots we are then.

443
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,520
 - I would say it is a sport.

444
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,240
 - They do it in college.

445
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,080
 - Yeah.

446
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,920
 - It doesn't sound like a sport to me.

447
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,840
 I think sport has to have some physical exertion.

448
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,680
 - Chess is a sport?

449
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,520
 - No, it's not.

450
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,360
 - Yes, chess is a sport.

451
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,720
 - I would say that's what makes chess not a sport.

452
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,600
 - Yeah, but Anna, what makes you an expert on sport?

453
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
 - Oh, James, I'm so glad you've asked.

454
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,360
 Well, I happened to have written a book recently

455
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,080
 with my good friend and colleague, James Harkin,

456
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,720
 called "Everything to Play For".

457
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,040
 It's the QI book of sport.

458
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,880
 - Excellent.

459
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,080
 - And chess doesn't feature.

460
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
 (laughing)

461
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,400
 - What if the pieces are so heavy

462
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,000
 that it is physical exertion to lift them?

463
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,280
 Is that then a sport?

464
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,720
 - Yeah, maybe chess is a sport for you.

465
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,560
 - Chess boxing.

466
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,400
 - Chess boxing.

467
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,740
 - Yeah.

468
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,280
 We've, Caroline from Svalbard has written.

469
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,120
 - No.

470
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,960
 - Yes.

471
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,280
 - Very interested in that.

472
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,120
 - It is so cool.

473
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,480
 We can get emails from all over the world, it's lovely.

474
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,040
 - I think we have one from,

475
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
 I can't remember where the other was,

476
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,520
 somewhere equally far from here.

477
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
 Anyway, cut that.

478
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,360
 - Leads.

479
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,200
 (laughing)

480
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,920
 - It's from Leads.

481
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,000
 - It's far away, you have the long year,

482
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 by and where you're not allowed to die,

483
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,840
 - Well.

484
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,680
 - Currently, 'cause it's too cold.

485
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,320
 - You've fallen right into my trap,

486
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,200
 you little fool.

487
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,040
 (laughing)

488
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,880
 - Caroline writes.

489
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,400
 (laughing)

490
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,440
 - Caroline writes.

491
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,320
 (laughing)

492
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
 - Subject line, episode 11.

493
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,960
 (laughing)

494
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,160
 - I live in Longyear Bayen.

495
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,040
 - In Svalbard, and I was listening to old episodes

496
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,320
 while out training my dog team.

497
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,880
 - Oh God, you're cool.

498
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,920
 - So a very long overdue correction

499
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,000
 and some related info on door handles and bears in Svalbard.

500
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,240
 Number one, it is not illegal to die here,

501
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,680
 but you cannot be buried here.

502
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,600
 Not because you freeze,

503
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,240
 but because the permafrost in most cases

504
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,480
 will bring you back up.

505
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,320
 - Yeah.

506
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,160
 - Yeah.

507
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,000
 - I think that's what we've said, isn't it?

508
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,120
 - Well, maybe.

509
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,680
 Maybe we said that in episode 12.

510
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,400
 (laughing)

511
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,440
 You can get cremated and bury your ashes here.

512
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,600
 - All right, number two, doorknobs.

513
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,000
 I own a cabin outside town,

514
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,800
 and like in many cabins here,

515
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,160
 the door opens inwards and the handle upwards.

516
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,960
 The first is to prevent you from snowing in,

517
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,320
 and the second to make it more difficult

518
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,840
 for bears to get in.

519
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
 However, the bears do not always use the handle.

520
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,920
 Again, see picture.

521
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,240
 And the picture is just of a door

522
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,680
 with a huge panel missing where.

523
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,520
 - Oh wow.

524
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,360
 - The bear has just gone in.

525
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,280
 - Wow.

526
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,640
 - Yeah, anyway, Caroline, Caroline,

527
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,000
 thank you so much for writing.

528
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,840
 - That's awesome.

529
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,680
 - Love that about the handles going up.

530
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,520
 - I'm excited.

531
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,360
 - I know.

532
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,720
 - David Crundwell writes.

533
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,560
 - Good name.

534
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,400
 - Great name.

535
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,240
 - Great name.

536
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,080
 I'm a huge fan of the show,

537
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,920
 and as of this week,

538
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,000
 also a proud card-carrying clubfish member.

539
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,840
 - Yeah.

540
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,680
 - This isn't a correction,

541
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,600
 but I thought it may be of some interest

542
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,040
 that the opposite of the word February,

543
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,440
 as discussed in episode 502,

544
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,880
 is in fact the word February.

545
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,800
 - Oh.

546
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,160
 - As the opposite of the song Wonderwall

547
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,560
 is also the song Wonderwall.

548
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,800
 As James correctly mentioned,

549
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,480
 active noise cancelling in headphones

550
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,880
 works by receiving an audio signal,

551
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,920
 inverting the phase of this signal,

552
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,640
 a pattern of compressions and decompressions

553
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,080
 in air pressure over time,

554
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,360
 playing the inverted signal into the speakers,

555
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,320
 cancelling out those compressions and decompressions.

556
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,680
 So Dave actually attached a file

557
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,440
 of him saying the word February,

558
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,280
 duplicated it,

559
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,160
 inverted the phrase,

560
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,800
 played them one over the other,

561
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,400
 and the result is silence.

562
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,720
 And I watched the video of him doing it,

563
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,840
 and it sounds like this.

564
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,800
 - That was a really good impression.

565
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,640
 - It was really good.

566
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,600
 (laughing)

567
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,120
 - So Dave actually did the work,

568
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,160
 and I'd just like to thank him.

569
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,720
 I'd also like to thank Riffles,

570
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,600
 who claimed to have sent the sound

571
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,080
 and just sent the file that was called

572
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,600
 "Five Seconds of Silence".

573
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,120
 - Oh, that's clever.

574
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,480
 - The effect was the same in both cases.

575
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,200
 - Yeah, and Swifties will know

576
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,240
 that Taylor Swift made it to the top of the charts

577
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
 with basically a silent track.

578
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,160
 - Ah.

579
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,000
 - Oh wow.

580
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,640
 - It was an accidental release,

581
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,120
 and it was just basically, effectively--

582
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,960
 - That sounds rude, doesn't it?

583
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,800
 - Sounds like a fart.

584
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,640
 (laughing)

585
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,720
 - Kind of an accidental release.

586
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,120
 But it was silent at least.

587
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,960
 (laughing)

588
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,360
 - But it was also deadly, so--

589
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,200
 (laughing)

590
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,040
 - That is what you would call a Swiftie as well.

591
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,000
 (laughing)

592
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,720
 - Yeah, I think it was either it had white noise

593
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,880
 or it was something basically that was a non-track in it,

594
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,000
 and it went to the top of the charts

595
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,440
 because it was attached to the name.

596
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,280
 - You can do a lot of interpretation work on that.

597
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,120
 What does she mean?

598
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,960
 - Yeah, exactly.

599
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,780
 - Yeah.

600
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,620
 - Brilliant.

601
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,760
 The Incess Zone we're entering now,

602
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,920
 which we've been in for a couple of months

603
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,960
 on Drops of the Line, Anna, sorry.

604
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,000
 This is about Iceland and the Incess app, you remember?

605
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,080
 - Oh yeah.

606
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,920
 - And we mentioned it,

607
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,720
 and some were going to say, "No, that's not true."

608
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,200
 - Well, it's not true that there's the app.

609
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,200
 - No, we don't have an app that we check our dates

610
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,440
 for Incess Tone.

 I think the name was Asgurthur,

 but struggled to understand the pronunciation,

616
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,880
 which is devastating 'cause I asked an Icelander

626
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,200
 - Oh, interesting.

627
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,040
 - This is huge.

628
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,880
 - That's huge, so.

629
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,720
 - This is huge.

630
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,960
 - So the way I understood it is

631
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,160
 that they had this genealogy website,

632
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,560
 and then they had a competition

633
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,320
 to see who could find the best way

634
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,080
 of utilizing this data,

635
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,320
 and then one person came up with the idea

636
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,520
 of doing the dating app where you bump two phones together

637
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,400
 and it will tell you if you're related,

638
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
 and it was kind of a joke,

639
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,440
 and if a load of people downloaded it kind of as a joke,

640
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,980
 but it was never really a proper, proper thing.

641
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,260
 But this actually goes against that evidence, doesn't it?

642
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,680
 This is actual anecdotal evidence of people using it.

643
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,660
 - Well, no, that could be true as well, right?

644
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,540
 Your thing is true, the joke thing,

645
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,380
 but then this person's actually used it, not as a joke.

646
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,100
 - So thank you, Elsa, vindicated.

647
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,940
 - Love it.

648
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,020
 - Yeah, so we'll say that in every episode from now on.

649
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,860
 That happens.

650
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,520
 Okay, Aaron Hung writes,

651
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,820
 "In episode 498, you, Dan, James, and Hannah Fry

652
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,300
 "had an interesting conversation about conversation.

653
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,700
 "There is, in fact, a whole field of study

654
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,960
 "called conversation analysis,

655
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
 "which focus on the rigorous, in-depth study

656
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,440
 "of mundane, everyday conversation,

 "when talking."

659
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,680
 So, for example, since you discussed ending conversations,

660
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,480
 there's a chapter attached here on that very topic.

661
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
 He's said a chapter.

662
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,860
 "The too-long-didn't-read version

663
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,520
 "is that a conversation usually closes

664
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,840
 "after a series of steps or pre-closing sequences

665
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,140
 "that signal a wind down to the conversation.

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,680
 "This is arguably why you're abrupt by,

 "at the end of your drop as a line, is so amusing."

 (all laughing)

669
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,680
 - Has it subversed those rules?

670
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,400
 Has it subversed those rules?

671
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,560
 That's why it's so amusing, guys.

672
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,860
 - So, we've gone away from,

673
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,320
 "Andy, this is why you're right,"

674
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,660
 to now, "Andy, this is why you're so funny."

675
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,680
 - We're gonna move on to,

676
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,040
 "Andy, this is why you're so attractive,"

00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,600
 I thought, I found the name in my research,

696
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,640
 "Twat Rocket," which I thought it was,

697
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,800
 but it turns out it's an American skater,

698
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,480
 she's called "Twat Rocket,"

699
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,840
 'cause that's how they pronounce "Twat."

700
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,040
 - Is this why on Twitter,

701
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,760
 the other day, you asked a lot of Americans

702
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,240
 how you pronounce--

703
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,080
 - "Twat."

704
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,320
 - Do you pronounce the word "Twat," "Twat?"

705
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,160
 - Yeah.

706
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,760
 - Or "Twat," and people just replied to you,

707
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,040
 just saying, "Twat, twat, twat, twat."

708
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,720
 - And it's so nice that finally there was a reason

709
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,800
 for them to reply to my tweet saying that.

710
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,360
 Yeah, but apparently, the hot-pocket,

711
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,160
 do you know the hot-pocket?

712
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,000
 - I guess, I think it's a pop-tart, isn't it?

713
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 - Yeah, pop-tart, right?

714
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,960
 - Did you, can I ask?

715
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,440
 Did you look onto YouTube to see

716
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,600
 what the hot-pocket advert was?

717
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,440
 - I did watch it, yeah.

718
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,280
 - Yeah.

719
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,120
 - Could you sing it?

720
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,960
 Can you sing it?

721
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,800
 - Like, we wanna hear it, basically.

722
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,120

723

 - So we get an idea of what "Twat Rocket" would sound like.

724
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,800
 - Hot-pocket.

725
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,840
 - "Twat Rocket."

726
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,840
 - Yeah, it's good.

727
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,480
 So, that's Fearless Bueller, thank you for that.

728
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,400
 All right, and last one.

729
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,240
 - Yes.

730
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
 - Holly Gittins writes.

731
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,080
 - Yeah.

732
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,240
 - She writes in very kind words,

733
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,040
 and then she says, "I wanted to say how refreshing

734
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,920
 "I was recently to hear an episode of Drop As A Line

735
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,840
 "recorded early in the day.

736
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,000
 "I often listened to the podcast

737
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,120
 "while driving to work, still slightly bleary.

738
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,240
 "I hope not too bleary to drive a car.

739
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,480
 "It's a great way of waking up in the morning,

740
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,440
 "but it was a lovely change to hear Dan and James

741
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,400
 "feeling as irritable and generally confused

742
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,280
 "as I often do by the first few minutes."

743
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,000
 - I actually think our morning ones

744
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,720
 are some of our best work on Drop As A Line.

745
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,920
 Have any of you ever had this?

746
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,600
 When I used to work in a nice five job,

747
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,560
 and I used to drive in the rush hour every morning,

748
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,960
 sometimes I'd be at my desk at like 10 o'clock,

749
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,600
 and not remember how I got there.

750
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
 - Oh, you're an autopilot.

751
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,640
 - You're an autopilot the whole way,

752
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,560
 and you're like, "Oh, last thing I knew I was in bed,

753
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,280
 "and now I'm here, how did that happen?"

754
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
 - Yeah, that's a bit freaky.

755
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,320
 I think I have had that sometimes.

756
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,960
 It's when you're driving very boring routes.

757
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,720
 - Yeah, it's the same route all the time,

758
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
 and it's car to car to car,

759
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,680
 and you're doing it for 45 minutes or an hour.

760
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,400
 So it's just to say, you don't do anything,

761
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,760
 you're just like behind a car.

762
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

763
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,480
 - Get the radio on, mate.

764
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,640
 - So Holly has a query, she asks,

765
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,560
 "Have you considered a rolling schedule of recording times?

766
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,360
 "A late night post-pub recording,

767
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,440
 "live audio of you all waking up at 2 a.m.

768
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,240
 "to record for no good reason,

769
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,520
 "or even recording immediately after a 40-hour flight

770
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,000
 "would all be greatly entertaining?"

771
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,560
 - We did a podcast the night after a British election,

772
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,800
 can't remember which one,

773
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,760
 where we did it on the morning of.

774
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,960
 I remember my fact or something to do with the Yeti party.

775
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,800
 That's all I--

776
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,240
 - I think it was 2017, I think it was election special.

777
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,080
 - Yeah.

778
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,920
 - So there was a big--

779
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,840
 - We got in early so that James could edit it,

780
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,720
 presumably that day, so he could get out that night.

781
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,760
 The one we recorded, we basically recorded a podcast

782
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,920
 at every single hour of the day,

783
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,400
 'cause we've done the Comic Relief special

784
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,120
 where we recorded for 24 hours, right?

785
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,720
 So we've just ticked your box.

786
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,560
 - Yes.

787
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,240
 - So yeah, this was, Holly was it.

788
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,080
 - Holly, yeah.

789
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,720
 - So Holly can just listen back to the 24 hours,

790
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,680
 all on YouTube.

791
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,520
 - Yeah.

792
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,560
 - And then you can compare how we were

793
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,880
 all those different times.

794
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,960
 - I was pretty tired by the end of the Comic Relief thing.

795
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,080
 - I remember I was as well,

796
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,160
 but I remember Anna and Dan really carrying

797
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,760
 the last two hours, that's my memory of it.

798
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,820
 - We're morning people.

799
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,660
 - I can't remember.

800
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,320
 - We had like a three minute break

801
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,160
 in between each 35 minute recording.

802
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,840
 And I remember I had my routine so down by the end.

803
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,340
 I'd like, run, put a kettle on, have a pee.

804
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,200
 Pour cattle into, I'd tell us more of it.

805
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,040
 (laughing)

806
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,880
 - On topedus.

807
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,720
 (laughing)

808
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,360
 Pour cattle, pour you more of it.

809
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,580
 On topedus, wake up, scream.

810
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,520
 (laughing)

811
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,440
 Have straps on the throat, I'll just scream.

812
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,280
 (laughing)

813
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,120
 Yeah.

814
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,200
 - I was stressed up.

815
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,120
 I didn't get those breaks

816
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,560
 'cause I had to do the ads in between.

817
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,400
 I had to sit there and--

818
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,240
 - You did ads?

819
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,080
 - Yeah, yeah.

820
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,920
 - What are you advertising?

821
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,760
 - I was just a little side bunny.

822
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,600
 - Side bunny?

823
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,120
 - Side bunny.

824
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,320
 - Bye bye you book, the theory of everything else.

825
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,960
 My dad's tribe are available in all good bookshops.

826
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,480
 - Are you a Desert Rogers child

827
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,160
 in a poor corner of the world?

828
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,360
 You need some entertaining.

829
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,960
 (laughing)

830
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,080
 - Hey, really quickly, just,

831
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,400
 you know how sometimes people recognize us

832
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,920
 by our voice on the street?

833
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,200
 'Cause, you know, not many people know what our faces are,

834
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,400
 but they will hear our accents and sometimes get it.

835
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,280
 And Andy, you said that this guy actually wrote in

836
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,400
 off the back of this incident.

837
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,760
 But I was in South London with Jamie

838
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,320
 from my dad wrote a porno.

839
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,080
 And we were walking down the street

840
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,800
 and I was telling Jamie about the fact

841
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,520
 that's gonna be on the episode

842
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,760
 that we just recorded about Senna.

843
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,840
 And so I went, I literally said the words to him.

844
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,000
 Yeah, so my fact this week is that in 1984,

845
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,920
 and this guy just turned around

846
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,960
 and went, Dan, no such thing.

847
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,800
 And as a kind of like, 'cause I've walked past podcasters

848
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,200
 and had a bit of sort of like,

849
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,560
 whoa, that's pretty exciting.

850
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,920
 To hear a podcaster use literally the words

851
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,240
 that you hear in an episode.

852
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,600
 - Are you sure you're not everyday?

853
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,440
 You sort of pay Jamie to take you out

854
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,200
 and you just spend all day walking around going,

855
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,240
 my fact this week, is there anyone,

856
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,880
 can you see anyone looking around Jamie?

857
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,720
 No, okay.

858
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,360
 - Let me do that a bit.

859
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
 This one was accidental.

860
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,560
 - Yeah, very funny.

861
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,840
 And then we got Neema from that block.

862
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,680
 - Yeah.

863
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,500
 - Oh, really?

864
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,340
 - Yeah.

865
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,960
 - But apparently not worthy for the show.

866
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,800
 No.

867
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,640
 (laughing)

868
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,160
 - 'Cause it was saying how nice Dan is.

869
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,800
 (laughing)

870
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,920
 - I actually have a filter set up for those emails.

871
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,160
 (laughing)

872
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,400
 - Bye.

873
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,980
 (upbeat music)

874
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,640
 - That does work.

875
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,480
 - Wow.

876
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,320
 - I can see it now.

877
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,160
 - It's really funny.

878
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,480
 - I've subverted the norms of conversation

879
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,960
 with that abrupt ending.

880
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,560
 But I now spoil the joke by saying,

881
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,880
 thank you for listening.

882
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,760
 And we will be available.

883
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,600
 We're in the inbox.

884
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,640
 We're waiting for you.

885
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,800
 We're in there.

886
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,800
 So get in with us by emailing podcast@qi.com.

887
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 And we love hearing from you.

888
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,140
 And bye.

889
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,720
 (upbeat music)

890
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,300
 (upbeat music)

891
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,880
 (upbeat music)
