00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:19,960
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,840
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,760
 My name is Dan Triber, and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,200
 Aniches Inski, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,540
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, James

7
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,540
 Harkin.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,480
 Okay, my fact this week is that the word "wow" was popular in Scotland for 400 years before

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,120
 it caught on in the rest of the English-speaking world.

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,200
 You were so waiting for one of those together, weren't you?

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
 Oh, hang on.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
 Wow.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
 Wow.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,400
 You're in the right place, and yeah, isn't that crazy?

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,440
 It's first use, 1513, this is according to the Oxford English Dictionary, in a translation

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,640
 of the "Need" by G Douglas, whoever that was.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,400
 Was it in the original author, Virgil?

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
 Yeah.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
 You're right.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,080
 But G Douglas was a Scottish person, and he said out on their 100-spirits, "Wow,

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,120
 thou crayous."

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,680
 And then the first time it gets used really in the English-speaking world is about the 1890s,

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,320
 and Burns uses it, and a few other Scottish writers use it as well.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,680
 And it was in that context, it's meant as an exclamation.

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
 It looks like it doesn't it?

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
 "Wow, thou crayous."

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
 Yeah.

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
 You're crying.

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
 Wow.

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
 Yeah.

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
 So why was Scottish people keeping it to themselves?

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
 Like a secret for 400 years?

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,920
 Maybe the only exciting things that happened in the world were all in Scotland.

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
 That's true.

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,080
 They were ahead with inventions and the enlightenment.

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,080
 There was much more to say "wow" to.

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
 That's true.

38
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
 And there was necessarily elsewhere.

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
 Yeah.

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,320
 So, yeah, Andy brings up a good point.

41
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,520
 How is it that we must have been, people were communicating, obviously, from Scotland and

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,800
 England and Ireland and further places, would they have been saying it to their face?

43
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
 Do we know?

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
 Or?

45
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,920
 So you think that when the English went back down South, they go, "Wow, what a bunch of

46
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
 minutes."

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,360
 "Wow, thank God he's gone."

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
 Well, we don't know.

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,720
 Basically, this is, as with all of these citations, this is the evidence that we have.

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,160
 So the only evidence that we have that it was spoken by anyone or written by anyone was

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,360
 in Scotland.

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,640
 And then when the evidence for it being spoken in England and the rest of the world comes

53
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
 in, that's all later on.

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
 Okay.

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,880
 But it seems like they were deliberately keeping it secret for everyone, I guess.

56
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,080
 As soon as an English person comes along, they will have an agreement to shut up.

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,920
 Do you know another very old Scottish word, first used in Scotland, is "boot."

58
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
 Really?

59
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
 "Boo."

60
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
 "Boo."

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
 Same meaning?

62
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,520
 Yeah, it's a word that's used in the north of Scotland to frighten crying children.

63
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
 Oh, no.

64
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
 So they were already frightened and crying?

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,200
 But does that frighten them out of their tears?

66
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,600
 It does sometimes with children, doesn't it?

67
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
 I've tried it.

68
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 Does it?

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
 Yeah, just on rounds.

70
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
 You do not sometimes make it worse.

71
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
 I think it's 50/50.

72
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,880
 It's definitely worth a try though.

73
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
 It's quite fun.

74
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,480
 But then you might try it like eight times, and by then it's like, you know, you do it once

75
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,080
 and it gets worse, and then you do it again, thinking, "Oh, I'll bring it back to the

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
 last time."

77
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
 It just gets worse again.

78
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
 It's a slippery slope.

79
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
 It feels like ink.

80
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,360
 But so another early reference this might give more of a guide to what context it was

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,000
 using was used by Sir Walter Scott in 1830, and he used to write papers on the esoteric,

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 on the paranormal.

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,360
 I had no idea about that.

84
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,320
 So he wrote a paper on, it was called "Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft," and that

85
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,480
 was from 1830, and the sentence he had in it was, "We start and are afraid when we hear

86
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,400
 one cry, boo," but he's spelled it B-O-H.

87
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,880
 So sorry, is he claiming that ghost shout boo?

88
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,680
 Is that where we've got the original idea that ridiculous ghost shout boo?

89
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
 Yeah, I guess so.

90
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
 I guess so.

91
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
 Ghost go boo.

92
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,920
 In comics, they say boo.

93
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
 They say boo.

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
 Do they?

95
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
 Yeah.

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
 It depends on the kind of days.

97
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
 It's a lot like Scottish dialects.

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,600
 I think different ghosts from different places have the different ways of speaking, don't

99
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
 they?

100
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
 Yeah.

101
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
 Different pronunciations.

102
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
 Yeah.

103
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,760
 So the Scottish also have, Scott has 421 words for snow, which is, so I think a lot of people

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,160
 used to say that Scandinavian had thousands of words for snow.

105
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,800
 They were like this, yeah.

106
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,920
 So they've got these amazing words for snow, and this is taken from all the Scottish dialects.

107
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,320
 So there are a lot of Scottish dialects from all around the country, and that's different

108
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,840
 to Gallic.

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,280
 And there was a study done a couple of years ago by a Scottish, the Soros compiler that

110
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,760
 found they have words, "a specific to snow," like, "sneazle," which is to begin to rain

111
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
 or snow.

112
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,000
 "Skelf" is a large snowflake.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,400
 "Fuctor" is to fall lightly and come down in odd flakes, "Fuctor," it's really "Fuctoring"

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
 out there.

115
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
 That sounds very Germanic.

116
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
 Germanic.

117
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
 Fuctor.

118
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
 No.

119
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,720
 It does a bit, but it also sounds a bit Scottish, and it obviously is a Germanic language.

120
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,880
 The thing with the Eskimos, I think, is that you could technically say that they do have

121
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,320
 100 words for snow, but the way it is is they have one or two or maybe four or five roots,

122
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,680
 which kind of means snow, and then the rest of them, you can just put like a prefix or a suffix

123
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,880
 after it to make another word, which means this type of snow, or this type of snow.

124
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,800
 So it's snowing a bit, or it's snowing a lot, or 98 other variations.

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 We would, it counts heavy snow and light snow, and you know, "Fuctor" snow, all this

126
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,120
 word for thing.

127
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,000
 Just in this study that they did, the Soros, they also looked at words that Scottish people

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
 have for sport.

129
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,240
 They figured there'd be a lot of sporting words as well.

130
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,600
 And they assumed that football would have the most words they used to refer to it, because

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
 football's popular sport.

132
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,120
 And actually, it turns out that the sport of marbles has many more words in its way.

133
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
 That is more of a football.

134
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,920
 Yeah, so marbles has things like, it had 369 different items of vocabulary linked to it

135
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
 in Scotland.

136
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
 Have you got me?

137
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
 Yeah.

138
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,080
 There's "Runtit", which is having lost all of one's marbles to one's opponent.

139
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,360
 There's a "neave", which is a method of cheating and delivering the shot by advancing

140
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
 the hand too far.

141
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,160
 I remember having that done to me when I was a kid.

142
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
 Wow.

143
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,240
 So marbles actually are more popular in Scotland than football in some ways.

144
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,240
 And are these words from Scottish dialects or are they "gaylequads"?

145
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,400
 They're words from Scottish dialects, and I think you mean "galic".

146
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
 I think I mean "gayle".

147
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
 Oh my god.

148
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,200
 Guys, we've just spent the last 15 minutes before this podcast arguing about this.

149
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 Yeah.

150
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,800
 That was an act of war that Andy just pulled out there.

151
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,440
 All I'm saying is what my glass we didn't father has said, and now I think of it, I'm

152
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,960
 not certain whether he said "galic" or "gaylec", but I'm pretty sure it was "gaylec".

153
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
 I know.

154
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
 Please write in.

155
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
 In your hundreds.

156
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
 Sorry.

157
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,760
 Is Marbles competitive on, like, is it, is it, is it competitive?

158
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,440
 No, but as in like, you know how we have darts on TV here?

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,080
 Is there marbles on TV in Scotland?

160
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
 Yeah, the Marbles channel.

161
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
 You're kidding.

162
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
 Are you working?

163
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
 I am.

164
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
 I'm kidding, yeah.

165
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,880
 No, I think it's just like an old-fashioned game, isn't it like, for instance, Skittles or

166
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
 something like that?

167
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
 Yeah.

168
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
 It's not one.

169
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
 It's a bit more old-fashioned than parks.

170
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,920
 All of them parks, parks go back to the Romans.

171
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,240
 The Romans had 500 different words to describe parks, didn't they?

172
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,360
 So there is another word, which Millens Open Dictionary took in August.

173
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,400
 So some dictionaries have an open section where anyone can submit a word, and it's like

174
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,960
 a holding pen for words, and then they take the words that they can find actual evidence

175
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
 for.

176
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
 Very few.

177
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
 And what a few of them, I imagine.

178
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
 Yeah, very few.

179
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,640
 Well, actually, they say about three-quarters fall into the disallowed sections, and they

180
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:33,120
 said that those are words that your friends have invented, obscenities, the names of people

181
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,680
 you dislike, and what you would like to do to them.

182
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,640
 But with me, all three of those are just one word.

183
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,840
 Can you share that, or is we'd have to edit that out?

184
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
 We'd have to edit that out.

185
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840
 We'd have to edit the out of the room.

186
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,000
 But the word that they took in August was "Ballbag."

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,640
 Oh, yeah.

188
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
 After Hurricane Ballbag.

189
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,840
 After Hurricane Ballbag, which was a storm in 2011, and all the papers, it was so annoying

190
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,280
 that all the papers call it Hurricane Ballbag for Ballbag, yeah, but with a W, Ballbag.

191
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,280
 And when Nigel Farage visited Scotland in 2013, he was greeted with cries of "Night you're

192
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
 you're a Ballbag."

193
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,880
 Was that a reference to the hurricane of political activity that he engendered to you?

194
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
 I can only assume that it is.

195
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,920
 I can't think of any other reason why people would compare him to a Ballbag, yeah.

196
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,520
 Is there a picture of him next to that word in the dictionary?

197
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
 I don't know.

198
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,040
 They don't really go for pictures in the dictionary, but maybe in the children's edition

199
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,520
 they'll have a picture of him.

200
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,240
 It's weird that that's a saying, actually, isn't it, if you look up stupid, there'd be a picture

201
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
 of you.

202
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,360
 Because, as you say, the dictionary is a book that does not go in for pictures at all.

203
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,080
 They should say, if you looked up stupid in the dictionary, there'd be a lengthy verbal

204
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
 description of you.

205
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,400
 However, if you were to look it up in the children's dictionary or the picture dictionary, there

206
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,240
 would be a picture of you.

207
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
 Can I just...

208
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
 Or in "pictionary."

209
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
 Sorry, it's still going.

210
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
 What is "pictionary"?

211
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
 That's a game, right?

212
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
 It's a game.

213
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
 Yeah.

214
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
 It's an ancient Roman game then.

215
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,960
 It's earlier than Pogs.

216
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,200
 Just on Scots dialects.

217
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,680
 So there was a sentence in 2011 which asked Scottish people if they spoke Scots.

218
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,640
 And there was a website that was set up to help people out with this in case they didn't

219
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,160
 know if they did, because it's dialects.

220
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
 A lot of Scottish people might speak a dialect, but think they're actually speaking just

221
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,480
 kind of bad English.

222
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,600
 And so there's now a website called "I Can" - A-Y-E-C-A-N, which is really fun.

223
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,000
 And it plays the dialects of all the different regions of Scotland, and if you can understand

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,680
 them, it shows that you speak that dialect.

225
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,680
 Does it also play bad English just in case that's what you speak?

226
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,840
 Yeah, that's actually become a Scottish dialect now in its own right.

227
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,600
 What they should do is put bad English at the top, and so you click on that, and it's bad

228
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,680
 English and you're like, "Okay, I definitely don't have any of the rest," rather than going

229
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,680
 through all of the dialects.

230
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,120
 All of the dialects get into the end and go, "No, it was bad English after all."

231
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,560
 I don't know if you go through all, because if you're from Glasgow for instance, it's

232
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,840
 very unlikely that you'll speak the 'Shetland' dialects unless you're in England.

233
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,160
 They spoke something very similar to Old Norse for a long time, didn't they?

234
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
 Yeah, Noun.

235
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,440
 Until only like two or three hundred years ago.

236
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
 Yeah.

237
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
 Yeah, it's clung on.

238
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,240
 Because it came because Norway owned Shetland, didn't it?

239
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,440
 What's clung on, sorry, is that the name of it?

240
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
 It clung on.

241
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
 Oh, it clung on.

242
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
 Sorry, that's just my bad diction.

243
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
 You've got bad English.

244
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
 I've got bad English.

245
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,480
 So I found another Scottish word, which is "glamour" is Scottish, which I didn't know.

246
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
 And...

247
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,800
 Because I've heard of that in English as well.

248
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
 Yeah.

249
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
 Well, we use it now.

250
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
 It's past onto us.

251
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 That's right.

252
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
 Yeah.

253
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,400
 But I used to just assume 'glamour' meant, you know, someone who looks very glamorous is

254
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,400
 someone who's dressed very well in high fashion.

255
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,840
 But the definition of 'glamour', at least the original definition is 'magic' enchantment

256
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,360
 spell.

257
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,640
 So whenever a magician says 'my glamorous assistant', he's actually saying 'my magical assistant'.

258
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
 Is that really true?

259
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
 Yeah.

260
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,120
 As in, that's why he says, "I don't know.

261
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,840
 I'm assuming that must be the origin of why not why not.

262
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,880
 That can't be the main origin of why all the traditions say 'my glamorous assistant'.

263
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
 No.

264
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,800
 'Plamour' meant something astonishing, like magical, and then it meant something beautiful,

265
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,880
 and then it was used by magicians, and then done made this connection.

266
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
 Yeah.

267
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
 So that's what it works.

268
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
 Okay, well, what a beautiful connection.

269
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
 That's what it's called.

270
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
 That's what it's called.

271
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,480
 They might be saying 'my magical assistant'.

272
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,080
 So the Collins English dictionary, they have a Scottish wing, and they recently added,

273
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,800
 so they have words of the year, which we've discussed on the TV show as well.

274
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
 So they added things like...

275
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
 What TV shows that?

276
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
 There's no such thing as the news.

277
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
 It's the BBC 2 TV show.

278
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
 When's that?

279
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
 It's on Wednesday night.

280
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 It's on BBC 2, after news night.

281
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
 Okay.

282
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
 They added words like 'neverendum'.

283
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
 I've heard of this.

284
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,800
 Which is just, you know, this debate about the referendum.

285
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,200
 I think that Bob Bagg was talking about the whole time.

286
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
 Yeah, exactly.

287
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,600
 That just keeps going on, and they've also added 'Nicolabilia'.

288
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
 Any guesses?

289
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
 Is it a lot of things that you collect that are made out of nickel?

290
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
 No.

291
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
 Not bad.

292
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
 I call the rage this year.

293
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
 James is desk, he's biding up.

294
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
 Is it like loose change?

295
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
 Because that's like nickels.

296
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
 No, think of the 'Nicola' bit of Nickelestogen.

297
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
 Nickelestogen.

298
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
 It's merchandise.

299
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
 She collects nickels.

300
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
 No.

301
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
 It's merchandise-feeding the face of Nickelestogen.

302
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
 Oh, really?

303
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
 And I'm unsure about how much this is used.

304
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
 I haven't found out my relatives.

305
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
 Right.

306
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
 And ask them.

307
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
 I've just got a couple more things on exclamations.

308
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
 So one that I use all the time is Holy Moly.

309
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,600
 And I assume that I got that from the early Batman series.

310
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
 Holy Moly Batman.

311
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
 So there's actually a Wikipedia article

312
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,600
 where they've listed every single Holy something that Robin has said.

313
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
 And there's hundreds of them.

314
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
 And I've just picked out a few.

315
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
 Holy bank balance.

316
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
 That's one.

317
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,600
 Holy contributing to the delinquency of miners.

318
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
 Batman.

319
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
 And holy priceless collection of Etruscan snoods.

320
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
 Batman.

321
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
 In context, they might make sense.

322
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
 I think it was plot point explaining.

323
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
 I think it was, I think, he was just trying to remind you

324
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
 that we're looking at Etruscan snoods here.

325
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
 Holy crobat, Batman.

326
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,600
 But weirdly, the one missing from the list, Holy Moly.

327
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
 Not on the list.

328
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
 Because it's a catchphrase that's owned by Captain Marvel.

329
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
 You were saying holy.

330
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
 That's what kind of a lot of ults are, aren't they?

331
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
 They're kind of things against the church.

332
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 Gosh means it's another way of saying God.

333
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
 Gagzooks.

334
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
 Gagzooks.

335
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
 Gagzooks.

336
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,600
 But when I was looking up gosh, I found out that people used to say

337
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
 Losh, which was like shot for Lord.

338
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
 Yeah.

339
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
 In the 18th century.

340
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
 Losh.

341
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
 Oh, that's pretty good.

342
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
 That is no.

343
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
 I'm not really like that.

344
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,600
 Just on Fuddleduddle, another explanation.

345
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
 That's got a more recent history.

346
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
 Do you know where that came from?

347
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
 Fuddleduddle.

348
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
 No.

349
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
 Yeah.

350
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 Fuddleduddle, that thing we say all the time to exclaim.

351
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
 That comes from Pierre Trudeau.

352
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 So you know Justin Trudeau's dad, who was Prime Minister of Canada in the 70s.

353
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
 Yeah.

354
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
 He was in a parliamentary debate when he was Prime Minister.

355
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
 And the opposition says something he didn't like.

356
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,600
 And he moused what the opposition then went out to journalists and complained,

357
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
 looked a lot like a word beginning with F, then a word beginning with O.

358
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
 So they said, what were you thinking when you mouled those two words?

359
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,600
 And he said, well, what's the nature of your thoughts, gentlemen?

360
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
 When you say Fuddleduddle.

361
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
 So he sort of claimed it was Fuddleduddle.

362
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,600
 And then that's caught on, in a way.

363
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
 They always fuck off.

364
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,600
 And then actually recently last year, Justin made a speech where he did admit

365
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,600
 that his dad hadn't, in fact, said Fuddleduddle.

366
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
 Right.

367
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
 Yeah, scandal.

368
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
 There was an Israeli guy.

369
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
 He was 90 years old.

370
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,600
 And he said, he was in the news about five, ten years ago saying that he invented

371
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 "Have a nice day."

372
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
 And he was like, I don't know what I was thinking.

373
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
 It just came into my head.

374
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 And I just said, have a nice day.

375
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
 And then before I knew, everyone was saying it.

376
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 Okay.

377
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
 It is time for fact number two.

378
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
 And that is Anna.

379
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,600
 My fact this week is that at least 61 species live in elephant footprints.

380
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
 That's so cool.

381
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
 It's so cool.

382
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
 Wow.

383
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
 So exclusively live in...

384
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 No.

385
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 So this is a paper that was published a couple of months ago.

386
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
 I read about it in Scientific American.

387
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,600
 And they've just studied the mini ecosystems that are elephant footprints.

388
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,600
 And they found 61 species in them.

389
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
 And that's where only studying a few.

390
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 So all these creatures are living in elephant footprints.

391
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,600
 But they make it their permanent habitat because they look to older footprints.

392
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,600
 And they found that they'd have much, many more animals in them.

393
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,600
 And that's because dead leaves have fallen into them and things like that.

394
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
 So it's become a bit like richer environment for them.

395
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
 But yeah, you get tadpoles in them.

396
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
 So moving around, you get mites, mayflies, leeches...

397
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
 So none of the big hitters.

398
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
 You don't get any...

399
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
 They don't get dolphins in there.

400
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,600
 Oh yeah, no. Cheaterly, they can hold 200 litres of water.

401
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
 Isn't that amazing?

402
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 But...

403
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
 Yeah, maybe a liter is less than we think it is.

404
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
 Yeah, how much...

405
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
 Oh, well, it's an African liter, which is five million.

406
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
 No, I don't know.

407
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
 I think it's...

408
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
 Yeah.

409
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
 If you had to express that in something that I don't understand...

410
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
 It would be nearly 400 points.

411
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
 Wow.

412
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
 In one footprint.

413
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
 Yeah, I think that's...

414
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
 I was so skeptical.

415
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,600
 But I guess in mud, then they'll sink very deep, weren't they?

416
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
 Yes.

417
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
 Does that count as a footprint, then?

418
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
 If, like, your leg is in...

419
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
 You think it's a leg print.

420
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
 That's a leg print.

421
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,600
 It's a full elephant print, if he just gets completely stuck in.

422
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
 And the other thing I do is they hop from footprint to footprint.

423
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
 Well, elephant...

424
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 No!

425
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
 I read they can't even jump.

426
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
 They call them stepping stone habitats.

427
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
 And apparently...

428
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
 Because during the dry season, it's really important, for animals.

429
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
 Yeah, yeah.

430
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
 And if the elephants weren't walking through this area,

431
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
 they would disappear during the dry season.

432
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 And other species would not be able to live in these areas.

433
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
 Wow.

434
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,600
 But I mean, this raises more cause for concern at elephant poaching, obviously,

435
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
 because it looks like these elephant footprints are preserving a lot of these creatures.

436
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
 Massive housing crisis.

437
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
 Yeah, exactly.

438
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
 Yeah.

439
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
 I mean, I was already quite concerned about elephant poaching.

440
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
 But now I hear that tadpoles are involved.

441
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
 I'm breaking it.

442
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
 Well, the thing is, like, with all this kind of thing,

443
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
 the elephants, you can be concerned about the elephants.

444
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,600
 But actually, it's the fact that they're top, you know, species in an ecosystem.

445
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
 And actually, it is.

446
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
 There's hundreds and hundreds of different species that rely on them.

447
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
 So, like, if you want to save an elephant,

448
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 it's mostly the other animals you should be worried about, really.

449
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 Yeah, yeah.

450
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
 They don't look as cool as an elephant, do they?

451
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
 It's true.

452
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
 But also, is it not that they loads of plants that they disperse the seeds?

453
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
 Yeah.

454
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
 They really do.

455
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
 Who do you sorry?

456
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
 Elephants.

457
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
 So people got, they're called ecological engineers,

458
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,600
 because they properly create habitats for other animals to live in,

459
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
 don't they?

460
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
 By knocking down all the trees and seed dispersal.

461
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
 They're good for lions.

462
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
 Right.

463
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,600
 Because they knock down trees as they move along and they convert forest to scrubland,

464
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
 which means you get smaller animals living in the scrubland,

465
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,600
 which means that lions prey on the smaller animals.

466
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
 So not so good for the smaller animals, then?

467
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
 No, but good for the lions.

468
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
 Yeah.

469
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,600
 And apparently, they have 96 species of seed a day on average in their poo,

470
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
 which they disperse across the areas they're moving through.

471
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
 They're like large insects, really, aren't they, spreading?

472
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
 They're like big bees.

473
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
 No.

474
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 Spreading seeds.

475
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
 They are.

476
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
 They're almost like pollinators.

477
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
 They're so unlike insects.

478
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
 They spread the seed of plants.

479
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
 I mean, that one incredibly specific respect, they're quite like us.

480
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
 And they've got six legs, is that right?

481
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,600
 So just to get my head around it, these animals, they're most found there.

482
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
 Where else would they live if not in the footprints?

483
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
 In puns and stuff.

484
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
 So there are fewer puns around, especially in the dry season.

485
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
 Yeah.

486
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,600
 So they'll find this kind of footprint, which has turned into a pond,

487
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
 and they'll live there.

488
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
 If it wasn't there, they'd have to try and find another pond.

489
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
 But the more puns there are, the more places they can live,

490
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
 and the better their species will do.

491
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
 Yeah.

492
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
 Okay.

493
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
 I got it now.

494
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
 Do you know one amazing use for elephant poo?

495
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
 If you're dying of thirst.

496
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
 Oh, no.

497
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
 Yes.

498
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
 You can squeeze it together and wring a few drops of water out of it.

499
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
 Yeah.

500
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
 Baragrills does that, doesn't he?

501
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
 I think he did it with camel poo, as opposed to elephant poo.

502
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,600
 Maybe it was elephant poo, but you can see footage of that.

503
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
 There's not much bacteria in there.

504
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
 Botswana gets 650,000 kilos of elephant droppings.

505
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
 That's Botswana alone every day.

506
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
 Wow.

507
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
 So much.

508
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
 Yeah.

509
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
 They pop it up.

510
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
 It is a lot.

511
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
 No one's denying it.

512
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
 All right, but I'm waiting for one of you to try to deny it.

513
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
 It's not that much.

514
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
 It is that much.

515
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:08,600
 So I was looking into other odd places that you find species living in.

516
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
 Okay.

517
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
 That aren't necessarily natural to their habitat.

518
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:20,600
 There's researchers have been looking in this specific African cave because they found out about this group of crocodiles who live in this cave.

519
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
 And it's really rare because they're out of sunlight for most of the time.

520
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
 They feed off bats that live in the cave and so on.

521
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,600
 Yeah, they have just a totally different eating habit.

522
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 The thing is they do go out though.

523
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
 So they're not going to go blind.

524
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
 They're not going to adapt to nighttime.

525
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
 Because they're going to need the heat because they don't make their own heat.

526
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
 Yeah, exactly.

527
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
 But they do spend a lot of time there.

528
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:48,600
 And one thing they notice, they did think for a while, at least to begin with, like, wow, I wonder if this is a completely different species or subspecies of crocodile because it was orange.

529
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
 And they were like, what's going on here?

530
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:58,600
 And it turns out that because of the water that they're in in the caves, there's so much bat poo that goes into the water that it's colored the crocodiles into a different color.

531
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
 So they come out and they're like, whoa, what's this weird color?

532
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
 And it's just batshit.

533
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,600
 Do you think that's where the phrase batshit crazy comes from?

534
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,600
 Because they look so crazy. They've turned orange and the other crocodiles are going, you look batshit crazy.

535
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
 It could be, yeah.

536
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
 I don't think so.

537
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,600
 There's actually this other amazing cave that has its own ecosystem, which I found out about.

538
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 So this is called the Sondoun Cave in Vietnam, apologies if I've mispronounced that.

539
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,600
 This is the world's largest cave and it was discovered in 2009 by a British guy.

540
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,600
 So that's what when it's reported it was discovered, even though I think the people in Vietnam knew about it.

541
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,600
 But it's this huge cave, so it has a jungle in it if you go into it.

542
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
 So it's got a jungle with, you should honestly look up, look up pictures of this place.

543
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
 It's extraordinary.

544
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
 The trees are fun.

545
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,600
 And inside the jungle there's a desert.

546
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
 Inside that there's an ocean.

547
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
 Why won't you believe me?

548
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
 The bottom is another massive cave.

549
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
 The Russian doll of caves.

550
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,600
 There's a jungle with trees that are 30 metres tall.

551
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
 It has its own river.

552
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,600
 It's got a centre parts.

553
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,600
 And all these new species have been found in it anyway.

554
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 So yeah, honestly look up pictures of it.

555
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,600
 So they found a new type of gecko, a tree frog, a new type of striped hair.

556
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,600
 Living inside this cave completely underground.

557
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,600
 The main cabin of it is so big it has its own climate, so it has rain clouds.

558
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,600
 Which I imagine means it actually rains inside this huge cave.

559
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
 Where is this again?

560
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
 It's in Vietnam.

561
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
 Can I just say one last thing?

562
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
 Yes, sure.

563
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,600
 As I read this the other day, I haven't got the full details here.

564
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,600
 But there's a species of crab and they're polygamous.

565
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,600
 So the males have sex with loads of different females and vice versa.

566
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:44,600
 If these crabs find a turtle shell with just the right gap between the shell and the bottom of the turtle

567
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,600
 that will fit two crabs in, then a male and a female crab will go and live inside the turtle shell

568
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,600
 and they'll have a monogamous relationship.

569
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
 And they won't have sex with anyone else, they'll just live there.

570
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
 But anywhere else they live, they'll have loads of partners.

571
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
 But if they find that little niche, then they'll kind of stay together.

572
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
 It's like a suburb.

573
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:08,600
 It's right if you move into the perfect house, then your relationship can be repaired.

574
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 Absolutely, yeah.

575
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
 It's a lesson here.

576
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:18,600
 Okay, it is time to move on to fact number three.

577
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
 And that is my fact.

578
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,600
 My fact this week is that the original edition of Wisden's Cricketer's Almanac

579
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,600
 was 112 pages long and because the author wasn't sure what to put in it,

580
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,600
 was padded out with accounts of the trial of King Charles I.

581
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,600
 So if you don't know what this book is, this is published annually

582
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
 and it is the ultimate Cricketer's book.

583
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,600
 And the current edition, the 2016 edition, is over 1,500 pages long.

584
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
 So it's a huge book, it has nothing but cricket.

585
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,600
 But the very first edition, Wisden was like, I don't have enough cricket to put in this.

586
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
 But I need to make it worth buying.

587
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
 So he added the accounts of the trial from King Charles of Earth.

588
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,600
 He also put in battles of the English Civil War and also Britain's canals,

589
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
 the size of them and length.

590
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
 And also the rules of quiting.

591
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
 Yeah, what is that?

592
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,600
 Quiting is where you, I think you have a quite is like kind of a circular thing,

593
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,600
 a bit like a horseshoe and you throw it to a stick and it goes around the stick.

594
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
 And if you get it around the stick, you get points.

595
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
 It's based on pub garden games, quits.

596
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,600
 We should actually not only explain what quiting is but probably for our American explain what cricket is.

597
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
 I think so.

598
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
 It's like baseball on the a lot slower.

599
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
 That'll do it.

600
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
 And there are tea breaks.

601
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
 Yeah.

602
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
 And I still find that insane.

603
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
 So I didn't know that because I didn't really follow cricket.

604
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,600
 But halfway through a day of playing cricket, they all stop to have cups of tea.

605
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
 No, you have tea as in food.

606
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
 You would have like sandwiches and stuff.

607
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
 Yeah, to see to English people who know about cricket,

608
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
 that seems like the most normal thing in the world.

609
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
 Yeah.

610
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
 I mean, you go for fun.

611
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
 I mean, I should know that in theory.

612
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
 Yeah.

613
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
 Well, actually, do Australia play cricket anymore?

614
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
 You can.

615
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
 Out.

616
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,600
 Interesting fact about the Cricketers Almanac.

617
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
 Yeah.

618
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
 Really interesting fact.

619
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
 Get ready.

620
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
 Hold on to your seats.

621
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,600
 So it's been published every year since 1864.

622
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
 And for the first six years, it was published.

623
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
 It was Wiston's Cricketers Almanac.

624
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
 But for the subsequent however many years,

625
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,600
 it's been Wiston's Cricketers Almanac.

626
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
 With the apostrophe on the other side of the S.

627
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
 Which S, Wiston's or Cricketers.

628
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
 Cricketers.

629
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
 Yeah, but there's only ever been one Wiston.

630
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,600
 So it's always been from one Wiston, but originally it was for only one Cricketer.

631
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
 It was for one Cricketer for the first six years.

632
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
 It was just aimed at one Cricketer.

633
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
 No one knows if that Cricketer is.

634
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
 But John Wiston, the founder, was quite an interesting guy.

635
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 He was a Cricketer.

636
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
 And his nickname was The Little Wonder.

637
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
 Because he was five foot nothing.

638
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
 And he weighed seven stone when he started his career.

639
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
 And he was tiny.

640
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,600
 And yet in one match in 1850 he bowled out all ten of the opposite team in a single innings.

641
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 Which I think it's written online that this is the only time that's ever happened in a first class match.

642
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,600
 So they were all bowled out as in he hit the stunts rather than then being caught out or, you know, got out in another way.

643
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
 There are about ten ways you can be caught up.

644
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
 That's great.

645
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
 Yeah.

646
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
 Well done here.

647
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,600
 On page 657 of the year 2000 edition.

648
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,600
 The Leicester Spinball and Matthew Brimson exposed himself.

649
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
 And nobody noticed at the time.

650
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
 And it went into the edition.

651
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,600
 And then about six days after it had been published, someone wrote in and said, this guy's middle stump is in this picture.

652
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
 Matthew Engel, who was editor at the time, wrote about this.

653
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,600
 And he said, in the 2000 Leicestershire photo, one of their most obscure players was laughing.

654
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,600
 Oh, having chosen to expose himself to the camera, his only contribution to Cricketer history.

655
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,600
 Oh, the Leicestershire squad was large.

656
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,600
 The page was small, so was our editorial team, and so was the appendage.

657
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,600
 Okay, this guy got slammed by the said.

658
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 Yeah, absolutely.

659
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
 It is kind of embarrassing that nobody noticed for a week.

660
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
 Yeah.

661
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,600
 And then he was asked to apologise and he didn't.

662
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,600
 And apparently he said, well, he said it was the editor's fault because they should have spotted it.

663
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,600
 And Engel said, oh, do you think we need to employ a full-time penis spotter then?

664
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,600
 So, did you know the first Cricket Balls were rolled along the ground?

665
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
 That was the first way you bowled and Cricket.

666
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
 Really?

667
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
 And this is very early, yeah.

668
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
 So it was more like croquet.

669
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
 Kind of, yeah.

670
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
 Right.

671
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
 Except you were allowed to roll the ball along the ground.

672
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,600
 And the idea being that it was still trying to hit stumps behind.

673
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
 Yeah, yeah.

674
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,600
 So, is it French Cricket where you throw very, very low?

675
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
 You aim for someone's legs.

676
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

677
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
 Cricket on their own, basically.

678
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
 So instead of having wickets that you aim for, you aim for their legs.

679
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
 Yeah.

680
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
 So, and this is very exciting.

681
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,600
 So one of the first bowlers to pitch was a guy called Edward Lumpy Stevens.

682
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
 Lumpy was his nickname.

683
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
 And there's a book.

684
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
 He got that nickname after he exposed himself.

685
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
 There's a book called the author's 11.

686
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,600
 And it says, the name Lumpy may have come either from his ability to pitch the ball on any protrusion on the pitch.

687
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,600
 Or his fondness for eating a whole apple pie at a time.

688
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,600
 Yeah.

689
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:07,600
 You know, in all the kind of, if you read, you know, amazing things about Wisden's Cricket as Almanac.

690
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,600
 One of the claims they make is that both PG Woodhouse got the name Jeaves from Wisden Cricket as Almanac.

691
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,600
 And Sherlock Holmes was named after a Cricket as well.

692
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,600
 Conan Doyle used to read Wisden's Cricket as Almanac.

693
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
 I can't see any evidence that that's true though.

694
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
 So I think that's one of those myths that's been going around.

695
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
 That's where they got them.

696
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,600
 Because you do have quotes from PG Woodhouse saying that he knew Jeaves the Cricketer and he was a big fan of his.

697
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
 And that's where the name came from.

698
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,600
 So presumably he didn't need to discover that in a book.

699
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
 He already knew that.

700
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:42,600
 That reminds me that Blowfelt, the bad guy in James Bond is named after Henry Blowfelt's father.

701
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
 Oh, yes.

702
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
 The family.

703
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
 Who is a Cricket commentator?

704
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
 Yeah, Henry Blowfelt's a Cricket commentator.

705
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,600
 We met him last year. He came on our radio show Museum of Curiosity.

706
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:02,600
 And he told this story about how In Fleming was in a gentleman's club in London and was looking through the members list and saw Blowfelt's father in there and decided to name him after that.

707
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
 Wow.

708
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
 Was there beef between them?

709
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
 No, I don't think so.

710
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,600
 Because he named Goldfinger after the architect Goldfinger who he didn't like at all.

711
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
 And he tried to sue him, didn't he?

712
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
 Like he was very Goldfinger tried to sue him.

713
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
 Yeah, Goldfinger was very angry about that.

714
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
 Yeah.

715
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,600
 And the most famous copy of Wisden is a 1939 edition belonging to EW Swanton.

716
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,600
 He was a Cricket writer and then he was taken prisoner by the Japanese in the war.

717
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,600
 And it was so popular with all the other prisoners of war that everyone used to borrow it.

718
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,600
 And he had to turn it into like a library book so people could take it at different times.

719
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,600
 And then it became really, really thumbed through.

720
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,600
 It was stamped not subversive by the Japanese.

721
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:47,600
 And then it was printed in the book, and it was printed in the book, and it was printed in the book.

 And it was printed in the book.

965
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,600
 And the auction said, the passer of this remarkable object

966
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
 is unknown and all this, you know, stuff.

967
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
 But it came from a place called the Wilkes Formation,

968
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
 which is where there was a swamp.

969
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,600
 And there is a theory that actually it's plant material

970
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,600
 and lumps of mineral, because sometimes things get--

971
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
 lumps of ash get turned into clay.

972
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
 And they get squeezed through not holes in trees.

973
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,600
 I mean, how is-- it's not that much different than a poo, is it?

974
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
 Exactly.

975
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
 It's basically--

976
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
 Yeah, it's basically being pushed through like a tube

977
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
 or toothpaste.

978
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
 So there is a theory that that's that.

979
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,600
 But you'd have to cut it in two to take a slice,

980
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
 because there'll be organic material in there

981
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
 if it isn't covered in.

982
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,600
 I found a really good website called The Poozyum.

983
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
 Did you guys see that?

984
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
 No.

985
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
 Did no one see it?

986
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
 I've seen The Poozyum.

987
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
 Isn't it great?

988
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
 I didn't look at the website I saw it referred to.

989
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
 And I think that was a funny name.

990
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
 Exactly.

991
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
 So it puts you off to look at it, because you think this is a silly name.

992
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
 It's not going to be good.

993
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
 This is a guy who much like the person you've just said

994
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
 with the largest collection has dedicated his life

995
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,600
 to understanding and cataloging and reporting on copper lights.

996
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
 And it's fantastic.

997
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
 It's an incredible website.

998
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
 It's got pictures.

999
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
 It's got all the latest news stories.

1000
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,600
 I just honestly highly recommend Poozyum.

1001
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,600
 Give us an example of a brilliant Poozyum news story.

1002
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
 What?

1003
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
 He was telling you how you can make your own.

1004
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
 I know how to take things.

1005
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,600
 I've been dedicating my life to making my own.

1006
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,600
 How you can make your own poo fossil in time.

1007
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,600
 So he says you, and this was done in an interview

1008
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,600
 that he reposted on his own site by Jason Rosenfeld

1009
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
 on Silicon Exit, which is a website.

1010
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
 Did this great interview with him?

1011
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,600
 So he said that the way that you can make your own copper light

1012
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,600
 is that you start off by eating a bunch of corn and peanuts

1013
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
 every few days.

1014
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
 And that will give the copper light interesting inclusions

1015
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
 and make it worth more money when someone finds it

1016
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
 a special treasure.

1017
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,600
 Because that's easier to tell if something is genuinely poo

1018
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
 because it has little bits sticking out of it of insects

1019
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
 or whatever.

1020
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,600
 That helps them identify it.

1021
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
 And then you dig it into a very deep hole

1022
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
 and then put the soil over immediately.

1023
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
 So nothing gets to it.

1024
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
 That in theory is how you make your own fossil poo

1025
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
 if someone wants to start going on that.

1026
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
 It's an incredibly weird thing to do.

1027
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
 Or you put in a lake.

1028
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
 How come?

1029
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
 It sinks through the water, right?

1030
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
 And it gets to the bottom.

1031
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
 And there's much less oxygen down there for it

1032
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
 for bacteria to eat it.

1033
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
 So the hope is that over time,

1034
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,600
 anaerobic bacteria gradually replace the matter with minerals.

1035
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
 But for best results, you have to poo in the lake.

1036
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
 You have to get in the lake.

1037
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
 Do the poo.

1038
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
 Get out of the lake.

1039
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
 OK.

1040
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,600
 I mean, there are other ways to make your mark on this Earth.

1041
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,600
 It's very unreliable because, you know,

1042
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,600
 the world would be covered in poo if they all survived.

1043
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,600
 So in fact, it's a really valuable substance, right?

1044
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,600
 Because it used to be important as fertilizer, copper light.

1045
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
 And so when they discovered this,

1046
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
 then it became something that people mined.

1047
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
 And there are various places in the UK

1048
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,600
 where copper light mining was an important industry.

1049
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
 So one of the main centers of this

1050
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
 was a place called Shillington in Bedfordshire.

1051
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
 And this was in the mid-19th century.

1052
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,600
 It's population doubled because loads of people flocked.

1053
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
 It was a bit like the gold rush.

1054
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,600
 It was the UK equivalent of the gold rush.

1055
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
 People flocked.

1056
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
 As ever, America's always better, isn't it?

1057
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,600
 We've had a third rush, America.

1058
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
 If you go to Bedfordshire,

1059
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
 all the streets are paved with chairs.

1060
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,600
 So the brilliant thing about this place

1061
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
 is that there's big boost to the local economy.

1062
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
 And it was actually a bit of a problem

1063
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600
 because these pubs multiplied

1064
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,600
 because copper light miners were paid--

1065
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
 They desperately to drink away the memories

1066
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
 of what they spend their day doing.

1067
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,600
 [LAUGHTER]

1068
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
 Well, they had quite a lot of fights.

1069
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
 So there was tension and everything.

1070
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
 I mean, exactly at the gold rush.

1071
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
 Can I just say, in the gold rush,

1072
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
 people used to go to the pubs and pay for their drinks

1073
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
 with little bits of gold that they found.

1074
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
 Yeah.

1075
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
 People used to just go with a--

1076
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
 They're like, this isn't an ancient one.

1077
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
 Yeah.

1078
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
 Forgeries from half an hour ago.

1079
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
 [LAUGHTER]

1080
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,600
 The great thing about this place is it's called Shillington.

1081
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
 Its name has actually changed in the 1880s,

1082
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
 because it was worried it was going to offend Queen Victoria,

1083
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
 because it was called Shillington.

1084
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
 Yeah, really?

1085
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
 Yeah.

1086
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,600
 Shillington was the heart of ship mining.

1087
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
 Wow.

1088
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
 That's amazing.

1089
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
 Hello to anyone living in Shillington.

1090
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
 Yeah.

1091
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
 He's learning that for the first time.

1092
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
 Is that coincidence?

1093
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
 It's coincidence.

1094
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
 Like glamorous assistant.

1095
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
 Like it's a total coincidence?

1096
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
 It's coincidence.

1097
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
 Wow.

1098
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,600
 They only discovered the third seam in the mid-19th century.

1099
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
 And it had been around for hundreds of years before that.

1100
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
 They called it the "treacle mines."

1101
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
 To that.

1102
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:29,600
 Likely.

1103
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
 Yeah, they used to, yeah.

1104
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
 That's the worst euphemism I've ever had ever had ever had ever had.

1105
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
 Horrible.

1106
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,600
 It's weird that there's a seam, isn't it?

1107
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
 You would think that they'd be scattered fairly evenly.

1108
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,600
 But actually, it all comes from a time when the south of England was covered

1109
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,600
 in hundreds of meters of water flooded, and all the land animals died.

1110
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
 So there's a lot remaining from that period.

1111
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
 Yeah.

1112
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
 Yeah.

1113
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
 So Andy, the whole idea of copper light selling more

1114
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
 if it looks actually like a poo.

1115
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,600
 I was reading, again, in this interview from Pusium,

1116
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,600
 that the reason that that's so precious is actually most fossilized poo.

1117
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,600
 The reason it doesn't retain the shape of a poo is that most animals will do it from a height, obviously.

1118
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,600
 And then it experiences what he calls the splatter effect.

1119
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,600
 So it's very hard to get a poo-shaped fossil because most of it has splattered once it hits the ground.

1120
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
 Get in the lake.

1121
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
 Get in the lake as the answer, yeah.

1122
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
 What?

1123
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
 Slow it down on the descent.

1124
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
 Absolutely, yeah.

1125
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
 Very good.

1126
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
 You say they're so precious.

1127
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:26,600
 This guy, George Transon, his most valuable copper light is called precious.

1128
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,600
 Just to make him a tiny bit more creepy, I did a business inquiry.

1129
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
 No.

1130
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:38,600
 I wonder because the splatter effect thing I just said was he's talking literally about precious in this sentence.

1131
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
 Is this the same guy?

1132
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
 Does he run Pusium?

1133
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
 I don't know.

1134
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,600
 I think that your guy runs the Pusium.

1135
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,600
 I've just checked it.

1136
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
 That's a great sight.

1137
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
 The guy knows what he's talking about.

1138
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
 Sure does.

1139
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:58,600
 Something related to copper lights are regurgitolites, which is, well, what do you think?

1140
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
 Fossilized vomit?

1141
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
 Correct.

1142
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
 Yeah.

1143
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,600
 Really good because often this will be something.

1144
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,600
 If you've got fossilized poo and you can see what someone's eaten, but it's obviously been through the digestive system.

1145
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,600
 If it's fossilized vomit, then obviously not been quite as far through the digestive system.

1146
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,600
 So you can see a lot better what these things have eaten.

1147
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,600
 So there was a bit of vomit cuffed up by an X-Fiasaur, 160 million years ago.

1148
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,600
 And it's still got little bits of the, like, ammonites and stuff that were in there.

1149
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
 That's amazing.

1150
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
 It's really cool.

1151
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,600
 It's so shame for the X-Fiasaur who vomited and thought, "God, I hope no one remembers this moment."

1152
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
 160 million years later.

1153
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
 There's still reminiscing.

1154
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
 There's an even more embarrassing thing.

1155
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,600
 We think we have a 300 year old piece of Bishop's excrement.

1156
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
 Wow.

1157
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
 This is in the news this week.

1158
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
 So there's a Danish Bishop.

1159
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
 It's in the news.

1160
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
 I didn't see him possessing.

1161
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
 I don't think it's credible.

1162
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,600
 There's a Danish Bishop called Jens Bircherod.

1163
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,600
 And he lived in a city called Alborg until 1708.

1164
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,600
 And 80 years ago, archaeologists found in his private mid and a lump of stuff.

1165
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
 And now it's been analysed.

1166
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
 And they think it's Bishop's poo.

1167
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
 It could be the Bishop's wife.

1168
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
 But it's God.

1169
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
 I'm very dumb.

1170
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:17,600
 18th century Denmark was a very liberal place.

1171
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,600
 No, one professor said this is a way of making history through the back door.

1172
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,600
 The way the tree called mine.

1173
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,600
 And they're going to put it probably in the local museum.

1174
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
 But it's so embarrassing.

1175
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
 No, I think it's good to be proud of it.

1176
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,600
 So there's a village called Bassingborn, hello to those in Bassingborn as well,

1177
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
 which was another home of coprolite mining.

1178
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,600
 And they wanted to erect a statue as a monument to their village's great history in 2005.

1179
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
 And there were some contenders.

1180
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
 So they could have had a heron.

1181
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
 There were lots of beautiful herons there.

1182
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,600
 They thought about having a Second World War bomber because they had a strong Second World War history.

1183
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
 And then one of the suggestions was a large poo.

1184
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
 And the village voted and they voted for the poo.

1185
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:05,600
 So they've got, don't let the public vote on things.

1186
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
 Okay, that's it.

1187
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
 That's all of our facts.

1188
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
