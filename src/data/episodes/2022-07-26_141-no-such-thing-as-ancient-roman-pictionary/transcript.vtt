00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 [upbeat music]

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:19.960
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.840
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.760
 My name is Dan Triber, and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.200
 Aniches Inski, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.540
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, James

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 Harkin.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.480
 Okay, my fact this week is that the word "wow" was popular in Scotland for 400 years before

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.120
 it caught on in the rest of the English-speaking world.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.200
 You were so waiting for one of those together, weren't you?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 Oh, hang on.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.200
 Wow.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 Wow.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.400
 You're in the right place, and yeah, isn't that crazy?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.440
 It's first use, 1513, this is according to the Oxford English Dictionary, in a translation

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.640
 of the "Need" by G Douglas, whoever that was.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.400
 Was it in the original author, Virgil?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 Yeah.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.400
 You're right.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.080
 But G Douglas was a Scottish person, and he said out on their 100-spirits, "Wow,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.120
 thou crayous."

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.680
 And then the first time it gets used really in the English-speaking world is about the 1890s,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.320
 and Burns uses it, and a few other Scottish writers use it as well.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.680
 And it was in that context, it's meant as an exclamation.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 It looks like it doesn't it?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.680
 "Wow, thou crayous."

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 Yeah.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.680
 You're crying.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 Wow.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 Yeah.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 So why was Scottish people keeping it to themselves?

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.680
 Like a secret for 400 years?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.920
 Maybe the only exciting things that happened in the world were all in Scotland.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 That's true.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.080
 They were ahead with inventions and the enlightenment.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.080
 There was much more to say "wow" to.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080
 That's true.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080
 And there was necessarily elsewhere.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 Yeah.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.320
 So, yeah, Andy brings up a good point.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.520
 How is it that we must have been, people were communicating, obviously, from Scotland and

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.800
 England and Ireland and further places, would they have been saying it to their face?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 Do we know?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 Or?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.920
 So you think that when the English went back down South, they go, "Wow, what a bunch of

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 minutes."

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.360
 "Wow, thank God he's gone."

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.360
 Well, we don't know.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.720
 Basically, this is, as with all of these citations, this is the evidence that we have.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.160
 So the only evidence that we have that it was spoken by anyone or written by anyone was

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.360
 in Scotland.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.640
 And then when the evidence for it being spoken in England and the rest of the world comes

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.640
 in, that's all later on.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.640
 Okay.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.880
 But it seems like they were deliberately keeping it secret for everyone, I guess.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.080
 As soon as an English person comes along, they will have an agreement to shut up.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.920
 Do you know another very old Scottish word, first used in Scotland, is "boot."

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.920
 Really?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.920
 "Boo."

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920
 "Boo."

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.920
 Same meaning?

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.520
 Yeah, it's a word that's used in the north of Scotland to frighten crying children.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.520
 Oh, no.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.520
 So they were already frightened and crying?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.200
 But does that frighten them out of their tears?

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.600
 It does sometimes with children, doesn't it?

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.600
 I've tried it.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 Does it?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 Yeah, just on rounds.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.600
 You do not sometimes make it worse.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.600
 I think it's 50/50.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.880
 It's definitely worth a try though.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.880
 It's quite fun.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.480
 But then you might try it like eight times, and by then it's like, you know, you do it once

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.080
 and it gets worse, and then you do it again, thinking, "Oh, I'll bring it back to the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.080
 last time."

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.080
 It just gets worse again.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.080
 It's a slippery slope.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.080
 It feels like ink.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.360
 But so another early reference this might give more of a guide to what context it was

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.000
 using was used by Sir Walter Scott in 1830, and he used to write papers on the esoteric,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 on the paranormal.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.360
 I had no idea about that.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.320
 So he wrote a paper on, it was called "Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft," and that

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.480
 was from 1830, and the sentence he had in it was, "We start and are afraid when we hear

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.400
 one cry, boo," but he's spelled it B-O-H.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.880
 So sorry, is he claiming that ghost shout boo?

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.680
 Is that where we've got the original idea that ridiculous ghost shout boo?

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.680
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680
 I guess so.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680
 Ghost go boo.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.920
 In comics, they say boo.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.920
 They say boo.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.920
 Do they?

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.920
 Yeah.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.920
 It depends on the kind of days.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.920
 It's a lot like Scottish dialects.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.600
 I think different ghosts from different places have the different ways of speaking, don't

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 they?

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600
 Yeah.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600
 Different pronunciations.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.600
 Yeah.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.760
 So the Scottish also have, Scott has 421 words for snow, which is, so I think a lot of people

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.160
 used to say that Scandinavian had thousands of words for snow.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.800
 They were like this, yeah.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.920
 So they've got these amazing words for snow, and this is taken from all the Scottish dialects.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.320
 So there are a lot of Scottish dialects from all around the country, and that's different

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.840
 to Gallic.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.280
 And there was a study done a couple of years ago by a Scottish, the Soros compiler that

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.760
 found they have words, "a specific to snow," like, "sneazle," which is to begin to rain

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760
 or snow.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.000
 "Skelf" is a large snowflake.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.400
 "Fuctor" is to fall lightly and come down in odd flakes, "Fuctor," it's really "Fuctoring"

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.400
 out there.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400
 That sounds very Germanic.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.400
 Germanic.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.400
 Fuctor.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.400
 No.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.720
 It does a bit, but it also sounds a bit Scottish, and it obviously is a Germanic language.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.880
 The thing with the Eskimos, I think, is that you could technically say that they do have

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.320
 100 words for snow, but the way it is is they have one or two or maybe four or five roots,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.680
 which kind of means snow, and then the rest of them, you can just put like a prefix or a suffix

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.880
 after it to make another word, which means this type of snow, or this type of snow.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.800
 So it's snowing a bit, or it's snowing a lot, or 98 other variations.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.800
 We would, it counts heavy snow and light snow, and you know, "Fuctor" snow, all this

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.120
 word for thing.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.000
 Just in this study that they did, the Soros, they also looked at words that Scottish people

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.600
 have for sport.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.240
 They figured there'd be a lot of sporting words as well.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.600
 And they assumed that football would have the most words they used to refer to it, because

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.600
 football's popular sport.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.120
 And actually, it turns out that the sport of marbles has many more words in its way.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.920
 That is more of a football.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.920
 Yeah, so marbles has things like, it had 369 different items of vocabulary linked to it

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.920
 in Scotland.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.920
 Have you got me?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.920
 Yeah.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.080
 There's "Runtit", which is having lost all of one's marbles to one's opponent.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.360
 There's a "neave", which is a method of cheating and delivering the shot by advancing

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.360
 the hand too far.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.160
 I remember having that done to me when I was a kid.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160
 Wow.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.240
 So marbles actually are more popular in Scotland than football in some ways.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.240
 And are these words from Scottish dialects or are they "gaylequads"?

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.400
 They're words from Scottish dialects, and I think you mean "galic".

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400
 I think I mean "gayle".

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400
 Oh my god.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.200
 Guys, we've just spent the last 15 minutes before this podcast arguing about this.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200
 Yeah.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.800
 That was an act of war that Andy just pulled out there.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.440
 All I'm saying is what my glass we didn't father has said, and now I think of it, I'm

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.960
 not certain whether he said "galic" or "gaylec", but I'm pretty sure it was "gaylec".

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.960
 I know.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.960
 Please write in.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.960
 In your hundreds.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960
 Sorry.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.760
 Is Marbles competitive on, like, is it, is it, is it competitive?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.440
 No, but as in like, you know how we have darts on TV here?

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.080
 Is there marbles on TV in Scotland?

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080
 Yeah, the Marbles channel.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.080
 You're kidding.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.080
 Are you working?

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.080
 I am.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.080
 I'm kidding, yeah.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.880
 No, I think it's just like an old-fashioned game, isn't it like, for instance, Skittles or

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880
 something like that?

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.880
 Yeah.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.880
 It's not one.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880
 It's a bit more old-fashioned than parks.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.920
 All of them parks, parks go back to the Romans.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.240
 The Romans had 500 different words to describe parks, didn't they?

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.360
 So there is another word, which Millens Open Dictionary took in August.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.400
 So some dictionaries have an open section where anyone can submit a word, and it's like

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.960
 a holding pen for words, and then they take the words that they can find actual evidence

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.960
 for.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.960
 Very few.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960
 And what a few of them, I imagine.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.960
 Yeah, very few.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.640
 Well, actually, they say about three-quarters fall into the disallowed sections, and they

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.120
 said that those are words that your friends have invented, obscenities, the names of people

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.680
 you dislike, and what you would like to do to them.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.640
 But with me, all three of those are just one word.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.840
 Can you share that, or is we'd have to edit that out?

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840
 We'd have to edit that out.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.840
 We'd have to edit the out of the room.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.000
 But the word that they took in August was "Ballbag."

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.640
 After Hurricane Ballbag.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.840
 After Hurricane Ballbag, which was a storm in 2011, and all the papers, it was so annoying

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.280
 that all the papers call it Hurricane Ballbag for Ballbag, yeah, but with a W, Ballbag.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.280
 And when Nigel Farage visited Scotland in 2013, he was greeted with cries of "Night you're

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.280
 you're a Ballbag."

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.880
 Was that a reference to the hurricane of political activity that he engendered to you?

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.880
 I can only assume that it is.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.920
 I can't think of any other reason why people would compare him to a Ballbag, yeah.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.520
 Is there a picture of him next to that word in the dictionary?

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.520
 I don't know.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.040
 They don't really go for pictures in the dictionary, but maybe in the children's edition

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.520
 they'll have a picture of him.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.240
 It's weird that that's a saying, actually, isn't it, if you look up stupid, there'd be a picture

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.240
 of you.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.360
 Because, as you say, the dictionary is a book that does not go in for pictures at all.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.080
 They should say, if you looked up stupid in the dictionary, there'd be a lengthy verbal

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.080
 description of you.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.400
 However, if you were to look it up in the children's dictionary or the picture dictionary, there

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.240
 would be a picture of you.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.240
 Can I just...

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240
 Or in "pictionary."

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240
 Sorry, it's still going.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.240
 What is "pictionary"?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.240
 That's a game, right?

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240
 It's a game.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.240
 Yeah.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.240
 It's an ancient Roman game then.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.960
 It's earlier than Pogs.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.200
 Just on Scots dialects.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:03.680
 So there was a sentence in 2011 which asked Scottish people if they spoke Scots.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.640
 And there was a website that was set up to help people out with this in case they didn't

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.160
 know if they did, because it's dialects.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.680
 A lot of Scottish people might speak a dialect, but think they're actually speaking just

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.480
 kind of bad English.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.600
 And so there's now a website called "I Can" - A-Y-E-C-A-N, which is really fun.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.000
 And it plays the dialects of all the different regions of Scotland, and if you can understand

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.680
 them, it shows that you speak that dialect.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.680
 Does it also play bad English just in case that's what you speak?

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.840
 Yeah, that's actually become a Scottish dialect now in its own right.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.600
 What they should do is put bad English at the top, and so you click on that, and it's bad

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.680
 English and you're like, "Okay, I definitely don't have any of the rest," rather than going

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.680
 through all of the dialects.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.120
 All of the dialects get into the end and go, "No, it was bad English after all."

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.560
 I don't know if you go through all, because if you're from Glasgow for instance, it's

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.840
 very unlikely that you'll speak the 'Shetland' dialects unless you're in England.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.160
 They spoke something very similar to Old Norse for a long time, didn't they?

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.160
 Yeah, Noun.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.440
 Until only like two or three hundred years ago.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.440
 Yeah.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.440
 Yeah, it's clung on.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.240
 Because it came because Norway owned Shetland, didn't it?

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.440
 What's clung on, sorry, is that the name of it?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.440
 It clung on.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.440
 Oh, it clung on.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.440
 Sorry, that's just my bad diction.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.440
 You've got bad English.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.440
 I've got bad English.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:15.480
 So I found another Scottish word, which is "glamour" is Scottish, which I didn't know.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.480
 And...

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.800
 Because I've heard of that in English as well.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.800
 Yeah.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800
 Well, we use it now.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.800
 It's past onto us.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.800
 That's right.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.800
 Yeah.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.400
 But I used to just assume 'glamour' meant, you know, someone who looks very glamorous is

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.400
 someone who's dressed very well in high fashion.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.840
 But the definition of 'glamour', at least the original definition is 'magic' enchantment

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.360
 spell.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.640
 So whenever a magician says 'my glamorous assistant', he's actually saying 'my magical assistant'.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.640
 Is that really true?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.640
 Yeah.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.120
 As in, that's why he says, "I don't know.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.840
 I'm assuming that must be the origin of why not why not.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.880
 That can't be the main origin of why all the traditions say 'my glamorous assistant'.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.880
 No.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.800
 'Plamour' meant something astonishing, like magical, and then it meant something beautiful,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.880
 and then it was used by magicians, and then done made this connection.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880
 Yeah.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.880
 So that's what it works.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.880
 Okay, well, what a beautiful connection.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.880
 That's what it's called.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.880
 That's what it's called.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.480
 They might be saying 'my magical assistant'.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.080
 So the Collins English dictionary, they have a Scottish wing, and they recently added,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.800
 so they have words of the year, which we've discussed on the TV show as well.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.800
 So they added things like...

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800
 What TV shows that?

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800
 There's no such thing as the news.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.800
 It's the BBC 2 TV show.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.800
 When's that?

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.800
 It's on Wednesday night.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.800
 It's on BBC 2, after news night.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800
 Okay.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.800
 They added words like 'neverendum'.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.800
 I've heard of this.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.800
 Which is just, you know, this debate about the referendum.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.200
 I think that Bob Bagg was talking about the whole time.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.200
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.600
 That just keeps going on, and they've also added 'Nicolabilia'.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.600
 Any guesses?

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.600
 Is it a lot of things that you collect that are made out of nickel?

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.600
 No.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.600
 Not bad.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.600
 I call the rage this year.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.600
 James is desk, he's biding up.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.600
 Is it like loose change?

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.600
 Because that's like nickels.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.600
 No, think of the 'Nicola' bit of Nickelestogen.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.600
 Nickelestogen.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.600
 It's merchandise.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600
 She collects nickels.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.600
 No.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.600
 It's merchandise-feeding the face of Nickelestogen.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.600
 Oh, really?

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.600
 And I'm unsure about how much this is used.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.600
 I haven't found out my relatives.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.600
 Right.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600
 And ask them.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.600
 I've just got a couple more things on exclamations.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.600
 So one that I use all the time is Holy Moly.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.600
 And I assume that I got that from the early Batman series.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.600
 Holy Moly Batman.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.600
 So there's actually a Wikipedia article

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.600
 where they've listed every single Holy something that Robin has said.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.600
 And there's hundreds of them.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.600
 And I've just picked out a few.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600
 Holy bank balance.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.600
 That's one.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.600
 Holy contributing to the delinquency of miners.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.600
 Batman.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.600
 And holy priceless collection of Etruscan snoods.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600
 Batman.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.600
 In context, they might make sense.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.600
 I think it was plot point explaining.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.600
 I think it was, I think, he was just trying to remind you

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.600
 that we're looking at Etruscan snoods here.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.600
 Holy crobat, Batman.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.600
 But weirdly, the one missing from the list, Holy Moly.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.600
 Not on the list.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.600
 Because it's a catchphrase that's owned by Captain Marvel.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.600
 You were saying holy.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.600
 That's what kind of a lot of ults are, aren't they?

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.600
 They're kind of things against the church.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.600
 Gosh means it's another way of saying God.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.600
 Gagzooks.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.600
 Gagzooks.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.600
 Gagzooks.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.600
 But when I was looking up gosh, I found out that people used to say

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.600
 Losh, which was like shot for Lord.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.600
 Yeah.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.600
 In the 18th century.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600
 Losh.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.600
 Oh, that's pretty good.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.600
 That is no.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.600
 I'm not really like that.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.600
 Just on Fuddleduddle, another explanation.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.600
 That's got a more recent history.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600
 Do you know where that came from?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600
 Fuddleduddle.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.600
 No.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.600
 Yeah.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.600
 Fuddleduddle, that thing we say all the time to exclaim.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.600
 That comes from Pierre Trudeau.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.600
 So you know Justin Trudeau's dad, who was Prime Minister of Canada in the 70s.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.600
 Yeah.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.600
 He was in a parliamentary debate when he was Prime Minister.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.600
 And the opposition says something he didn't like.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.600
 And he moused what the opposition then went out to journalists and complained,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.600
 looked a lot like a word beginning with F, then a word beginning with O.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.600
 So they said, what were you thinking when you mouled those two words?

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.600
 And he said, well, what's the nature of your thoughts, gentlemen?

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.600
 When you say Fuddleduddle.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.600
 So he sort of claimed it was Fuddleduddle.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.600
 And then that's caught on, in a way.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.600
 They always fuck off.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.600
 And then actually recently last year, Justin made a speech where he did admit

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.600
 that his dad hadn't, in fact, said Fuddleduddle.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600
 Right.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.600
 Yeah, scandal.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600
 There was an Israeli guy.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600
 He was 90 years old.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.600
 And he said, he was in the news about five, ten years ago saying that he invented

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.600
 "Have a nice day."

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.600
 And he was like, I don't know what I was thinking.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.600
 It just came into my head.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.600
 And I just said, have a nice day.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.600
 And then before I knew, everyone was saying it.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:30.600
 Okay.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.600
 It is time for fact number two.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.600
 And that is Anna.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.600
 My fact this week is that at least 61 species live in elephant footprints.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.600
 That's so cool.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.600
 It's so cool.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600
 Wow.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.600
 So exclusively live in...

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600
 No.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.600
 So this is a paper that was published a couple of months ago.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.600
 I read about it in Scientific American.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.600
 And they've just studied the mini ecosystems that are elephant footprints.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.600
 And they found 61 species in them.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.600
 And that's where only studying a few.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.600
 So all these creatures are living in elephant footprints.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.600
 But they make it their permanent habitat because they look to older footprints.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.600
 And they found that they'd have much, many more animals in them.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.600
 And that's because dead leaves have fallen into them and things like that.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.600
 So it's become a bit like richer environment for them.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.600
 But yeah, you get tadpoles in them.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.600
 So moving around, you get mites, mayflies, leeches...

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.600
 So none of the big hitters.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.600
 You don't get any...

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.600
 They don't get dolphins in there.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.600
 Oh yeah, no. Cheaterly, they can hold 200 litres of water.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.600
 Isn't that amazing?

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.600
 But...

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.600
 Yeah, maybe a liter is less than we think it is.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.600
 Yeah, how much...

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.600
 Oh, well, it's an African liter, which is five million.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600
 No, I don't know.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.600
 I think it's...

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.600
 Yeah.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.600
 If you had to express that in something that I don't understand...

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.600
 It would be nearly 400 points.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.600
 Wow.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.600
 In one footprint.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.600
 Yeah, I think that's...

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.600
 I was so skeptical.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.600
 But I guess in mud, then they'll sink very deep, weren't they?

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.600
 Yes.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.600
 Does that count as a footprint, then?

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.600
 If, like, your leg is in...

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.600
 You think it's a leg print.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.600
 That's a leg print.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.600
 It's a full elephant print, if he just gets completely stuck in.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.600
 And the other thing I do is they hop from footprint to footprint.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.600
 Well, elephant...

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.600
 No!

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.600
 I read they can't even jump.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.600
 They call them stepping stone habitats.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.600
 And apparently...

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.600
 Because during the dry season, it's really important, for animals.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.600
 And if the elephants weren't walking through this area,

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.600
 they would disappear during the dry season.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.600
 And other species would not be able to live in these areas.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.600
 Wow.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.600
 But I mean, this raises more cause for concern at elephant poaching, obviously,

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.600
 because it looks like these elephant footprints are preserving a lot of these creatures.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.600
 Massive housing crisis.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600
 Yeah.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.600
 I mean, I was already quite concerned about elephant poaching.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.600
 But now I hear that tadpoles are involved.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600
 I'm breaking it.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.600
 Well, the thing is, like, with all this kind of thing,

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600
 the elephants, you can be concerned about the elephants.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.600
 But actually, it's the fact that they're top, you know, species in an ecosystem.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.600
 And actually, it is.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.600
 There's hundreds and hundreds of different species that rely on them.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.600
 So, like, if you want to save an elephant,

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.600
 it's mostly the other animals you should be worried about, really.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.600
 They don't look as cool as an elephant, do they?

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.600
 It's true.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.600
 But also, is it not that they loads of plants that they disperse the seeds?

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.600
 Yeah.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.600
 They really do.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.600
 Who do you sorry?

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.600
 Elephants.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.600
 So people got, they're called ecological engineers,

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.600
 because they properly create habitats for other animals to live in,

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600
 don't they?

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.600
 By knocking down all the trees and seed dispersal.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600
 They're good for lions.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.600
 Right.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.600
 Because they knock down trees as they move along and they convert forest to scrubland,

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.600
 which means you get smaller animals living in the scrubland,

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.600
 which means that lions prey on the smaller animals.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.600
 So not so good for the smaller animals, then?

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.600
 No, but good for the lions.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.600
 Yeah.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.600
 And apparently, they have 96 species of seed a day on average in their poo,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.600
 which they disperse across the areas they're moving through.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.600
 They're like large insects, really, aren't they, spreading?

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600
 They're like big bees.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.600
 No.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.600
 Spreading seeds.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.600
 They are.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.600
 They're almost like pollinators.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.600
 They're so unlike insects.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.600
 They spread the seed of plants.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.600
 I mean, that one incredibly specific respect, they're quite like us.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.600
 And they've got six legs, is that right?

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.600
 So just to get my head around it, these animals, they're most found there.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.600
 Where else would they live if not in the footprints?

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.600
 In puns and stuff.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.600
 So there are fewer puns around, especially in the dry season.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.600
 Yeah.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.600
 So they'll find this kind of footprint, which has turned into a pond,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.600
 and they'll live there.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.600
 If it wasn't there, they'd have to try and find another pond.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.600
 But the more puns there are, the more places they can live,

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.600
 and the better their species will do.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.600
 Yeah.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600
 Okay.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.600
 I got it now.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.600
 Do you know one amazing use for elephant poo?

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.600
 If you're dying of thirst.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.600
 Oh, no.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.600
 Yes.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.600
 You can squeeze it together and wring a few drops of water out of it.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600
 Yeah.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.600
 Baragrills does that, doesn't he?

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.600
 I think he did it with camel poo, as opposed to elephant poo.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.600
 Maybe it was elephant poo, but you can see footage of that.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.600
 There's not much bacteria in there.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.600
 Botswana gets 650,000 kilos of elephant droppings.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.600
 That's Botswana alone every day.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600
 Wow.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.600
 So much.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.600
 Yeah.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600
 They pop it up.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600
 It is a lot.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.600
 No one's denying it.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.600
 All right, but I'm waiting for one of you to try to deny it.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.600
 It's not that much.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.600
 It is that much.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:08.600
 So I was looking into other odd places that you find species living in.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.600
 Okay.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.600
 That aren't necessarily natural to their habitat.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:20.600
 There's researchers have been looking in this specific African cave because they found out about this group of crocodiles who live in this cave.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.600
 And it's really rare because they're out of sunlight for most of the time.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.600
 They feed off bats that live in the cave and so on.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.600
 Yeah, they have just a totally different eating habit.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.600
 The thing is they do go out though.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.600
 So they're not going to go blind.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.600
 They're not going to adapt to nighttime.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.600
 Because they're going to need the heat because they don't make their own heat.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.600
 But they do spend a lot of time there.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:48.600
 And one thing they notice, they did think for a while, at least to begin with, like, wow, I wonder if this is a completely different species or subspecies of crocodile because it was orange.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.600
 And they were like, what's going on here?

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:58.600
 And it turns out that because of the water that they're in in the caves, there's so much bat poo that goes into the water that it's colored the crocodiles into a different color.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.600
 So they come out and they're like, whoa, what's this weird color?

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.600
 And it's just batshit.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.600
 Do you think that's where the phrase batshit crazy comes from?

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.600
 Because they look so crazy. They've turned orange and the other crocodiles are going, you look batshit crazy.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.600
 It could be, yeah.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.600
 I don't think so.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:18.600
 There's actually this other amazing cave that has its own ecosystem, which I found out about.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.600
 So this is called the Sondoun Cave in Vietnam, apologies if I've mispronounced that.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:28.600
 This is the world's largest cave and it was discovered in 2009 by a British guy.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.600
 So that's what when it's reported it was discovered, even though I think the people in Vietnam knew about it.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:37.600
 But it's this huge cave, so it has a jungle in it if you go into it.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.600
 So it's got a jungle with, you should honestly look up, look up pictures of this place.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.600
 It's extraordinary.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.600
 The trees are fun.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.600
 And inside the jungle there's a desert.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.600
 Inside that there's an ocean.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.600
 Why won't you believe me?

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.600
 The bottom is another massive cave.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.600
 The Russian doll of caves.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.600
 There's a jungle with trees that are 30 metres tall.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.600
 It has its own river.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.600
 It's got a centre parts.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.600
 And all these new species have been found in it anyway.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.600
 So yeah, honestly look up pictures of it.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.600
 So they found a new type of gecko, a tree frog, a new type of striped hair.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.600
 Living inside this cave completely underground.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.600
 The main cabin of it is so big it has its own climate, so it has rain clouds.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.600
 Which I imagine means it actually rains inside this huge cave.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.600
 Where is this again?

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.600
 It's in Vietnam.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.600
 Can I just say one last thing?

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.600
 Yes, sure.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.600
 As I read this the other day, I haven't got the full details here.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.600
 But there's a species of crab and they're polygamous.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.600
 So the males have sex with loads of different females and vice versa.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:44.600
 If these crabs find a turtle shell with just the right gap between the shell and the bottom of the turtle

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.600
 that will fit two crabs in, then a male and a female crab will go and live inside the turtle shell

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.600
 and they'll have a monogamous relationship.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.600
 And they won't have sex with anyone else, they'll just live there.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.600
 But anywhere else they live, they'll have loads of partners.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.600
 But if they find that little niche, then they'll kind of stay together.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.600
 It's like a suburb.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:08.600
 It's right if you move into the perfect house, then your relationship can be repaired.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.600
 Absolutely, yeah.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600
 It's a lesson here.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:18.600
 Okay, it is time to move on to fact number three.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.600
 And that is my fact.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.600
 My fact this week is that the original edition of Wisden's Cricketer's Almanac

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.600
 was 112 pages long and because the author wasn't sure what to put in it,

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.600
 was padded out with accounts of the trial of King Charles I.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.600
 So if you don't know what this book is, this is published annually

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.600
 and it is the ultimate Cricketer's book.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:44.600
 And the current edition, the 2016 edition, is over 1,500 pages long.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.600
 So it's a huge book, it has nothing but cricket.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.600
 But the very first edition, Wisden was like, I don't have enough cricket to put in this.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.600
 But I need to make it worth buying.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.600
 So he added the accounts of the trial from King Charles of Earth.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.600
 He also put in battles of the English Civil War and also Britain's canals,

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.600
 the size of them and length.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.600
 And also the rules of quiting.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.600
 Yeah, what is that?

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.600
 Quiting is where you, I think you have a quite is like kind of a circular thing,

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.600
 a bit like a horseshoe and you throw it to a stick and it goes around the stick.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.600
 And if you get it around the stick, you get points.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.600
 It's based on pub garden games, quits.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:23.600
 We should actually not only explain what quiting is but probably for our American explain what cricket is.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600
 I think so.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.600
 It's like baseball on the a lot slower.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.600
 That'll do it.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.600
 And there are tea breaks.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.600
 Yeah.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.600
 And I still find that insane.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.600
 So I didn't know that because I didn't really follow cricket.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.600
 But halfway through a day of playing cricket, they all stop to have cups of tea.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.600
 No, you have tea as in food.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.600
 You would have like sandwiches and stuff.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.600
 Yeah, to see to English people who know about cricket,

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.600
 that seems like the most normal thing in the world.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.600
 Yeah.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.600
 I mean, you go for fun.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.600
 I mean, I should know that in theory.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.600
 Yeah.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.600
 Well, actually, do Australia play cricket anymore?

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.600
 You can.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.600
 Out.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.600
 Interesting fact about the Cricketers Almanac.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.600
 Yeah.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600
 Really interesting fact.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600
 Get ready.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.600
 Hold on to your seats.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.600
 So it's been published every year since 1864.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.600
 And for the first six years, it was published.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.600
 It was Wiston's Cricketers Almanac.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.600
 But for the subsequent however many years,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.600
 it's been Wiston's Cricketers Almanac.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.600
 With the apostrophe on the other side of the S.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.600
 Which S, Wiston's or Cricketers.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.600
 Cricketers.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.600
 Yeah, but there's only ever been one Wiston.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.600
 So it's always been from one Wiston, but originally it was for only one Cricketer.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.600
 It was for one Cricketer for the first six years.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.600
 It was just aimed at one Cricketer.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.600
 No one knows if that Cricketer is.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.600
 But John Wiston, the founder, was quite an interesting guy.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.600
 He was a Cricketer.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.600
 And his nickname was The Little Wonder.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.600
 Because he was five foot nothing.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.600
 And he weighed seven stone when he started his career.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.600
 And he was tiny.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.600
 And yet in one match in 1850 he bowled out all ten of the opposite team in a single innings.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.600
 Which I think it's written online that this is the only time that's ever happened in a first class match.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.600
 So they were all bowled out as in he hit the stunts rather than then being caught out or, you know, got out in another way.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.600
 There are about ten ways you can be caught up.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.600
 That's great.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.600
 Yeah.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.600
 Well done here.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.600
 On page 657 of the year 2000 edition.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.600
 The Leicester Spinball and Matthew Brimson exposed himself.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.600
 And nobody noticed at the time.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.600
 And it went into the edition.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.600
 And then about six days after it had been published, someone wrote in and said, this guy's middle stump is in this picture.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.600
 Matthew Engel, who was editor at the time, wrote about this.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.600
 And he said, in the 2000 Leicestershire photo, one of their most obscure players was laughing.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.600
 Oh, having chosen to expose himself to the camera, his only contribution to Cricketer history.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.600
 Oh, the Leicestershire squad was large.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.600
 The page was small, so was our editorial team, and so was the appendage.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.600
 Okay, this guy got slammed by the said.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.600
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.600
 It is kind of embarrassing that nobody noticed for a week.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600
 Yeah.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.600
 And then he was asked to apologise and he didn't.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.600
 And apparently he said, well, he said it was the editor's fault because they should have spotted it.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:03.600
 And Engel said, oh, do you think we need to employ a full-time penis spotter then?

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.600
 So, did you know the first Cricket Balls were rolled along the ground?

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.600
 That was the first way you bowled and Cricket.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.600
 Really?

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.600
 And this is very early, yeah.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.600
 So it was more like croquet.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.600
 Kind of, yeah.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.600
 Right.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.600
 Except you were allowed to roll the ball along the ground.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.600
 And the idea being that it was still trying to hit stumps behind.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.600
 So, is it French Cricket where you throw very, very low?

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.600
 You aim for someone's legs.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.600
 Cricket on their own, basically.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.600
 So instead of having wickets that you aim for, you aim for their legs.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.600
 Yeah.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.600
 So, and this is very exciting.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.600
 So one of the first bowlers to pitch was a guy called Edward Lumpy Stevens.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.600
 Lumpy was his nickname.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.600
 And there's a book.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.600
 He got that nickname after he exposed himself.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.600
 There's a book called the author's 11.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:51.600
 And it says, the name Lumpy may have come either from his ability to pitch the ball on any protrusion on the pitch.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.600
 Or his fondness for eating a whole apple pie at a time.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:00.600
 Yeah.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:07.600
 You know, in all the kind of, if you read, you know, amazing things about Wisden's Cricket as Almanac.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:14.600
 One of the claims they make is that both PG Woodhouse got the name Jeaves from Wisden Cricket as Almanac.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.600
 And Sherlock Holmes was named after a Cricket as well.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.600
 Conan Doyle used to read Wisden's Cricket as Almanac.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.600
 I can't see any evidence that that's true though.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.600
 So I think that's one of those myths that's been going around.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.600
 That's where they got them.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:31.600
 Because you do have quotes from PG Woodhouse saying that he knew Jeaves the Cricketer and he was a big fan of his.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.600
 And that's where the name came from.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.600
 So presumably he didn't need to discover that in a book.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600
 He already knew that.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:42.600
 That reminds me that Blowfelt, the bad guy in James Bond is named after Henry Blowfelt's father.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.600
 Oh, yes.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.600
 The family.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.600
 Who is a Cricket commentator?

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.600
 Yeah, Henry Blowfelt's a Cricket commentator.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.600
 We met him last year. He came on our radio show Museum of Curiosity.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:28:02.600
 And he told this story about how In Fleming was in a gentleman's club in London and was looking through the members list and saw Blowfelt's father in there and decided to name him after that.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.600
 Wow.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.600
 Was there beef between them?

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.600
 No, I don't think so.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.600
 Because he named Goldfinger after the architect Goldfinger who he didn't like at all.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.600
 And he tried to sue him, didn't he?

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.600
 Like he was very Goldfinger tried to sue him.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.600
 Yeah, Goldfinger was very angry about that.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.600
 Yeah.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:22.600
 And the most famous copy of Wisden is a 1939 edition belonging to EW Swanton.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.600
 He was a Cricket writer and then he was taken prisoner by the Japanese in the war.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.600
 And it was so popular with all the other prisoners of war that everyone used to borrow it.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.600
 And he had to turn it into like a library book so people could take it at different times.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.600
 And then it became really, really thumbed through.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.600
 It was stamped not subversive by the Japanese.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:47.600
 And then it was printed in the book, and it was printed in the book, and it was printed in the book.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.600
 And it was printed in the book, and it was printed in the book.

 And it was printed in the book.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.600
 And the auction said, the passer of this remarkable object

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.600
 is unknown and all this, you know, stuff.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.600
 But it came from a place called the Wilkes Formation,

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.600
 which is where there was a swamp.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.600
 And there is a theory that actually it's plant material

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.600
 and lumps of mineral, because sometimes things get--

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.600
 lumps of ash get turned into clay.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.600
 And they get squeezed through not holes in trees.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.600
 I mean, how is-- it's not that much different than a poo, is it?

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.600
 Exactly.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.600
 It's basically--

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.600
 Yeah, it's basically being pushed through like a tube

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.600
 or toothpaste.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.600
 So there is a theory that that's that.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.600
 But you'd have to cut it in two to take a slice,

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.600
 because there'll be organic material in there

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.600
 if it isn't covered in.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.600
 I found a really good website called The Poozyum.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.600
 Did you guys see that?

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.600
 No.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.600
 Did no one see it?

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.600
 I've seen The Poozyum.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.600
 Isn't it great?

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.600
 I didn't look at the website I saw it referred to.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.600
 And I think that was a funny name.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.600
 Exactly.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.600
 So it puts you off to look at it, because you think this is a silly name.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.600
 It's not going to be good.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.600
 This is a guy who much like the person you've just said

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.600
 with the largest collection has dedicated his life

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.600
 to understanding and cataloging and reporting on copper lights.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.600
 And it's fantastic.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.600
 It's an incredible website.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.600
 It's got pictures.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.600
 It's got all the latest news stories.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.600
 I just honestly highly recommend Poozyum.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.600
 Give us an example of a brilliant Poozyum news story.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.600
 What?

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.600
 He was telling you how you can make your own.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.600
 I know how to take things.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.600
 I've been dedicating my life to making my own.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.600
 How you can make your own poo fossil in time.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.600
 So he says you, and this was done in an interview

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.600
 that he reposted on his own site by Jason Rosenfeld

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.600
 on Silicon Exit, which is a website.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.600
 Did this great interview with him?

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.600
 So he said that the way that you can make your own copper light

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.600
 is that you start off by eating a bunch of corn and peanuts

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.600
 every few days.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.600
 And that will give the copper light interesting inclusions

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.600
 and make it worth more money when someone finds it

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.600
 a special treasure.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.600
 Because that's easier to tell if something is genuinely poo

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.600
 because it has little bits sticking out of it of insects

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.600
 or whatever.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.600
 That helps them identify it.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.600
 And then you dig it into a very deep hole

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.600
 and then put the soil over immediately.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.600
 So nothing gets to it.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.600
 That in theory is how you make your own fossil poo

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.600
 if someone wants to start going on that.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.600
 It's an incredibly weird thing to do.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.600
 Or you put in a lake.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.600
 How come?

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.600
 It sinks through the water, right?

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.600
 And it gets to the bottom.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.600
 And there's much less oxygen down there for it

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.600
 for bacteria to eat it.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.600
 So the hope is that over time,

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.600
 anaerobic bacteria gradually replace the matter with minerals.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.600
 But for best results, you have to poo in the lake.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.600
 You have to get in the lake.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.600
 Do the poo.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.600
 Get out of the lake.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.600
 OK.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.600
 I mean, there are other ways to make your mark on this Earth.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.600
 It's very unreliable because, you know,

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.600
 the world would be covered in poo if they all survived.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.600
 So in fact, it's a really valuable substance, right?

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.600
 Because it used to be important as fertilizer, copper light.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.600
 And so when they discovered this,

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.600
 then it became something that people mined.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.600
 And there are various places in the UK

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.600
 where copper light mining was an important industry.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.600
 So one of the main centers of this

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.600
 was a place called Shillington in Bedfordshire.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.600
 And this was in the mid-19th century.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.600
 It's population doubled because loads of people flocked.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.600
 It was a bit like the gold rush.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.600
 It was the UK equivalent of the gold rush.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.600
 People flocked.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.600
 As ever, America's always better, isn't it?

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.600
 We've had a third rush, America.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.600
 If you go to Bedfordshire,

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.600
 all the streets are paved with chairs.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.600
 So the brilliant thing about this place

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.600
 is that there's big boost to the local economy.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.600
 And it was actually a bit of a problem

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.600
 because these pubs multiplied

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.600
 because copper light miners were paid--

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.600
 They desperately to drink away the memories

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.600
 of what they spend their day doing.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.600
 Well, they had quite a lot of fights.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.600
 So there was tension and everything.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.600
 I mean, exactly at the gold rush.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.600
 Can I just say, in the gold rush,

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.600
 people used to go to the pubs and pay for their drinks

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.600
 with little bits of gold that they found.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.600
 Yeah.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.600
 People used to just go with a--

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.600
 They're like, this isn't an ancient one.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600
 Yeah.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.600
 Forgeries from half an hour ago.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.600
 The great thing about this place is it's called Shillington.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.600
 Its name has actually changed in the 1880s,

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.600
 because it was worried it was going to offend Queen Victoria,

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.600
 because it was called Shillington.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.600
 Yeah, really?

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.600
 Yeah.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.600
 Shillington was the heart of ship mining.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.600
 Wow.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600
 That's amazing.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.600
 Hello to anyone living in Shillington.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.600
 Yeah.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.600
 He's learning that for the first time.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600
 Is that coincidence?

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.600
 It's coincidence.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600
 Like glamorous assistant.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.600
 Like it's a total coincidence?

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.600
 It's coincidence.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.600
 Wow.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.600
 They only discovered the third seam in the mid-19th century.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.600
 And it had been around for hundreds of years before that.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.600
 They called it the "treacle mines."

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.600
 To that.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:29.600
 Likely.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.600
 Yeah, they used to, yeah.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.600
 That's the worst euphemism I've ever had ever had ever had ever had.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.600
 Horrible.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.600
 It's weird that there's a seam, isn't it?

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.600
 You would think that they'd be scattered fairly evenly.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.600
 But actually, it all comes from a time when the south of England was covered

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.600
 in hundreds of meters of water flooded, and all the land animals died.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.600
 So there's a lot remaining from that period.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.600
 Yeah.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.600
 Yeah.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.600
 So Andy, the whole idea of copper light selling more

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.600
 if it looks actually like a poo.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.600
 I was reading, again, in this interview from Pusium,

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.600
 that the reason that that's so precious is actually most fossilized poo.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.600
 The reason it doesn't retain the shape of a poo is that most animals will do it from a height, obviously.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.600
 And then it experiences what he calls the splatter effect.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.600
 So it's very hard to get a poo-shaped fossil because most of it has splattered once it hits the ground.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.600
 Get in the lake.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.600
 Get in the lake as the answer, yeah.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.600
 What?

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.600
 Slow it down on the descent.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.600
 Absolutely, yeah.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.600
 Very good.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.600
 You say they're so precious.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:26.600
 This guy, George Transon, his most valuable copper light is called precious.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.600
 Just to make him a tiny bit more creepy, I did a business inquiry.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.600
 No.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:38.600
 I wonder because the splatter effect thing I just said was he's talking literally about precious in this sentence.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.600
 Is this the same guy?

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.600
 Does he run Pusium?

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.600
 I don't know.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:46.600
 I think that your guy runs the Pusium.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.600
 I've just checked it.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.600
 That's a great sight.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.600
 The guy knows what he's talking about.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.600
 Sure does.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:58.600
 Something related to copper lights are regurgitolites, which is, well, what do you think?

00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.600
 Fossilized vomit?

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.600
 Correct.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.600
 Yeah.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.600
 Really good because often this will be something.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.600
 If you've got fossilized poo and you can see what someone's eaten, but it's obviously been through the digestive system.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.600
 If it's fossilized vomit, then obviously not been quite as far through the digestive system.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.600
 So you can see a lot better what these things have eaten.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:21.600
 So there was a bit of vomit cuffed up by an X-Fiasaur, 160 million years ago.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.600
 And it's still got little bits of the, like, ammonites and stuff that were in there.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600
 That's amazing.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.600
 It's really cool.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.600
 It's so shame for the X-Fiasaur who vomited and thought, "God, I hope no one remembers this moment."

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.600
 160 million years later.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.600
 There's still reminiscing.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.600
 There's an even more embarrassing thing.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.600
 We think we have a 300 year old piece of Bishop's excrement.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.600
 Wow.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.600
 This is in the news this week.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.600
 So there's a Danish Bishop.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.600
 It's in the news.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.600
 I didn't see him possessing.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.600
 I don't think it's credible.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.600
 There's a Danish Bishop called Jens Bircherod.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.600
 And he lived in a city called Alborg until 1708.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.600
 And 80 years ago, archaeologists found in his private mid and a lump of stuff.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.600
 And now it's been analysed.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.600
 And they think it's Bishop's poo.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.600
 It could be the Bishop's wife.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.600
 But it's God.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.600
 I'm very dumb.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:17.600
 18th century Denmark was a very liberal place.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.600
 No, one professor said this is a way of making history through the back door.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.600
 The way the tree called mine.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.600
 And they're going to put it probably in the local museum.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.600
 But it's so embarrassing.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.600
 No, I think it's good to be proud of it.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:37.600
 So there's a village called Bassingborn, hello to those in Bassingborn as well,

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.600
 which was another home of coprolite mining.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.600
 And they wanted to erect a statue as a monument to their village's great history in 2005.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.600
 And there were some contenders.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.600
 So they could have had a heron.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.600
 There were lots of beautiful herons there.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:53.600
 They thought about having a Second World War bomber because they had a strong Second World War history.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.600
 And then one of the suggestions was a large poo.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.600
 And the village voted and they voted for the poo.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:05.600
 So they've got, don't let the public vote on things.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600
 Okay, that's it.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.600
 That's all of our facts.
