00:00:09,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:18,00:00:22,to you from the QI offices in Covered Garden. My name is Dan Triber. I am sitting here
00:00:22,00:00:27,"with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Chizinski, and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered"
00:00:27,00:00:32,around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular
00:00:32,00:00:40,"order, here we go. Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that on July 13, 1930, Sir"
00:00:40,00:00:46,"Arthur Conan Doyle headlined a show at the Royal Albert Hall, despite having died six days"
00:00:46,00:00:53,"before. You couldn't be booed off stage, could you? You mean died in a physical sense,"
00:00:53,00:00:58,"what died in how to really bad gig sense? Yeah, so basically what happened is that six"
00:00:58,00:01:04,"days previous, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had actually died. And his family were very spiritual,"
00:01:04,00:01:08,and they knew that they were going to be reunited with him in some way. And they thought why
00:01:08,00:01:12,don't we put on effectively a family reunion gig at the Royal Albert Hall. And they did
00:01:12,00:01:17,"it as a partial memorial as well. So it was build as a memorial. However, the star bill"
00:01:17,00:01:21,at the top was that there was going to be a clairvoyant coming along. There was going
00:01:21,00:01:26,to be an empty chair on the stage at the Royal Albert Hall. And his spirit would be summoned
00:01:26,00:01:31,"to give a message to say, it's all good. I'm on the other side. And it was, right? Okay,"
00:01:31,00:01:36,"it rocks up. It showed up six and 6,000 people came to see it as well. Yeah. 6,000 people"
00:01:36,00:01:39,"crowded the Albert Hall. Some numbers put it up at 10,000, but apparently it doesn't"
00:01:39,00:01:44,"seat that many or stand that many. If you fit ghosts in, it's going to theoretically"
00:01:44,00:01:49,"infinite capacity. No, I don't want to be kept in skeptical, Anna, but what do you mean"
00:01:49,00:01:55,"he turned up? Oh, well, we have recorded evidence that he turned up. What I read about it is that"
00:01:55,00:02:00,the medium Estelle Roberts claimed that she'd seen Doyle sitting in his chair. And she conveyed
00:02:00,00:02:04,"a message from him, but apparently only his wife heard it. And everyone else was overpowered"
00:02:04,00:02:10,from a massive blast on the organ that was playing. It was an oddly typed blast of organ
00:02:10,00:02:14,to mean that no one else could hear what was being said. Was anyone playing the organ or
00:02:14,00:02:19,was it an organ played by a ghost? There was an organist build on the actual
00:02:19,00:02:23,"play bill. So it wasn't a ghost blast. No, it was just the organist being an idiot. No,"
00:02:23,00:02:27,I think the idea is that they wanted to keep the message in the end a bit private. And so
00:02:27,00:02:31,they did that. It's really odd. The total moment that everyone waited like two hours or
00:02:31,00:02:34,"more. Yes, absolutely bizarre that they'd try and cover up to hear words of Arthur Conan"
00:02:34,00:02:40,"Doyle speaking from Beyond the Grave. Just quickly, the medium Estelle Roberts, she had"
00:02:40,00:02:45,"a spirit that she used to talk to called Red Cloud, who is a native American. He"
00:02:45,00:02:51,was wrongly predicted that World War II wouldn't happen and that it would all be fine. He said
00:02:51,00:02:56,"that and then obviously was wrong. But they did manage to catch him on photo once or twice,"
00:02:56,00:03:04,but it turned out always to look exactly like her wearing a hat. We had to predict that
00:03:04,00:03:11,World War II won't happen. I think a lot of people predicted it might happen. And Red
00:03:11,00:03:16,"Cloud was like, no, it'll be fine. Conan Doyle's spirit guide said the opposite so that"
00:03:16,00:03:20,"Conan Doyle and his wife, Jean, they had their home in Sussex, they had a spirit guide called"
00:03:20,00:03:28,"Phineas, who I'm coizing here regularly predicted global catastrophe. And he also advised them"
00:03:28,00:03:34,"on when they should move house and things like this. Supposedly on one occasion, Jean asked"
00:03:34,00:03:38,the local station master to reschedule a train that Arthur was going to take because her
00:03:38,00:03:42,spirit guide had said it'll be better if the trains moved actually. I think it might have
00:03:42,00:03:47,"fitted with the diary. I don't know. Because he was a popular man, you never know. Yeah, maybe."
00:03:47,00:03:54,"You know, when he was a doctor before he became a writer and he had almost zero patients. His"
00:03:54,00:03:58,"first one when he set up in Port Smith was a man who walked in and so Conan Doyle said, oh come in,"
00:03:58,00:04:03,"come in, really excitedly. Showed him straight into his consultation room, sat him down and said,"
00:04:03,00:04:08,I can tell already by the way you're coughing that you've got some bronchial problems and the
00:04:08,00:04:11,"man said, no, sorry, I'm just coughing because I'm a bit nervous. I'm here to collect the gas"
00:04:11,00:04:21,bill that the previous tenant didn't pay off. Thus the home's method was born. So Conan Doyle very
00:04:21,00:04:27,famously believed in fairies and he believed in contacting the dead and all of his family were very
00:04:27,00:04:31,much apart of the same belief system. There was a time magazine article that was published on the
00:04:31,00:04:35,"21st of July. It was basically reviewing the gig, but it was also giving the background and the"
00:04:35,00:04:39,"lead up to it. So they said that when Conan Doyle died, this is the words in the articles,"
00:04:39,00:04:44,"Serotho's family cheerfully buried him because they were like, well, we'll see him in a few days,"
00:04:44,00:04:49,"anyway. So that'll be fine. And it was really interesting in the period between the gig happening,"
00:04:49,00:04:53,they got lots of messages from people saying that Serotho Conan Doyle had got in contact and left
00:04:53,00:04:58,"their messages. And the sun said, we believe the people that they're not lying that spirits got in"
00:04:58,00:05:04,"contact, but their spirits themselves are pranksters on the other side. And people like, what do you"
00:05:04,00:05:09,mean? They're prankster spirits who are pretending to be Conan Doyle and it's not our dad. It's just
00:05:09,00:05:15,someone else. I think this is quite a pervasive thought about for people who believe in sayances
00:05:15,00:05:19,"and about spirits. There are a lot of pranksters. There's a really excellent book by Hillary Mantell,"
00:05:19,00:05:24,"one of her earlier books called Beyond Black, where the idea is that sayances are all haunted by"
00:05:24,00:05:28,these bastard pranksters who are always just throwing shit at you and pretending to be your
00:05:28,00:05:32,dead mom and then biting you in the face and stuff. But you would only really need one ghost to
00:05:32,00:05:37,"exist and he could do devices. If it was like a John Colchard ghost or something, who could do"
00:05:37,00:05:42,the voices of all the dead people who are ever there if there's just one prankster. So the thing
00:05:42,00:05:46,about the medium is getting it wrong. This was a huge part of the relationship between Doyle and
00:05:46,00:05:51,"Houdini. Harry Houdini, yes, the escapologist. They were friends and Doyle believed and Houdini didn't"
00:05:51,00:05:57,and Houdini spent a lot of his time cheerfully unmasking fraudulent mediums and then Doyle talked
00:05:57,00:06:03,"Houdini into going to a sayance because Doyle's wife was a medium and she said Houdini, I've got great"
00:06:03,00:06:07,news. I'm in contact with your mother who's died and they talked him into it and then he went along
00:06:07,00:06:13,"and then Houdini's mum wrote a 15 page message to Houdini. Unfortunately, it was in perfect English,"
00:06:13,00:06:19,whereas Houdini's mum spoke almost no English. And it started with the sign of the cross and Houdini's
00:06:19,00:06:24,"mother was married to a rabbi and it was just, yeah, it wasn't very well done. It wasn't very well done."
00:06:24,00:06:27,"And that did break up their friendship really, didn't it? Which is a shame because they had one of these very"
00:06:27,00:06:32,good sparring relationships where Houdini was constantly trying to convince Conan Doyle that he
00:06:32,00:06:36,wasn't magic and Conan Doyle was constantly trying to tell Houdini that Houdini was magic and then
00:06:36,00:06:40,"they sort of really fell out over this. Well, so you just probably didn't believe him that these"
00:06:40,00:06:45,"were tricks. Yeah, he kept saying, Harry, honestly, you've got amazing powers, embrace it and Houdini's"
00:06:45,00:06:51,"going, no, this is how I do it. But yeah, he called Conan Doyle's beliefs hogwash and apple sauce,"
00:06:51,00:06:58,"which I enjoy is insults. Before he was an escapologist, he was the wild man and he would live in a cage"
00:06:58,00:07:04,"and eat pieces of meat. What's he? Yeah, he was he and his wife absolutely broke and they had to do"
00:07:04,00:07:08,anything they could to get work. So that was one of the acts that he had. Oh my god. Would he then
00:07:08,00:07:15,"break out of the cage using? No, no, no, no. Oh my god. So have you heard of Marjorie Crandon? No."
00:07:15,00:07:20,She's one of the best ever fraudulent mediums and Houdini had this huge vendetta against her.
00:07:20,00:07:26,"She performed very scantily clad and on one occasion, supposedly, she emitted ectoplasm from"
00:07:26,00:07:33,"her vagina. As you do. That's kind of what happened. Yeah. Well, were she embarrassed by that?"
00:07:33,00:07:36,"I don't think so. Because usually it comes from your ear or your nostril, right?"
00:07:36,00:07:42,"Well, it basically comes from anywhere you hide it. Yes. So you get a load of ectoplasm and it's"
00:07:42,00:07:48,made out of egg whites and wood chip or whatever and you hide it in your various ore facies around
00:07:48,00:07:54,your body and then it comes out of the wood chip. I think it's made of woodchip is in that. I sawdust.
00:07:54,00:07:59,"Sawdust. Really? Marjorie supposedly had some made of butchers awful, which she was pulling out of it."
00:07:59,00:08:04,"I mean, I imagine that butchers awful is like intestines. Yeah, yeah. Like you would pull flags"
00:08:04,00:08:10,"out of a top hat or something. Yes, if she did that. If she did that. Clags with lambs intestines"
00:08:10,00:08:16,"and the top hat with a vagina. That's exactly, I'm never booking that lady for my children's party again."
00:08:16,00:08:23,"So yeah, so Houdini cancelled his own shows to travel across the country to attend her"
00:08:23,00:08:28,sayances and try to debunk her. I found a really cool sayance thing. The connection between
00:08:28,00:08:33,"alcoholics anonymous and sayances. So Bill Wilson, who's the founder of alcoholics anonymous,"
00:08:33,00:08:38,"he was massively into sayances. He used to go to them all the time and he had in his own house,"
00:08:38,00:08:42,he had a spook room and the spook room is where he would go into and that's where he'd chat to
00:08:42,00:08:50,"spirits. And actually, he claimed that the famous 12 steps that alcoholics anonymous has, he actually,"
00:08:50,00:08:55,"he wrote this in his autobiography as well, that he led, he got led to creating that as an idea"
00:08:55,00:09:02,"because he was talking to a 15th century monk called Boniface. No, yeah, same place, same place."
00:09:02,00:09:10,"And that's why step number seven of the 12 is, yeah, so he, and as far as the idea,"
00:09:10,00:09:14,"we were sitting around in a room, around a table and and sharing things and that led to a very"
00:09:14,00:09:19,similar situation for alcoholics anonymous. Really? I didn't know that. Do you know who named
00:09:19,00:09:27,"Ouija Boards? Parker Brothers? No, Ouija Boards, named Ouija Boards. So Ouija Boards, they became,"
00:09:27,00:09:31,they became quite popular sayances became very popular in the 19th century and people started
00:09:31,00:09:36,"using something like Ouija Board at about the 1880s, but it didn't have a name and of about four"
00:09:36,00:09:41,"investors got together in 1890 and decided, you know, they had to find out a name for the Ouija Board."
00:09:41,00:09:45,"So they called in their, one of their spiritualist sisters and they gathered around it and they"
00:09:45,00:09:51,"asked the Ouija Board, what do you want to be called? And it spelled out Ouija. So the fact that it's"
00:09:51,00:09:57,"also the words for yes in French German. No, that really is irrelevant, I think. I think that's a myth."
00:09:57,00:10:02,"No, you're right, Anna, your theory is much better. So the truth was that the woman,"
00:10:02,00:10:07,"the spiritualist who said that the board was spoken to her was wearing a locket at the time, a picture of"
00:10:07,00:10:13,a woman who was called Ouija. So she got the idea from that. I've never done a Ouija Board. I've never
00:10:13,00:10:20,done any of this stuff. It's too scary. That's not quite the reason I haven't done it. They used to use
00:10:20,00:10:26,"Ouija Boards for contacting a life people mostly, didn't they? Very well, well, one, I think, they were"
00:10:26,00:10:33,"used to contact soldiers on the front. So families would say, how's it going over there? And then the"
00:10:33,00:10:38,"soldier would supposedly talk to them? Well, they not rumbled when their sons came home from war and"
00:10:38,00:10:44,"their mum was like, how dare you speak to me like you did last year. Mum, I believe you lost it."
00:10:44,00:10:48,I believe you flung all that ectoplasm across the room. Didn't even know you had a vagina.
00:10:54,00:11:00,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Chuzinski. My fact is that Dutch trains are fitted"
00:11:00,00:11:07,"with lasers to fire at leaves on the line. That is amazing. Is it how I imagine? So it's like,"
00:11:07,00:11:12,"I'm imagining actually a steam train at the moment, but it's got a massive laser on the front"
00:11:12,00:11:18,"and it's firing like green lasers at and then kind of vaporizing them. Yeah, it's just like that."
00:11:18,00:11:26,"It also makes the noise, it's got a giant pair of eyes shooting lasers a hundred metres ahead. No,"
00:11:26,00:11:31,"it hasn't. Sorry guys, this is, they're a little bit smaller than that. It's definitely the same principle,"
00:11:31,00:11:36,but they're tiny little lasers that are attached to the wheels and they just shoot and vaporize leaves
00:11:36,00:11:41,"on the track just in front of the wheels. So they're quite small, but this is still in trial stage,"
00:11:41,00:11:48,"I think, and it started in 2014 and it's because leaves on the line is a massive problem and it's"
00:11:48,00:11:53,just a more efficient way of cleaning them up. So other ways of getting leaves off the line like
00:11:53,00:11:58,jets of water or jets of sand cause a bit of damage to the line and because lasers have a really
00:11:58,00:12:03,"tiny wavelength, they get absorbed by the leaves, but the rails are completely unaffected by them,"
00:12:03,00:12:07,so you can fire a laser at a rail forever and never and nothing will happen. I think the first time
00:12:07,00:12:14,"they started investigating this method was in 1999. Yes. And the original laser burned at 5,000 degrees"
00:12:14,00:12:21,"Celsius and fired 25,000 times a second, but the vibrations of the train meant that it wasn't accurate"
00:12:21,00:12:30,"enough. So that was one of the bombs at first. And after thousands of deaths, they decided to rethink,"
00:12:30,00:12:41,"""No leaves killed."" Trees prospered as humanity perished. No, this is, so the guy who came up with"
00:12:41,00:12:45,this idea was a man called Malcolm Higgins who was a raw Navy Lieutenant Commander and he had
00:12:45,00:12:48,"no experience in lasers and no experience in trains. No, because he was in the Navy."
00:12:48,00:12:55,"Don't, don't, he's in that much on ships. And he was just the radio one day, I think, and thought,"
00:12:55,00:12:59,"""Leaves on the line, I bet I know what could fix that, a laser."" And he looked into it and set up this"
00:12:59,00:13:05,"company called Laser Thor. And it turns out it is better than the other methods in a lot of ways,"
00:13:05,00:13:09,"but you're right because of the slight wobble of trains. The laser is sometimes misfired,"
00:13:09,00:13:13,"whereas if you fire a jet of water, it just gets anything that's in its way. But it's been adjusted"
00:13:13,00:13:19,for now in the Dutch version. And so it seems like it's working like a dream. We haven't said why
00:13:19,00:13:26,"leaves on the line are a bad thing. Yeah, they are. They are. No, why? Oh, why? So they turn into a"
00:13:26,00:13:31,"black mulch, don't they? Yeah. Sorry, Andy, Andy wanted to say why I thought you were asking me,"
00:13:31,00:13:37,"but you just wanted to show up that you knew. Sorry, forgive me for bringing you back to the same."
00:13:37,00:13:45,"Go on. No, no, no, if I can showboat for a second, I have to read out a fact."
00:13:45,00:13:50,"Yep, no, take, take the stage. So what happens is when the, so it's when you're going to leave on the"
00:13:50,00:13:54,"line, it's the previous train goes over it and crushes it. The leaves release the thing called pectin,"
00:13:55,00:14:02,which is the stuff that the food industry uses as a gel to make jams and jellies. So that's what
00:14:02,00:14:06,"happens. So the train, so it means it slows down the deceleration of the train. So the train basically"
00:14:06,00:14:10,the train can't break very effectively. And that's dangerous. So they have to go much more slowly.
00:14:10,00:14:14,Does that mean that this vaporising by lasers of the leaves is going to reduce the quantities
00:14:14,00:14:20,of jam available to us? I think that jam companies don't principally sort the jam from railway
00:14:20,00:14:27,lines. The jam harvests every year is a little chertian running along railway lines scooping up
00:14:27,00:14:36,this supermarket to show you got the strawberry raspberry trade. So they are a huge problem and I
00:14:36,00:14:41,do feel bad for things like network rail because we take the piss. But I think 4.5 million hours
00:14:41,00:14:47,"of passenger delays roughly a year, a cause by leaves on the rails. The cost of repairing tracks"
00:14:47,00:14:51,because of leaf issues or repairing trains is 10 million a year and then another 5 million for
00:14:51,00:14:55,the vegetation management. And the only reason they were there in the first place is because people
00:14:55,00:15:00,who were building railways wanted to protect people who lived nearby from the sounds. So they planted
00:15:00,00:15:05,lots and lots of trees next to them and turns out that was a real boi. You know these aren't the only
00:15:05,00:15:11,lasers that are used on trains. There's another train that shoots out lasers that we have in the UK.
00:15:11,00:15:18,It's called the flying banana. This is an Arthur Conan drill hallucination. This is real. It goes all
00:15:18,00:15:23,the way up and down the UK rail networks and what it's doing is checking the quality. So using lasers
00:15:23,00:15:28,"and cameras of the tracks. They're making sure that the tracks are just still as strong, still as good."
00:15:28,00:15:35,"Why did they call it the flying banana? Because it's yellow. Oh, okay. So it looks a bit like a banana."
00:15:35,00:15:39,And they mean flying and going quickly rather than actually flying.
00:15:39,00:15:45,Yeah. So like a flying banana to me. Do we know if it's curved? We don't know. We don't know.
00:15:45,00:15:49,"No, it won't be because how would it go in the tracks? Like the one thing about trains is they have"
00:15:49,00:15:55,"to be straight. You can put a banana on wheels. It's only the wheels that need to be straight, James."
00:15:55,00:16:01,"That's true. If you put a big enough axle and gauge on a standard banana, you could have a train"
00:16:01,00:16:06,"that was just a banana on wheels. Yeah, I agree with that. But on the other hand, if you're"
00:16:06,00:16:10,"checking the rail, you really want it to be pretty much the size and shape of a train."
00:16:10,00:16:14,"Too small as well, bananas. You don't get bananas the size of trains."
00:16:14,00:16:18,"Well, I'm going to take the example from the Navy Man, and I'm going to set up a company."
00:16:18,00:16:23,I should say the real name of that train is the new measurement train.
00:16:23,00:16:26,I could see what they had to come up with a nickname for it.
00:16:26,00:16:32,"But yeah, so it checks strength in the joins and overhead cables. And so it just makes sure it's"
00:16:32,00:16:37,"the maintenance train, basically. Do you know what the fastest train ever in North America was?"
00:16:37,00:16:44,"Oh, no. Okay, it was called the M497 Black Beetle, and it was basically a normal train that they put"
00:16:44,00:16:51,"two jet engines on. I fired it down the tracks. Cheezing? Yeah, well, it is. But for a while, it was"
00:16:51,00:16:55,"thought that this might be the future, and they did it in Russia, and they did it in America."
00:16:56,00:17:04,"But the problem was, basically, if they crashed, everyone died. So it was incredibly dangerous,"
00:17:04,00:17:08,"but they did go really fast, and they do technically work. Isn't that how all trains work,"
00:17:08,00:17:15,"that if they crash, everyone dies? No, they work. Do you think everyone's died in every single train crash?"
00:17:15,00:17:19,"I always make sure to get off before the last stop, because I assume it just goes into a wall."
00:17:19,00:17:25,"What we've talked about the phrase, haven't we? Getting off a gate set is slang for"
00:17:26,00:17:32,"the withdrawal method in sex, because gate set is the second last stop on the line before Newcastle."
00:17:32,00:17:38,"I thought it was for premature ejaculation. I think that's being thrown off the train at gate set,"
00:17:38,00:17:51,"whether you want to do it or not. I should just finish off this. Yeah, basically, the reason is,"
00:17:51,00:17:56,"because you've got two massive engines on, and it's going so fast that it's used a lot of fuel,"
00:17:56,00:18:03,and any kind of accident is going to be pretty fatal. Should we do some stuff quickly on lasers?
00:18:03,00:18:09,"Yeah. Do you know what the world's largest laser is? No, the world's biggest laser. It was made"
00:18:09,00:18:16,"in Osaka, University, and Japan, and it has the power of 2,000 trillion watts. That's two"
00:18:16,00:18:22,"petawatts, and it's very short amount of time that it does it, and that's a billion times more powerful"
00:18:22,00:18:29,than floodlights in a football stadium. It's about the same as all the power that the sun gives to
00:18:29,00:18:36,London every year. What they do with that is they fire it for a very small amount of time on some
00:18:36,00:18:42,"matter, and it turns it into plasma. Plasma is what we think it's a state of matter, and it's what we"
00:18:42,00:18:47,"think, 99% of everything in the universe is made out of, but we can't really make it on Earth,"
00:18:47,00:18:51,because it's quite hard to make unless you use this massive laser. So we're just trying to turn the
00:18:51,00:18:57,remaining one percent into plasma as well. The poor desperate one percent. Still clicking on.
00:18:57,00:19:04,That's very cool. Can I tell you about my favorite laser out there? It doesn't exist yet. It's been
00:19:04,00:19:09,"proposed, but I would love it if this was made. So there's a lot of debate about the fact that we're"
00:19:09,00:19:14,"transmitting stuff into space, and people like Stephen Hawking has said, ""Let's stop trying to tell"
00:19:14,00:19:19,"any potential life out there that we're here because they might use us as a resource."" It's oddly,"
00:19:19,00:19:24,"it appears in the news a lot, but it's just been seeing Independence Day 2. It does make sense,"
00:19:24,00:19:29,"because of all the life forms in the universe, let's assume there are others. It's pretty unlikely"
00:19:29,00:19:34,"we're going to be the smartest, and you know what happens when smarter so-called communities"
00:19:34,00:19:39,"reach less smart communities. Yeah, the less smart ones get pushed around. Exactly. I personally experienced"
00:19:39,00:19:45,"it every week of this podcast. So two astronomers at Columbia University have taken this seriously,"
00:19:45,00:19:50,"and they've developed the idea of two lasers that we would put out into space, and what we would do"
00:19:50,00:19:56,"is we would blast a continuous 30 megawatt laser for about 10 hours once a year, and what that would"
00:19:56,00:20:01,"do is it would cloak us into invisibility from any outside planets that we're looking for light,"
00:20:01,00:20:05,"the knitting, and whatever it is that you look for you. It's like an invisibility shield,"
00:20:05,00:20:10,and it wouldn't use that much energy. It would only use about 70 American homes worth of energy
00:20:10,00:20:15,for that one 10 hour blast per year. So just 70 families in America just have to do without television.
00:20:15,00:20:21,"No, that surely that wouldn't work. What would these aliens think? They've managed to see all the way"
00:20:21,00:20:25,"over to where we are, but there doesn't seem to be a planet there, despite the fact that all the"
00:20:25,00:20:29,"gravity of all the other planets seems to say that there is a planet there. Suddenly,"
00:20:29,00:20:34,there are episode of friends just cut out. I don't know. Suppose there's nobody there.
00:20:34,00:20:41,"Yeah, I didn't see this. I think if they're smart enough to get to kind of look over here,"
00:20:41,00:20:44,"then they're smart enough to realize that that was a trick. That's true, unless they haven't spotted"
00:20:44,00:20:48,"us yet. You're going to say two big lasers, one saying piss, and the other saying, oh,"
00:20:55,00:21:01,"okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray. My fact is that to avoid"
00:21:01,00:21:09,"catching malaria, you should carry a chicken with you at all times live chicken. It can't be a KFC"
00:21:09,00:21:16,bucket. Are you sure? Is it? Does because it's something to do molecules that it gives off or something?
00:21:16,00:21:20,"Yeah, so there have been some scientists from Ethiopia and Sweden who've been doing trials on this,"
00:21:20,00:21:25,and they're preparing more trials at the moment. They did experiments where they suspended a live
00:21:25,00:21:32,"chicken in a cage near people sleeping in under a bed net. Do they warn the people sleeping,"
00:21:32,00:21:39,or do they wake up in the morning and freak out? They warn them. So it's a particular kind of
00:21:39,00:21:44,"malaria mosquitoes, anopheles, Arabiensis, and it's been discovered. They avoid chickens,"
00:21:44,00:21:48,and so the scientists are working on extracting the chemicals from the chickens which give off the
00:21:48,00:21:52,"chickeny smell, and then you'll just be able to spray this around, and you won't get malaria, which"
00:21:52,00:21:57,"is a smell of delicious chicken. Exactly, yeah. Then people will start eating you instead."
00:21:57,00:22:03,"What? Yeah, so this is about how great chickens are and all the things they do for us that we don't"
00:22:03,00:22:07,"get incredible. Yeah, yeah, that's really amazing. That's incredible, yeah. Do you know you get some"
00:22:07,00:22:13,"chickens which are half male and half female? Really? Yeah, and they're split down the middle,"
00:22:14,00:22:18,"all the cells on the left hand side are male, and all the cells on the right hand side are female."
00:22:18,00:22:25,"So they have, you know, cox combs on one side and sort of big fighting spurs that male cox have,"
00:22:25,00:22:31,"and on the right they have much dainty, more hen-like features. Large breasts. Large breasts, yeah."
00:22:31,00:22:37,"So do they lay half eggs? I don't know, that's an amazing question."
00:22:39,00:22:43,"If you're not really hungry, but you do. They could just eat half an egg."
00:22:43,00:22:49,"They've got a lot of hybrid chickens. But they look different, they're plumage is completely"
00:22:49,00:22:54,"different. Wow, it's amazing. It's called bilateral guy Nandromov, something. Yes they are."
00:22:54,00:22:57,"And they're, I think you get them in butterflies, I've seen them in butterflies as well,"
00:22:57,00:23:01,so half of them look like they're one color and half of them look like they're another color.
00:23:01,00:23:05,I think chickens can change their sex camp. I've heard that as well. I remember hearing about a
00:23:05,00:23:13,fighting cock once who was a female and then changed their sex halfway through all the other way
00:23:13,00:23:19,"around. But then all the, it was the other way around because then all the cox would see this"
00:23:19,00:23:24,"like hen and think, oh well this is going to be easy, but actually she had all the aggression"
00:23:24,00:23:27,of a male cock and would just absolutely kill. Wow. So it turns out you should
00:23:27,00:23:32,"pit a fighting hen against a fighting cock. Yeah, but they just don't have that kind of aggression"
00:23:32,00:23:38,"that can. Okay. Another possible cure for malaria or sorry not a cure for malaria, a"
00:23:38,00:23:43,malaria prevention trick is spiders. So there's a spider that prays specifically on the Inoffice
00:23:43,00:23:47,"Mosquito, which is the jumping spider. And it's been found that they're attracted to smelly"
00:23:47,00:23:53,"socks or smelly human clothes like smelly underwear. And so it's, there's a thought that you could"
00:23:53,00:23:57,"leave your smelly clothes, just not wash your clothes, leave them in your house, attract jumping"
00:23:57,00:24:00,spiders into your house. And by having them there they'll get rid of the malaria mosquitoes.
00:24:00,00:24:04,"And instead you'll just be infested with spiders. Wow, that's amazing. It's very interesting"
00:24:04,00:24:09,"because they used to eat spiders webs to get rid of malaria, which presumably didn't work at all,"
00:24:09,00:24:13,"but yeah, I don't think so. Yeah, they used to give you tablets full of spiders webs,"
00:24:13,00:24:17,"and you would take those and they would help. And there was another thing that you,"
00:24:17,00:24:22,"you would carry around walnuts, I think empty walnuts with little spiders inside them,"
00:24:22,00:24:26,"and that would supposedly stop the malaria from getting you. Of course, none of these works."
00:24:26,00:24:30,"But interesting. I think that was up to the 20th century in Italy, yeah, but they thought the"
00:24:30,00:24:34,"thing would go to the world. To the 20th century. Very early 20th century, they thought the"
00:24:34,00:24:39,"thing with the mosquito bite, the walnut or the spider inside it. And also, I read that around"
00:24:39,00:24:44,"the same time in Italy, a doctor would sew a live millipede into the clothes of the sufferer,"
00:24:44,00:24:47,without telling the sufferer. And that would also stop them from getting malaria somehow.
00:24:47,00:24:51,Wow. So people walking around with live millipedes in their clothes have no idea.
00:24:53,00:24:58,"Did you know that you can, and Japanese students have recently, fertilised a shop bought chicken egg"
00:24:58,00:25:04,"and grown it into a chick, which I thought wasn't possible. What do you mean? So this was to see"
00:25:04,00:25:10,"if they could grow embryo outside of it shell completely. And there's video of this again online,"
00:25:10,00:25:15,"and these Japanese students literally bought this egg, cracked it into a cup, fertilised it,"
00:25:15,00:25:21,"so they bought the required sperm, I guess, male sex stuff to fertilise it. That's what we call it."
00:25:21,00:25:28,"And they, yeah, they fertilised it, they covered it with sort of cling film, and it grew into a chick,"
00:25:28,00:25:32,"isn't that weird. So you could watch it, you could watch all the vessels develop, if you look at the"
00:25:32,00:25:37,"video, you can see this egg that you would fry in a pan, turn into a chick. That is amazing. That's"
00:25:37,00:25:43,"extraordinary. So do they do, no, they don't start as yolk in all cases, right? No, the yolk is"
00:25:43,00:25:50,"both eats some food, yeah, okay, right. Cool. So do they think that we and chickens both eat chicken yolk?"
00:25:50,00:26:00,"Oh yes. Well, we and cows both drink milk. What? We and sharks both eat fish."
00:26:00,00:26:10,"Mind blown, Andy. Yeah, if you look in an egg, there's like a little tiny bit attached to the yolk,"
00:26:10,00:26:17,"and that's what would be the actual true egg, and the rest of it is just for, well, you sometimes get a"
00:26:17,00:26:25,"little red bit, don't you, in the yolk? Yeah, yeah. I'm speaking of male sex stuff. So female chickens,"
00:26:25,00:26:33,"they have sperm storage tubules, these called SSTs, they can keep male sperm alive inside them for up to"
00:26:33,00:26:40,"15 weeks. That's cool. Wow, it's way longer than mammalian sperm can survive. A lot of animals that do"
00:26:40,00:26:44,"that, it's so that they have a choice whether to, what's the word, fertilize? Yeah, yeah."
00:26:44,00:26:48,"Whether it's fertilize on that, is that true, chicken? It's true of hence, and they can, they can eject"
00:26:48,00:26:58,"inferior roosters sperm after sex. Brilliant, I want to see that. They eject up to 80% of the stuff they"
00:26:58,00:27:03,"receive. Wow. No, no, thank you. I want to see a rooster have sex with a hen and go, and that go,"
00:27:03,00:27:07,"was that good view? And her go, yeah, yeah, it was great. It walks 10 meters down the road, and then"
00:27:07,00:27:18,"it gets splattered, and she goes, just kidding, it was terrible. Okay, it is time for our final"
00:27:18,00:27:25,"fact of the show, and that is James. Okay, my fat this week is that all of the sandals won by the"
00:27:25,00:27:33,Pueblo people of New Mexico had enough space for six toes. Wow. Yeah. Did any of them have six toes?
00:27:33,00:27:43,"It was just a very bad shoemaker. It just kind of counts. So 3% of them had six toes, which is a lot higher"
00:27:43,00:27:49,than normal. Yeah. Normally it would be probably less than 1%. And it was the fact that they thought that
00:27:49,00:27:54,"people with six toes were especially good, and they were revered, and they were thought to be great,"
00:27:54,00:28:00,and they were associated with like important rituals and things like that. And so having six toes
00:28:00,00:28:05,"was good, and so researchers who have looked at the place where they live have found loads of sandals,"
00:28:05,00:28:10,"loads of sandal shaped stones, loads of pictures of sandals, and all of these have an extra toe."
00:28:10,00:28:15,Wow. That's incredible. So that kind of implies that the other 97% were pretending they had six toes.
00:28:15,00:28:19,"Maybe they were all wearing the six toe sandals. Yeah, maybe they have like little fake toes that"
00:28:19,00:28:25,"they used to stick on. Yeah, a little bit of play do. Can I just ask when were they around?"
00:28:25,00:28:30,"Okay, so they've been, they're actually still around the descendants of these people, the hoppy"
00:28:30,00:28:36,nace for reckons are supposed to be descended from them. But these particular times that looking
00:28:36,00:28:44,"at an area of a canyon in New Mexico, and they were living around 700 AD, 800 AD. So just over a"
00:28:44,00:28:49,thousand years ago. Okay. And the other thing is that they found that it's about 3% of the population
00:28:49,00:28:55,"had six toes, but it could be actually that it wasn't that high. The bodies that we find are ones"
00:28:55,00:29:00,"that have been especially buried, and it might be just the more revered people who have been buried."
00:29:00,00:29:05,"So maybe they had a normal incidence of toes, but we just know about them more because we only see"
00:29:05,00:29:12,"the special people. Yeah. Okay. They found a skeleton, haven't they, where the, the foot, which has"
00:29:12,00:29:17,"six toes has a special ornamental anklet worn around it, as if to say, check out my six toes."
00:29:17,00:29:21,"And the other foot, which has only got five toes on it, has no such decoration. There's more"
00:29:21,00:29:24,another strut of evidence that I did it. This was a revered trait. Yeah. You know how you're saying
00:29:24,00:29:29,"it might attract the opposite of sex. Yeah. Not the opposite of sex. Oh, the opposite of the opposite"
00:29:29,00:29:38,"of sex. Sex. But is there anything in, in genetics that if your mum and dad had six toes that"
00:29:38,00:29:42,you're in any way likely to inherit six toes? Yeah. Really? It's a genetic trait. Yeah. So we could
00:29:42,00:29:50,"actually just, within one generation, make new different humans. I mean, if we forced six"
00:29:50,00:29:54,"toes and we were able to breed with each other in a kind of weirdly awful dystopian way, I guess we could."
00:29:54,00:29:59,"Yeah, but if we decided it was more practical for humans going forward to have six toes, we could"
00:29:59,00:30:02,"actually just do that within. Well, it takes a long time. It doesn't, I don't think it was one"
00:30:02,00:30:09,"generation. You're not going to have to, like Clarks, don't need to worry. You know who else has six"
00:30:09,00:30:18,"fingers? Um, pandas. Oh, yeah. They all have this sort of extra little thummy protrusion on the opposite"
00:30:18,00:30:22,side from their first thumb. Right. It helps them to grip bamboo and it helps with support and
00:30:22,00:30:26,things like that. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Is it that it's not really a true thing that they call
00:30:26,00:30:31,"a pseudo thumb? Yeah. I think it's, it's like a bony protrusion isn't it? So you can wiggle it. It's"
00:30:31,00:30:35,"thumb-like, but they can't, yeah. But it serves the purpose that a thumb would be able to serve,"
00:30:35,00:30:40,"doesn't it? It grips. I think people have said that if if we were to pick a sixth digit, that another"
00:30:40,00:30:45,thumb on the other side will be the best one to have. That would be fantastic. Yeah. If you do lose a
00:30:45,00:30:50,"finger or a thumb, you could get a toe transplanted, which is quite common now, a quite a common"
00:30:50,00:30:54,"treatment for losing a finger. It's mostly to replace thumbs, isn't it? It's mostly to replace"
00:30:54,00:30:58,"thumbs. I quite like this interview with the guy who had it done, who said there's an operation"
00:30:58,00:31:03,which involves two surgical teams. One is to lock off the toe and the other is to prepare the thumb
00:31:03,00:31:09,"area to have the toe attached. And he said afterwards, the worst part of it was them taking the toe off"
00:31:09,00:31:14,"as, which seems quite obvious to me that that would be the worst part, as opposed to them putting"
00:31:14,00:31:20,"it onto the hand. But this was first done in 1897 by this Austrian surgeon called Carl Nicoladoni,"
00:31:20,00:31:25,"who, and it wasn't as successful, but it did, it did work in that he was able to turn a toe into a"
00:31:25,00:31:34,"thumb, and he did it by connecting the man's thumbless hand to his foot. So, I think if you're going to"
00:31:34,00:31:38,"replace your thumb with a toe, what you want to do is take the toe from the foot and put it on your hand,"
00:31:38,00:31:44,not take your hand and put it down though. That's what he had to do because he had to get the
00:31:44,00:31:48,"toe sort of used to being on the hand before he detached it from the foot. So, the man had to go"
00:31:48,00:31:55,"round for a long time. Because if you put the toe on some of his hand, he's going to go, ""What? It's so high up here!"""
00:31:55,00:32:01,They've got to get used to it. It's like this hand's just coming to stay for a while.
00:32:01,00:32:06,"Wait, the guy who's coming down to meet the in-laws basically. What exactly did the guy have to do?"
00:32:06,00:32:11,Right. Here's what the guy had to do. He had to bend over how his thumbless hand sewn onto his
00:32:11,00:32:16,"big toe, and then that allowed the big toe to get accustomed to being sewn onto the hand."
00:32:16,00:32:19,"The big toe wasn't detached. No, the big toe wasn't detached with the man"
00:32:19,00:32:22,"hand, so it's the end of a few weeks bent over with his hand attached to his foot, yes."
00:32:22,00:32:28,"So, we'd be like, ""Come on, Gem, we're off. I'm just tying my shoe off, is that right?"""
00:32:28,00:32:33,"You have to tie your shoe for three weeks, Gem."
00:32:33,00:32:40,"But it won't do you any good in terms of acclimatising, Shauny, if your toe is still attached to"
00:32:40,00:32:45,"your foot? Well, it's apparently, it did work. I can see it's not really deep in my"
00:32:45,00:32:49,"foot. You might attach the blood vessels, for instance, and they need to, they might be still"
00:32:49,00:32:53,"attached in one place, but also attached in the other place. I think that was it, yeah."
00:32:53,00:32:57,"If you look at images online, if people who've had their thumbs replaced by toes,"
00:32:57,00:33:02,"it's pretty easy to miss. Yeah. You could very easily meet someone, talk to them,"
00:33:02,00:33:07,shake their hand and not notice that this replacement is that. It is one of the most amazing
00:33:07,00:33:10,operate. Do you think you'd mention it if you saw someone and you thought that looked like
00:33:10,00:33:14,"that looked like a toe on that? No, because it's the embarrassment. It's like saying to a"
00:33:14,00:33:19,woman that you think she's pregnant and she might not be. You can't say what you've had that
00:33:19,00:33:27,"operation. What you were saying Anna about putting your thumb on your toe, it reminds me of, in the"
00:33:27,00:33:33,"shoulders, knees and thumbs, knees and thumbs. We've got to do it because Barry's here today,"
00:33:33,00:33:42,"and she's still sitting alone. It reminds me of, in the olden days, when they used to do have"
00:33:42,00:33:49,a nose job. So you had to have a new nose put on there and they would put skin from your arm
00:33:49,00:33:57,"to reconstruct the nose, but you had to have the blood supply from your arm at the same time as"
00:33:57,00:34:03,it's growing on your nose. So you used to have your arm attached to your face while the skin would
00:34:03,00:34:09,grow over your nose. So you would have people whose arm is attached to their nose for weeks on end.
00:34:09,00:34:15,"And there was one famous guy in Italy, I think, who had this done, but he didn't want to be having his"
00:34:15,00:34:22,arm over his nose the whole time. So he had his servants used to stand up. His servant had to walk
00:34:22,00:34:28,"around with his arm over his butt his nose the whole time, yeah. Wow, that's harsh. I hope the servant"
00:34:28,00:34:35,"never washed his hands to get him back. Just on toes, have you guys heard of the world"
00:34:35,00:34:41,"toe wrestling championships? No, it takes place in the UK and it is an annual event. The current"
00:34:41,00:34:48,"champion is Alan Nasty Nash. He won it in 2015. I'm not sure if the 2016 event has happened,"
00:34:48,00:34:54,but it's basically exactly what it says it is. It is just toe wrestling and they treat it very
00:34:54,00:35:02,"seriously. Each toe is inspected prior to it. They show it's not a thug. Yeah, so the contestants"
00:35:02,00:35:08,have their toes examined by qualified nurse before giving being given clearance that it's a unmodified
00:35:08,00:35:13,toe and that it can do it. And it was invented basically by four guys who were drinking and just so
00:35:13,00:35:19,annoyed that the UK just was never good at winning international sports. So it was never just a champion
00:35:19,00:35:24,who was from the UK. So they thought let's let's invent a new sport. It's only a matter of time
00:35:24,00:35:29,"before we teach the continent how to play this game and they come over to start the team. Exactly,"
00:35:29,00:35:34,"yeah. Do they have weight categories in toe wrestling? So is it, is it, you know, little tov,"
00:35:34,00:35:41,"little toe? It's always big tov, big toe, isn't it? Yes. And it's also, it's also men versus men"
00:35:41,00:35:47,"women versus women. So there's no, there's no plucky second toe which took on a big toe because that"
00:35:47,00:35:52,is a screenplay waiting for you written. But you can watch videos online and they all come across like
00:35:52,00:35:56,WWF wrestlers. They take it really seriously. And so some of the people in the top 100 at the
00:35:56,00:36:03,"moment, you do have not a hundred people. Maybe just top players. There might be a hundred."
00:36:03,00:36:09,"Alan Nasty Nash, as I mentioned before, current champion, Tom 100 meter Martin. And then there's"
00:36:09,00:36:15,"a guy called Paul Beach whose nickname is Tominator. Oh, very, very good name. It sounds like what happens"
00:36:15,00:36:20,when the characters out of this little piggy went to market grew up. I think that's what they're all
00:36:20,00:36:30,"doing now. This little piggy went wrestling. This little piggy became a thumb. Okay, that is it."
