00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 [trumpet]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Do you know what they put a hold back?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [cheering]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Stockholm!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 [cheering]

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am a sitting here with Anitzenski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 and once again we have a gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 and in no particular order, here we go!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 My fact is that Sweden has more than 4,000 cyborgs.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 [cheering]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 This will be a thing that I'm sure a lot of you know about.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Are there any cyborgs in tonight?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 [cheering]

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Oh my really?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 All 4,000!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Genuinely?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Oh that's a cyborg there?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 With your massive metal hand you just put in the air.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 [laughing]

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 What have you got?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 So you have a chip implant in your hand and RFID, little chip implant.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Cool, I need to trash a lot of the abuse and stuff I had.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 [laughing]

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 That's so cool!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Wow, so we've got cyborgs in the audience.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 This is a different gig to any gig we've ever done before.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 So this is it, Sweden is going cashless.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 A fifth of people in Sweden don't use ATMs anymore.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 And so more than 4,000 people in the country have these little microchips and they let's them pay for rail travel and food.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 And official rail firms, you know, register your hands and they, you can just pay with your hand.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And you can order DIY kits and there are sometimes people do it at parties, they have implant parties.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Yeah, yeah, it's chip and beer parties they're called fish and chips party.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 I don't know if that happens, I just made that one up.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 But if it doesn't, please start it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 You, cyborg, get on it.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 [laughing]

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 It's been around for a while, hasn't it?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 I've been trying to make this catch on and it feels like it is happening.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 So I think there was a girl called left anonym and I can't remember where she was from.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 But this is in about 2010 and she realized that a lot of the technology that people were advertising to have sort of implanted was quite expensive.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Of course, if you're under a quid.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 And so she was one of the pioneers of sort of biohacking yourself.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 And she just thought it inserting random things under her skin.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 At one point she said she inserted some device that she'd sort of made using a vegetable peeler and vodka to sterilize herself.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 [laughing]

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Wow.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 But now she's quite famous, so.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Sorry, she didn't put a vegetable peeler inside her body.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Because it wouldn't work if it's inside your skin.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 No, I wouldn't be able to peel anything with that.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 The first thing that's peeling is your own skin.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 No, it was she, I guess she opened up her skin with a vegetable peeler and inserted a little techy device.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Wow.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Well look, desperate times.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 That's amazing.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 I almost became a cyborg myself.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Did you?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Yeah, back in England, I did a TB thing where I was talking about cyborgs and they said,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 "Would you be up for having the little, it's rice-sized little RFID chip implanted in my hand?"

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 And I said, "Yes."

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And I went there and the guy came and he had it with him.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 And I got a call from my wife and she said, "If you become a robot man, you are not coming home tonight."

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 And yeah, but you could just bash down the dog probably.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 No, so imagine.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 So I had to fake the thing.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 So I still got the injection.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 It's a big, it's a big scary injection.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 It's like a straw and it goes in in between your forefinger and your thumb.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 And I had to push right in and I still have a scar from where I should be a cyborg.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Okay, so what you're saying is, your wife said you couldn't do it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 You still have a scar but you really didn't do it.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 And what powers was it going to give you?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 You can get on a bus and tap it like a Jedi and it will just go, "Boop!"

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 But it doesn't work if the UK does it.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 It wasn't working for you.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 It's not officially recognized in the UK.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 I think if you cut out the whole chip from a oyster card, it might, I presume.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Yes, it does.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 There was a guy who took out the chip from a oyster card.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 He didn't put it in his body but he put it on the top of a wand and he dressed like a wizard.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 So, yeah.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 He used to walk out to the oyster and go, "When you got in, open the osu!"

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 But there are lots of risks.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 It can go wrong.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 So, obviously, it's very safe to do but there are risks with the human factors.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 So this last November, a writer for the website, Vice.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 He got an implant and he wrote it up.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 And one of the first things you have to do with the one he had,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 you have to secure it with a pin number.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Unfortunately, he was at a party at the time.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 And he said he woke up the next day, hung over, and he couldn't remember the pin number for his own hand.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Well, luckily, he had it tattooed on his other hand.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 That is amazing.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Yeah.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 But actually, some people think that it is the mark of the beast to have these things.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 You know from the Bible, the idea that there's a mark which tells you if you're the devil or something.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 And apparently, the passage in Revelation 1315 says,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 "Also, it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell it unless he has the mark."

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 And that's kind of the idea that these people want us to have everyone to have these things

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 and you won't be able to buy things without it.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 So, what satan's come to earth to do is make sure we can get a free bus ride with our fingers.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 And also?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 He's going to start small.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Also, I haven't seen evidence of anyone paying with their forehead.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 I mean, you feel pretty stupid.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Well, that's why I was reading an FAQ by someone called Kyla Heffanen

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 because this person was talking about a, it was a company that was getting people to have these chips.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 And one of the questions was, "Do you have to lose your hand if you lose your job?"

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Which the answer is no.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 But then she also said to this thing about Revelation,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 it says, "It's in your right hand or your forehead,"

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 but she says, "Actually, many people get a microchip in the non-dominant hand,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 so it can't be to do with the devil."

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Well, I'm glad we finally cleared out whether or not it's the mark of the beast.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 You do get some hacks in the head, though.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 There's one of the, another sort of pioneer of this biohacking is what I call Neil Harbison

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 and his device is mostly in his head.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 And it's actually quite useful.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 So sometimes these things can correct problems that people have.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 And so he has acromatopsia, which is like extreme colour blindness.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 He can't see colour at all. He sees everything in grayscale.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 And so he's had this antenna sort of implanted and then it kind of comes over his head.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 So it looks like he's wearing one of those big reading lights or something.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 It's called an eye-bog.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And it's mounted into his Vogue Club, yeah.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 It's mounted into his skull.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 And basically, it receives signals from the visible and the infrared light spectrums.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 And then it translates them into sounds that he can hear.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 And so then he can, because he's an artist, so he needs to be able to paint in the right colours.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 And so he can match up the colours that he's got labelled with the exact colours that are around him.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 And it's very cool.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 And he also says that singing grayscale is more of a gift than a curse

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 because you see much better at night, apparently.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 So he sees better at night. He has a good memory for shapes

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 and they're very useful in the military, he claims, because they don't get fooled by camouflage.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 So they actually get employed sometimes in the military to be able to detect stuff.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Because you're not fooled by camouflage if you're not saying colour.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Because you can't do that green leafy coloured thing.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Looks a lot like all the other leaves.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 But surely absolutely everything looks like absolutely everything else.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 You want to stop.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Yeah, I don't know if I trust Neil at all, but that's his claim.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 There are smart gravestones these days.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 So in Johannesburg sometimes thieves will steal slabs of marble,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 because they can be very valuable.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 So these days the smart graves, they have a microchip in them.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 And if someone tampers with the smart grave, it sets off an alarm,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 it calls security, and it texts the relatives of the deceased.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 I think I would just make it go, "Woo!"

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 "Get off my grave stone!"

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 You can't text the robber.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 That only works if the relatives have turned up.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Oh, you mean the graves?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 As soon as it gets tampered, man.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 That's even better. That's even better.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 It couldn't be that hard to rig up just a single hand

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 about a foot below the soil to just go, "Blah!"

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 That is a brilliant idea.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Yeah.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 So good.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 Although he's going to freak you out every time you visit your grandma's grave.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Oh, God, I knew I shouldn't have stepped on that bit.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 It's very hard to put a chip, a microchip of this kind,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 into a starfish, bizarrely.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 And are they crying out for this biohacking as well?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 That's why you never see a starfish on the train.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 It's because it doesn't have the chip very sad.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 That's because you can't get the oyster in there, is that one?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Yeah!

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 So this was in a university in southern Denmark,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 and they put a microchip inside a starfish,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 and they came back to the tank a few days later,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 and it was laying there at the bottom of the tank.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 And they thought, "That's so weird, it's expelled the chip from..."

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 "How did this happen?" So they put chips into 53 other of these starfish

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 to see what would happen, and they monitored it,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 and they noticed that it took days,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 but it just moved it slowly out the body,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 but not through the point of entry,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 which is the most obvious place for it to go back out.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 It went almost in the opposite direction,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 and it would move 10% of the distance

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 from where it was put in every day to be expelled.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 And it has no problems doing it, no pain, as far as they can tell.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Maybe they thought that people would put it inward guarding the entrance.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 - Oh, yes. - Let me go out the back.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 I have a really quick fact about microchips

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 and about the inventions of microchips.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 So this is a fact from the Times newspaper,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 and it's about transistors, you know,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 the tiny switches that you can on microchips.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 So you used to be able to get thousands on,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 then you could get millions these days,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 you can get 30 billion switches on an area of microchip

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 the size of a fingernail.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 30 billion.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 So this is the fact from the Times,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 obviously, you know, transistors have had to get a lot smaller

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 over the years for this to be possible.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 The fact is, if a house had shrunk at the same pace

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 that transistors have, you would not be able to see the house

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 without a microscope.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Oh, that's how much they've shrunk over the years.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 And that is actually a lot like the most expensive flats in London these days.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 I just, one tiny thing I wanted to say about biohacking

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 is that it really serves a purpose for people

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 who have had certain problems, as I said before,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 and it serves a particular purpose if you've had legs amputated

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 or arms amputated and you have prostheses

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 and this kind of smart technology means that they can be really advanced.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 So I was looking at some people who've had smart technology in plants like that.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 And there's a personal trainer called Jack Ezz.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 And he was talking about the different prosthetic legs see house.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 So there are these companies which provide prosthetics for every occasion.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 So you can buy a whole bunch.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 And he said, "I've got my water legs that I wake up in.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 I've got my sports leg which is just a roughty, toughty

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 snatch it up and it won't break."

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 He said, "He's got an electric leg which is just for walking

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 but you don't really run in it.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 I've got a spare mechanical leg and then there's a pause."

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 And then he says, "Of course I've got my most important leg.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 I've got my wooden pirate's leg."

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that Queen Elizabeth I's ladies in waiting

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 would try on her underwear every morning to make sure it hadn't been poisoned.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 What a quick thinking excuse from that mage when the Queen came in.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 I wish I thought of that when my wife can't be that type.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 That didn't happen.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 But how would that work?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 How long would they have to wear the underpants for before they knew?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Good question.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 So first of all, it's quite controversial.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 What kind of underwear Queen Elizabeth wore?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 Because it wasn't very common that women would wear underwear those days,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 especially not a very wealthy women.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 But we do know, we know according to her accounts that she did have some draws

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 or, you know, knickers, but she definitely had stockings.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 She definitely had corsets.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 And in 1560 there was her secretary of state who was called William Cecil.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 She was worried that the Catholics were coming to poison her.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 And he realized that the back doors of the chambers were kind of places where servants came in and out

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 and no one really paid attention to the long dresses and to the tailors and the wardrobes.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 So he thought this was a perfect way that someone would be able to poison her.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 And so they decided that they were going to do this.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 And so the ladies in waiting would try on the royal underpants

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 and they would wait to see if there was any burning sensation.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 They didn't know about thrush back then.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 So that would be the worst thing, wouldn't they?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 If they had thrushed and then just someone gets executed, some laundress.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Actually, I always think that with foodtasters.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 What if you get your foodtaster who's allergic to peanuts or something?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Well, this was the weird thing.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 The foodtasters.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 They went way further than we would think of a foodtaster.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Now just trying it a bit.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 So they would sometimes kiss and lick the plates and the cups and the cutlery of the king.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 All his cutlery was pre-legged.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 All his plates, everything.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Apparently they would have to go kissing everything.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 They had to kiss the tablecloth, the seat, the cushion, on the seat, everything.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 I think Louis XIV employed 324 people specifically for that, didn't he?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 It takes a big team of people if you've got to lick every bit of cutlery.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Dinner's going to go cold if it's one guy.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 Edward the sixth of England had servant's test his chamber pot to see it was poisoned.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 I don't know how they tested that.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Was it splashed back then?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 That's going to get him?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Maybe content.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 No.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 I think it was the, you sneak in, you pounder, a pounder, a toilet lid with some hemorrhide that had a similar thing.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 So the idea is that there are poisons that can leach into your skin if you get your bare skin on them.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 So he might sit down on the chamber pot and it might come in that way.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Yes.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 I remember ages ago on the podcast we spoke about a, I think it was a king who sat down on the toilet,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 but there was an assassin underneath who put a sword up his bum.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 That's a slightly different thing.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 Like you're not going round.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 The king has been poisoned.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 You're not getting a, like a taster who goes around and then he's got a massive sword through his tongue.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 And he's going, oh, try to lick the toilet again, did you?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 It's true, that's why they call it arsenic, I think.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 She was paranoid and actually she wasn't paranoid, but it was Cecil who was paranoid and so he was the person who looked over her final years.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 And he does sort of sound like a pervert and I'm sure he wasn't, but when he makes this, we're not going to sue us now.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 He's bloody pervert.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 So yeah, he ruled that all garments that touched her body bare would be so expectantly looked into.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 And he used to warn her about all these poisoning threats, which there were coming from all around the continent.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 She had lots of enemies.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 At one point he warned her that they'd been threatened by the prospect of a poisoner who was going to be a burly Italian man with a black beard called Stefano.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Just look out for that.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Do you know the method that they had to detect poison? Because as well as testers and like the King's 300 official liquors, they had unicorn horns or what were supposedly unicorn horns, obviously they weren't.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 But you would wave it over your food like a wand at an airport or a security wand or a tube station.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 Yes, I got it.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 So they would wave it over food and allegedly, if there was poison in the food, the unicorn horn would sweat and start shaking.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 And we now know what these were. They were the tusks of novels.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Yes, and Pope Boniface had a stash of knives allegedly made from novel.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 They were made from novel and so if you touched your food and poisoned it, your cut root would start to sweat.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 And they would fully disintegrate if you poured something into them and they just fell to pieces or exploded.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 Then it was thought that was signified that something was poisoned.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 But they were sought after and royalty loved them. So there was a British explorer called Martin Frobyshire.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 And he did a big expedition and he came back at 1577 with a six foot long tusk and he said it came from a unicorn of the sea, which again was a novel.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 And the way he tested if it had the ability to neutralise poison is he put a whole bunch of spiders inside it and he said all the spiders had died and therefore it's a poison tester.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Very cool.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 The Queen Elizabeth kept it next to the crown jewels as like she really valued in that highly.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 You know Cleopatra. She killed herself supposedly with an aspas snake biting her.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 But the story about her death is that she experimented first with the idea of poisoning herself with deadly nightshade plant.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 And apparently she asked a slave to try the juice and she then observed the slave and found that the death was not as quick and painless as she would like.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 So she then went with the snake instead.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Amazing.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Chazinsky. My fact this week is that the world champion polo player builds swimming pools for his horses whenever they get injured.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Oh, it's so sweet actually.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Sorry, he builds a new swimming pool every time it gets injured.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 I think he builds one for each new horse that gets injured because you can't share a swimming pool as a horse.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 So not to contradict you, but I do think it's just one swimming pool that he gets them to swim in because he has a lot of horses.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 He, in fact, I think has the most privately owned amount of horses.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 He does, although you do have to have multiple pools.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 And in fact, this is a guy called Adolfo Cambiazo who's this amazing Argentinian guy who's been the world leader in polo for 22 years.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Actually, I was just wondering.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Do you think he has misunderstood how to play water polo?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Another team drowned again today.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Amazing, his world champion is never understood the rules.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 But yeah, he loves his horses.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 And so he like breeds, he breeds them all, all the horses that he competes with.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 He breeds personally and he grows special grass for them and feeds them this special diet on his massive farms.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 And he says if they have a little bit of pain or if they have a pooled muscle, then I dig a swimming pool for them where they do laps.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 And in fact, I was, I emailed today our producer, QI, who is called Pears Fletcher and he is very into polo.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 So I was asking him about this.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 And he was saying, this is actually quite common to give top end horses hydrotherapy.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 So it's kind of these small pools which are basically like a lock in a canal and with a treadmill at the bottom of them.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 And they just walk along them and they exercise against the resistance of water.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 Wow.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Or in Pears's case, he used to just pull horses through the middle of a river because that's the pool man's version.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 That's the way it is, yeah.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Yeah.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 This guy also, he's very big into cloning horses.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 He's done it many times.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 He's got one horse that he's cloned 14 times.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 And because he loves these horses and what's amazing about this, it's said that this particular horse that he's had done 14 times.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 That during matches, he'll even swap to a different cloned horse.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 That's like a tennis player changing a racket for the exact same racket.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 It's where the horse's whopping.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 So I didn't realise that in polo, you just swap horses constantly.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 So it split into these sections called chuckers.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 And it's sort of between four and eight about, I think it's about seven and a half minute periods.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 They're called chuckers that constitute a match in polo.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 And if you're a professional, you'll use at least one horse per chucker sometimes two.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 And you'll just quickly go and swap a horse.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 So yeah, he's got all these clones.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 And he's constantly like, you know, number one.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Number one, number seven, number five of the same, same varieties.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 Amazing. He's supposed, what was his name like?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 He's called Adolfo Cambiala.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Oh, yeah. He's supposed to be, is he the best polo player in the world?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 Yeah, the last 22.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 I read that sometimes he can gallop at 40 miles an hour for the entire length of the polo field, bouncing the ball on his mallet,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 with no one able to get anywhere near him before he just hits it into the corner.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Wow. And the other players like him so much, I think he's so great that they'll just watch him play instead of tackle him.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 That's incredible. Imagine playing against Federer and just standing there and be like, that's fantastic, sorry.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 That's a pleasure.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 This guy, Cambiasso, he's quite humble, because is he Argentinian?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 Argentinian.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Argentinian. He grew up in the farm in Argentina.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 And he was interviewed by the Financial Times in 2011.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 And he said, I will never be a millionaire and I don't want to be.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 And then the reporter pointed out that he is a millionaire.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 Many, many, many times all that.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 So, well, there is another kind of polo where you, I don't think, can change your animal halfway through.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 And that's Elephant Polo.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 So, I spent a bit of today, this happens a lot, particularly in Southeast Asia.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 So, it's different in some ways. The mallet has to be a lot longer.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 That's one element of the game. Of course. Of course.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 All the ball would have to be massive.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 Yes.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 All the Elephant's tiny.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 Yeah. So, they chose that worker out.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 The long mallet. Probably simplest.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 But I just, I started reading the rules, the official rules of Elephant Polo today.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 And they're just quite nice, you know. So, they obviously have to have a rule for what happens

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 if you fall off your elephant halfway through.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 They just stop.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 But also, you have to wear a traditional hat while you're playing Elephant Polo.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 That's really important.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Can it be any traditional hat?

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 No, we know it.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 Like, some people with a sun braero.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 No, they're really strict. It has to be a solo topy or, oh sorry, or any other polo hat.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 There you go. It can be any hat.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 That's after more hat.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 You've got to wear hat.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 But if you're, it says here, "Shoulder players or elephant drivers hat fall off, the game is not stopped,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 but the hat must be recovered immediately."

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Players and elephant drivers must not continue play without a hat being worn.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 I don't know why it's so important.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 What are you joking?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 You don't know why you need to wear a hat if you're riding in a quite violent and very fast-paced game on the back of an elephant.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 I think it's a protectance.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 It's like a helmet, isn't it?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 I think you said that.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Okay, yeah, yeah.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 Are you going to look like a right dickhead when you come up with your sun braero?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 So they stop play if they come off today?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 Because in the horse polo, you don't stop play if you fall off, but you did used to.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 So this is actually something that our friend Piers told me.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 It used to be that as soon as someone falls off, you have to stop.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 But in 1936, a British player called Humphrey Guinness, so he was playing a match

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 and he thought they were literally about to score.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 The opposition was about to score a goal.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 The ball was heading towards a goal.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 And so he just holds himself off his horse.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 And you have to stop.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 So they had to disqualify the goal.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 And then after that, they said, maybe we should change that rule because these fucking British dickheads are involved.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 We're going to have to move on in a second, guys, to our final phase.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 If you really wanted to reclaim the traditional polo image, you could play Cockboru,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 which is Kergistani traditional polo.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 So the ball is a dead goat.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 And the whole game is basically everyone's on a horse and it's really tiring to play, obviously.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Especially for the goat.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 Most of the game is just you and your team trying to pick up the goat.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 And the other team is also trying to pick up the goat, so you're just wrestling.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 It weighs about 40 kilos this goat.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 You just have to pick it up and carry it on your horse to the...

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 You have to sort of shove it under your leg in the saddle.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 That's a real sport.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 That's a really silly idea.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 There's also, you can, if you want to stay in the UK, you can play Penny Farthing Polo,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 which is actually quite a hardcore sport because the world leader, I think, in Penny Farthing Polo,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 is a guy called Neil Lawton.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 And he's the guy who trained Bear Grills, so he went up Everest with Bear Grills.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 He's been up Everest a few times, I think.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 He's gone around the whole of the UK on a jet ski.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 He's flown a June buggy from London to Timbuktu.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 He's been on a Shackleton Memorial Expedition to Antarctica.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And now he is competing in Sussex in Penny Farthing Polo Championships.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 Sad to clone.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 Okay, we need to move on to our final fact of the show.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 And that is my fact.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 My fact this week is to prevent spoilers getting out.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 Some Game of Thrones scripts were built to self-detonate.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Yeah.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 That's why they all have such bad injuries if you watch it.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 It's blooded in their hands.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Yeah, this was revealed by the guy who played Jamie Lannister in the show.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 The idea was, unfortunately, it's not as exciting as a mission impossible explosion of a script.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 I haven't seen that.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Let's say that.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Oh, damn it.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Yeah, that's the big bit of the movie when Tom Cruise's script explodes.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 He didn't know any of his lines after that.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 But yeah, so it is a digital script that they all get.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 And as soon as the scene has been shot, a button gets pressed somewhere,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 and every single copy disappears, it explodes into the cyber web.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Yeah.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Sorry.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 Wow.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 I'm in a room full of cyborgs that I used.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 Cyber web.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Cyber web has blown down.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 Yeah, you're right, it is all digital now, isn't it?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 So it means that the only paper on set is Starbucks Cups.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 I assume that's some sort of spoiler, but I can't work out.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 So they have a real problem with their stuff being spoiled.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 So people fly drones very near where they're filming.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 And this is a massive problem because they can just spot scenes being filmed,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 and you know, they can find out that way.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 So what Game of Thrones did when they were making it,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 they filmed some of their scenes, they were in Northern Ireland.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 They filmed some of their scenes very close to Belfast Airport,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 because it's a designated no drone area.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 But surely it's also a designated no dragon area.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 That's true.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Wow.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 So are there some shots where an easy jet just comes flying past?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 They also do have drones appers for when they can't fly near Belfast.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 So it's a drone killer that can intercept, like it's a digital thing,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 it can intercept drones and immediately force them to land.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Wow.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 That's scary.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 So I haven't seen Game of Thrones has now finished.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 I have been trying desperately to avoid spoilers.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 You both have seen it.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 James and Andy.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 And I thought--

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 Oh, it's amazing that the very end went no.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 Well, so today I was, again, looking,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 we're talking about Game of Thrones and spoilers,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 had to be very careful looking.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 And I found that, in fact, in America, there is a thing whereby,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 if you don't like someone, you can have this website called

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 spoiler.io, send a spoiler anonymously to someone that you hate.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Yeah.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 That's terrible.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Yeah.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 It costs 99 pennies American to do this.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 And you give them the number.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And there's an FAQ that I read on the page for, you know,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 how does this work?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 And so, you know, what inspired you to do this?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 They said that it was a lady who had done this

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 with an ex-boyfriend who she hated so much that she just kept texting

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 him Game of Thrones spoilers.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 And he thought that was amazing.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 I just need to do that.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 And the final question of the FAQ is, how do you sleep at night?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 And the guy wrote pretty well, actually.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 I have a machine that simulates the sounds of the ocean.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 He's fine.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Now, here's the shit thing.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 I went to check out the site and right at the top was the spoiler

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 of how it all ends.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 I would do you.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 That's right.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 I didn't set up the site.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 And I guess you weren't going on to the site in order to spoil your white.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 You know, that's fair enough.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 Yeah.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 That's on them.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 The worst people for spoilers are the actors in these shows, aren't they?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 Yeah.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 They are not to be relied upon.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 So, apparently Robert Downey Jr. is a particular bad one.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 So, he was involved when he was writing on a film a couple of years ago.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 And they actually made fake scenes for him to help write without his knowledge

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 that he wouldn't give away the actual plot spoilers.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 Yeah.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 There's a guy called Tom Holland who I think plays Spider-Man.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 And, well, you're not going to like him so much after this.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 He's so not trusting because he's given away, so he's leaked so many plot twists

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 in the past that he's never given full scripts to act out.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 He's just given the scripts bit by bit.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 And he's also made to act out a whole series of fake scenes

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 so that he doesn't know which is real and which isn't.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 No, but it's not.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 It's not even that.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 The real scenes that they're filming, a lot of the people that he fights

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 are CGI characters.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 They don't tell him who he's fighting in the CGI, in the real scene.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 He'll be like, "Who am I fighting?"

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 They're like, "You don't need to know."

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 And he'll say, "Well, what should I do?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 Just make some kick moves and stuff."

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 But how big is he?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 They'll give it away.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 We can't tell you.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 So, he has, because he's very famous for--

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 He says that--

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 He says that he has to act opposite a tennis ball sometimes.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 That's just what they use to show him where it is.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 They're all terrible.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 The Avengers.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 They're basically terrible at spoilers and like this.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 Because even so Mark Ruffalo, for instance,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 complained that he had to do five different endings for Avengers Endgame

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 so that he wouldn't know which one was the real one.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 Although in fairness, he did once accidentally livestream

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 the first 20 minutes of Thor Ragnarok on Instagram.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 So, you know, am I allowed to spoil Star Wars?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 Like the original trilogy, guys.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 You've had time.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 You've had time to see it.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 So, this is the really weird thing.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 About two years before the second Star Wars film was released,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 Dave Pratt, who was the huge guy who was the physical body of Darth Vader,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 he was speaking at a fan event.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 He was speaking to over a thousand fans.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 And he started just imagining what's going to happen

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 in the next few films.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 And he joked that at the end of the third film,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 it would be revealed that Luke and Darth Vader were father and son.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 He revealed this two years before the film came out.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 No one knew at this point.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 Wait, so that wasn't a coincidence.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 He had no idea.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 Wait, so was it possible that they stole that idea off him?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Probably.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Amazing.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 He wrote an autobiography which was called "Straight from the Force's Mouth."

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 Which is good.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 I thought a better title would have been "The Empire Strikes Hardback."

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 I would have been.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 And I told that to someone who met him and he went, eh.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Apparently.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Yeah.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 It's so good attempt at being polite with him there.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Spoiler is obviously, it's hugely irritating if you follow something

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 and you have a spoiler get told to you.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 It can really bring up anger.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 In fact, there was a story that was in the paper a few years back

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 in Antarctica, two Russian science researchers who were living there.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 There was a stabbing incident and the reason was because one of the science colleagues

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 kept revealing the ending of all the books that this guy was planning to read.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 And it got so aggravating that he stabbed him.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 The guy survived.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 But yeah, that's...

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Well, things get pretty tense and I'm talking to you, don't they?

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 Yeah.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 On the spoilers, the first use of the word "spiler"

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 to mean what we mean it today, what it is today was in 1971.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 It was in the magazine called National Lampoon.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 And the idea was they were going to put the spoilers of horror movies

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 so it would reduce the risk of unsettling and dangerous suspense in their viewers.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 So if you didn't really want to be shocked by a movie,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 you could read these spoilers and it would tell you what was going to happen.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Oh, really?

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 So you're actually doing someone a favour?

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 Yeah.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 That was the idea, yeah.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Well, there have been studies which have claimed different things about

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 whether spoilers affect your mood and your enjoyment of the thing.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 Some studies say that spoilers make you enjoy a story more

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 because you sort of know what's going to happen.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 You don't know how they're going to get there.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 And another study has claimed that it makes you enjoy a story much less

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 and that you get really consistently.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 You find it less fun if you know what's going to happen.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 But the ones who say that you enjoy it more,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 I think are complete bullshit, I have to say,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 because they make you read a short story

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 and they just tell you at the start what the end is.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 The whole thing is that it's something that you've been invested in

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 and built up to over weeks and weeks, isn't it?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 So you can't really simulate that.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 But then you love Dickens, of course,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 which, and they have spoilers at the start of every chapter, don't they?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 They tell you what's going to happen.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 They do.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Yeah, but it's not.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 I don't love him like for the thrill.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 I don't love him for the big reveals at the end of every chapter.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Although that used to be such a big thing.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 So spoilers, sort of the idea of a spoiler came about in the mid-19th century,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 really, in the concept that that might be a really bad thing to reveal the ending.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 But just before that, Dickens was writing the old curiosity shop.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 And there's, and I'm really sorry if you haven't read this,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 but I'm afraid you're too late.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 So this little nail is perilously ill at one point in the old curiosity shop,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 and you probably know it was released in installments.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 And the installments got to America after they had been released in Britain.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 And people were so desperate to know what happened to little nail,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 because they just knew that she was ill,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 that whenever the British people arrived in the New York docks

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 and started disembarking the shit, they would riot.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 They would literally riot at the docks begging them to tell them what had happened to little nail.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 And they'd be screaming, "Is she alive? Is she alive?"

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Wow. And you actually, you didn't give anything away about whether she was alive or not?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 No, I didn't. You're right. You're right, she dies.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 Yeah.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 We're going to have to wrap up, very shortly.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 Just a couple of really quick things about Game of Thrones.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Yeah, let's go for it.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 So this is, I don't quite believe this, but...

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 So a lot of it's filmed in Northern Ireland,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 because it has the right kind of terrain and stuff.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 According to the LA Times, almost 1% of the population of Northern Ireland

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 has been an extra in Game of Thrones.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 Wow.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 And there's 1.9 million people who live there.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 I've got a friend who was in Game of Thrones,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 and he was there the whole time,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 and literally you cannot see him at all.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 Because they just have so many extras, and they're just the battle scenes are so massive.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 Yeah.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 So I've seen him dressed as a dothraki,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 but we just never saw him on screen at all.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 Right.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 Believe me, we tried.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 In China, it's very common that people will download it illegally,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 and that's because you can't watch it legally,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 but China disapproves of all sex, violence, and supernatural horror.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 So, in 2014, one internet person said that,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 "Okay, they've caught all the fight scenes, all the nude scenes, all the dragons."

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 I guess that's okay if all you want to watch is a medieval European castle documentary.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 That's so good.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 And you're playing it pretty fast and loose with the word "documentary", I think.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 Yeah.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 I like that initially it was meant to be a short story.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 No.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 Really?

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 When he started writing it, he thought this is going to be a great short story,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 and then he said, "Whoa, this is still going. What's going on here?"

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 And here we are, all these years later.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 One of my favorite things is that during the filming,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 this is just a little filming fact about it,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 Amelia Clark, who played mother of dragons.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 She was doused in so much fake blood during a scene where she has to eat the horse's heart,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 that during a break, when she went to the toilet,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 she was so covered in this blood that she couldn't get herself off the toilet.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 She was stuck there as a, yeah, the blood had sort of just congealed.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 If only she'd had a toilet tester.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 Yes.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Does she die in the end by a sword at the barn by any chance?

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 Imagine if the answer was yes.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 That's how they all die.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 That would be amazing.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 That would be incredible.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 It's just one character that you never see,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 but he's just a serial sword of the bug murder.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 The liquor.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 He's the only other guy survived.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Never see him because he's busy licking shit all over.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 Okay, that is it.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000

 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 Thanks so much, Stockholm.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 That has been amazing.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 That has been awesome.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
