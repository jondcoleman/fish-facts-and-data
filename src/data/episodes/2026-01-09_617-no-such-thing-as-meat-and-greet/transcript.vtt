00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish, where we were

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.720
 joined by the absolutely brilliant Lou Sanders. Now you'll remember Lou because

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.760
 she's been on fish a couple of times I think, she's been on QI many many times,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.960
 she's an absolute favourite of ours, she's so so funny, so so brilliant. There's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.400
 loads of things I could tell you about her, she's written books, she's on tour next

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.560
 year, but really the best place to find out everything about her is to go to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.440
 Lou Sanders that's l-o-u-s-a-n-d-e-r-s dot com and all of the information about

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.520
 her is there if you want to learn more, which I bet you will because she is a real

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.880
 tour de force and she definitely shows that off in this episode today and of

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.480
 course it would be remiss of me not to mention club fish go to patreon.com/nosuchthingsafish

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.960
 and find out everything there is to get there there is merch there's bonus stuff

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.440
 others all sorts you know where to go patreon.com/nosuchthingsafish and find out more

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.320
 not much more to say apart from on with the podcast

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:22.480
 hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.160
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Shriver I am sitting

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.720
 here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Lou Sanders and once again we

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.800
 have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.840
 last seven days and in a particular order here we go starting with fact number

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.960
 one and that is Lou. Well you're more likely to get your way if you ask

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.440
 one for a favor in the right ear and not the left ear it's called right ear

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.560
 dominance okay so yeah interesting where we're sat you're speaking into

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.680
 and these right ear yeah and into our left ears can I get more money for the polka yes

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.600
 it wouldn't work if I asked Dan that no no um right to write a dominance is this

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.520
 like being like left or right handed or left or right footage is to do with the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.280
 hemispheres of the brain and now I'll consult my phone

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.080
 you got the baby that's right without looking at I was quite impressed myself actually

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.960
 yeah so it's called right ear advantage I said that didn't I for verbal

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.720
 commands and persuasion can you imagine sort of like looping round and going

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.720
 through the other way to sort of ask yeah you've got to do it subtly yes you've

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.200
 got to make your way over getting out of the bed going round to her side yeah it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.720
 does make sense to sleep on the right side of the bed right yes yeah that is

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.680
 how we're positioned in bed is that right yes I don't want to hear how you're

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.920
 positioned in bed who's mixing the who's right here for now look at my right

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:05.160
 I heard it was top to jail with you I thought it was you on the top bunk that's

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.440
 very cool yeah um that's a very good idea I've you would see now I wonder if

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.740
 you look at classic photos a big business meals and so on whether or not you

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.560
 see you know who's on the right side of Trump for example yeah who's on the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.640
 right side of history so do we know why it's why this well let me consult

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.640
 AI is now you when you search engine something AI comes up first she's annoying

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.760
 because they're using all the water um don't get me started language I left

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.920
 hemisphere dominance language and verbal information are primarily

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.640
 processed by the left hemisphere of the brain in most people in most people oh the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.480
 right here is more directly wired to the left hemisphere faster processing

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.440
 information received is interesting through the right ear reaches the language

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.240
 processing center in the left hemisphere more quickly I don't know oh here we go

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.240
 this is more interesting a study conducted in Italian nightclubs where

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.400
 researchers asked clubbers for a cigarette in their left ear or right ear found

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.280
 that requests made in a right ear were twice as successful really yeah I'd say I

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.160
 don't want to cigarette in my left ear Italian nightclubs the cradle of science I've

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.360
 done my own research in there no no one one of us sitting around this table for

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.380
 a particular reason has better hearing than the other three irrespective of

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.960
 okay a major hearing damage okay I mean have better hearing women have better

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.880
 hearing than men because we are supposed to get up for the baby I suppose that'll

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.840
 be it is it better hearing in terms of like you know the higher a sound goes

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.360
 and then only dogs can hear it do they have a higher range that's for sure they

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.920
 do yeah yeah but it's also player sound at any part of the range and women will

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.720
 be more likely to perceive it than men and our eyes are better as well so we can

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.600
 see more colors than men yes it's not like why are we so downtrodden when we're

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.120
 actually better um oh it's made you a stronger yeah yeah you've put all we're

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.000
 emotionally strong if someone's fighting you you can't say oh I can see 20 colors

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.360
 here yeah we're emotionally strong that's true so you tell me how often are you

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.520
 getting into fights and how often are you seeing and hearing things every day

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.960
 you're seeing and hearing fights even you not one month is it I am from the

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.880
 north one interesting thing about women having better hearing is they can hear

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.720
 higher things and that means that there was a thing where people were making

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.760
 household appliances and they'd have a very high sort of hum but the people who

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.040
 are making them were often men so the men couldn't hear it and then they'd sell

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.480
 them and the women were using them this is like in the 70s and 80s yeah and the

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.040
 women could hear it that's that's like the um it's a sort of invisible women

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.920
 that book yes yeah yeah it's all about how things are not built with women in

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.080
 mind but that's so funny that men have been making like screaming blenders

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.640
 yeah and perceivable to them another way to terrorize us congratulations

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.840
 it's weird that this was done in Italian night clubs yeah because I think there's a

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.320
 big history of make your place your job you know yeah I think there's a big

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:24.800
 history of Italian ear science really yeah so Alessandra Volta was the

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.800
 count Italian count the battery and the battery needed a lot of it wow electrical

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.640
 experimentation and he was one of the pioneers of electrifying ears why was he

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.480
 electrifying ears he was electrifying everything he could get his hands on but

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.040
 one of them invented the battery what are you gonna do yeah that's USP basically

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.280
 going around night clubs just battery in people right yeah but there were lots

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.440
 a lot I think lots of Italian pioneers here's another thing two people around

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.360
 this table have better hearing than the other two irrespective of Lou getting

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.960
 about them male female thing forget about me and Lou because we live by the sea

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.240
 you got it well not within the city actually people who live in the city have

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.960
 better hearing oh so you're me yes sorry that's right and this is according to a

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.040
 study at the University of Giesen in Germany and they found that people in

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.880
 quiet villages they don't have so good hearing because they don't have to

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.640
 fight over the traffic and stuff all the time and the absolute worst hearing of

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.760
 anyone in the world where do you think they live the quietest place quietest

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.960
 but then there's an extra thing on top it's not Wales it's quiet but there's a

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.040
 background noise so like near and nuclear reactor because it's low population

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.680
 but the nuclear reactor's humming it's not that it's East Asian villages because

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.880
 they have a very quiet life that every now and then they get huge firework

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.200
 displays and that really damages their hearing but then they also have the

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.240
 quiet thing I was looking into is inevitably landed on Van Gogh because that's

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.720
 where all year research will get you to and I was reading about when he was

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.600
 getting his ear treated after after an injury to it and I can't tell if this was

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.600
 the injury where he lobbed it off or if he had another injury where he just

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.960
 cut it with a razor and needed it looked after either way he saw a doctor

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.760
 called Dr Felix Ray and as a thank you he gave Dr Felix Ray a portrait of Dr

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.480
 Felix Ray so he did one over a number of days handed to him to say yeah really

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:29.520
 beautiful painting I've seen it Dr Ray hated it as his wife so for the next 10

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.840
 years they used it to block up a hole that was in the chicken coop but they had

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.320
 outside their house they have the painting on the inside of the

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:43.200
 house that's where it stayed for 10 years it was eventually sold off and it's

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.240
 now in a museum and it's estimated to be worth about 50 million but they get

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.760
 the money for it did they get some money for I think no I think it got you know

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.120
 just picked it on to someone else if they got any money would be in a small

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.680
 amount yeah wow could I should have kept that fan art that someone sent me with a

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:08.320
 boggly eye they tagged me in I thought I'm not reposting that if you do make

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.080
 fan art people you want them should we post it make it on the right side of

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:19.320
 flattering sure here's another really famous here on science history okay the

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.800
 year on the rat the year on the rat the year of the rat the year of the

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.160
 house does anyone ever yes I do and here was grown on the back of a rat the year was

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.680
 grown on the back of a rat a human here a human ear was grown on the back of a

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:38.120
 rat and people science has been doing this for at least 20 years on and off the

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.560
 first one was done in 1997 wow I think there's a scientist the original the

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.640
 Vacanty mouse I think the scientist was Joseph Vacanty talent may have been

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.200
 Italian it certainly sounds Italian oh yeah they love the ears yeah and he

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.440
 basically he was a pediatric surgeon and one of his colleagues said we really

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.800
 struggle with recreating good ears for children of child's lost an ear and an

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.480
 accident or something it's really hard to shape the cartilage to make it

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.280
 yeah because you can't hear out the mouse can't hear out of that massive ear on

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.820
 its back kind of no it's not like it's not a working ear it's just the

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.360
 outside bit it's it's the same as the shell exactly it's the kind of the

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.560
 external yeah and they grow it and they would put a they put a frame on the

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.000
 mouse or the rat that grows the ear so it grows into the shape of the ear

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 because there's a mold yes it's like forcing a cucumber to the right place I didn't

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.600
 know that detail I just thought yeah actually think it was like the

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:41.320
 mouse is going fuck I didn't think it was that fairly function I don't have any

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:47.440
 cigarettes to give you I'm sorry no business so and his breath weirdly the

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.760
 vacanti vacanti and his brother had both worked on the same problem but they've

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.000
 keep doing it the latest one I think was in 2016 and they said we're going to

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.120
 move to human trials so yeah I was in growing the ears on animals and then

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.440
 implanting them into humans yeah so far the trailer's gone cold I believe so

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.200
 can we just grow a whole human if we put it in a mold if you put a mold of a

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.360
 human no there is a market for that is there what doesn't do anything does it

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.200
 but it's a human doll oh yeah yeah yes yes like the ear it wouldn't it would

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.960
 just be a it would just be the shape yeah I don't think there's a grown on the

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.120
 backs of mice as far as I understand well you couldn't put a high human body on

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.560
 the back of a mice it would topple over yes absolutely yeah whatever also it

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.040
 wouldn't be able to get back into its hole would it because the human would be

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.400
 too this is you know it's obvious it's obvious it's a terrible idea yeah I don't

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.560
 have to be the one to say that come on boys come on you're supposed to be

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:47.840
 braining you can't go ahead of body on a mouse come on yeah real and we've been

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.680
 doing it for as you say since 1997 yeah multiple years but no ear has ever

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:58.320
 gone from a mouse to a human I believe not so I'm to move on I think it's time to

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:06.320
 double them but also you always read things in the paper that says oh they've

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.200
 figured out a way to do this and then you don't hear any more about it I think

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.960
 it's like to give us a bit of a lift and a bit of a story but they're not really

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.720
 planning on doing anything with it like the the thing that ain't plastic the little

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.000
 bacteria yeah where's that gone I think it's probably when I was talking about it

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.600
 they let go of disappeared yeah yeah you know they give us a bit of a good

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.560
 news yeah oh they've saved sight or something I read the other day right come on

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.600
 then it's it's always a very early development

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.680
 yeah don't waste my time yeah come back to me it's because they need to do the

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.760
 headlines to get funding yeah yes so they do the big oh we're going to save

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.880
 this yeah the newspapers say we're going to save this and they're like no we just

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.720
 really just want a few grand to buy some nice on the hearing front what is it

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.160
 with people that talk really loudly I've got two friends that talks so loudly

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.840
 they must be deaf yeah for now says that I talk extremely loudly and I don't

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:10.480
 think I do no she's always going on about how you shout out her a lot yeah yeah

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.760
 when I when I've been with you guys that might be what she's talking about my

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.960
 rage I mean I've got like 15 kids to shout over we do and also when you're

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:25.440
 sleeping top to tails it does take yeah the blankets yeah we should be

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.320
 bouncing oh feel like we have a nobody facts oh we've done loads oh we've done

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.920
 tons if you've got bigger ears do you think you hear better or worse or the

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.920
 better better you're right it's one of those facts that's just what you would

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.240
 imagine it's so enjoyable but that's the case yeah that bigger is mean it's only

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.240
 it's very very slight it's 15 decibels difference which is basically you can't

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.760
 really tell the difference but yeah it does make a difference like if you have

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.280
 the bigger nose can you smell better probably not right because it doesn't

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.400
 necessarily mean your receptors are any better it's you can take more air and

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:06.080
 in one sniff why don't you let us know dad okay wait that's got a big big nose I've

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.360
 got a small nose and you make a smell and we'll see who smells it first yeah

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:17.160
 make a smell make a smell right now I'm doing it if you can smell it at home do let us

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:28.400
 know podcasted QI dot com okay it is time for fact number two and that is James okay

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:35.360
 my fat this week is that the town of Ramsgate is named after a gate for Ravens

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.880
 very confusing that's so cool it is really cool well I think is wonder Ravens

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:47.040
 need a gate it's a gap in the cliffs where the Ravens go in I thought you could

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:53.920
 say it's a gap in the market we think it comes from the old English word gate

00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:00.360
 meaning gate and laughing which means Raven and that became Ramsgate

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:06.000
 laughing also sometimes means warlord so it could be gate of the warlord and

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.600
 Daniel Defoe thought that Ramsgate was originally called Romansgate and it's

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.880
 where the Romans landed because it was actually where the Romans landed but

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:20.280
 can we just say for maybe for international listeners from the north or

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.080
 listeners from the north or west of England or other parts of the UK who may

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.480
 not know about the bustling metropolis of Ramsgate yes for Ramsgators yeah well

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.680
 part of fan it which is on the southeast coast that's a circular no it's a

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.080
 it's it's it's because it's quite connected to quite a few places that you may

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.120
 have heard of margate broad stairs and Ramsgate kind of come as a trio you've

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.040
 got Westgate as well it's a it's a town it's a town on the you're trying to get

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.800
 to it's a town it's just say if you want us to say it's a town you say it I just

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.120
 think that's referencing can I just say it's a margate I think the fact was the

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.440
 town of Ramsgate you're right you're absolutely right you're right it's a classic

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.320
 English seaside town in many ways yes yeah it's lovely and it's it's so

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.480
 interesting I had no idea how interesting it is is it where you live where are

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.680
 you no no I've no I know I know I do what you're talking about no I was I would

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.360
 live there from two to four then I move next door to broad stairs now I live in

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.880
 Margate so do the trilogy oh it's that going or down market to go well they all

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.320
 changed the Ramsgate was of dive and then broad stairs is a bit of

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:34.640
 fancier then Margate was a dive but now it's fancier you know what regular

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.400
 listeners will know about Margate because Dan goes on about it so much yeah

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.720
 because I live there yeah it's not just because it's nice it's nice I really

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.680
 excitedly I went to see a school today it's one that my daughter might go to and

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.840
 they said that every year they take all the kids on a trip to Margate and I

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:56.480
 got to say sold yeah yeah well I think if it was a trip to Ramsgate that'd be

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:03.200
 even better because it's stunningly interesting it's one of those towns where

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.920
 it's quite it's reasonably close to London and then for a spell in the what

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.680
 18th and 19th century it was one of the most fashionable places on the planet

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.160
 incredibly beautiful buildings incredibly rich history in terms of

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.120
 connections to Europe it's got weight troze it's got a weight troze Charles Darwin

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.840
 had a flat did a lot of his barnacle research in the area

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:30.480
 van Gogh van Gogh oh that brings it of chicken coop famous wow

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.800
 himself spent three months as a teacher a lot of artists do you go to the

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.440
 area because the lights are very beautiful you see this one rising Ramsgate and

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.160
 you see this on set in Margate something to do with those yeah

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.120
 geography teaching a teaching assistant I think teaching assistant who's TA who

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.040
 was who was van Gogh van Gogh I mean you're actually being the teacher in the class

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.440
 where van Gogh is a teaching assistant right that's quite trick if you're the art

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.360
 teacher as I'm presuming he was yeah and you're trying to teach something he's

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:06.560
 in the pack of it weird yeah but it was also branded in world or one as the most

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:12.680
 bombed seaside town in the UK basically the first blitzes hit Ramsgate and they

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.120
 had an amazing way of dealing with that which I'm sure Andy you must have

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.640
 read into and enjoyed the tunnels that they built yeah oh tunneled into the

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.440
 cliffs they dug and I think it was for the second mobile was the big bombing

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.720
 grades yeah the worst time in the first mobile the second mobile they just dug

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.200
 this cave complex into the bliss I think they can get 60,000 people down there they

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.840
 quite so it's really I didn't know this and I've been to these caves while I've

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.120
 been to the gift shop we didn't quite make it into the caves no but we were we

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.880
 we're going back isn't the gift shop usually at the end of this

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.520
 specter you would get in for free by going through the gift shop walking backwards

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:51.160
 to the side style so what's it saying a rock yeah it's like a model of a cave

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.280
 what is it no it's where you actually buy the tickets to go into the cave but

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.520
 they can only take you as a tour group so you can't just wander in so it's huge

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:05.880
 and initially why it was built was it goes deep into away from the ocean in land

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.680
 and it was for the local town members to have a tunnel that would get them

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.200
 straight to the seaside so it wasn't built initially for the bombing but they

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.760
 were they were already live at the seaside but it's just a quick way rather than

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.120
 going through the town yeah because there's a little there's a little there's

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.920
 a little rail yeah it was trains exactly I'll go above ground what if you need to

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:31.960
 pop to boots or something also people get a piss of that tunnel yeah surely not

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.880
 surely not in Ramsgate oh well do you want to story about Ramsgate that's not

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:41.160
 very high brats please I years ago I was thinking why don't I just buy in Ramsgate

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.040
 this was like years and years ago and I felt it's quite nice and then I was

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.560
 seriously considering it and then I went to the toilet Ramsgate station

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:55.920
 before I got on the train and someone had done a shit a loft of the radiator in

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.360
 the waiting room a loft of the radiator yeah it's just they've they've positioned

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.360
 themselves on top of the radiator so the toilet was like two seconds through a

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.680
 door toilets there but they said no what I'll do is pull down my pants in the

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.160
 waiting room and just poop on a radiator no get out broad stairs do you you

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.280
 don't get that much in broad stairs definitely humor well I haven't got time to

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:24.600
 do you know the world's biggest weather spoons is in Ramsgate I go there

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.960
 probably do you do actually I do I don't because he he was like a pioneer of

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.800
 Brexit not you know but you can get a pint of ruddles for £1.20 all right here

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.920
 we go okay here we go yeah it does it's Matt is great to list it yeah it's

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:45.120
 1,500 people it can hold which is the same as Shakespeare's Globe wow it's an

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.880
 old ballroom yeah it's an old ballroom and it's really beautiful it's right on the

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:59.000
 beach it's a it's a great it's a great big pub it's true I'm with Lou it's a

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.800
 shithole it's a two-minute walk from the caves by the way if anyone there's some

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:10.240
 lovely little independent wine bars up there say that do you know the home for

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:18.040
 smack boys yeah no that's in Ramsgate what is it it's what does it sound like

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:26.280
 where Max is Congregate I know come on I like boys where people who worked on

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.920
 smacks are they yeah fishing boats fishing smacks yeah and they went out with

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.160
 boys as young as sort of probably about 14 were going out working on the fishing

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.640
 boats and said this was a place to give them food and accommodation and you know

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.360
 stability yeah still if you walk across from this building it still has the words

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.680
 like something like home of the smack boys on the side which if you don't know

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.200
 what that means is quite confusing yeah what it's attached to is the sailors

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.560
 church which is this tiny church you can fit about 30 people in there I've been

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.720
 into it multiple times I've never seen a service done there but I started

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.400
 reading into it and there's reviews by I didn't know this was a thing mystery

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:10.520
 worshipers so it's like mystery shoppers yeah is not great so yeah you would have

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.040
 mystery shoppers who would do that they mystery worshipers are people who go

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.680
 into a church they experience it and they report back on a survey that they're

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.680
 questioned about did you connect with the almighty yeah exactly level of

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.480
 spiritual well questions are like how full was the building did anyone welcome

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.000
 you personally were the puse comfortable and the person who filled it in was

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.880
 slightly slightly odd was the puse comfortable the puse had very low back

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.960
 support so I thought on balance no it was uncomfortable off balance mark yeah

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.160
 did the service make you feel glad to be a Christian I didn't feel miserable

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.000
 that's an accomplishment

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.080
 someone who used to regularly go to church yeah if any new person came into our

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.880
 church everyone would know yeah because it would always be the same family

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.960
 everyone would sit in the same places and stuff like that if someone sat in your

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.520
 place you would know immediately that they were a secret mystery

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.680
 worshiper mystery worshipers the smallest church in the world maybe is in

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.880
 over just a really I think so every time someone asked me if that's really true

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:16.120
 our panic but I think that house how small will be talking tiny can a fit one

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:22.760
 person and a lot of people obviously I've not got the answers hey Andy I thought

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.040
 you would hate Ramsgate because your hero hated Ramsgate Jane Austen correct

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.400
 really why well she thought it was a place of distribute as seaside results were

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:38.140
 in her day really sure and apparently according to Kent historian Norman

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.040
 Thomas she mentions it in pride and prejudice in Mansfield Park and she's

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.200
 never complimentary and either I've not read any Jane Austen so I think it's

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:54.280
 where mr. Darcy's sister is nearly seduced by mr. Wickham in I think it

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.800
 happens in Ramsgate it's at the place is that the one where mr. Darcy leaves a

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:04.440
 turd on a radiator yeah and that's when Lizzie Bennett knows that he's the one yeah

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.320
 I think her brother lived down there for a while captain Austin yes she had a load

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:15.040
 of brothers who were navy or military and I think it was a place where you know

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:20.600
 this thing scarlet fever not the disease is where it's basically sorry just

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.960
 cut out everything I said about the smoothies you know if you wonder why it was

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:31.340
 quite the last couple minutes no it's one of the smallest work in church is in

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:38.560
 England Dover's tiny chapels and Edmund of Abeddon is the only church still in

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:44.540
 existence that was dead and by that point you get quite bored right you got it

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:51.880
 it's a small job it's a small get over it sorry what are you saying nothing

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.320
 important yeah I got I got quite a nice message which is something that

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.640
 usually would be reserved for drop us a line but a listener who runs a local

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:07.080
 thing called Margate mushrooms so as Andy and James or no I've been taking

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.720
 lion's main mushrooms it's a little drip to help your concentration we have to

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.140
 keep this for the advertising bit of the show we have to put it in a

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.320
 break we can't just work at it we can't just work at it what turns out the

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.420
 person who makes this stuff listens to our show I had no idea and she

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.340
 messaged me she listened to our episode about crafts that are going in

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:29.320
 danger and virtually out Ramsgate is home to one of the very few chainmail

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:34.660
 makers living in the UK so a guy named Nick Chexfield so he has a lifetime

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.060
 achievement award from the Heritage Crafts Association and she was saying

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.740
 because she knows him or it's only spoken to him and she was saying he's so

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:47.060
 good at understanding chainmail that if he looks at old centuries-old chain

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.740
 mail he can tell if the maker was right or left-handed he can tell if they

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:55.500
 were getting tired as they were making it who's fact checking him you know what I

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.620
 mean I could go on and go like yeah okay this guy's as such a

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.480
 serious you know well he's dead he's dead 100 years ago so that's easier to

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:10.500
 fact check well he's got he's got a website Nick Chexfield Nick Chexfield

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:17.300
 website no it doesn't good and I would like some free mushroom jobs as well would

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.660
 you right but check this out I'm the website he has an advice hotline for if you

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.420
 have emergency questions about your chainmail now this is gonna come in you

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.380
 so she might just drop that down what circumstances do you need emergency

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:35.860
 advice about it like if a hundred crossbow balls are flying towards you

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:42.060
 okay does he sell much do you think I don't know if he sells much and I don't I

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:46.380
 assume the the advice hotline is for people who are in museums who might have

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.180
 damaged the chainmail and they need some advice on what to immediately do

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:54.400
 he's doing great anyway that's a that's a craft rams engaged and he's

00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:00.260
 down the rams get a hero yeah along with oh backpack really my broad studs

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:06.300
 backpacks was supposed to post again again I will have to fact check that well

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.700
 see you in a few minutes and then the book goes get shorter is that the guy who

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.700
 created backpacks a backpacks and I'll post gate right right how do you

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.980
 retain all this information this is crazy to me yeah well the good thing is I

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.620
 can keep staying stuff and if I get it wrong that just cut it out but I couldn't

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:31.460
 even remember that I booked account for myself the other day fascinating that you

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:40.540
 will need to remove your chainmail for that okay it's time for fact number three

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.380
 and that is Andy my fact is the scientist who won this year's Nobel prize for

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:48.820
 medicine didn't find out for nearly a day because he'd gone off grid and he only

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:54.060
 found out after his wife got two hundred texts wow so this is about Fred

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:59.380
 Ramsdell who's an immunologist yep and a very good one clearly and he and his

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:04.340
 wife in October he they'd gone on a three-week hike in Wyoming with their

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.460
 dogs they were having a whale of a time and they gone they gone off grid and they

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.580
 turned off their phones and they you know they just had not paid any attention

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:16.620
 on the very last day his wife started screaming and he thought she's seen a

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.780
 bear we're in big trouble and it turns out she just got two hundred tech

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:24.700
 messages saying can you please put your phone on the Nobel's are trying to contact you

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.540
 and that's why I won't ever turn my phone off in case I just win a Nobel

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:34.180
 basically yeah and if you turn your phone off you have no bow on it so yeah brilliant

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:41.540
 brilliant um yeah they've been trying to get them up for 20 hours and there's

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.460
 pretty much a new record for how long anyone's been able to stay away from the

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.500
 Nobel committee trying to contact you right very amazing I mean the quite

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.180
 often it becomes the viral thing when the Nobel prizes are announced someone

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.140
 not picking up their phone yeah we love it this happened last year where a

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.140
 neighbor had to come over who happened to be a scientist at like two in the

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.700
 morning and was ringing the doorbell yes did I pick up your phone that's 2020

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.940
 that was Paul Milgram right yeah yeah do you want to hear about Richard Ernst in 1991

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.980
 he was on a flight from Moscow back to the USA he was asleep it was a night flight

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.780
 and he was woken up he said there's a phone call for you he said what do you mean

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.700
 there's a phone call for me it's 1991 how could it be a phone call for me and you

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.700
 said leave me like I'm going back to sleep I think they did have some phones on

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.500
 planes but it wasn't a couple of things receive a call he said no let me sleep and

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.900
 they said no no no get up sir come to the cockpit and he went to the cockpit of

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.980
 this plane and he put on the radio set the pilot around him and it was the Nobel

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:41.860
 committee saying you've just won the Nobel for chemistry yeah he'd done the

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.460
 research on depending MRI scanning who's a big deal yeah there was a guy

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:52.020
 Melvin Calvin going slightly off memory here sounds like he's been filled in

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:59.420
 do you want it for he won the science prize and he was not they weren't able to

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:06.060
 reach him because he was away secretly at a alien conference and it's not as

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.540
 weird as it sounds because it's where Carl Sagan and Frank Frank Rakeware where

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.220
 they the foundations of SETI were so he was at the very first SETI meeting and

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:20.220
 they found out as he was busy being probed and they yeah yeah and actually Frank

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.740
 Drake was going to send off for some champagne and it just so happened that

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:28.260
 the person who was the chauffeur for all of them to get them to this place was

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:33.460
 called French beverage and what are you talking about I can't I can't send French

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.180
 beverage to go get the champagne that just feels to the mushrooms that you had

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:45.860
 with a a so Melvin Calvin was the guy who won but was at an alien conference well

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.980
 not an alien conference so we're setting up SETI yeah sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah quite

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.340
 good the SETI runs with Yeti but those are two of your big interests yes that's

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:57.620
 true didn't know that that's a good point I'm spaghetti you like as well don't you

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.620
 I love spaghetti the whole point is that he wasn't they couldn't reach him and

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.700
 they got through to his wife you then had to call right the secret base yeah

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.460
 it's a mention it to him that he had won it a lot of people think it's spam

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.140
 don't they are telemarketing when people when the Nobel's ring up I really

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.460
 after as that gunner who won the literature prize a few years ago they rank him

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.580
 and said you've won the Nobel Prize but before they could say anything he said

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:25.780
 leave me alone and just slap the phone down I think Kazooir Ishiguro yeah same thing

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:32.860
 I bet yeah so maybe you've already won it Lou you just so off grid which is

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:40.000
 where Fred Ramstone was what does that mean well I think it gets used wrong all the

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.500
 time I certainly use it right people say I'm going off grid yeah and what they

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.740
 mean is I won't have my phone I'm turning up I'm putting on my out-of-office

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.220
 of the Eva well Morrison's in Margate it's got no reception so that's off grid

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.260
 right there we go yeah what it should mean is and you do have to fund for yourself

00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:01.320
 because some of those are really mixed up but it should be I'm not going to be

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.120
 using public utilities yes I'm not going to be using public water or electricity

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:09.120
 supplies but people don't use it to mean that anymore self-sustainable is

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.840
 what I want to be right so you have your own electricity you have your own

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.040
 water source I think they're the big two those are the big two some kind of

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.280
 sewage system if you're if we're being fussy yes yes yes yes or I radio

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:27.520
 didn't listen drawing it out is half the battle you get rid of it or dry it thank

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:33.480
 you it's mostly water weight so are you are you interested in this kind of

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:39.600
 I would love to keep doing my job and keep doing what I do but then living in a

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.520
 few acres of land with my own water and electricity solar system all eco I'd

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.440
 like to sort of have a little eco village so I would like to be self-sustainable

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:54.160
 but still you know pop on QI etc you know yeah yeah yeah you'll have to make your

00:32:54.160 --> 00:33:00.560
 own QI unfortunately no you have to have your own set bill I still want to go

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.480
 to cafes you know yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm not growing my own coffee beans I think

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.440
 that's fine I think that is off-grid there's one good way of getting powered

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:15.520
 that a youtuber called Chris doll has done you know vapes love him coming out

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.520
 your ears so vapes they each have a tiny battery in them but what people do is they

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.600
 vape them until you can vape no more and then you chuck them away but then that

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.280
 means they're chucking away this tiny battery and usually there's electricity

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:35.080
 left on it so this guy he salvaged 500 disposable vapes and turned the

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.680
 batteries into a working power wall which powers basically all his stuff in his

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.560
 house wow that's so good yeah it's not that many vapes as well I didn't have

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.680
 fast to get through a vape 500 well you go through about 20 a day then yeah yeah

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.080
 I do I do they come with a certain number of puffs don't they and you can buy

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:57.080
 mega vapes which are illegal which have more puffs in them really yeah mega

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:04.080
 vape I've never felt more how do you do fellow kids talking about vapes yeah yeah

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.880
 but I think and you can say to you like your news agent whether you've got

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.440
 the illegal vapes for me and he'll go under the counter and pull out like a

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.200
 size of a Toblerone and this is how you're also not done it how do you know that he

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.000
 had the Toblerones come in all different sizes I'm so sorry you're absolutely

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.640
 right the size of an airport Toblerone oh okay there we go okay right if I ask for

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.880
 a large Toblerone when they have that under the counter as well they'll actually

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.920
 pull out a massive Toblerone they'll pull out an even bigger one always a

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.160
 bigger one yeah there's always a bigger than the counter no I think they're meant

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.920
 to be legally they have to be rechargeable now but people still throw them away

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.680
 because they can't be bothered to because they're cheap because they're cheap

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.000
 there's quite a few places that are kind of set up already for off-grid living

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.920
 would you have a considered just incorporating yourself into a place the

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:53.160
 groundwork having been done yes but how am I going to be a cult leader if there's

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:59.240
 already good point you know you know will you kill the kill the previous

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.960
 leaders are by combat yeah no I want to do it with a couple of friends or

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.280
 something so I don't know I don't know maybe but then would you have to deal

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.480
 with annoying people I don't know always in life always yeah usually what happens

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:16.640
 with cults is either so it's not actually a cult yeah it's just James is sure

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:22.320
 and let's say people who live off-grid in communes yeah usually what happens is

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.560
 someone decides let's all have sex with each other yes and then they all fall

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:31.320
 out or two groups mob and they all fall out well there'll be no sex in my

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.120
 commune and you know even if it's a married couple I will be enforcing a

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:42.600
 sex role you'll be lying in between yeah yeah yeah yeah wholesome wholesome I think I

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.280
 may have found out the most famous person to be living off-grid I might be

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.920
 wrong because I'm sure there are loads of candidates currently living off-grid

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:58.000
 currently living off-grid I believe okay most people we need the poop okay is

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.720
 it someone we could guess somebody lives in America a very famous Taylor Swift not

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:08.760
 far off actually quite far off screen a carpenter more male more male and

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:19.520
 Sabrina Carpenter good luck very narrow sub-separate now Joe Rogan okay writer

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:25.800
 writing and he's a writer or that's more correct even closer with Stephen King

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:31.320
 somebody who writes famously about rural America Michael John Grisham oh now

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:36.760
 we get now we're getting closer now we're getting closer in America he writes a

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.600
 battle small-time drifter drifting into your town solving some problems

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:47.320
 Lee Child's British Lee Child lives in Wyoming Lee Child sorry really dead ball

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:51.680
 that on hit that one into the net I just think of because he's British but he

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.920
 lives in America he does he has experience of life in America now and he lives in

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:01.120
 this mad huge estate in Wyoming okay get this Lou I don't know if you be up

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:08.080
 for this marrying him so I get my land yeah I just his post box is 10 miles from his

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:14.840
 house no thank you 10 miles to the post box often does he said letters all the time

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:20.680
 he's exclusively like Jane Austen Lee Child I guess he's not on email his nearest

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:26.440
 grocery shop yeah yeah 45 miles away no if he needs to go and get some milk it's

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:32.960
 a 90-mile-round trip does he is he making his own milk what are we saying I don't

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.560
 think that's not he that stays you've got yes you got farm he was just well you

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.600
 know what Jack Reacher's like Lee Child will just pick up a cow drink straight

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.840
 from the district no I don't know if he's got a farm but basically he's in this

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:52.200
 place in Wyoming Wyoming is the size of the UK but the population is the

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.600
 combined populations of Cambridge, Canterbury, Carlyle and Chelmsford as he's

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.280
 put it it's just very very sparsely populated and he has a friend who he

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.960
 sometimes visits for dinner who lives 105 miles away that's I mean I'm not

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:10.480
 interested in that life it's so remote yeah so it's so far from

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:15.040
 that's 10 miles to your post box yeah for someone as well who kind of puts out a

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.860
 book a year and is in the press and is doing interviews and presumably doing

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.040
 lunch yeah but he's not being distracted by constant letters is he so he's not

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.420
 doing the writers how you write a book a year a lot of people want to move to these

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.560
 places in case there's like a nuclear war or something or a zombie outbreak

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.520
 or does that appeal to you Lou are you sort of trying to get a gauge if how much

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.960
 for not I am and I'm right away and we'll be we'll be bottling all this

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:47.100
 well the reason I ask is like a lot of squillainers will buy these sort of

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:51.720
 off grid places and we'll have them in case the whole world goes to shit

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:57.600
 yeah if I had the money I probably would yeah so this guy Peter Thiel oh yeah

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:03.960
 him squillainer asshole he got New Zealand citizenship so that he could build a

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:08.040
 super bunker in New Zealand they're all building in New Zealand because they know

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.720
 that they're causing it like climate damage to anyway they are but there's a new

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:16.160
 book by a guy called Mark Linus who looked at all the countries in the world and

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:21.680
 who would survive best a nuclear winter situation and New Zealand is one of

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.620
 the worst places you can be really because they're very unselfsufficient in

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:32.680
 food oh wow they import a lot of food so only 68% of Kiwis would survive a

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:37.040
 nuclear winter and on the whole world is that the bird the Kiwi or is it the

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:46.640
 fruit the best places any of the best places someone once told me that it's

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:54.040
 in the UK if you go like no in the UK 99% of people will die well because we're

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.700
 not self-sufficient with food but I want to focus on that 1% James that's

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.600
 that's who I absolutely think I want to see in the world yeah yeah I got 50

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.800
 cans of beans under my dad yeah you will be the 1% I reckon living in your

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.040
 self-sufficient um well okay I'm a highly allergic to beans that's the only

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:18.140
 problem yeah so some of the self-sufficient in terms of food yeah it's really

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:22.120
 interesting is it somewhere in and energy and various different things oh it's

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:27.200
 like Sweden or Norway or something like that I'll give you Iceland thank you

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.560
 oh because they've got all the GM far yeah they've got all those kind of great

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:36.840
 aisles of options and Australia Iceland Argentina Paraguay Uruguay and Costa

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:41.680
 Rica and Haiti places where they're kind of self-sufficient in themselves that

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.760
 they can feed their whole population yeah right right because of because of

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:48.240
 Australia you said is sort of they I think they've got so much solar power

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.100
 they've just been giving everyone three hours of free and they got very low

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:55.480
 population as well yeah Australia is a good place to go yeah and also they have

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.960
 lots of different sort of climates there so you could grow lots of stuff in the

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.120
 north that you can't grow in the south and stuff you can't grow in the north so

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.960
 if you need all the different bits of it if everyone was wiped out in England

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.880
 I'd just sort of go along as well I'm not I'm not that interested in living

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:14.040
 underground for five years on some teams but you live near the Ramsgate tunnels

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.640
 which are perfectly yeah perfectly set they're already set up they've got the

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:24.560
 bunk beds left over from the war in there oh for no one I'll fit in nicely I'll be

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:38.280
 running my coat no okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that is my

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:43.160
 fact my fact this week is that at Morrissey gigs security have been known to

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:52.120
 pat down fans to search them for meat wow the idea of a big security is kind of

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.920
 going off you just see the shape of a pork chop in someone's pocket or a sausage or

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.480
 a sausage yeah I do the same at my gigs actually do yeah yeah but I'm sort of

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.720
 wanting to find the meat is are you doing the patdowns yourself yeah I am yeah I'm

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.480
 gonna do the patdowns yeah I'm gonna meet and greet with loose enders as a very

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:15.080
 different meaning I pay you I pay you to meet and greet you

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:20.720
 so this is Morrissey singer from the band The Smiths who's had a very long solo

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:26.920
 career after they break up and he is a committed vegetarian and vegan and he

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:33.160
 hates meat to the point that if it is even in the air if he can even smell it at a

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:38.160
 gig he will be known to walk off stage so he always says that if he's gonna

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.760
 play a venue you're not allowed to sell meat in the venue for that specific gig

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.640
 so if he was playing let's say the O2 in London that would be one of the

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.400
 conditions that he would have and in 2011 fans were reporting that as they

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.440
 were coming through the security barriers men and women were patting them down

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.840
 searching for meat I think it's fair enough yeah it's his gig like I think the

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:03.120
 searching is a bit I think the searching is because once or twice he said

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:09.360
 sausages thrown at him once yeah which I don't think is on I do think that's

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:13.840
 poor form yeah do you need to search everyone for meat just the people who

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:17.760
 look suspicious they look like they might be packing a suspicious sausage but

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:23.280
 you can anyone in tide I come straight through but you can meet his I would say

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.720
 quite easy to smuggle yeah because you're made of meat so there's no way they

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.360
 could do like a X-ray thing because your whole body's meat it's only if there's

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.600
 it's there's an extra bone you would spot that if someone's smuggling in a

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:42.120
 tea ball steak a tea ball steak yeah I agree I think it's a bit much it's a

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:46.080
 bit much he's he said he's he doesn't identify with the term vegan but he's

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.520
 managed to find an even smaller subset of what does he identify with that he

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:53.520
 says he just says are refused to eat anything that had a mother he says he's

00:43:53.520 --> 00:44:02.840
 never had a curry or coffee or garlic coffee got a mother but he said his

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.240
 diet consists of bread potato pasta and nuts so it feels it feels more like a

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:12.560
 sort of channel for documentry about a façade this is this is interesting

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.880
 though his influence despite him being this character that people find quite

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:22.960
 difficult people get annoyed with vegans and my theory is that because they know

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:27.960
 that they shouldn't really be eat something in them feels a bit icky about eating

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.800
 animals they feel embarrassed about themselves that's possible yeah and

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:38.120
 Coachella the big festival really tried hard to get a Smith reunion and

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:42.600
 there's been so much fallout between the members Johnny Mar and and Morrissey

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:48.080
 don't particularly they do not get on they do not get on and so Coachella said we

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.320
 want you to get back we're gonna pay you a lot of money and we will make Coachella

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:56.080
 a vegetarian oh wow experience and he said I would rather eat my own testicles

00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:02.200
 why which is not very vegan but he uh because this is how much the band do not

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.600
 like each other I'm afraid this will be us in 30 years I think last maybe last

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.880
 year they almost got together and Morrissey wanted them to get together because

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.440
 they got offered an insane amount of money but Johnny Mar said no oh wow

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.440
 he could have given it to the animal charity and Morrissey has canceled a

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:23.320
 gig in Iceland over there meet policy market yeah they do a lot of

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:31.960
 form rings though they you know no geothermally powered country Iceland but

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.440
 the venue just refused to stop selling meat for one day and he said I love

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.720
 Iceland and have waited a long time to return but I should leave the Harpack

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.960
 concert hall to their cannibalistic flesh eating bloodlust yeah he's not

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:48.000
 afraid to put together a pitty quote for a press release I'll say that yeah I

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.320
 think it's crazy though the venue couldn't stop selling meat for a day because it's

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:55.520
 so bad for the planet as well you think you know just don't sell meat for a day

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.080
 people will cope I think the thing is with Iceland though they have like a

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:03.120
 history meeting lots of meat because they've not been able to grow plants for

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:07.600
 many hundreds of years especially in the winter so they really do have a very big

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:12.960
 culture of eating white whales males yeah puffins fish I think you're right

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.200
 I think the vegan thing is really interesting because I think he's he's been

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.080
 very provocative in the way he presents it like his tour gates would you know

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.760
 what's provocative slaughterhouses slaughterhouses are provocative absolutely

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.960
 absolutely and I think probably he sort of deliberately does it in a

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:29.680
 way maybe because he's trying to shock people and no one's listening well I

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.520
 think it works on only a small percentage of it I think people are likely to

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.680
 shut it out if something is so upsetting I think yeah like the vegan is a

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.680
 movement that's had a bit of a stumble in recent years it's a bit less popular

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.440
 than it was about five years ago yeah and just a lot of people have sort of

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:46.040
 thought of what is quite difficult now I can't quite be bothered to cut out

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.680
 everything and you know like vegetarians sometimes get stick for not being

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.000
 vegans and like that kind of thing so it's I think it's tricky how you sort of

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.920
 softly softly people into it yeah do you guys remember that Morrissey wrote a

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:02.760
 novel and it became quite well-known for the fact that it contained possibly the

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.560
 worst sex scene of the year oh included in the book did it when there's no

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:11.160
 word for the worst sex it did it won the 2015 worst sex scene so his book was

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.920
 called List of the Lost could you be in a sexy voice yeah what do you want to do

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:21.160
 you want to okay here we go Eliza and Ezra rolled together in the one giggling

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.440
 snowball a full-figured copulation screaming and shouting as they playfully

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:31.920
 bit and pull each other in a dangerous and cool I think it's good so far yeah sorry

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:38.360
 how's everyone else doing in a glamorous roller coaster coil of sexually

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.960
 violent rotation with Eliza's breasts barrel rolled across as was howling

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:49.960
 mouth and painted and the pained frenzy of his bulbous solute salt solute was

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:56.000
 that's how it tastes sorry extenuating his excitement as it whacked and

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.460
 smacked its way into every muscle of Eliza's body except for the otherwise

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:04.800
 central zone this is a Tuesday night at my house this is just this is just

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:10.480
 Tuesday's that's mad I think I do think sexy novels are a bit less sexy what

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.720
 you have to ask people can you tell me what this is but that is insane he's never

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:21.120
 had sex I'm sorry I think it's so good yeah yeah there is so many big metaphors in

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.640
 there yeah they're like a snowball and they're like a roller coaster

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:29.400
 it's a timeless roller coaster coil yeah and it's quite aggressive not at

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.160
 not at all sexually violent rotation is a bit I mean if you're breasts are doing

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:38.000
 barrel rolls that's the least imagine like that's RAF stuff isn't that's like

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.120
 that's the red arrows you know and your bulbous salutation is a bit that's

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:52.160
 mad bulbous salutations feels like they might support this one on Morris

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:57.640
 he's books yeah yeah he has been a bit controversial because he wrote an

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:02.700
 autobiography a memoir and it was published by Penguin Classics yeah so same

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:07.000
 list as Ovid home was Odyssey and he's basically said I'll do I'll do a book

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.360
 but only if it goes in straight as a Penguin Classic oh wow yeah a Penguin

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.800
 class sorry I didn't really take notice yeah so yeah so it didn't come out in

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.840
 hardback which would be your traditional release it was straight into a paper

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:24.480
 bag with the classic yeah yeah wow Plato is is they're on the same

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.920
 list my book is bold and I think it got him a lot of publicity yeah

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.920
 negative yeah yeah yeah yeah but he's got a long history writing so when he

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.720
 before he was a pop star he wrote unsolicited script for Coronation Street did

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.840
 they go with it or not he sent it to them he sent them a script where the

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:44.560
 Rovers return installs a jukebox and they did not it's basically fanfiction isn't it

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:49.400
 it's basically fanfiction yeah yeah yeah I found one other example just while

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:54.480
 we're still on Marcy slash musicians of people who are very strict vegan

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:59.960
 slash vegetarians to the point where it almost seems a bit awkward

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:06.200
 Katie Lang oh yeah Katie Lang once refused to meet the singer Meetloaf

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:13.760
 because of his name wow yeah it was an interview from Meetloaf where he said I was

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:18.600
 a vegetarian for 10 years and I was sitting next to John Bon Jovi and awards

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.160
 thing and I said oh man I'd love to meet Katie Lang I'd really love to meet her

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.120
 they went to find out if that's okay she said no his name is Meetloaf but he

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:29.600
 was a vegetarian at the time possibly he'd lapsed at that point okay he had been

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.080
 a vegetarian at some point for 10 years yeah I think I think it's a bit

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:37.080
 strict of Katie though yeah I had just while we're on sort of pop stars and

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.680
 stuff before we go on to veganism I had a look at some other riders that people

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:46.200
 have so Kanye West apparently when he played later with Jules Holland that he

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:52.960
 must have his dressing room carpet ironed wow M&M apparently when he played

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:59.200
 at a festival in Northern Ireland insisted on a coy carp pond okay and according

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:04.520
 to TMZ there's a rapper called DMX who I'm not massively familiar with oh yeah

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:09.080
 he's a biggie though yeah he is big and for every rider he wants a bottle of

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:15.400
 Hennessy and three boxes of condoms three boxes which boxes were the boxes well

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.920
 sometimes the box is a fewer like so even if there was three in a box had the

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:24.520
 year-end you can get through nine before of gig not before not when I'm at when

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:34.600
 I'm at the Bill Murray it's a similar story it seats 90 I'm optimistic no that's

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:39.800
 man I was wondering if he might be using them to carry water because they're quite

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:47.680
 good for that I heard the Drake puts when he finishes off in a condom because he

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:51.600
 doesn't want you know kids with some like you know stranger that he's yeah

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:58.520
 even when he puts like chili flakes in the reminence or something so they

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:05.160
 can't shove it up them oh that's what I heard so people might take the condom and

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:09.720
 shove and chili flakes is going to stop them I mean if you're mentally

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:13.140
 enough to want to do the first part about do you think the chili flakes would stop

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:37.200
 I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:57.560
 yeah absolutely I wouldn't be a hundred percent certain any of the things I said a tree will you give toward Lou you recently toward I did the only I asked for was not a plastic bottle of water so either like a jug a filter jug or yeah or like cans I guess a

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:06.680
