00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish, where we were"
00:00:03,00:00:09,joined by the absolutely brilliant Lou Sanders. Now you'll remember Lou because
00:00:09,00:00:13,"she's been on fish a couple of times I think, she's been on QI many many times,"
00:00:13,00:00:18,"she's an absolute favourite of ours, she's so so funny, so so brilliant. There's"
00:00:18,00:00:23,"loads of things I could tell you about her, she's written books, she's on tour next"
00:00:23,00:00:27,"year, but really the best place to find out everything about her is to go to"
00:00:27,00:00:33,Lou Sanders that's l-o-u-s-a-n-d-e-r-s dot com and all of the information about
00:00:33,00:00:38,"her is there if you want to learn more, which I bet you will because she is a real"
00:00:38,00:00:42,tour de force and she definitely shows that off in this episode today and of
00:00:42,00:00:48,course it would be remiss of me not to mention club fish go to patreon.com/nosuchthingsafish
00:00:48,00:00:53,and find out everything there is to get there there is merch there's bonus stuff
00:00:53,00:00:59,others all sorts you know where to go patreon.com/nosuchthingsafish and find out more
00:00:59,00:01:04,not much more to say apart from on with the podcast
00:01:04,00:01:22,hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:01:22,00:01:27,coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Shriver I am sitting
00:01:27,00:01:31,"here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Lou Sanders and once again we"
00:01:31,00:01:34,have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the
00:01:34,00:01:39,last seven days and in a particular order here we go starting with fact number
00:01:39,00:01:44,one and that is Lou. Well you're more likely to get your way if you ask
00:01:44,00:01:49,one for a favor in the right ear and not the left ear it's called right ear
00:01:49,00:01:54,dominance okay so yeah interesting where we're sat you're speaking into
00:01:54,00:02:01,and these right ear yeah and into our left ears can I get more money for the polka yes
00:02:01,00:02:08,it wouldn't work if I asked Dan that no no um right to write a dominance is this
00:02:08,00:02:12,like being like left or right handed or left or right footage is to do with the
00:02:12,00:02:17,hemispheres of the brain and now I'll consult my phone
00:02:17,00:02:22,you got the baby that's right without looking at I was quite impressed myself actually
00:02:22,00:02:26,yeah so it's called right ear advantage I said that didn't I for verbal
00:02:26,00:02:32,commands and persuasion can you imagine sort of like looping round and going
00:02:32,00:02:36,through the other way to sort of ask yeah you've got to do it subtly yes you've
00:02:36,00:02:43,got to make your way over getting out of the bed going round to her side yeah it
00:02:43,00:02:48,does make sense to sleep on the right side of the bed right yes yeah that is
00:02:48,00:02:52,how we're positioned in bed is that right yes I don't want to hear how you're
00:02:52,00:02:56,positioned in bed who's mixing the who's right here for now look at my right
00:02:56,00:03:05,I heard it was top to jail with you I thought it was you on the top bunk that's
00:03:05,00:03:10,very cool yeah um that's a very good idea I've you would see now I wonder if
00:03:10,00:03:14,you look at classic photos a big business meals and so on whether or not you
00:03:14,00:03:20,see you know who's on the right side of Trump for example yeah who's on the
00:03:20,00:03:26,right side of history so do we know why it's why this well let me consult
00:03:26,00:03:33,AI is now you when you search engine something AI comes up first she's annoying
00:03:33,00:03:38,because they're using all the water um don't get me started language I left
00:03:38,00:03:41,hemisphere dominance language and verbal information are primarily
00:03:41,00:03:46,processed by the left hemisphere of the brain in most people in most people oh the
00:03:46,00:03:50,right here is more directly wired to the left hemisphere faster processing
00:03:50,00:03:54,information received is interesting through the right ear reaches the language
00:03:54,00:03:58,processing center in the left hemisphere more quickly I don't know oh here we go
00:03:58,00:04:03,this is more interesting a study conducted in Italian nightclubs where
00:04:03,00:04:07,researchers asked clubbers for a cigarette in their left ear or right ear found
00:04:07,00:04:11,that requests made in a right ear were twice as successful really yeah I'd say I
00:04:11,00:04:19,don't want to cigarette in my left ear Italian nightclubs the cradle of science I've
00:04:19,00:04:24,done my own research in there no no one one of us sitting around this table for
00:04:24,00:04:27,a particular reason has better hearing than the other three irrespective of
00:04:27,00:04:31,okay a major hearing damage okay I mean have better hearing women have better
00:04:31,00:04:35,hearing than men because we are supposed to get up for the baby I suppose that'll
00:04:35,00:04:42,be it is it better hearing in terms of like you know the higher a sound goes
00:04:42,00:04:46,and then only dogs can hear it do they have a higher range that's for sure they
00:04:46,00:04:52,do yeah yeah but it's also player sound at any part of the range and women will
00:04:52,00:04:56,be more likely to perceive it than men and our eyes are better as well so we can
00:04:56,00:05:02,see more colors than men yes it's not like why are we so downtrodden when we're
00:05:02,00:05:08,actually better um oh it's made you a stronger yeah yeah you've put all we're
00:05:08,00:05:12,emotionally strong if someone's fighting you you can't say oh I can see 20 colors
00:05:12,00:05:18,here yeah we're emotionally strong that's true so you tell me how often are you
00:05:18,00:05:21,getting into fights and how often are you seeing and hearing things every day
00:05:21,00:05:26,you're seeing and hearing fights even you not one month is it I am from the
00:05:26,00:05:31,north one interesting thing about women having better hearing is they can hear
00:05:31,00:05:35,higher things and that means that there was a thing where people were making
00:05:35,00:05:40,household appliances and they'd have a very high sort of hum but the people who
00:05:40,00:05:44,are making them were often men so the men couldn't hear it and then they'd sell
00:05:44,00:05:47,them and the women were using them this is like in the 70s and 80s yeah and the
00:05:47,00:05:53,women could hear it that's that's like the um it's a sort of invisible women
00:05:53,00:05:57,that book yes yeah yeah it's all about how things are not built with women in
00:05:57,00:06:02,mind but that's so funny that men have been making like screaming blenders
00:06:02,00:06:07,yeah and perceivable to them another way to terrorize us congratulations
00:06:07,00:06:12,it's weird that this was done in Italian night clubs yeah because I think there's a
00:06:12,00:06:17,big history of make your place your job you know yeah I think there's a big
00:06:17,00:06:24,history of Italian ear science really yeah so Alessandra Volta was the
00:06:24,00:06:29,count Italian count the battery and the battery needed a lot of it wow electrical
00:06:29,00:06:35,experimentation and he was one of the pioneers of electrifying ears why was he
00:06:35,00:06:38,electrifying ears he was electrifying everything he could get his hands on but
00:06:38,00:06:43,one of them invented the battery what are you gonna do yeah that's USP basically
00:06:43,00:06:48,going around night clubs just battery in people right yeah but there were lots
00:06:48,00:06:51,a lot I think lots of Italian pioneers here's another thing two people around
00:06:51,00:06:55,this table have better hearing than the other two irrespective of Lou getting
00:06:55,00:07:00,about them male female thing forget about me and Lou because we live by the sea
00:07:00,00:07:06,you got it well not within the city actually people who live in the city have
00:07:06,00:07:11,better hearing oh so you're me yes sorry that's right and this is according to a
00:07:11,00:07:16,study at the University of Giesen in Germany and they found that people in
00:07:16,00:07:19,quiet villages they don't have so good hearing because they don't have to
00:07:19,00:07:24,fight over the traffic and stuff all the time and the absolute worst hearing of
00:07:24,00:07:29,anyone in the world where do you think they live the quietest place quietest
00:07:29,00:07:33,but then there's an extra thing on top it's not Wales it's quiet but there's a
00:07:33,00:07:39,background noise so like near and nuclear reactor because it's low population
00:07:39,00:07:43,but the nuclear reactor's humming it's not that it's East Asian villages because
00:07:43,00:07:46,they have a very quiet life that every now and then they get huge firework
00:07:46,00:07:51,displays and that really damages their hearing but then they also have the
00:07:51,00:07:56,quiet thing I was looking into is inevitably landed on Van Gogh because that's
00:07:56,00:08:00,where all year research will get you to and I was reading about when he was
00:08:00,00:08:05,getting his ear treated after after an injury to it and I can't tell if this was
00:08:05,00:08:08,the injury where he lobbed it off or if he had another injury where he just
00:08:08,00:08:11,cut it with a razor and needed it looked after either way he saw a doctor
00:08:11,00:08:18,called Dr Felix Ray and as a thank you he gave Dr Felix Ray a portrait of Dr
00:08:18,00:08:23,Felix Ray so he did one over a number of days handed to him to say yeah really
00:08:23,00:08:29,beautiful painting I've seen it Dr Ray hated it as his wife so for the next 10
00:08:29,00:08:33,years they used it to block up a hole that was in the chicken coop but they had
00:08:33,00:08:37,outside their house they have the painting on the inside of the
00:08:37,00:08:43,house that's where it stayed for 10 years it was eventually sold off and it's
00:08:43,00:08:47,now in a museum and it's estimated to be worth about 50 million but they get
00:08:47,00:08:50,the money for it did they get some money for I think no I think it got you know
00:08:50,00:08:54,just picked it on to someone else if they got any money would be in a small
00:08:54,00:08:58,amount yeah wow could I should have kept that fan art that someone sent me with a
00:08:58,00:09:08,boggly eye they tagged me in I thought I'm not reposting that if you do make
00:09:08,00:09:11,fan art people you want them should we post it make it on the right side of
00:09:11,00:09:19,flattering sure here's another really famous here on science history okay the
00:09:19,00:09:24,year on the rat the year on the rat the year of the rat the year of the
00:09:24,00:09:29,house does anyone ever yes I do and here was grown on the back of a rat the year was
00:09:29,00:09:32,grown on the back of a rat a human here a human ear was grown on the back of a
00:09:32,00:09:38,rat and people science has been doing this for at least 20 years on and off the
00:09:38,00:09:42,first one was done in 1997 wow I think there's a scientist the original the
00:09:42,00:09:47,Vacanty mouse I think the scientist was Joseph Vacanty talent may have been
00:09:47,00:09:52,Italian it certainly sounds Italian oh yeah they love the ears yeah and he
00:09:52,00:09:55,basically he was a pediatric surgeon and one of his colleagues said we really
00:09:55,00:09:59,struggle with recreating good ears for children of child's lost an ear and an
00:09:59,00:10:03,accident or something it's really hard to shape the cartilage to make it
00:10:03,00:10:07,yeah because you can't hear out the mouse can't hear out of that massive ear on
00:10:07,00:10:11,its back kind of no it's not like it's not a working ear it's just the
00:10:11,00:10:16,outside bit it's it's the same as the shell exactly it's the kind of the
00:10:16,00:10:20,external yeah and they grow it and they would put a they put a frame on the
00:10:20,00:10:26,mouse or the rat that grows the ear so it grows into the shape of the ear
00:10:26,00:10:30,because there's a mold yes it's like forcing a cucumber to the right place I didn't
00:10:30,00:10:33,know that detail I just thought yeah actually think it was like the
00:10:33,00:10:41,mouse is going fuck I didn't think it was that fairly function I don't have any
00:10:41,00:10:47,cigarettes to give you I'm sorry no business so and his breath weirdly the
00:10:47,00:10:50,vacanti vacanti and his brother had both worked on the same problem but they've
00:10:50,00:10:54,keep doing it the latest one I think was in 2016 and they said we're going to
00:10:54,00:10:58,move to human trials so yeah I was in growing the ears on animals and then
00:10:58,00:11:02,implanting them into humans yeah so far the trailer's gone cold I believe so
00:11:02,00:11:06,can we just grow a whole human if we put it in a mold if you put a mold of a
00:11:06,00:11:11,human no there is a market for that is there what doesn't do anything does it
00:11:11,00:11:16,but it's a human doll oh yeah yeah yes yes like the ear it wouldn't it would
00:11:16,00:11:19,just be a it would just be the shape yeah I don't think there's a grown on the
00:11:19,00:11:25,backs of mice as far as I understand well you couldn't put a high human body on
00:11:25,00:11:29,the back of a mice it would topple over yes absolutely yeah whatever also it
00:11:29,00:11:33,wouldn't be able to get back into its hole would it because the human would be
00:11:33,00:11:37,too this is you know it's obvious it's obvious it's a terrible idea yeah I don't
00:11:37,00:11:41,have to be the one to say that come on boys come on you're supposed to be
00:11:41,00:11:47,braining you can't go ahead of body on a mouse come on yeah real and we've been
00:11:47,00:11:52,doing it for as you say since 1997 yeah multiple years but no ear has ever
00:11:52,00:11:58,gone from a mouse to a human I believe not so I'm to move on I think it's time to
00:11:58,00:12:06,double them but also you always read things in the paper that says oh they've
00:12:06,00:12:10,figured out a way to do this and then you don't hear any more about it I think
00:12:10,00:12:13,it's like to give us a bit of a lift and a bit of a story but they're not really
00:12:13,00:12:18,planning on doing anything with it like the the thing that ain't plastic the little
00:12:18,00:12:23,bacteria yeah where's that gone I think it's probably when I was talking about it
00:12:23,00:12:29,they let go of disappeared yeah yeah you know they give us a bit of a good
00:12:29,00:12:33,news yeah oh they've saved sight or something I read the other day right come on
00:12:33,00:12:36,then it's it's always a very early development
00:12:36,00:12:40,yeah don't waste my time yeah come back to me it's because they need to do the
00:12:40,00:12:44,headlines to get funding yeah yes so they do the big oh we're going to save
00:12:44,00:12:48,this yeah the newspapers say we're going to save this and they're like no we just
00:12:48,00:12:55,really just want a few grand to buy some nice on the hearing front what is it
00:12:55,00:13:00,with people that talk really loudly I've got two friends that talks so loudly
00:13:00,00:13:04,they must be deaf yeah for now says that I talk extremely loudly and I don't
00:13:04,00:13:10,think I do no she's always going on about how you shout out her a lot yeah yeah
00:13:10,00:13:14,when I when I've been with you guys that might be what she's talking about my
00:13:14,00:13:19,rage I mean I've got like 15 kids to shout over we do and also when you're
00:13:19,00:13:25,sleeping top to tails it does take yeah the blankets yeah we should be
00:13:25,00:13:29,bouncing oh feel like we have a nobody facts oh we've done loads oh we've done
00:13:29,00:13:32,tons if you've got bigger ears do you think you hear better or worse or the
00:13:32,00:13:38,better better you're right it's one of those facts that's just what you would
00:13:38,00:13:43,imagine it's so enjoyable but that's the case yeah that bigger is mean it's only
00:13:43,00:13:48,it's very very slight it's 15 decibels difference which is basically you can't
00:13:48,00:13:50,really tell the difference but yeah it does make a difference like if you have
00:13:50,00:13:54,the bigger nose can you smell better probably not right because it doesn't
00:13:54,00:13:57,necessarily mean your receptors are any better it's you can take more air and
00:13:57,00:14:06,in one sniff why don't you let us know dad okay wait that's got a big big nose I've
00:14:06,00:14:10,got a small nose and you make a smell and we'll see who smells it first yeah
00:14:10,00:14:17,make a smell make a smell right now I'm doing it if you can smell it at home do let us
00:14:17,00:14:28,know podcasted QI dot com okay it is time for fact number two and that is James okay
00:14:28,00:14:35,my fat this week is that the town of Ramsgate is named after a gate for Ravens
00:14:35,00:14:41,very confusing that's so cool it is really cool well I think is wonder Ravens
00:14:41,00:14:47,need a gate it's a gap in the cliffs where the Ravens go in I thought you could
00:14:47,00:14:53,say it's a gap in the market we think it comes from the old English word gate
00:14:53,00:15:00,meaning gate and laughing which means Raven and that became Ramsgate
00:15:00,00:15:06,laughing also sometimes means warlord so it could be gate of the warlord and
00:15:06,00:15:10,Daniel Defoe thought that Ramsgate was originally called Romansgate and it's
00:15:10,00:15:13,where the Romans landed because it was actually where the Romans landed but
00:15:13,00:15:20,can we just say for maybe for international listeners from the north or
00:15:20,00:15:24,listeners from the north or west of England or other parts of the UK who may
00:15:24,00:15:28,not know about the bustling metropolis of Ramsgate yes for Ramsgators yeah well
00:15:28,00:15:33,part of fan it which is on the southeast coast that's a circular no it's a
00:15:33,00:15:37,it's it's it's because it's quite connected to quite a few places that you may
00:15:37,00:15:41,have heard of margate broad stairs and Ramsgate kind of come as a trio you've
00:15:41,00:15:45,got Westgate as well it's a it's a town it's a town on the you're trying to get
00:15:45,00:15:49,to it's a town it's just say if you want us to say it's a town you say it I just
00:15:49,00:15:54,think that's referencing can I just say it's a margate I think the fact was the
00:15:54,00:15:59,town of Ramsgate you're right you're absolutely right you're right it's a classic
00:15:59,00:16:04,English seaside town in many ways yes yeah it's lovely and it's it's so
00:16:04,00:16:08,interesting I had no idea how interesting it is is it where you live where are
00:16:08,00:16:15,you no no I've no I know I know I do what you're talking about no I was I would
00:16:15,00:16:19,live there from two to four then I move next door to broad stairs now I live in
00:16:19,00:16:24,Margate so do the trilogy oh it's that going or down market to go well they all
00:16:24,00:16:29,changed the Ramsgate was of dive and then broad stairs is a bit of
00:16:29,00:16:34,fancier then Margate was a dive but now it's fancier you know what regular
00:16:34,00:16:38,listeners will know about Margate because Dan goes on about it so much yeah
00:16:38,00:16:42,because I live there yeah it's not just because it's nice it's nice I really
00:16:42,00:16:46,excitedly I went to see a school today it's one that my daughter might go to and
00:16:46,00:16:50,they said that every year they take all the kids on a trip to Margate and I
00:16:50,00:16:56,got to say sold yeah yeah well I think if it was a trip to Ramsgate that'd be
00:16:56,00:17:03,even better because it's stunningly interesting it's one of those towns where
00:17:03,00:17:07,it's quite it's reasonably close to London and then for a spell in the what
00:17:07,00:17:11,18th and 19th century it was one of the most fashionable places on the planet
00:17:11,00:17:16,incredibly beautiful buildings incredibly rich history in terms of
00:17:16,00:17:21,connections to Europe it's got weight troze it's got a weight troze Charles Darwin
00:17:21,00:17:24,had a flat did a lot of his barnacle research in the area
00:17:24,00:17:30,van Gogh van Gogh oh that brings it of chicken coop famous wow
00:17:30,00:17:34,himself spent three months as a teacher a lot of artists do you go to the
00:17:34,00:17:39,area because the lights are very beautiful you see this one rising Ramsgate and
00:17:39,00:17:43,you see this on set in Margate something to do with those yeah
00:17:43,00:17:48,geography teaching a teaching assistant I think teaching assistant who's TA who
00:17:48,00:17:52,was who was van Gogh van Gogh I mean you're actually being the teacher in the class
00:17:52,00:17:56,where van Gogh is a teaching assistant right that's quite trick if you're the art
00:17:56,00:18:00,teacher as I'm presuming he was yeah and you're trying to teach something he's
00:18:00,00:18:06,in the pack of it weird yeah but it was also branded in world or one as the most
00:18:06,00:18:12,bombed seaside town in the UK basically the first blitzes hit Ramsgate and they
00:18:12,00:18:16,had an amazing way of dealing with that which I'm sure Andy you must have
00:18:16,00:18:20,read into and enjoyed the tunnels that they built yeah oh tunneled into the
00:18:20,00:18:24,cliffs they dug and I think it was for the second mobile was the big bombing
00:18:24,00:18:27,grades yeah the worst time in the first mobile the second mobile they just dug
00:18:27,00:18:32,"this cave complex into the bliss I think they can get 60,000 people down there they"
00:18:32,00:18:34,quite so it's really I didn't know this and I've been to these caves while I've
00:18:34,00:18:39,been to the gift shop we didn't quite make it into the caves no but we were we
00:18:39,00:18:41,we're going back isn't the gift shop usually at the end of this
00:18:41,00:18:45,specter you would get in for free by going through the gift shop walking backwards
00:18:45,00:18:51,to the side style so what's it saying a rock yeah it's like a model of a cave
00:18:51,00:18:55,what is it no it's where you actually buy the tickets to go into the cave but
00:18:55,00:18:59,they can only take you as a tour group so you can't just wander in so it's huge
00:18:59,00:19:05,and initially why it was built was it goes deep into away from the ocean in land
00:19:05,00:19:09,and it was for the local town members to have a tunnel that would get them
00:19:09,00:19:14,straight to the seaside so it wasn't built initially for the bombing but they
00:19:14,00:19:17,were they were already live at the seaside but it's just a quick way rather than
00:19:17,00:19:21,going through the town yeah because there's a little there's a little there's
00:19:21,00:19:25,a little rail yeah it was trains exactly I'll go above ground what if you need to
00:19:25,00:19:31,pop to boots or something also people get a piss of that tunnel yeah surely not
00:19:31,00:19:35,surely not in Ramsgate oh well do you want to story about Ramsgate that's not
00:19:35,00:19:41,very high brats please I years ago I was thinking why don't I just buy in Ramsgate
00:19:41,00:19:46,this was like years and years ago and I felt it's quite nice and then I was
00:19:46,00:19:50,seriously considering it and then I went to the toilet Ramsgate station
00:19:50,00:19:55,before I got on the train and someone had done a shit a loft of the radiator in
00:19:55,00:19:59,the waiting room a loft of the radiator yeah it's just they've they've positioned
00:19:59,00:20:04,themselves on top of the radiator so the toilet was like two seconds through a
00:20:04,00:20:09,door toilets there but they said no what I'll do is pull down my pants in the
00:20:09,00:20:14,waiting room and just poop on a radiator no get out broad stairs do you you
00:20:14,00:20:17,don't get that much in broad stairs definitely humor well I haven't got time to
00:20:17,00:20:24,do you know the world's biggest weather spoons is in Ramsgate I go there
00:20:24,00:20:29,probably do you do actually I do I don't because he he was like a pioneer of
00:20:29,00:20:34,Brexit not you know but you can get a pint of ruddles for £1.20 all right here
00:20:34,00:20:38,we go okay here we go yeah it does it's Matt is great to list it yeah it's
00:20:38,00:20:45,"1,500 people it can hold which is the same as Shakespeare's Globe wow it's an"
00:20:45,00:20:50,old ballroom yeah it's an old ballroom and it's really beautiful it's right on the
00:20:50,00:20:59,beach it's a it's a great it's a great big pub it's true I'm with Lou it's a
00:20:59,00:21:04,shithole it's a two-minute walk from the caves by the way if anyone there's some
00:21:04,00:21:10,lovely little independent wine bars up there say that do you know the home for
00:21:10,00:21:18,smack boys yeah no that's in Ramsgate what is it it's what does it sound like
00:21:18,00:21:26,where Max is Congregate I know come on I like boys where people who worked on
00:21:26,00:21:30,smacks are they yeah fishing boats fishing smacks yeah and they went out with
00:21:30,00:21:35,boys as young as sort of probably about 14 were going out working on the fishing
00:21:35,00:21:38,boats and said this was a place to give them food and accommodation and you know
00:21:38,00:21:43,stability yeah still if you walk across from this building it still has the words
00:21:43,00:21:47,like something like home of the smack boys on the side which if you don't know
00:21:47,00:21:51,what that means is quite confusing yeah what it's attached to is the sailors
00:21:51,00:21:55,church which is this tiny church you can fit about 30 people in there I've been
00:21:55,00:21:58,into it multiple times I've never seen a service done there but I started
00:21:58,00:22:03,reading into it and there's reviews by I didn't know this was a thing mystery
00:22:03,00:22:10,worshipers so it's like mystery shoppers yeah is not great so yeah you would have
00:22:10,00:22:14,mystery shoppers who would do that they mystery worshipers are people who go
00:22:14,00:22:18,into a church they experience it and they report back on a survey that they're
00:22:18,00:22:22,questioned about did you connect with the almighty yeah exactly level of
00:22:22,00:22:26,spiritual well questions are like how full was the building did anyone welcome
00:22:26,00:22:30,you personally were the puse comfortable and the person who filled it in was
00:22:30,00:22:34,slightly slightly odd was the puse comfortable the puse had very low back
00:22:34,00:22:38,support so I thought on balance no it was uncomfortable off balance mark yeah
00:22:38,00:22:43,did the service make you feel glad to be a Christian I didn't feel miserable
00:22:43,00:22:47,that's an accomplishment
00:22:47,00:22:51,someone who used to regularly go to church yeah if any new person came into our
00:22:51,00:22:54,church everyone would know yeah because it would always be the same family
00:22:54,00:22:57,everyone would sit in the same places and stuff like that if someone sat in your
00:22:57,00:23:01,place you would know immediately that they were a secret mystery
00:23:01,00:23:06,worshiper mystery worshipers the smallest church in the world maybe is in
00:23:06,00:23:11,over just a really I think so every time someone asked me if that's really true
00:23:11,00:23:16,our panic but I think that house how small will be talking tiny can a fit one
00:23:16,00:23:22,person and a lot of people obviously I've not got the answers hey Andy I thought
00:23:22,00:23:27,you would hate Ramsgate because your hero hated Ramsgate Jane Austen correct
00:23:27,00:23:32,really why well she thought it was a place of distribute as seaside results were
00:23:32,00:23:38,in her day really sure and apparently according to Kent historian Norman
00:23:38,00:23:42,Thomas she mentions it in pride and prejudice in Mansfield Park and she's
00:23:42,00:23:46,never complimentary and either I've not read any Jane Austen so I think it's
00:23:46,00:23:54,where mr. Darcy's sister is nearly seduced by mr. Wickham in I think it
00:23:54,00:23:57,happens in Ramsgate it's at the place is that the one where mr. Darcy leaves a
00:23:57,00:24:04,turd on a radiator yeah and that's when Lizzie Bennett knows that he's the one yeah
00:24:04,00:24:09,I think her brother lived down there for a while captain Austin yes she had a load
00:24:09,00:24:15,of brothers who were navy or military and I think it was a place where you know
00:24:15,00:24:20,this thing scarlet fever not the disease is where it's basically sorry just
00:24:20,00:24:25,cut out everything I said about the smoothies you know if you wonder why it was
00:24:25,00:24:31,quite the last couple minutes no it's one of the smallest work in church is in
00:24:31,00:24:38,England Dover's tiny chapels and Edmund of Abeddon is the only church still in
00:24:38,00:24:44,existence that was dead and by that point you get quite bored right you got it
00:24:44,00:24:51,it's a small job it's a small get over it sorry what are you saying nothing
00:24:51,00:24:57,important yeah I got I got quite a nice message which is something that
00:24:57,00:25:01,usually would be reserved for drop us a line but a listener who runs a local
00:25:01,00:25:07,thing called Margate mushrooms so as Andy and James or no I've been taking
00:25:07,00:25:11,lion's main mushrooms it's a little drip to help your concentration we have to
00:25:11,00:25:14,keep this for the advertising bit of the show we have to put it in a
00:25:14,00:25:17,break we can't just work at it we can't just work at it what turns out the
00:25:17,00:25:20,person who makes this stuff listens to our show I had no idea and she
00:25:20,00:25:24,messaged me she listened to our episode about crafts that are going in
00:25:24,00:25:29,danger and virtually out Ramsgate is home to one of the very few chainmail
00:25:29,00:25:34,makers living in the UK so a guy named Nick Chexfield so he has a lifetime
00:25:34,00:25:38,achievement award from the Heritage Crafts Association and she was saying
00:25:38,00:25:41,because she knows him or it's only spoken to him and she was saying he's so
00:25:41,00:25:47,good at understanding chainmail that if he looks at old centuries-old chain
00:25:47,00:25:50,mail he can tell if the maker was right or left-handed he can tell if they
00:25:50,00:25:55,were getting tired as they were making it who's fact checking him you know what I
00:25:55,00:25:58,mean I could go on and go like yeah okay this guy's as such a
00:25:58,00:26:03,serious you know well he's dead he's dead 100 years ago so that's easier to
00:26:03,00:26:10,fact check well he's got he's got a website Nick Chexfield Nick Chexfield
00:26:10,00:26:17,website no it doesn't good and I would like some free mushroom jobs as well would
00:26:17,00:26:22,you right but check this out I'm the website he has an advice hotline for if you
00:26:22,00:26:26,have emergency questions about your chainmail now this is gonna come in you
00:26:26,00:26:30,so she might just drop that down what circumstances do you need emergency
00:26:30,00:26:35,advice about it like if a hundred crossbow balls are flying towards you
00:26:35,00:26:42,okay does he sell much do you think I don't know if he sells much and I don't I
00:26:42,00:26:46,assume the the advice hotline is for people who are in museums who might have
00:26:46,00:26:49,damaged the chainmail and they need some advice on what to immediately do
00:26:49,00:26:54,he's doing great anyway that's a that's a craft rams engaged and he's
00:26:54,00:27:00,down the rams get a hero yeah along with oh backpack really my broad studs
00:27:00,00:27:06,backpacks was supposed to post again again I will have to fact check that well
00:27:06,00:27:11,see you in a few minutes and then the book goes get shorter is that the guy who
00:27:11,00:27:16,created backpacks a backpacks and I'll post gate right right how do you
00:27:16,00:27:21,retain all this information this is crazy to me yeah well the good thing is I
00:27:21,00:27:25,can keep staying stuff and if I get it wrong that just cut it out but I couldn't
00:27:25,00:27:31,even remember that I booked account for myself the other day fascinating that you
00:27:31,00:27:40,will need to remove your chainmail for that okay it's time for fact number three
00:27:40,00:27:44,and that is Andy my fact is the scientist who won this year's Nobel prize for
00:27:44,00:27:48,medicine didn't find out for nearly a day because he'd gone off grid and he only
00:27:48,00:27:54,found out after his wife got two hundred texts wow so this is about Fred
00:27:54,00:27:59,Ramsdell who's an immunologist yep and a very good one clearly and he and his
00:27:59,00:28:04,wife in October he they'd gone on a three-week hike in Wyoming with their
00:28:04,00:28:08,dogs they were having a whale of a time and they gone they gone off grid and they
00:28:08,00:28:11,turned off their phones and they you know they just had not paid any attention
00:28:11,00:28:16,on the very last day his wife started screaming and he thought she's seen a
00:28:16,00:28:19,bear we're in big trouble and it turns out she just got two hundred tech
00:28:19,00:28:24,messages saying can you please put your phone on the Nobel's are trying to contact you
00:28:24,00:28:27,and that's why I won't ever turn my phone off in case I just win a Nobel
00:28:27,00:28:34,basically yeah and if you turn your phone off you have no bow on it so yeah brilliant
00:28:34,00:28:41,brilliant um yeah they've been trying to get them up for 20 hours and there's
00:28:41,00:28:45,pretty much a new record for how long anyone's been able to stay away from the
00:28:45,00:28:49,Nobel committee trying to contact you right very amazing I mean the quite
00:28:49,00:28:53,often it becomes the viral thing when the Nobel prizes are announced someone
00:28:53,00:28:56,not picking up their phone yeah we love it this happened last year where a
00:28:56,00:28:59,neighbor had to come over who happened to be a scientist at like two in the
00:28:59,00:29:02,morning and was ringing the doorbell yes did I pick up your phone that's 2020
00:29:02,00:29:06,that was Paul Milgram right yeah yeah do you want to hear about Richard Ernst in 1991
00:29:06,00:29:10,he was on a flight from Moscow back to the USA he was asleep it was a night flight
00:29:10,00:29:14,and he was woken up he said there's a phone call for you he said what do you mean
00:29:14,00:29:18,there's a phone call for me it's 1991 how could it be a phone call for me and you
00:29:18,00:29:22,said leave me like I'm going back to sleep I think they did have some phones on
00:29:22,00:29:26,planes but it wasn't a couple of things receive a call he said no let me sleep and
00:29:26,00:29:29,they said no no no get up sir come to the cockpit and he went to the cockpit of
00:29:29,00:29:33,this plane and he put on the radio set the pilot around him and it was the Nobel
00:29:33,00:29:41,committee saying you've just won the Nobel for chemistry yeah he'd done the
00:29:41,00:29:45,research on depending MRI scanning who's a big deal yeah there was a guy
00:29:45,00:29:52,Melvin Calvin going slightly off memory here sounds like he's been filled in
00:29:52,00:29:59,do you want it for he won the science prize and he was not they weren't able to
00:29:59,00:30:06,reach him because he was away secretly at a alien conference and it's not as
00:30:06,00:30:09,weird as it sounds because it's where Carl Sagan and Frank Frank Rakeware where
00:30:09,00:30:14,they the foundations of SETI were so he was at the very first SETI meeting and
00:30:14,00:30:20,they found out as he was busy being probed and they yeah yeah and actually Frank
00:30:20,00:30:23,Drake was going to send off for some champagne and it just so happened that
00:30:23,00:30:28,the person who was the chauffeur for all of them to get them to this place was
00:30:28,00:30:33,called French beverage and what are you talking about I can't I can't send French
00:30:33,00:30:37,beverage to go get the champagne that just feels to the mushrooms that you had
00:30:37,00:30:45,with a a so Melvin Calvin was the guy who won but was at an alien conference well
00:30:45,00:30:49,not an alien conference so we're setting up SETI yeah sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah quite
00:30:49,00:30:53,good the SETI runs with Yeti but those are two of your big interests yes that's
00:30:53,00:30:57,true didn't know that that's a good point I'm spaghetti you like as well don't you
00:30:57,00:31:01,I love spaghetti the whole point is that he wasn't they couldn't reach him and
00:31:01,00:31:04,they got through to his wife you then had to call right the secret base yeah
00:31:04,00:31:08,it's a mention it to him that he had won it a lot of people think it's spam
00:31:08,00:31:12,don't they are telemarketing when people when the Nobel's ring up I really
00:31:12,00:31:16,after as that gunner who won the literature prize a few years ago they rank him
00:31:16,00:31:19,and said you've won the Nobel Prize but before they could say anything he said
00:31:19,00:31:25,leave me alone and just slap the phone down I think Kazooir Ishiguro yeah same thing
00:31:25,00:31:32,I bet yeah so maybe you've already won it Lou you just so off grid which is
00:31:32,00:31:40,where Fred Ramstone was what does that mean well I think it gets used wrong all the
00:31:40,00:31:44,time I certainly use it right people say I'm going off grid yeah and what they
00:31:44,00:31:47,mean is I won't have my phone I'm turning up I'm putting on my out-of-office
00:31:47,00:31:52,of the Eva well Morrison's in Margate it's got no reception so that's off grid
00:31:52,00:31:56,right there we go yeah what it should mean is and you do have to fund for yourself
00:31:56,00:32:01,because some of those are really mixed up but it should be I'm not going to be
00:32:01,00:32:05,using public utilities yes I'm not going to be using public water or electricity
00:32:05,00:32:09,supplies but people don't use it to mean that anymore self-sustainable is
00:32:09,00:32:12,what I want to be right so you have your own electricity you have your own
00:32:12,00:32:17,water source I think they're the big two those are the big two some kind of
00:32:17,00:32:21,sewage system if you're if we're being fussy yes yes yes yes or I radio
00:32:21,00:32:27,didn't listen drawing it out is half the battle you get rid of it or dry it thank
00:32:27,00:32:33,you it's mostly water weight so are you are you interested in this kind of
00:32:33,00:32:39,I would love to keep doing my job and keep doing what I do but then living in a
00:32:39,00:32:44,few acres of land with my own water and electricity solar system all eco I'd
00:32:44,00:32:48,like to sort of have a little eco village so I would like to be self-sustainable
00:32:48,00:32:54,but still you know pop on QI etc you know yeah yeah yeah you'll have to make your
00:32:54,00:33:00,own QI unfortunately no you have to have your own set bill I still want to go
00:33:00,00:33:04,to cafes you know yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm not growing my own coffee beans I think
00:33:04,00:33:07,that's fine I think that is off-grid there's one good way of getting powered
00:33:07,00:33:15,that a youtuber called Chris doll has done you know vapes love him coming out
00:33:15,00:33:21,your ears so vapes they each have a tiny battery in them but what people do is they
00:33:21,00:33:25,vape them until you can vape no more and then you chuck them away but then that
00:33:25,00:33:29,means they're chucking away this tiny battery and usually there's electricity
00:33:29,00:33:35,left on it so this guy he salvaged 500 disposable vapes and turned the
00:33:35,00:33:39,batteries into a working power wall which powers basically all his stuff in his
00:33:39,00:33:44,house wow that's so good yeah it's not that many vapes as well I didn't have
00:33:44,00:33:48,fast to get through a vape 500 well you go through about 20 a day then yeah yeah
00:33:48,00:33:53,I do I do they come with a certain number of puffs don't they and you can buy
00:33:53,00:33:57,mega vapes which are illegal which have more puffs in them really yeah mega
00:33:57,00:34:04,vape I've never felt more how do you do fellow kids talking about vapes yeah yeah
00:34:04,00:34:07,but I think and you can say to you like your news agent whether you've got
00:34:07,00:34:10,the illegal vapes for me and he'll go under the counter and pull out like a
00:34:10,00:34:15,size of a Toblerone and this is how you're also not done it how do you know that he
00:34:15,00:34:20,had the Toblerones come in all different sizes I'm so sorry you're absolutely
00:34:20,00:34:25,right the size of an airport Toblerone oh okay there we go okay right if I ask for
00:34:25,00:34:28,a large Toblerone when they have that under the counter as well they'll actually
00:34:28,00:34:31,pull out a massive Toblerone they'll pull out an even bigger one always a
00:34:31,00:34:35,bigger one yeah there's always a bigger than the counter no I think they're meant
00:34:35,00:34:37,to be legally they have to be rechargeable now but people still throw them away
00:34:37,00:34:41,because they can't be bothered to because they're cheap because they're cheap
00:34:41,00:34:46,there's quite a few places that are kind of set up already for off-grid living
00:34:46,00:34:48,would you have a considered just incorporating yourself into a place the
00:34:48,00:34:53,groundwork having been done yes but how am I going to be a cult leader if there's
00:34:53,00:34:59,already good point you know you know will you kill the kill the previous
00:34:59,00:35:02,leaders are by combat yeah no I want to do it with a couple of friends or
00:35:02,00:35:07,something so I don't know I don't know maybe but then would you have to deal
00:35:07,00:35:11,with annoying people I don't know always in life always yeah usually what happens
00:35:11,00:35:16,with cults is either so it's not actually a cult yeah it's just James is sure
00:35:16,00:35:22,and let's say people who live off-grid in communes yeah usually what happens is
00:35:22,00:35:26,someone decides let's all have sex with each other yes and then they all fall
00:35:26,00:35:31,out or two groups mob and they all fall out well there'll be no sex in my
00:35:31,00:35:35,commune and you know even if it's a married couple I will be enforcing a
00:35:35,00:35:42,sex role you'll be lying in between yeah yeah yeah yeah wholesome wholesome I think I
00:35:42,00:35:46,may have found out the most famous person to be living off-grid I might be
00:35:46,00:35:48,wrong because I'm sure there are loads of candidates currently living off-grid
00:35:48,00:35:58,currently living off-grid I believe okay most people we need the poop okay is
00:35:58,00:36:02,it someone we could guess somebody lives in America a very famous Taylor Swift not
00:36:02,00:36:08,far off actually quite far off screen a carpenter more male more male and
00:36:08,00:36:19,Sabrina Carpenter good luck very narrow sub-separate now Joe Rogan okay writer
00:36:19,00:36:25,writing and he's a writer or that's more correct even closer with Stephen King
00:36:25,00:36:31,somebody who writes famously about rural America Michael John Grisham oh now
00:36:31,00:36:36,we get now we're getting closer now we're getting closer in America he writes a
00:36:36,00:36:40,battle small-time drifter drifting into your town solving some problems
00:36:40,00:36:47,Lee Child's British Lee Child lives in Wyoming Lee Child sorry really dead ball
00:36:47,00:36:51,that on hit that one into the net I just think of because he's British but he
00:36:51,00:36:55,lives in America he does he has experience of life in America now and he lives in
00:36:55,00:37:01,this mad huge estate in Wyoming okay get this Lou I don't know if you be up
00:37:01,00:37:08,for this marrying him so I get my land yeah I just his post box is 10 miles from his
00:37:08,00:37:14,house no thank you 10 miles to the post box often does he said letters all the time
00:37:14,00:37:20,he's exclusively like Jane Austen Lee Child I guess he's not on email his nearest
00:37:20,00:37:26,grocery shop yeah yeah 45 miles away no if he needs to go and get some milk it's
00:37:26,00:37:32,a 90-mile-round trip does he is he making his own milk what are we saying I don't
00:37:32,00:37:37,think that's not he that stays you've got yes you got farm he was just well you
00:37:37,00:37:41,know what Jack Reacher's like Lee Child will just pick up a cow drink straight
00:37:41,00:37:46,from the district no I don't know if he's got a farm but basically he's in this
00:37:46,00:37:52,place in Wyoming Wyoming is the size of the UK but the population is the
00:37:52,00:37:55,"combined populations of Cambridge, Canterbury, Carlyle and Chelmsford as he's"
00:37:55,00:38:00,put it it's just very very sparsely populated and he has a friend who he
00:38:00,00:38:04,sometimes visits for dinner who lives 105 miles away that's I mean I'm not
00:38:04,00:38:10,interested in that life it's so remote yeah so it's so far from
00:38:10,00:38:15,that's 10 miles to your post box yeah for someone as well who kind of puts out a
00:38:15,00:38:18,book a year and is in the press and is doing interviews and presumably doing
00:38:18,00:38:23,lunch yeah but he's not being distracted by constant letters is he so he's not
00:38:23,00:38:26,doing the writers how you write a book a year a lot of people want to move to these
00:38:26,00:38:30,places in case there's like a nuclear war or something or a zombie outbreak
00:38:30,00:38:34,or does that appeal to you Lou are you sort of trying to get a gauge if how much
00:38:34,00:38:39,for not I am and I'm right away and we'll be we'll be bottling all this
00:38:39,00:38:47,well the reason I ask is like a lot of squillainers will buy these sort of
00:38:47,00:38:51,off grid places and we'll have them in case the whole world goes to shit
00:38:51,00:38:57,yeah if I had the money I probably would yeah so this guy Peter Thiel oh yeah
00:38:57,00:39:03,him squillainer asshole he got New Zealand citizenship so that he could build a
00:39:03,00:39:08,super bunker in New Zealand they're all building in New Zealand because they know
00:39:08,00:39:12,that they're causing it like climate damage to anyway they are but there's a new
00:39:12,00:39:16,book by a guy called Mark Linus who looked at all the countries in the world and
00:39:16,00:39:21,who would survive best a nuclear winter situation and New Zealand is one of
00:39:21,00:39:26,the worst places you can be really because they're very unselfsufficient in
00:39:26,00:39:32,food oh wow they import a lot of food so only 68% of Kiwis would survive a
00:39:32,00:39:37,nuclear winter and on the whole world is that the bird the Kiwi or is it the
00:39:37,00:39:46,fruit the best places any of the best places someone once told me that it's
00:39:46,00:39:54,in the UK if you go like no in the UK 99% of people will die well because we're
00:39:54,00:39:57,not self-sufficient with food but I want to focus on that 1% James that's
00:39:57,00:40:01,that's who I absolutely think I want to see in the world yeah yeah I got 50
00:40:01,00:40:05,cans of beans under my dad yeah you will be the 1% I reckon living in your
00:40:05,00:40:10,self-sufficient um well okay I'm a highly allergic to beans that's the only
00:40:10,00:40:18,problem yeah so some of the self-sufficient in terms of food yeah it's really
00:40:18,00:40:22,interesting is it somewhere in and energy and various different things oh it's
00:40:22,00:40:27,like Sweden or Norway or something like that I'll give you Iceland thank you
00:40:27,00:40:31,oh because they've got all the GM far yeah they've got all those kind of great
00:40:31,00:40:36,aisles of options and Australia Iceland Argentina Paraguay Uruguay and Costa
00:40:36,00:40:41,Rica and Haiti places where they're kind of self-sufficient in themselves that
00:40:41,00:40:44,they can feed their whole population yeah right right because of because of
00:40:44,00:40:48,Australia you said is sort of they I think they've got so much solar power
00:40:48,00:40:51,they've just been giving everyone three hours of free and they got very low
00:40:51,00:40:55,population as well yeah Australia is a good place to go yeah and also they have
00:40:55,00:40:59,lots of different sort of climates there so you could grow lots of stuff in the
00:40:59,00:41:03,north that you can't grow in the south and stuff you can't grow in the north so
00:41:03,00:41:05,if you need all the different bits of it if everyone was wiped out in England
00:41:05,00:41:09,I'd just sort of go along as well I'm not I'm not that interested in living
00:41:09,00:41:14,underground for five years on some teams but you live near the Ramsgate tunnels
00:41:14,00:41:17,which are perfectly yeah perfectly set they're already set up they've got the
00:41:17,00:41:24,bunk beds left over from the war in there oh for no one I'll fit in nicely I'll be
00:41:24,00:41:38,running my coat no okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that is my
00:41:38,00:41:43,fact my fact this week is that at Morrissey gigs security have been known to
00:41:43,00:41:52,pat down fans to search them for meat wow the idea of a big security is kind of
00:41:52,00:41:56,going off you just see the shape of a pork chop in someone's pocket or a sausage or
00:41:56,00:42:01,a sausage yeah I do the same at my gigs actually do yeah yeah but I'm sort of
00:42:01,00:42:05,wanting to find the meat is are you doing the patdowns yourself yeah I am yeah I'm
00:42:05,00:42:09,gonna do the patdowns yeah I'm gonna meet and greet with loose enders as a very
00:42:09,00:42:15,different meaning I pay you I pay you to meet and greet you
00:42:15,00:42:20,so this is Morrissey singer from the band The Smiths who's had a very long solo
00:42:20,00:42:26,career after they break up and he is a committed vegetarian and vegan and he
00:42:26,00:42:33,hates meat to the point that if it is even in the air if he can even smell it at a
00:42:33,00:42:38,gig he will be known to walk off stage so he always says that if he's gonna
00:42:38,00:42:41,play a venue you're not allowed to sell meat in the venue for that specific gig
00:42:41,00:42:44,so if he was playing let's say the O2 in London that would be one of the
00:42:44,00:42:49,conditions that he would have and in 2011 fans were reporting that as they
00:42:49,00:42:52,were coming through the security barriers men and women were patting them down
00:42:52,00:42:57,searching for meat I think it's fair enough yeah it's his gig like I think the
00:42:57,00:43:03,searching is a bit I think the searching is because once or twice he said
00:43:03,00:43:09,sausages thrown at him once yeah which I don't think is on I do think that's
00:43:09,00:43:13,poor form yeah do you need to search everyone for meat just the people who
00:43:13,00:43:17,look suspicious they look like they might be packing a suspicious sausage but
00:43:17,00:43:23,you can anyone in tide I come straight through but you can meet his I would say
00:43:23,00:43:27,quite easy to smuggle yeah because you're made of meat so there's no way they
00:43:27,00:43:32,could do like a X-ray thing because your whole body's meat it's only if there's
00:43:32,00:43:36,it's there's an extra bone you would spot that if someone's smuggling in a
00:43:36,00:43:42,tea ball steak a tea ball steak yeah I agree I think it's a bit much it's a
00:43:42,00:43:46,bit much he's he said he's he doesn't identify with the term vegan but he's
00:43:46,00:43:49,managed to find an even smaller subset of what does he identify with that he
00:43:49,00:43:53,says he just says are refused to eat anything that had a mother he says he's
00:43:53,00:44:02,never had a curry or coffee or garlic coffee got a mother but he said his
00:44:02,00:44:07,diet consists of bread potato pasta and nuts so it feels it feels more like a
00:44:07,00:44:12,sort of channel for documentry about a façade this is this is interesting
00:44:12,00:44:16,though his influence despite him being this character that people find quite
00:44:16,00:44:22,difficult people get annoyed with vegans and my theory is that because they know
00:44:22,00:44:27,that they shouldn't really be eat something in them feels a bit icky about eating
00:44:27,00:44:31,animals they feel embarrassed about themselves that's possible yeah and
00:44:31,00:44:38,Coachella the big festival really tried hard to get a Smith reunion and
00:44:38,00:44:42,there's been so much fallout between the members Johnny Mar and and Morrissey
00:44:42,00:44:48,don't particularly they do not get on they do not get on and so Coachella said we
00:44:48,00:44:51,want you to get back we're gonna pay you a lot of money and we will make Coachella
00:44:51,00:44:56,a vegetarian oh wow experience and he said I would rather eat my own testicles
00:44:56,00:45:02,why which is not very vegan but he uh because this is how much the band do not
00:45:02,00:45:06,like each other I'm afraid this will be us in 30 years I think last maybe last
00:45:06,00:45:09,year they almost got together and Morrissey wanted them to get together because
00:45:09,00:45:14,they got offered an insane amount of money but Johnny Mar said no oh wow
00:45:14,00:45:18,he could have given it to the animal charity and Morrissey has canceled a
00:45:18,00:45:23,gig in Iceland over there meet policy market yeah they do a lot of
00:45:23,00:45:31,form rings though they you know no geothermally powered country Iceland but
00:45:31,00:45:36,the venue just refused to stop selling meat for one day and he said I love
00:45:36,00:45:39,Iceland and have waited a long time to return but I should leave the Harpack
00:45:39,00:45:43,concert hall to their cannibalistic flesh eating bloodlust yeah he's not
00:45:43,00:45:48,afraid to put together a pitty quote for a press release I'll say that yeah I
00:45:48,00:45:51,think it's crazy though the venue couldn't stop selling meat for a day because it's
00:45:51,00:45:55,so bad for the planet as well you think you know just don't sell meat for a day
00:45:55,00:45:59,people will cope I think the thing is with Iceland though they have like a
00:45:59,00:46:03,history meeting lots of meat because they've not been able to grow plants for
00:46:03,00:46:07,many hundreds of years especially in the winter so they really do have a very big
00:46:07,00:46:12,culture of eating white whales males yeah puffins fish I think you're right
00:46:12,00:46:15,I think the vegan thing is really interesting because I think he's he's been
00:46:15,00:46:18,very provocative in the way he presents it like his tour gates would you know
00:46:18,00:46:21,what's provocative slaughterhouses slaughterhouses are provocative absolutely
00:46:21,00:46:25,absolutely and I think probably he sort of deliberately does it in a
00:46:25,00:46:29,way maybe because he's trying to shock people and no one's listening well I
00:46:29,00:46:32,think it works on only a small percentage of it I think people are likely to
00:46:32,00:46:36,shut it out if something is so upsetting I think yeah like the vegan is a
00:46:36,00:46:39,movement that's had a bit of a stumble in recent years it's a bit less popular
00:46:39,00:46:42,than it was about five years ago yeah and just a lot of people have sort of
00:46:42,00:46:46,thought of what is quite difficult now I can't quite be bothered to cut out
00:46:46,00:46:49,everything and you know like vegetarians sometimes get stick for not being
00:46:49,00:46:53,vegans and like that kind of thing so it's I think it's tricky how you sort of
00:46:53,00:46:57,softly softly people into it yeah do you guys remember that Morrissey wrote a
00:46:57,00:47:02,novel and it became quite well-known for the fact that it contained possibly the
00:47:02,00:47:06,worst sex scene of the year oh included in the book did it when there's no
00:47:06,00:47:11,word for the worst sex it did it won the 2015 worst sex scene so his book was
00:47:11,00:47:14,called List of the Lost could you be in a sexy voice yeah what do you want to do
00:47:14,00:47:21,you want to okay here we go Eliza and Ezra rolled together in the one giggling
00:47:21,00:47:25,snowball a full-figured copulation screaming and shouting as they playfully
00:47:25,00:47:31,bit and pull each other in a dangerous and cool I think it's good so far yeah sorry
00:47:31,00:47:38,how's everyone else doing in a glamorous roller coaster coil of sexually
00:47:38,00:47:42,violent rotation with Eliza's breasts barrel rolled across as was howling
00:47:42,00:47:49,mouth and painted and the pained frenzy of his bulbous solute salt solute was
00:47:49,00:47:56,that's how it tastes sorry extenuating his excitement as it whacked and
00:47:56,00:48:00,smacked its way into every muscle of Eliza's body except for the otherwise
00:48:00,00:48:04,central zone this is a Tuesday night at my house this is just this is just
00:48:04,00:48:10,Tuesday's that's mad I think I do think sexy novels are a bit less sexy what
00:48:10,00:48:15,you have to ask people can you tell me what this is but that is insane he's never
00:48:15,00:48:21,had sex I'm sorry I think it's so good yeah yeah there is so many big metaphors in
00:48:21,00:48:24,there yeah they're like a snowball and they're like a roller coaster
00:48:24,00:48:29,it's a timeless roller coaster coil yeah and it's quite aggressive not at
00:48:29,00:48:33,not at all sexually violent rotation is a bit I mean if you're breasts are doing
00:48:33,00:48:38,barrel rolls that's the least imagine like that's RAF stuff isn't that's like
00:48:38,00:48:45,that's the red arrows you know and your bulbous salutation is a bit that's
00:48:45,00:48:52,mad bulbous salutations feels like they might support this one on Morris
00:48:52,00:48:57,he's books yeah yeah he has been a bit controversial because he wrote an
00:48:57,00:49:02,autobiography a memoir and it was published by Penguin Classics yeah so same
00:49:02,00:49:07,list as Ovid home was Odyssey and he's basically said I'll do I'll do a book
00:49:07,00:49:12,but only if it goes in straight as a Penguin Classic oh wow yeah a Penguin
00:49:12,00:49:15,class sorry I didn't really take notice yeah so yeah so it didn't come out in
00:49:15,00:49:18,hardback which would be your traditional release it was straight into a paper
00:49:18,00:49:24,bag with the classic yeah yeah wow Plato is is they're on the same
00:49:24,00:49:28,list my book is bold and I think it got him a lot of publicity yeah
00:49:28,00:49:32,negative yeah yeah yeah yeah but he's got a long history writing so when he
00:49:32,00:49:36,before he was a pop star he wrote unsolicited script for Coronation Street did
00:49:36,00:49:39,they go with it or not he sent it to them he sent them a script where the
00:49:39,00:49:44,Rovers return installs a jukebox and they did not it's basically fanfiction isn't it
00:49:44,00:49:49,it's basically fanfiction yeah yeah yeah I found one other example just while
00:49:49,00:49:54,we're still on Marcy slash musicians of people who are very strict vegan
00:49:54,00:49:59,slash vegetarians to the point where it almost seems a bit awkward
00:49:59,00:50:06,Katie Lang oh yeah Katie Lang once refused to meet the singer Meetloaf
00:50:06,00:50:13,because of his name wow yeah it was an interview from Meetloaf where he said I was
00:50:13,00:50:18,a vegetarian for 10 years and I was sitting next to John Bon Jovi and awards
00:50:18,00:50:22,thing and I said oh man I'd love to meet Katie Lang I'd really love to meet her
00:50:22,00:50:26,they went to find out if that's okay she said no his name is Meetloaf but he
00:50:26,00:50:29,was a vegetarian at the time possibly he'd lapsed at that point okay he had been
00:50:29,00:50:33,a vegetarian at some point for 10 years yeah I think I think it's a bit
00:50:33,00:50:37,strict of Katie though yeah I had just while we're on sort of pop stars and
00:50:37,00:50:40,stuff before we go on to veganism I had a look at some other riders that people
00:50:40,00:50:46,have so Kanye West apparently when he played later with Jules Holland that he
00:50:46,00:50:52,must have his dressing room carpet ironed wow M&M apparently when he played
00:50:52,00:50:59,at a festival in Northern Ireland insisted on a coy carp pond okay and according
00:50:59,00:51:04,to TMZ there's a rapper called DMX who I'm not massively familiar with oh yeah
00:51:04,00:51:09,he's a biggie though yeah he is big and for every rider he wants a bottle of
00:51:09,00:51:15,Hennessy and three boxes of condoms three boxes which boxes were the boxes well
00:51:15,00:51:19,sometimes the box is a fewer like so even if there was three in a box had the
00:51:19,00:51:24,year-end you can get through nine before of gig not before not when I'm at when
00:51:24,00:51:34,I'm at the Bill Murray it's a similar story it seats 90 I'm optimistic no that's
00:51:34,00:51:39,man I was wondering if he might be using them to carry water because they're quite
00:51:39,00:51:47,good for that I heard the Drake puts when he finishes off in a condom because he
00:51:47,00:51:51,doesn't want you know kids with some like you know stranger that he's yeah
00:51:51,00:51:58,even when he puts like chili flakes in the reminence or something so they
00:51:58,00:52:05,can't shove it up them oh that's what I heard so people might take the condom and
00:52:05,00:52:09,shove and chili flakes is going to stop them I mean if you're mentally
00:52:09,00:52:13,enough to want to do the first part about do you think the chili flakes would stop
00:52:13,00:52:37,I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
