 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish, where we were
 joined by the absolutely brilliant Lou Sanders. Now you'll remember Lou because
 she's been on fish a couple of times I think, she's been on QI many many times,
 she's an absolute favourite of ours, she's so so funny, so so brilliant. There's
 loads of things I could tell you about her, she's written books, she's on tour next
 year, but really the best place to find out everything about her is to go to
 Lou Sanders that's l-o-u-s-a-n-d-e-r-s dot com and all of the information about
 her is there if you want to learn more, which I bet you will because she is a real
 tour de force and she definitely shows that off in this episode today and of
 course it would be remiss of me not to mention club fish go to patreon.com/nosuchthingsafish
 and find out everything there is to get there there is merch there's bonus stuff
 others all sorts you know where to go patreon.com/nosuchthingsafish and find out more
 not much more to say apart from on with the podcast
 hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Shriver I am sitting
 here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Lou Sanders and once again we
 have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the
 last seven days and in a particular order here we go starting with fact number
 one and that is Lou. Well you're more likely to get your way if you ask
 one for a favor in the right ear and not the left ear it's called right ear
 dominance okay so yeah interesting where we're sat you're speaking into
 and these right ear yeah and into our left ears can I get more money for the polka yes
 it wouldn't work if I asked Dan that no no um right to write a dominance is this
 like being like left or right handed or left or right footage is to do with the
 hemispheres of the brain and now I'll consult my phone
 you got the baby that's right without looking at I was quite impressed myself actually
 yeah so it's called right ear advantage I said that didn't I for verbal
 commands and persuasion can you imagine sort of like looping round and going
 through the other way to sort of ask yeah you've got to do it subtly yes you've
 got to make your way over getting out of the bed going round to her side yeah it
 does make sense to sleep on the right side of the bed right yes yeah that is
 how we're positioned in bed is that right yes I don't want to hear how you're
 positioned in bed who's mixing the who's right here for now look at my right
 I heard it was top to jail with you I thought it was you on the top bunk that's
 very cool yeah um that's a very good idea I've you would see now I wonder if
 you look at classic photos a big business meals and so on whether or not you
 see you know who's on the right side of Trump for example yeah who's on the
 right side of history so do we know why it's why this well let me consult
 AI is now you when you search engine something AI comes up first she's annoying
 because they're using all the water um don't get me started language I left
 hemisphere dominance language and verbal information are primarily
 processed by the left hemisphere of the brain in most people in most people oh the
 right here is more directly wired to the left hemisphere faster processing
 information received is interesting through the right ear reaches the language
 processing center in the left hemisphere more quickly I don't know oh here we go
 this is more interesting a study conducted in Italian nightclubs where
 researchers asked clubbers for a cigarette in their left ear or right ear found
 that requests made in a right ear were twice as successful really yeah I'd say I
 don't want to cigarette in my left ear Italian nightclubs the cradle of science I've
 done my own research in there no no one one of us sitting around this table for
 a particular reason has better hearing than the other three irrespective of
 okay a major hearing damage okay I mean have better hearing women have better
 hearing than men because we are supposed to get up for the baby I suppose that'll
 be it is it better hearing in terms of like you know the higher a sound goes
 and then only dogs can hear it do they have a higher range that's for sure they
 do yeah yeah but it's also player sound at any part of the range and women will
 be more likely to perceive it than men and our eyes are better as well so we can
 see more colors than men yes it's not like why are we so downtrodden when we're
 actually better um oh it's made you a stronger yeah yeah you've put all we're
 emotionally strong if someone's fighting you you can't say oh I can see 20 colors
 here yeah we're emotionally strong that's true so you tell me how often are you
 getting into fights and how often are you seeing and hearing things every day
 you're seeing and hearing fights even you not one month is it I am from the
 north one interesting thing about women having better hearing is they can hear
 higher things and that means that there was a thing where people were making
 household appliances and they'd have a very high sort of hum but the people who
 are making them were often men so the men couldn't hear it and then they'd sell
 them and the women were using them this is like in the 70s and 80s yeah and the
 women could hear it that's that's like the um it's a sort of invisible women
 that book yes yeah yeah it's all about how things are not built with women in
 mind but that's so funny that men have been making like screaming blenders
 yeah and perceivable to them another way to terrorize us congratulations
 it's weird that this was done in Italian night clubs yeah because I think there's a
 big history of make your place your job you know yeah I think there's a big
 history of Italian ear science really yeah so Alessandra Volta was the
 count Italian count the battery and the battery needed a lot of it wow electrical
 experimentation and he was one of the pioneers of electrifying ears why was he
 electrifying ears he was electrifying everything he could get his hands on but
 one of them invented the battery what are you gonna do yeah that's USP basically
 going around night clubs just battery in people right yeah but there were lots
 a lot I think lots of Italian pioneers here's another thing two people around
 this table have better hearing than the other two irrespective of Lou getting
 about them male female thing forget about me and Lou because we live by the sea
 you got it well not within the city actually people who live in the city have
 better hearing oh so you're me yes sorry that's right and this is according to a
 study at the University of Giesen in Germany and they found that people in
 quiet villages they don't have so good hearing because they don't have to
 fight over the traffic and stuff all the time and the absolute worst hearing of
 anyone in the world where do you think they live the quietest place quietest
 but then there's an extra thing on top it's not Wales it's quiet but there's a
 background noise so like near and nuclear reactor because it's low population
 but the nuclear reactor's humming it's not that it's East Asian villages because
 they have a very quiet life that every now and then they get huge firework
 displays and that really damages their hearing but then they also have the
 quiet thing I was looking into is inevitably landed on Van Gogh because that's
 where all year research will get you to and I was reading about when he was
 getting his ear treated after after an injury to it and I can't tell if this was
 the injury where he lobbed it off or if he had another injury where he just
 cut it with a razor and needed it looked after either way he saw a doctor
 called Dr Felix Ray and as a thank you he gave Dr Felix Ray a portrait of Dr
 Felix Ray so he did one over a number of days handed to him to say yeah really
 beautiful painting I've seen it Dr Ray hated it as his wife so for the next 10
 years they used it to block up a hole that was in the chicken coop but they had
 outside their house they have the painting on the inside of the
 house that's where it stayed for 10 years it was eventually sold off and it's
 now in a museum and it's estimated to be worth about 50 million but they get
 the money for it did they get some money for I think no I think it got you know
 just picked it on to someone else if they got any money would be in a small
 amount yeah wow could I should have kept that fan art that someone sent me with a
 boggly eye they tagged me in I thought I'm not reposting that if you do make
 fan art people you want them should we post it make it on the right side of
 flattering sure here's another really famous here on science history okay the
 year on the rat the year on the rat the year of the rat the year of the
 house does anyone ever yes I do and here was grown on the back of a rat the year was
 grown on the back of a rat a human here a human ear was grown on the back of a
 rat and people science has been doing this for at least 20 years on and off the
 first one was done in 1997 wow I think there's a scientist the original the
 Vacanty mouse I think the scientist was Joseph Vacanty talent may have been
 Italian it certainly sounds Italian oh yeah they love the ears yeah and he
 basically he was a pediatric surgeon and one of his colleagues said we really
 struggle with recreating good ears for children of child's lost an ear and an
 accident or something it's really hard to shape the cartilage to make it
 yeah because you can't hear out the mouse can't hear out of that massive ear on
 its back kind of no it's not like it's not a working ear it's just the
 outside bit it's it's the same as the shell exactly it's the kind of the
 external yeah and they grow it and they would put a they put a frame on the
 mouse or the rat that grows the ear so it grows into the shape of the ear
 because there's a mold yes it's like forcing a cucumber to the right place I didn't
 know that detail I just thought yeah actually think it was like the
 mouse is going fuck I didn't think it was that fairly function I don't have any
 cigarettes to give you I'm sorry no business so and his breath weirdly the
 vacanti vacanti and his brother had both worked on the same problem but they've
 keep doing it the latest one I think was in 2016 and they said we're going to
 move to human trials so yeah I was in growing the ears on animals and then
 implanting them into humans yeah so far the trailer's gone cold I believe so
 can we just grow a whole human if we put it in a mold if you put a mold of a
 human no there is a market for that is there what doesn't do anything does it
 but it's a human doll oh yeah yeah yes yes like the ear it wouldn't it would
 just be a it would just be the shape yeah I don't think there's a grown on the
 backs of mice as far as I understand well you couldn't put a high human body on
 the back of a mice it would topple over yes absolutely yeah whatever also it
 wouldn't be able to get back into its hole would it because the human would be
 too this is you know it's obvious it's obvious it's a terrible idea yeah I don't
 have to be the one to say that come on boys come on you're supposed to be
 braining you can't go ahead of body on a mouse come on yeah real and we've been
 doing it for as you say since 1997 yeah multiple years but no ear has ever
 gone from a mouse to a human I believe not so I'm to move on I think it's time to
 double them but also you always read things in the paper that says oh they've
 figured out a way to do this and then you don't hear any more about it I think
 it's like to give us a bit of a lift and a bit of a story but they're not really
 planning on doing anything with it like the the thing that ain't plastic the little
 bacteria yeah where's that gone I think it's probably when I was talking about it
 they let go of disappeared yeah yeah you know they give us a bit of a good
 news yeah oh they've saved sight or something I read the other day right come on
 then it's it's always a very early development
 yeah don't waste my time yeah come back to me it's because they need to do the
 headlines to get funding yeah yes so they do the big oh we're going to save
 this yeah the newspapers say we're going to save this and they're like no we just
 really just want a few grand to buy some nice on the hearing front what is it
 with people that talk really loudly I've got two friends that talks so loudly
 they must be deaf yeah for now says that I talk extremely loudly and I don't
 think I do no she's always going on about how you shout out her a lot yeah yeah
 when I when I've been with you guys that might be what she's talking about my
 rage I mean I've got like 15 kids to shout over we do and also when you're
 sleeping top to tails it does take yeah the blankets yeah we should be
 bouncing oh feel like we have a nobody facts oh we've done loads oh we've done
 tons if you've got bigger ears do you think you hear better or worse or the
 better better you're right it's one of those facts that's just what you would
 imagine it's so enjoyable but that's the case yeah that bigger is mean it's only
 it's very very slight it's 15 decibels difference which is basically you can't
 really tell the difference but yeah it does make a difference like if you have
 the bigger nose can you smell better probably not right because it doesn't
 necessarily mean your receptors are any better it's you can take more air and
 in one sniff why don't you let us know dad okay wait that's got a big big nose I've
 got a small nose and you make a smell and we'll see who smells it first yeah
 make a smell make a smell right now I'm doing it if you can smell it at home do let us
 know podcasted QI dot com okay it is time for fact number two and that is James okay
 my fat this week is that the town of Ramsgate is named after a gate for Ravens
 very confusing that's so cool it is really cool well I think is wonder Ravens
 need a gate it's a gap in the cliffs where the Ravens go in I thought you could
 say it's a gap in the market we think it comes from the old English word gate
 meaning gate and laughing which means Raven and that became Ramsgate
 laughing also sometimes means warlord so it could be gate of the warlord and
 Daniel Defoe thought that Ramsgate was originally called Romansgate and it's
 where the Romans landed because it was actually where the Romans landed but
 can we just say for maybe for international listeners from the north or
 listeners from the north or west of England or other parts of the UK who may
 not know about the bustling metropolis of Ramsgate yes for Ramsgators yeah well
 part of fan it which is on the southeast coast that's a circular no it's a
 it's it's it's because it's quite connected to quite a few places that you may
 have heard of margate broad stairs and Ramsgate kind of come as a trio you've
 got Westgate as well it's a it's a town it's a town on the you're trying to get
 to it's a town it's just say if you want us to say it's a town you say it I just
 think that's referencing can I just say it's a margate I think the fact was the
 town of Ramsgate you're right you're absolutely right you're right it's a classic
 English seaside town in many ways yes yeah it's lovely and it's it's so
 interesting I had no idea how interesting it is is it where you live where are
 you no no I've no I know I know I do what you're talking about no I was I would
 live there from two to four then I move next door to broad stairs now I live in
 Margate so do the trilogy oh it's that going or down market to go well they all
 changed the Ramsgate was of dive and then broad stairs is a bit of
 fancier then Margate was a dive but now it's fancier you know what regular
 listeners will know about Margate because Dan goes on about it so much yeah
 because I live there yeah it's not just because it's nice it's nice I really
 excitedly I went to see a school today it's one that my daughter might go to and
 they said that every year they take all the kids on a trip to Margate and I
 got to say sold yeah yeah well I think if it was a trip to Ramsgate that'd be
 even better because it's stunningly interesting it's one of those towns where
 it's quite it's reasonably close to London and then for a spell in the what
 18th and 19th century it was one of the most fashionable places on the planet
 incredibly beautiful buildings incredibly rich history in terms of
 connections to Europe it's got weight troze it's got a weight troze Charles Darwin
 had a flat did a lot of his barnacle research in the area
 van Gogh van Gogh oh that brings it of chicken coop famous wow
 himself spent three months as a teacher a lot of artists do you go to the
 area because the lights are very beautiful you see this one rising Ramsgate and
 you see this on set in Margate something to do with those yeah
 geography teaching a teaching assistant I think teaching assistant who's TA who
 was who was van Gogh van Gogh I mean you're actually being the teacher in the class
 where van Gogh is a teaching assistant right that's quite trick if you're the art
 teacher as I'm presuming he was yeah and you're trying to teach something he's
 in the pack of it weird yeah but it was also branded in world or one as the most
 bombed seaside town in the UK basically the first blitzes hit Ramsgate and they
 had an amazing way of dealing with that which I'm sure Andy you must have
 read into and enjoyed the tunnels that they built yeah oh tunneled into the
 cliffs they dug and I think it was for the second mobile was the big bombing
 grades yeah the worst time in the first mobile the second mobile they just dug
 this cave complex into the bliss I think they can get 60,000 people down there they
 quite so it's really I didn't know this and I've been to these caves while I've
 been to the gift shop we didn't quite make it into the caves no but we were we
 we're going back isn't the gift shop usually at the end of this
 specter you would get in for free by going through the gift shop walking backwards
 to the side style so what's it saying a rock yeah it's like a model of a cave
 what is it no it's where you actually buy the tickets to go into the cave but
 they can only take you as a tour group so you can't just wander in so it's huge
 and initially why it was built was it goes deep into away from the ocean in land
 and it was for the local town members to have a tunnel that would get them
 straight to the seaside so it wasn't built initially for the bombing but they
 were they were already live at the seaside but it's just a quick way rather than
 going through the town yeah because there's a little there's a little there's
 a little rail yeah it was trains exactly I'll go above ground what if you need to
 pop to boots or something also people get a piss of that tunnel yeah surely not
 surely not in Ramsgate oh well do you want to story about Ramsgate that's not
 very high brats please I years ago I was thinking why don't I just buy in Ramsgate
 this was like years and years ago and I felt it's quite nice and then I was
 seriously considering it and then I went to the toilet Ramsgate station
 before I got on the train and someone had done a shit a loft of the radiator in
 the waiting room a loft of the radiator yeah it's just they've they've positioned
 themselves on top of the radiator so the toilet was like two seconds through a
 door toilets there but they said no what I'll do is pull down my pants in the
 waiting room and just poop on a radiator no get out broad stairs do you you
 don't get that much in broad stairs definitely humor well I haven't got time to
 do you know the world's biggest weather spoons is in Ramsgate I go there
 probably do you do actually I do I don't because he he was like a pioneer of
 Brexit not you know but you can get a pint of ruddles for £1.20 all right here
 we go okay here we go yeah it does it's Matt is great to list it yeah it's
 1,500 people it can hold which is the same as Shakespeare's Globe wow it's an
 old ballroom yeah it's an old ballroom and it's really beautiful it's right on the
 beach it's a it's a great it's a great big pub it's true I'm with Lou it's a
 shithole it's a two-minute walk from the caves by the way if anyone there's some
 lovely little independent wine bars up there say that do you know the home for
 smack boys yeah no that's in Ramsgate what is it it's what does it sound like
 where Max is Congregate I know come on I like boys where people who worked on
 smacks are they yeah fishing boats fishing smacks yeah and they went out with
 boys as young as sort of probably about 14 were going out working on the fishing
 boats and said this was a place to give them food and accommodation and you know
 stability yeah still if you walk across from this building it still has the words
 like something like home of the smack boys on the side which if you don't know
 what that means is quite confusing yeah what it's attached to is the sailors
 church which is this tiny church you can fit about 30 people in there I've been
 into it multiple times I've never seen a service done there but I started
 reading into it and there's reviews by I didn't know this was a thing mystery
 worshipers so it's like mystery shoppers yeah is not great so yeah you would have
 mystery shoppers who would do that they mystery worshipers are people who go
 into a church they experience it and they report back on a survey that they're
 questioned about did you connect with the almighty yeah exactly level of
 spiritual well questions are like how full was the building did anyone welcome
 you personally were the puse comfortable and the person who filled it in was
 slightly slightly odd was the puse comfortable the puse had very low back
 support so I thought on balance no it was uncomfortable off balance mark yeah
 did the service make you feel glad to be a Christian I didn't feel miserable
 that's an accomplishment
 someone who used to regularly go to church yeah if any new person came into our
 church everyone would know yeah because it would always be the same family
 everyone would sit in the same places and stuff like that if someone sat in your
 place you would know immediately that they were a secret mystery
 worshiper mystery worshipers the smallest church in the world maybe is in
 over just a really I think so every time someone asked me if that's really true
 our panic but I think that house how small will be talking tiny can a fit one
 person and a lot of people obviously I've not got the answers hey Andy I thought
 you would hate Ramsgate because your hero hated Ramsgate Jane Austen correct
 really why well she thought it was a place of distribute as seaside results were
 in her day really sure and apparently according to Kent historian Norman
 Thomas she mentions it in pride and prejudice in Mansfield Park and she's
 never complimentary and either I've not read any Jane Austen so I think it's
 where mr. Darcy's sister is nearly seduced by mr. Wickham in I think it
 happens in Ramsgate it's at the place is that the one where mr. Darcy leaves a
 turd on a radiator yeah and that's when Lizzie Bennett knows that he's the one yeah
 I think her brother lived down there for a while captain Austin yes she had a load
 of brothers who were navy or military and I think it was a place where you know
 this thing scarlet fever not the disease is where it's basically sorry just
 cut out everything I said about the smoothies you know if you wonder why it was
 quite the last couple minutes no it's one of the smallest work in church is in
 England Dover's tiny chapels and Edmund of Abeddon is the only church still in
 existence that was dead and by that point you get quite bored right you got it
 it's a small job it's a small get over it sorry what are you saying nothing
 important yeah I got I got quite a nice message which is something that
 usually would be reserved for drop us a line but a listener who runs a local
 thing called Margate mushrooms so as Andy and James or no I've been taking
 lion's main mushrooms it's a little drip to help your concentration we have to
 keep this for the advertising bit of the show we have to put it in a
 break we can't just work at it we can't just work at it what turns out the
 person who makes this stuff listens to our show I had no idea and she
 messaged me she listened to our episode about crafts that are going in
 danger and virtually out Ramsgate is home to one of the very few chainmail
 makers living in the UK so a guy named Nick Chexfield so he has a lifetime
 achievement award from the Heritage Crafts Association and she was saying
 because she knows him or it's only spoken to him and she was saying he's so
 good at understanding chainmail that if he looks at old centuries-old chain
 mail he can tell if the maker was right or left-handed he can tell if they
 were getting tired as they were making it who's fact checking him you know what I
 mean I could go on and go like yeah okay this guy's as such a
 serious you know well he's dead he's dead 100 years ago so that's easier to
 fact check well he's got he's got a website Nick Chexfield Nick Chexfield
 website no it doesn't good and I would like some free mushroom jobs as well would
 you right but check this out I'm the website he has an advice hotline for if you
 have emergency questions about your chainmail now this is gonna come in you
 so she might just drop that down what circumstances do you need emergency
 advice about it like if a hundred crossbow balls are flying towards you
 okay does he sell much do you think I don't know if he sells much and I don't I
 assume the the advice hotline is for people who are in museums who might have
 damaged the chainmail and they need some advice on what to immediately do
 he's doing great anyway that's a that's a craft rams engaged and he's
 down the rams get a hero yeah along with oh backpack really my broad studs
 backpacks was supposed to post again again I will have to fact check that well
 see you in a few minutes and then the book goes get shorter is that the guy who
 created backpacks a backpacks and I'll post gate right right how do you
 retain all this information this is crazy to me yeah well the good thing is I
 can keep staying stuff and if I get it wrong that just cut it out but I couldn't
 even remember that I booked account for myself the other day fascinating that you
 will need to remove your chainmail for that okay it's time for fact number three
 and that is Andy my fact is the scientist who won this year's Nobel prize for
 medicine didn't find out for nearly a day because he'd gone off grid and he only
 found out after his wife got two hundred texts wow so this is about Fred
 Ramsdell who's an immunologist yep and a very good one clearly and he and his
 wife in October he they'd gone on a three-week hike in Wyoming with their
 dogs they were having a whale of a time and they gone they gone off grid and they
 turned off their phones and they you know they just had not paid any attention
 on the very last day his wife started screaming and he thought she's seen a
 bear we're in big trouble and it turns out she just got two hundred tech
 messages saying can you please put your phone on the Nobel's are trying to contact you
 and that's why I won't ever turn my phone off in case I just win a Nobel
 basically yeah and if you turn your phone off you have no bow on it so yeah brilliant
 brilliant um yeah they've been trying to get them up for 20 hours and there's
 pretty much a new record for how long anyone's been able to stay away from the
 Nobel committee trying to contact you right very amazing I mean the quite
 often it becomes the viral thing when the Nobel prizes are announced someone
 not picking up their phone yeah we love it this happened last year where a
 neighbor had to come over who happened to be a scientist at like two in the
 morning and was ringing the doorbell yes did I pick up your phone that's 2020
 that was Paul Milgram right yeah yeah do you want to hear about Richard Ernst in 1991
 he was on a flight from Moscow back to the USA he was asleep it was a night flight
 and he was woken up he said there's a phone call for you he said what do you mean
 there's a phone call for me it's 1991 how could it be a phone call for me and you
 said leave me like I'm going back to sleep I think they did have some phones on
 planes but it wasn't a couple of things receive a call he said no let me sleep and
 they said no no no get up sir come to the cockpit and he went to the cockpit of
 this plane and he put on the radio set the pilot around him and it was the Nobel
 committee saying you've just won the Nobel for chemistry yeah he'd done the
 research on depending MRI scanning who's a big deal yeah there was a guy
 Melvin Calvin going slightly off memory here sounds like he's been filled in
 do you want it for he won the science prize and he was not they weren't able to
 reach him because he was away secretly at a alien conference and it's not as
 weird as it sounds because it's where Carl Sagan and Frank Frank Rakeware where
 they the foundations of SETI were so he was at the very first SETI meeting and
 they found out as he was busy being probed and they yeah yeah and actually Frank
 Drake was going to send off for some champagne and it just so happened that
 the person who was the chauffeur for all of them to get them to this place was
 called French beverage and what are you talking about I can't I can't send French
 beverage to go get the champagne that just feels to the mushrooms that you had
 with a a so Melvin Calvin was the guy who won but was at an alien conference well
 not an alien conference so we're setting up SETI yeah sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah quite
 good the SETI runs with Yeti but those are two of your big interests yes that's
 true didn't know that that's a good point I'm spaghetti you like as well don't you
 I love spaghetti the whole point is that he wasn't they couldn't reach him and
 they got through to his wife you then had to call right the secret base yeah
 it's a mention it to him that he had won it a lot of people think it's spam
 don't they are telemarketing when people when the Nobel's ring up I really
 after as that gunner who won the literature prize a few years ago they rank him
 and said you've won the Nobel Prize but before they could say anything he said
 leave me alone and just slap the phone down I think Kazooir Ishiguro yeah same thing
 I bet yeah so maybe you've already won it Lou you just so off grid which is
 where Fred Ramstone was what does that mean well I think it gets used wrong all the
 time I certainly use it right people say I'm going off grid yeah and what they
 mean is I won't have my phone I'm turning up I'm putting on my out-of-office
 of the Eva well Morrison's in Margate it's got no reception so that's off grid
 right there we go yeah what it should mean is and you do have to fund for yourself
 because some of those are really mixed up but it should be I'm not going to be
 using public utilities yes I'm not going to be using public water or electricity
 supplies but people don't use it to mean that anymore self-sustainable is
 what I want to be right so you have your own electricity you have your own
 water source I think they're the big two those are the big two some kind of
 sewage system if you're if we're being fussy yes yes yes yes or I radio
 didn't listen drawing it out is half the battle you get rid of it or dry it thank
 you it's mostly water weight so are you are you interested in this kind of
 I would love to keep doing my job and keep doing what I do but then living in a
 few acres of land with my own water and electricity solar system all eco I'd
 like to sort of have a little eco village so I would like to be self-sustainable
 but still you know pop on QI etc you know yeah yeah yeah you'll have to make your
 own QI unfortunately no you have to have your own set bill I still want to go
 to cafes you know yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm not growing my own coffee beans I think
 that's fine I think that is off-grid there's one good way of getting powered
 that a youtuber called Chris doll has done you know vapes love him coming out
 your ears so vapes they each have a tiny battery in them but what people do is they
 vape them until you can vape no more and then you chuck them away but then that
 means they're chucking away this tiny battery and usually there's electricity
 left on it so this guy he salvaged 500 disposable vapes and turned the
 batteries into a working power wall which powers basically all his stuff in his
 house wow that's so good yeah it's not that many vapes as well I didn't have
 fast to get through a vape 500 well you go through about 20 a day then yeah yeah
 I do I do they come with a certain number of puffs don't they and you can buy
 mega vapes which are illegal which have more puffs in them really yeah mega
 vape I've never felt more how do you do fellow kids talking about vapes yeah yeah
 but I think and you can say to you like your news agent whether you've got
 the illegal vapes for me and he'll go under the counter and pull out like a
 size of a Toblerone and this is how you're also not done it how do you know that he
 had the Toblerones come in all different sizes I'm so sorry you're absolutely
 right the size of an airport Toblerone oh okay there we go okay right if I ask for
 a large Toblerone when they have that under the counter as well they'll actually
 pull out a massive Toblerone they'll pull out an even bigger one always a
 bigger one yeah there's always a bigger than the counter no I think they're meant
 to be legally they have to be rechargeable now but people still throw them away
 because they can't be bothered to because they're cheap because they're cheap
 there's quite a few places that are kind of set up already for off-grid living
 would you have a considered just incorporating yourself into a place the
 groundwork having been done yes but how am I going to be a cult leader if there's
 already good point you know you know will you kill the kill the previous
 leaders are by combat yeah no I want to do it with a couple of friends or
 something so I don't know I don't know maybe but then would you have to deal
 with annoying people I don't know always in life always yeah usually what happens
 with cults is either so it's not actually a cult yeah it's just James is sure
 and let's say people who live off-grid in communes yeah usually what happens is
 someone decides let's all have sex with each other yes and then they all fall
 out or two groups mob and they all fall out well there'll be no sex in my
 commune and you know even if it's a married couple I will be enforcing a
 sex role you'll be lying in between yeah yeah yeah yeah wholesome wholesome I think I
 may have found out the most famous person to be living off-grid I might be
 wrong because I'm sure there are loads of candidates currently living off-grid
 currently living off-grid I believe okay most people we need the poop okay is
 it someone we could guess somebody lives in America a very famous Taylor Swift not
 far off actually quite far off screen a carpenter more male more male and
 Sabrina Carpenter good luck very narrow sub-separate now Joe Rogan okay writer
 writing and he's a writer or that's more correct even closer with Stephen King
 somebody who writes famously about rural America Michael John Grisham oh now
 we get now we're getting closer now we're getting closer in America he writes a
 battle small-time drifter drifting into your town solving some problems
 Lee Child's British Lee Child lives in Wyoming Lee Child sorry really dead ball
 that on hit that one into the net I just think of because he's British but he
 lives in America he does he has experience of life in America now and he lives in
 this mad huge estate in Wyoming okay get this Lou I don't know if you be up
 for this marrying him so I get my land yeah I just his post box is 10 miles from his
 house no thank you 10 miles to the post box often does he said letters all the time
 he's exclusively like Jane Austen Lee Child I guess he's not on email his nearest
 grocery shop yeah yeah 45 miles away no if he needs to go and get some milk it's
 a 90-mile-round trip does he is he making his own milk what are we saying I don't
 think that's not he that stays you've got yes you got farm he was just well you
 know what Jack Reacher's like Lee Child will just pick up a cow drink straight
 from the district no I don't know if he's got a farm but basically he's in this
 place in Wyoming Wyoming is the size of the UK but the population is the
 combined populations of Cambridge, Canterbury, Carlyle and Chelmsford as he's
 put it it's just very very sparsely populated and he has a friend who he
 sometimes visits for dinner who lives 105 miles away that's I mean I'm not
 interested in that life it's so remote yeah so it's so far from
 that's 10 miles to your post box yeah for someone as well who kind of puts out a
 book a year and is in the press and is doing interviews and presumably doing
 lunch yeah but he's not being distracted by constant letters is he so he's not
 doing the writers how you write a book a year a lot of people want to move to these
 places in case there's like a nuclear war or something or a zombie outbreak
 or does that appeal to you Lou are you sort of trying to get a gauge if how much
 for not I am and I'm right away and we'll be we'll be bottling all this
 well the reason I ask is like a lot of squillainers will buy these sort of
 off grid places and we'll have them in case the whole world goes to shit
 yeah if I had the money I probably would yeah so this guy Peter Thiel oh yeah
 him squillainer asshole he got New Zealand citizenship so that he could build a
 super bunker in New Zealand they're all building in New Zealand because they know
 that they're causing it like climate damage to anyway they are but there's a new
 book by a guy called Mark Linus who looked at all the countries in the world and
 who would survive best a nuclear winter situation and New Zealand is one of
 the worst places you can be really because they're very unselfsufficient in
 food oh wow they import a lot of food so only 68% of Kiwis would survive a
 nuclear winter and on the whole world is that the bird the Kiwi or is it the
 fruit the best places any of the best places someone once told me that it's
 in the UK if you go like no in the UK 99% of people will die well because we're
 not self-sufficient with food but I want to focus on that 1% James that's
 that's who I absolutely think I want to see in the world yeah yeah I got 50
 cans of beans under my dad yeah you will be the 1% I reckon living in your
 self-sufficient um well okay I'm a highly allergic to beans that's the only
 problem yeah so some of the self-sufficient in terms of food yeah it's really
 interesting is it somewhere in and energy and various different things oh it's
 like Sweden or Norway or something like that I'll give you Iceland thank you
 oh because they've got all the GM far yeah they've got all those kind of great
 aisles of options and Australia Iceland Argentina Paraguay Uruguay and Costa
 Rica and Haiti places where they're kind of self-sufficient in themselves that
 they can feed their whole population yeah right right because of because of
 Australia you said is sort of they I think they've got so much solar power
 they've just been giving everyone three hours of free and they got very low
 population as well yeah Australia is a good place to go yeah and also they have
 lots of different sort of climates there so you could grow lots of stuff in the
 north that you can't grow in the south and stuff you can't grow in the north so
 if you need all the different bits of it if everyone was wiped out in England
 I'd just sort of go along as well I'm not I'm not that interested in living
 underground for five years on some teams but you live near the Ramsgate tunnels
 which are perfectly yeah perfectly set they're already set up they've got the
 bunk beds left over from the war in there oh for no one I'll fit in nicely I'll be
 running my coat no okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that is my
 fact my fact this week is that at Morrissey gigs security have been known to
 pat down fans to search them for meat wow the idea of a big security is kind of
 going off you just see the shape of a pork chop in someone's pocket or a sausage or
 a sausage yeah I do the same at my gigs actually do yeah yeah but I'm sort of
 wanting to find the meat is are you doing the patdowns yourself yeah I am yeah I'm
 gonna do the patdowns yeah I'm gonna meet and greet with loose enders as a very
 different meaning I pay you I pay you to meet and greet you
 so this is Morrissey singer from the band The Smiths who's had a very long solo
 career after they break up and he is a committed vegetarian and vegan and he
 hates meat to the point that if it is even in the air if he can even smell it at a
 gig he will be known to walk off stage so he always says that if he's gonna
 play a venue you're not allowed to sell meat in the venue for that specific gig
 so if he was playing let's say the O2 in London that would be one of the
 conditions that he would have and in 2011 fans were reporting that as they
 were coming through the security barriers men and women were patting them down
 searching for meat I think it's fair enough yeah it's his gig like I think the
 searching is a bit I think the searching is because once or twice he said
 sausages thrown at him once yeah which I don't think is on I do think that's
 poor form yeah do you need to search everyone for meat just the people who
 look suspicious they look like they might be packing a suspicious sausage but
 you can anyone in tide I come straight through but you can meet his I would say
 quite easy to smuggle yeah because you're made of meat so there's no way they
 could do like a X-ray thing because your whole body's meat it's only if there's
 it's there's an extra bone you would spot that if someone's smuggling in a
 tea ball steak a tea ball steak yeah I agree I think it's a bit much it's a
 bit much he's he said he's he doesn't identify with the term vegan but he's
 managed to find an even smaller subset of what does he identify with that he
 says he just says are refused to eat anything that had a mother he says he's
 never had a curry or coffee or garlic coffee got a mother but he said his
 diet consists of bread potato pasta and nuts so it feels it feels more like a
 sort of channel for documentry about a façade this is this is interesting
 though his influence despite him being this character that people find quite
 difficult people get annoyed with vegans and my theory is that because they know
 that they shouldn't really be eat something in them feels a bit icky about eating
 animals they feel embarrassed about themselves that's possible yeah and
 Coachella the big festival really tried hard to get a Smith reunion and
 there's been so much fallout between the members Johnny Mar and and Morrissey
 don't particularly they do not get on they do not get on and so Coachella said we
 want you to get back we're gonna pay you a lot of money and we will make Coachella
 a vegetarian oh wow experience and he said I would rather eat my own testicles
 why which is not very vegan but he uh because this is how much the band do not
 like each other I'm afraid this will be us in 30 years I think last maybe last
 year they almost got together and Morrissey wanted them to get together because
 they got offered an insane amount of money but Johnny Mar said no oh wow
 he could have given it to the animal charity and Morrissey has canceled a
 gig in Iceland over there meet policy market yeah they do a lot of
 form rings though they you know no geothermally powered country Iceland but
 the venue just refused to stop selling meat for one day and he said I love
 Iceland and have waited a long time to return but I should leave the Harpack
 concert hall to their cannibalistic flesh eating bloodlust yeah he's not
 afraid to put together a pitty quote for a press release I'll say that yeah I
 think it's crazy though the venue couldn't stop selling meat for a day because it's
 so bad for the planet as well you think you know just don't sell meat for a day
 people will cope I think the thing is with Iceland though they have like a
 history meeting lots of meat because they've not been able to grow plants for
 many hundreds of years especially in the winter so they really do have a very big
 culture of eating white whales males yeah puffins fish I think you're right
 I think the vegan thing is really interesting because I think he's he's been
 very provocative in the way he presents it like his tour gates would you know
 what's provocative slaughterhouses slaughterhouses are provocative absolutely
 absolutely and I think probably he sort of deliberately does it in a
 way maybe because he's trying to shock people and no one's listening well I
 think it works on only a small percentage of it I think people are likely to
 shut it out if something is so upsetting I think yeah like the vegan is a
 movement that's had a bit of a stumble in recent years it's a bit less popular
 than it was about five years ago yeah and just a lot of people have sort of
 thought of what is quite difficult now I can't quite be bothered to cut out
 everything and you know like vegetarians sometimes get stick for not being
 vegans and like that kind of thing so it's I think it's tricky how you sort of
 softly softly people into it yeah do you guys remember that Morrissey wrote a
 novel and it became quite well-known for the fact that it contained possibly the
 worst sex scene of the year oh included in the book did it when there's no
 word for the worst sex it did it won the 2015 worst sex scene so his book was
 called List of the Lost could you be in a sexy voice yeah what do you want to do
 you want to okay here we go Eliza and Ezra rolled together in the one giggling
 snowball a full-figured copulation screaming and shouting as they playfully
 bit and pull each other in a dangerous and cool I think it's good so far yeah sorry
 how's everyone else doing in a glamorous roller coaster coil of sexually
 violent rotation with Eliza's breasts barrel rolled across as was howling
 mouth and painted and the pained frenzy of his bulbous solute salt solute was
 that's how it tastes sorry extenuating his excitement as it whacked and
 smacked its way into every muscle of Eliza's body except for the otherwise
 central zone this is a Tuesday night at my house this is just this is just
 Tuesday's that's mad I think I do think sexy novels are a bit less sexy what
 you have to ask people can you tell me what this is but that is insane he's never
 had sex I'm sorry I think it's so good yeah yeah there is so many big metaphors in
 there yeah they're like a snowball and they're like a roller coaster
 it's a timeless roller coaster coil yeah and it's quite aggressive not at
 not at all sexually violent rotation is a bit I mean if you're breasts are doing
 barrel rolls that's the least imagine like that's RAF stuff isn't that's like
 that's the red arrows you know and your bulbous salutation is a bit that's
 mad bulbous salutations feels like they might support this one on Morris
 he's books yeah yeah he has been a bit controversial because he wrote an
 autobiography a memoir and it was published by Penguin Classics yeah so same
 list as Ovid home was Odyssey and he's basically said I'll do I'll do a book
 but only if it goes in straight as a Penguin Classic oh wow yeah a Penguin
 class sorry I didn't really take notice yeah so yeah so it didn't come out in
 hardback which would be your traditional release it was straight into a paper
 bag with the classic yeah yeah wow Plato is is they're on the same
 list my book is bold and I think it got him a lot of publicity yeah
 negative yeah yeah yeah yeah but he's got a long history writing so when he
 before he was a pop star he wrote unsolicited script for Coronation Street did
 they go with it or not he sent it to them he sent them a script where the
 Rovers return installs a jukebox and they did not it's basically fanfiction isn't it
 it's basically fanfiction yeah yeah yeah I found one other example just while
 we're still on Marcy slash musicians of people who are very strict vegan
 slash vegetarians to the point where it almost seems a bit awkward
 Katie Lang oh yeah Katie Lang once refused to meet the singer Meetloaf
 because of his name wow yeah it was an interview from Meetloaf where he said I was
 a vegetarian for 10 years and I was sitting next to John Bon Jovi and awards
 thing and I said oh man I'd love to meet Katie Lang I'd really love to meet her
 they went to find out if that's okay she said no his name is Meetloaf but he
 was a vegetarian at the time possibly he'd lapsed at that point okay he had been
 a vegetarian at some point for 10 years yeah I think I think it's a bit
 strict of Katie though yeah I had just while we're on sort of pop stars and
 stuff before we go on to veganism I had a look at some other riders that people
 have so Kanye West apparently when he played later with Jules Holland that he
 must have his dressing room carpet ironed wow M&M apparently when he played
 at a festival in Northern Ireland insisted on a coy carp pond okay and according
 to TMZ there's a rapper called DMX who I'm not massively familiar with oh yeah
 he's a biggie though yeah he is big and for every rider he wants a bottle of
 Hennessy and three boxes of condoms three boxes which boxes were the boxes well
 sometimes the box is a fewer like so even if there was three in a box had the
 year-end you can get through nine before of gig not before not when I'm at when
 I'm at the Bill Murray it's a similar story it seats 90 I'm optimistic no that's
 man I was wondering if he might be using them to carry water because they're quite
 good for that I heard the Drake puts when he finishes off in a condom because he
 doesn't want you know kids with some like you know stranger that he's yeah
 even when he puts like chili flakes in the reminence or something so they
 can't shove it up them oh that's what I heard so people might take the condom and
 shove and chili flakes is going to stop them I mean if you're mentally
 enough to want to do the first part about do you think the chili flakes would stop
 I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
 yeah absolutely I wouldn't be a hundred percent certain any of the things I said a tree will you give toward Lou you recently toward I did the only I asked for was not a plastic bottle of water so either like a jug a filter jug or yeah or like cans I guess a
 water yeah because they're called the plastic bottles yeah very not I guess I'm a good person I guess I'm just what I'm saying here so today is like I'm a guy you're more a
 CEO of comedy yeah yeah better chocolate does does Eminem ask on his right to have all the Van Halens removed from his dressing room I love it very good
