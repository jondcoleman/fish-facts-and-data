00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
 Hello and welcome to another edition of "No Such Thing as a Fish Presents International

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,680
 Fact Ball."

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,560
 This is brought to you by the Qilves in association with visitingland.com.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
 My name is Dan.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,160
 I'm sitting here with Alex, James and Molly, and it's time to pit another two teams together,

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,800
 and today's match is Australia vs Mexico.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,840
 So let's begin with Australia.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
 What is quite interesting about Australia?

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,080
 Who wants to go first?

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,800
 Well, Dan Schreiber is from Australia.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
 I am Australian.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
 Yes.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,920
 This is going to be a very biased match, I feel.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,920
 I think we're all going to be going for Mexico, just despite you.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,920
 There you go.

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,440
 Bloody there you.

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,640
 This is very Australian.

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,960
 The National Anthem was written on a bus.

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
 But really?

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,520
 Yeah, it was a guy called Peter Dodds, McCormick.

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,320
 He was returning from a concert of National Anthems, that must have been a great concert.

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,480
 And he was just annoyed that Australia didn't have one.

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,280
 He was basically sitting on the bus and he thought, no way, we need a National Anthem.

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,960
 And so, yeah, he just started writing it.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
 Did you write a good one?

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,720
 We wrote 'Advanced Australia Fair' which...

27
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
 So which?

28
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,320
 No, it does include the line, our home is 'Gurt by Sea'.

29
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,760
 'Gurt by Sea' means that it's surrounded by seas.

30
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
 It's a yes.

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
 We are a beautiful island, you wanted to say.

32
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,120
 Yeah, which would have been nicer to say we're a beautiful island.

33
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,520
 Okay, so some facts about Australia, lots of Aboriginal languages in Australia.

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,400
 And here are some words that we get from there.

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:35,920
 And also 'Kailee', right? 'Kailee' is an Aboriginal word that means...

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,440
 Kind of like a boomerang that doesn't come back, it's a stick that used to be used for catching and killing animals.

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
 That's what 'Kailee' means.

38
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,880
 And there's the oldest one that's been dated at 20,000 years old, made from a mammoth tusk.

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,320
 It would really hurt the mammoth because it's made out of mammoth tusks and then it gets hit by something that's made out of his own tusk.

40
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,840
 That's terrible, that would be like us walking around as someone throws a leg at us.

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,120
 It's like hit by a human bit of body.

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,920
 I know.

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,440
 They have a surprising number of shipwrecks on the shores of Australia.

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,840
 They've got over 6,500 shipwrecks.

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
 Nothing.

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,400
 Yeah, that's really high, that's one for every nine kilometres of the coast.

47
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,880
 It should be our country as 'Gurt by Shipwrecks'.

48
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
 Yeah, absolutely.

49
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,280
 This is really nice.

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,560
 One of Australia's lakes is called Lake Disappointment.

51
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,720
 It was a guy who went to one of the most remote parts of Australia.

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,200
 He was following a number of creeks convinced that it was going to lead to a ginormous lake.

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,600
 And the body of water they eventually got to was so salty that he couldn't drink it.

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,440
 So he just said, "Oh, this is a huge disappointment."

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
 I can't exactly say the same thing with a mountain.

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,200
 And there's a mountain disappointment north of Melbourne, I think.

57
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,960
 And to explore this, human hovel, they climbed it and it was really difficult.

58
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,760
 And they got to the top when the view was rubbish and they were really disappointed with it.

59
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,520
 I hope it's the same explorer who didn't like it the moment.

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,800
 How was your trip? It was really disappointing.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,240
 It's like early trip advice, so just kind of giving it a crab name.

62
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,440
 Lake One Star.

63
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,200
 Should we move on to the Australian animals?

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,920
 Because I think they're probably one of the greatest thing about Australia.

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
 OK, go on.

66
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,880
 So classic Kiwifact kangaroos have three vaginas.

67
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,280
 But so do koalis, wombats and Tasmanian devils.

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,920
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

69
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,640
 Oh, yeah?

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,800
 So, wombats have three vaginas?

71
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,560
 Yep.

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,280
 Koalis too.

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
 Koalis have three vaginas?

74
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,800
 Tasmanian devils too.

75
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,320
 Tazzy devils have three.

76
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,120
 Yep.

77
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,040
 A tiny kangaroo is the size of a jelly bean, which I think would be pretty cute to see.

78
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,200
 A root, a root.

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,600
 Yeah, when they're born, they come out.

80
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,880
 But then they climb up the front of the mother and go into the pouch.

81
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,360
 And there are these tiny little things, tiny little mountain climbers.

82
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,480
 Have you ever seen one?

83
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,000
 Yeah, yeah.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
 You can watch it in a David Adamborough documentary.

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,280
 Yeah.

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,080
 We see the jelly bean.

87
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,280
 It was in 1932.

88
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,480
 There was a great emu war in Australia.

89
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,480
 And basically, after World War I, a lot of soldiers retired into farming.

90
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,200
 But they had a massive problem with emus that were coming and ravaging their land.

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,280
 So they went to the Minister of Defense who gave them a load of machine guns.

92
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,840
 And they assumed that they were just going to decimate them.

93
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,680
 And they only got about 5,000 in one go.

94
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,600
 How did the emus fight back?

95
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,800
 They just ran around, which is generally really difficult.

96
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,960
 He said that they were organizing guerrilla tactics.

97
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,600
 They were pretending to be guerrillas.

98
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,440
 That's how they go around it.

99
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,760
 He said, if we had a military division with the bullet carrying capacity of these birds,

100
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,320
 it would face any army in the world.

101
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,920
 They can face machine guns with the invulnerability of tanks.

102
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,400
 They're like Zulu's who even dumbed on bullets could not stop.

103
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
 Yeah, that's a bit weird.

104
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,560
 I read that this is a story about a guy Captain Starlight.

105
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,920
 He was a ranch man.

106
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
 He was kind of like a drover.

107
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,680
 And he stole 1,000 cows from a ranch.

108
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,680
 And he steered them 800 miles across some of the most

109
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,800
 inhospitable land in Australia.

110
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,840
 And he was caught as a result of it.

111
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,360
 And when he was put on trial, the jury, they were so impressed by his achievement

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
 that they found him not guilty.

113
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,080
 You're not guilty, because you've got such an awesome name.

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
 Yeah, what, we're going to put Captain Starlight in jail?

115
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,040
 No way, he's a superhero.

116
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
 Yeah, that's not happening.

117
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,160
 In an Australian law, they have guilty, not guilty or lad.

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,600
 Lad, don't do starlight.

119
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,320
 They do have, though, Australian MPs.

120
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,200
 If an MP is being sort of either rude or whatever, they can be sinbind.

121
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,800
 Yeah. That's cool.

122
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,160
 We have this seat called the hot seat.

123
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,880
 And they didn't turn it on anymore.

124
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,840
 But back in the day, they used to just turn it on

125
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,880
 and it got hotter and hotter.

126
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,480
 And we're like, burn you as you sat there and everyone would walk past

127
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,400
 and you were like, on fire.

128
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,320
 That's torture.

129
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
 It's not allowed.

130
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,960
 We used to have a playground.

131
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
 We used to have a friendship stop.

132
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,080
 And the idea was that in the playground, if you don't have any friends,

133
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
 you're going to stand by this stuff on it.

134
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
 And you wait for someone else, he doesn't have any friends.

135
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,840
 And then you go make a--

136
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,160
 Yeah, we would call that the bully suit.

137
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,160
 Yeah.

138
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,480
 OK, that's it for the first half.

139
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,360
 That's Australia done.

140
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,360
 But now it's time for our half-time quiz sponsored by Visitingland.com.

141
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,040
 And this comes in the form of three QI questions,

142
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,560
 which we will reveal the answers to at the end of this podcast.

143
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,320
 So Molly, what's your question?

144
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,760
 Where in England used puffins as currency?

145
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,000
 Puffins as an actual currency.

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,840
 As an actual currency.

147
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,160
 Well, we'll find out, I guess.

148
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
 Has it got the queen on it?

149
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,920
 Can you do that?

150
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
 Is that legal?

151
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,120
 We're not at puffins.

152
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,880
 Yeah, all right, James, question number two.

153
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,720
 My question is, what does the German word "coventry-erin" mean?

154
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,080
 There must be an English link there somewhere.

155
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,280
 It's not just a German question.

156
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,360
 OK, and question number three, Alex.

157
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,560
 Mine is, when William the Conqueror went to crush an uprising in Exeter in 1068,

158
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,280
 what Rude gesture did one of the residents make that really upset him?

159
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,560
 OK, well, that's the quiz.

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
 We get the answers at the end of our podcast.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,920
 And now it's back to the second half of our match.

162
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,520
 And it's Mexico.

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,320
 We started off with Australia with the National Anthem facts.

164
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,520
 Yeah.

165
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,760
 So I've got one on Mexico.

166
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,320
 And that's that you can be fined in Mexico

167
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,360
 if you stumble while singing the National Anthem.

168
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,880
 So--

169
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
 Stumble as if fall over or just get the words wrong.

170
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,040
 Did you get the words wrong?

171
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,480
 There was a woman who got in Guadalajara who got fined $40

172
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,160
 when she was singing for in front of an affable stadium in the National Anthem.

173
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,280
 Just speaking about weird laws that have been put in place,

174
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,920
 in a northern Mexican state called Sonora,

175
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,440
 there were a bunch of names that they've made it illegal to call your child now.

176
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,160
 So you're not allowed to call your child Burger King.

177
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,760
 Fair enough.

178
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,640
 Rambo.

179
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,480
 Robocop.

180
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,320
 Harry Potter.

181
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,160
 Terminator.

182
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
 Hitler.

183
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,920
 Scrotum.

184
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,200
 [LAUGHTER]

185
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,960
 Batman, Martian, and panties.

186
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
 [LAUGHTER]

187
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,960
 Something that all kids in Mexico already called things like Scrotum--

188
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,400
 It must be.

189
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
 It must mean that these would put on there for a reason.

190
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,120
 So there must be somewhere out there, Terminator is playing with spinach.

191
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,920
 I just imagine Scrotum standing underneath it like I need a friend placing out to school.

192
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,720
 Robocop.

193
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,240
 Who's naming their kid Robocop?

194
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,840
 I tell you something that's not illegal in Mexico, escaping from prison.

195
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,480
 They don't punish-- if you escape in prison and then if you were caught,

196
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,080
 they just put you back in prison.

197
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,320
 You don't get charged with an extra crime because they can see

198
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,000
 that everyone has a natural desire to be free.

199
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,880
 Also, if they were trying to escape,

200
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,080
 there's plenty of tunnels for them to do that in cross-border drug tunnels,

201
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,600
 which I'd never heard of.

202
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,400
 And apparently, since the '90s, more than 100 drug tunnels have been made

203
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,680
 that go across the border.

204
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,080
 They have lots of ways of getting drugs into America, don't they?

205
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,200
 They catapult them over sometimes.

206
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,600
 And there was a guy in 2013 who was arrested trying to float from Mexico to the US

207
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,560
 on a bag of marijuana.

208
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:21,960
 Wow.

209
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,360
 So his boat was the drugs itself.

210
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,960
 Oh my god.

211
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,760
 It's quite clever, isn't it?

212
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,200
 That's great.

213
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
 And he got busted, did he?

215
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,840
 Oh yeah, otherwise we wouldn't know about it, my guess.

216
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,360
 Yeah.

217
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,360
 Well, many bustings of people trying to cross the border into America

218
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,680
 are made at the hand of one of the greatest of all sheriffs.

219
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,760
 An actual sheriff, Steven Segal.

220
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,120
 Steven Segal is not a sheriff.

221
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,600
 He's a sheriff.

222
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 He's a genuine sheriff.

223
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,560
 Is this a movie that you want?

224
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,160
 No, no, no, no.

225
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,560
 Anyone listening to Google it, you'll see that he's busted a number of people.

226
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,320
 He got two guys who were traveling across the border with $250,000 worth of marijuana.

227
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,600
 And he busted them there in jail.

228
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,120
 Mexico has more televisions per head than any other country in the world.

229
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
 Just a fact.

230
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
 Oh.

231
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,560
 And I think the most obese people.

232
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,240
 That's where chocolate comes from, I guess.

233
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,080
 It is indeed.

234
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,560
 Yeah, is that some Mexican word?

235
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,440
 And I didn't know that.

236
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,320
 That's chocolate itself, the word, is one of the--

237
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,560
 Yeah, it's Nahuatl.

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,600
 Other words that come from there are avocado, chili, coyote, axolotl, tequila, and tomato.

239
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,120
 All words originally from Mexico.

240
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,160
 Do you know what tequila is made out of?

241
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,480
 Yeah, it's made from cactus.

242
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
 I think.

243
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,360
 No, it's made from a plant called agave.

244
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
 Oh.

245
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,320
 It's like a cactus, but it's related to the lily, and there's a 136 species of it in Mexico.

246
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,800
 Under other Mexican foods, avocado means testicle tree, and it was named by the Aztecs because

247
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,720
 they thought that avocados just looked like testicles hanging from a tree.

248
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,160
 Wow, they must have had very strangely shaped testicles.

249
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
 That's it.

250
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
 Green.

251
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,920
 [LAUGHTER]

252
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:57,440
 Certain priests of the Catholic Church believe that Mexico is currently under attack by Satan.

253
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,720
 And they put a calling out for more exorcists because they need more to fight him.

254
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,440
 And apparently, it's gone so bad that there is an unprecedented demand for their services,

255
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,920
 and some are so busy that they can't take on new cases.

256
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,600
 It's reflective of the state that Mexico's got into with drug trade and all that.

257
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
 Yeah.

258
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
 And it's a very Catholic country as well.

259
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
 Yes, exactly.

260
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,160
 So they think Satan's got a stranglehold on them right now.

261
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,960
 So if there are any exorcists listening and they're not getting enough work in England,

262
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,200
 Mexico's your place.

263
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,360
 We're going to have to wrap up.

264
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,760
 But we've covered a lot with Mexico there.

265
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,640
 Does anyone have anything they want to chuck in?

266
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,480
 Well, I want to go to night of the radishes, which is held on December 23rd every year in

267
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,120
 Mexico and Oaxaca, and hundreds of people compete to make the coolest nativity scenes and

268
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,160
 all kinds of stuff out of radishes.

269
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,000
 And the winner gets their photo in the local newspaper.

270
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 That's really good.

271
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 [CHEERING]

272
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Okay.

273
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 All right.

274
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,360
 Well, that's the end of our match.

275
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,680
 Before we find out who has won Australia and Mexico, why don't we find out the answers

276
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,720
 to our visitingland.com quiz and we'll start with you, Molly, with the question first.

277
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,320
 Where in England used puffins as currency?

278
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,440
 The answer is Lundy Island.

279
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
 Lundy Island.

280
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
 Yeah.

281
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,320
 And what did it, so how much was one puffin worth, do we know?

282
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,360
 So there was a guy called Martin Coles who in 1925 bought the whole of Lundy Island and

283
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,960
 he issued two coins, the half puffin and the one puffin and he used them as local currency.

284
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,240
 So it wasn't real puffins.

285
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
 Oh, okay.

286
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,840
 Yeah, because when you said half puffin, I was like, oh my god.

287
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
 It suddenly got dark.

288
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
 Like the change.

289
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
 Yeah.

290
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
 James.

291
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
 Question number two.

292
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,200
 My question was, what was the German word 'coventrier' in mean?

293
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,440
 And it means 'to flatten' and it refers to the bombing of 'coventrier' in the way.

294
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
 Oh, wow.

295
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,680
 Well, that actually made it into their language.

296
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
 Yeah.

297
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
 That's horrible.

298
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
 Wow, yeah, that's terrible.

299
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,480
 I don't think it's particularly commonly used, but it does mean that.

300
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
 Wow.

301
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
 Okay.

302
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
 Alex.

303
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
 Last one from you.

304
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,480
 My question was, when will you and the conqueror went to crush an uprising in Exeter in 1068?

305
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,320
 What rude gesture did one of the residents make that really upset him?

306
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
 Oh, yeah.

307
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,960
 And is that he climbed onto city walls, it dropped his trousers and broke wind at the approaching

308
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,360
 troops.

309
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,320
 How did they know from that distance that he broke wind?

310
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,280
 And that must have been in, like, one of those areas that just echoes.

311
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
 All the flags were fluttering.

312
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
 Okay.

313
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
 So that's the answers there.

314
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
 There's no prizes, unfortunately.

315
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,560
 However, if you do go over to Visitingland.com, there is a chance to win some QI goodies, including

316
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,440
 some of the books signed by the elves, there's a bunch of stuff there.

317
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
 So go and check it out.

318
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,000
 But in the meantime, let's sort out who's won this match.

319
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Alex.

320
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 I think Mexico.

321
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 What?

322
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Yeah, sorry.

323
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 All right.

324
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 James.

325
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Yeah, definitely Mexico.

326
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Okay, this is not...

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 This is clearly...

328
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 I'm all over Mexico.

329
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Really?

330
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 You as well?

331
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Chocolate, avocados.

332
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 All good things.

333
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Oh, my days.

334
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 All right.

335
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Well, there we go.

336
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Decision made.

337
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Australia, the obvious winner there.

338
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 What?

339
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And I don't know what you guys are doing there.

340
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Is this FIFA?

341
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Yeah.

342
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 So that's it from us.

343
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,520
 If you want to get in contact with us about any of the things that we've said over the

344
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,440
 course of this podcast, you can reach us all on our Twitter handles.

345
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
 I'm on @Sriberland, Molly.

346
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
 @MollyOldfield.

347
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
 James.

348
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
