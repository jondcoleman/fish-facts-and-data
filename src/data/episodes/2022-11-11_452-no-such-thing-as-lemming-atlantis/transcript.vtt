00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.200
 you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here with

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.080
 Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski and once again we have gathered around the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.280
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.520
 we go. Starting with fact number one and that is my fact, my fact this week is that not long

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.800
 after Benjamin Franklin invented the lightning rod it took off as a fashion. A lightning rod's

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.680
 very tall metal objects. Yeah and very sexy when combined. You could dance around them.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 Now this was in Paris in 1778. If you were walking the streets of Paris you would have seen

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.520
 women with lightning rod hats so this is a hat that would have a sort of protruding rod. As far as

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.840
 I can see in the drawings of the time they might dress that up a bit with a bit of sort of floral

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.480
 stuff going around it. Yeah something to disguise it but what you didn't really disguise was the

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.040
 big chain that came out of the hat that ran to the ground so that should you be struck by

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.080
 lightning you could then ground the lightning via this big chain. Umbrellas did it as well so you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.320
 had umbrella with a giant lightning rod on top. How long do these women tend to survive

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 during thunderstorms? We don't know. The interesting thing is like was there any use for it do you

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.080
 think? Do you think they deliberately had them to try and get the lightning away from them?

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.880
 It's just for fashion. Well I think you know if it functioned as it was meant to then yeah

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.720
 absolutely. They wanted it to function definitely. No hang on if you were hit by lightning wearing

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.600
 one of these rods which it would ground it to the ground it's just I think it should work it just

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.880
 that it would probably be too close to you. You'd die. You would die. If your hat had this and then

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.240
 you had a Faraday cage all the way around you then that would save you. I've seen the pictures

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.360
 and they didn't. No. Maybe your sedan chair was a Faraday sedan chair and then you're laughing.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.800
 I gotta say I empathize more and more with the French Revolution hearing what was going on in

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.520
 Paris in the 1780s you know I think yeah that's pretty extravagant outlandish stuff. I don't

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.240
 think this was to do with Franklin by the way but I think it was his specifically the French

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.920
 Benjamin Franklin it was his translator who then turned it so he was a guy who was a botanist,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.120
 a physician and he was called Jacques and then he has two French names off of that.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.720
 Babur de Bourg. Yeah that'll do. Yeah looks good to me. Jacques Babur de Bourg and he was a

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:57.200
 physician. Are you gonna do the rest of the book? Because he was the guy who translated all

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.280
 Franklin's stuff into French didn't he? Yeah and because he was friends with Franklin he was also

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.040
 supposed to go to America and then be kind of you know helping the revolution in a way but he

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.640
 never went because no one liked him. Oh really? Well like he asked the Americans do you want my

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.360
 help and they said we're okay. Well they were between a couple of different people and he was

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.480
 really brash and people weren't really sure about him so he never got to do that. That is mad. Well

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.080
 but thank god because otherwise you might not design this umbrella. Yeah and the UK might have

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.840
 still owned America and well on that the America project thing I have a fact about George the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.120
 Third related to this and Benjamin Franklin because they had a disagreement about lightning rods.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.960
 Guess who was right? George the Third or Benjamin Franklin considering the scientific backgrounds

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.760
 of the two guys. So one of them famously mad. One of them one of the greatest scientists who's

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:59.520
 ever lived. And a fashionable guy. I guess you wouldn't be asking us if it wasn't the

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.240
 exactly. George the Third was right in their disagreement so Franklin thought that lightning

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.080
 rods should be incredibly sharp tipped at the top. Sharp tops. George the Third said no I want blunt

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.560
 ones and he fitted the pallets with blunt ones and he was right they are more effective at

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.760
 earthing lightning. Okay. For the reason that the field above blunt rods is stronger and I think

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.240
 that means it intercepts lightning more. It helps to draw the lightning down. So actually I didn't

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.120
 know that lightning rods were to stop lightning happening. Not the secondary purpose initially

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.760
 was to ground it but the primary purpose according to Franklin and his people was

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.160
 stop it happening by this sharp rod attracting this charge so dissipating it before it all

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.920
 built up in the cloud. But it turns out that it's just not nearly big enough a field so it

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.840
 doesn't really matter. So yeah George the Third was right you can have a knob. A door knob.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.200
 So another thing about the bulbous versus the spike right is that basically because Benjamin

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.280
 Franklin was you know one of the signatories of the declaration of independence he was like a real

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.280
 patriot and he invented the lightning rod. Basically this was a symbol of the new country

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.480
 and so Britain did not like this upstart having its new symbol and that was another reason why

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.880
 George the Third said that you had to put a knob on every single lightning rod in the entire empire.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.160
 Do you think it was a bit of a sly you know Franklin such a knob kind of gesture? Almost

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.720
 certainly. Really? Yeah definitely that kind of work. That's a George the Third move. Yeah.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.880
 Can I tell you something about Benjamin Franklin getting in trouble for inventing the lightning

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.960
 rod? So there was an earthquake at Cape Anne which is off the coast of Massachusetts and it was

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.360
 soon after the lightning rod was invented and the pastor who was there was called Reverend Thomas

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.840
 Prince and he said the earthquake happened because everyone's been putting up lightning rods.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.080
 Basically man has been thwarting God by trying to you know harness the lightning or channel it

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.760
 so God has reacted by sending an earthquake. Well his idea was since God can't send down

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.320
 lightning bolts to kill us anymore he's going to have to go from below instead. Exactly and it's

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.800
 like you don't you're not showing much faith in your God you'll be able to do that wherever he likes.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.320
 People were very anti weren't they because of that you know you're trying to prevent God from

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.760
 doing his work if he wants to strike you with lightning he should strike you with lightning

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.720
 and there was a big push among scientists to try and convert people to it. There was a guy in

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.280
 Germany called Johann Jakob Hemmer and he was a big lightning rod advocate in Germany this is in

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.080
 the 18th century and he designed like a cross-shaped one which you can still see on the Mannheim Palace

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.960
 and he had it so that each bit of the cross was detachable so that whenever lightning struck any

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.840
 bit of the cross and caused a bit of damage he would then detach it bring it down to the masses

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.160
 and put it on display to say look the lightning struck this and damaged it but it didn't damage

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.160
 the building so it must work. That's clever because what people thought was that like Andy said that

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.480
 maybe God was sending down lightning bolts to punish people but the problem is the tallest

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:02.640
 building in most towns was a church whereby the brothels were quite like that and so if anything

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.040
 got struck by lightning it usually was a church and the brothels usually got away scot-free so no

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.680
 one could really explain what the problem was. The church's thing was an issue there's another

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.360
 reason why it's good the lightning rod was invented because the way they repelled lightning before

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.200
 the rod was to ring loads of church bells and so being a bell ringer was an extremely dangerous

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.560
 job and that you know they were often hit by lightning they I think many of them used to die

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.560
 because you'd be sent up to the church tower to ring the bell when there was a storm yeah when

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.840
 you're most likely to get hit and there was actually in 1769 there was a church in Brescia

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.040
 which was storing a hundred tons of gunpowder in its vaults for safekeeping and it got struck

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.680
 by lightning because of the church spire and it blew up a sixth of the city three thousand people

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:54.640
 died. Oh my god I know. Unbelievable. It started raining quite hard outside from where we're sitting.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.640
 And then you've got a massive spike coming out of your head. It's all the fashion darling.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.240
 The church bells they had written on them or you know inscribed on them the words fulgra frango

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.240
 meaning I chase lightning. And the idea I think was that demons would kind of send down the

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.880
 bolts like God would send the demons and the bells would scare them away. Yeah we have actually

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.320
 mentioned them before. How interesting though that they would go and ring the bells during the

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:26.160
 storms because in my head the wind was kind of doing that anyway. Oh yeah. Like I would always

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.880
 have thought this. Maybe those big church bells aren't too worried by wind so much. Yeah yeah yeah.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.440
 So you can't get a good rhythm going maybe. The wind's very bad at getting exactly getting the right

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:42.000
 beats. You can't get a canterbury, peeled, vicar, pleasure going. Whatever the first canterbury

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.560
 pleasure that's a that's a bell ringing thing. Is it? The first canterbury pleasure just sounds

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.800
 like a porn film based around the art of canterbury. That's why I didn't say it. Oh really? That's why

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.680
 I didn't say it because I thought it sounds too weird but I think it's a question from the very

00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:01.920
 earliest QI episodes. I was thinking it was what the wife of BAFTA did. Yeah. I read that they were

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:08.800
 all saying this. If I can't do jokes from the 14th century what jokes can I do? In the age

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.480
 where lightning rods were becoming fashionable and people were skeptical there was one really famous

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:19.920
 trial and this was in 1783 in France and it was a guy who'd installed a lightning rod on his house.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.400
 He was like an early adopter. The first person to get an iPhone in the village and the villagers

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.240
 didn't like it. They said you know that's God's not going to like that. We didn't like it. We

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.800
 don't believe it works and the alderman told him to remove it and he hired a lawyer and took the

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.040
 alderman to court saying I'm allowed to keep my lightning rod and they won the case and he was

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.960
 allowed to keep it and his lawyer was Maximilien Robespierre. The sort of one of the leading figures

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.880
 in the French Revolution. Responsible for a lot of heads getting chopped up. Lots. Yeah and he made

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.960
 his name in this case as the standout lawyer. This was 1783 but he didn't electrocute and he

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.760
 actually saved maybe a lot of lives by defending this guy's lightning rod to compensate for the

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.520
 head chopping off. But you're saying he was like a planning dispute lawyer. Everyone's

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.440
 got to start somewhere. Yeah absolutely. He also loved physics. Like he was a science. He was like

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.720
 one of these you know men of the century and he really liked science. They called him the barometer

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.000
 when he was younger because he was so good at science. That's a cool name. I presumably knew

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.960
 what the weather was going to be like. Always under pressure. Always under pressure. I got

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.280
 another cool nickname for someone so barometer. Benjamin Franklin's grandson. Do you know he was

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:42.160
 called? The the the thermometer. Lightning Rod Jr. was his name. Okay. Lightning Rod Jr. Not his real

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.720
 name. His nickname. His grandson right. Yeah. Okay. You would think it would be Lightning Rod the

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.280
 third. Maybe his dad didn't want the Lightning Rod nickname and said you know what let's just hold

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:59.120
 this my son. Yes. That's cool. Do we know why? Just do you like Lightning Rods? No no no. He was

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:05.520
 I think he was a journalist. I think he ran a magazine or a newspaper. I think possibly the

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:11.680
 nickname was a bit of a slur on him. But I am I am just riffing off. Because he attracted controversy.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.160
 I like that. Could be. I like that. Because he always used to sit on the top of people's houses.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.240
 Yeah. So he had a knob on his head.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:31.760
 Okay. It's time for fact number two and that is Andy. My fact is that every time the UK delays a

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:38.080
 decision on expanding Heathrow, the head of Skipple Airport in the Netherlands sends Heathrow a

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.480
 congratulatory cake to thank them for all the extra custom. Ouch. I love the way you

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.840
 pronounced Heathrow two different ways. Heathrow and then Heathrow. Heathrow. It's Heathrow,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:55.120
 isn't it? It's Heathrow. I was so worried about how to pronounce Skipple. I forgot how to pronounce

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:01.200
 Heathrow. This was reported in 2016 and so Skipple is the the main Dutch airport. It's huge. It's

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.480
 really really massive. Yeah. And Heathrow has been having a debate for about 70 80 years about

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.400
 whether it's it's it's insane how long this debate's been going on. And so the third runway.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.120
 The third runway. Yeah, exactly. And so Skipple keeps sending them cakes. I find this very funny

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.280
 and they said it was to congratulate Heathrow with the positive advice of the Airports Commission

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.520
 on London. Heathrow's third runway. It's sarcastic. It's a sarcasm cake basically that they're

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.000
 sending. What kind of cake is it? Do we know? Well, they showed a photo of the last one they sent

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.400
 and it was one of those. It was a slightly fancy, you know, a coffee cake. It looked like a flower,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.240
 like a lake. If you were looking aerial shot over a flower, it was very beautiful.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.160
 Like a flower, like a beautiful, it looked like a cake, you know. It was a different kind of cake.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.480
 Yeah, it was very pretty. Is there any chance we keep delaying this Heathrow runway decision because

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.400
 the people that Heathrow love this cake so much? It's very possible. It wouldn't make much less

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.000
 sense than anything else. But they've been doing it for years. In 2016, this year of this article,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.680
 Heathrow finally sent their own cake back because of the approval of the third runway. So they said,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.600
 thanks for letting us borrow your runway, Amsterdam. We shouldn't need it much longer.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.680
 And then the cake's on the way. Six years ago. That's hubris, I'm afraid.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:19.440
 We haven't quite said this, I don't think, but the reason that they're sending them this cake is

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.800
 because of the lack of this third runway. It means that the planes have to pit stop on a bigger

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.120
 journey at this airport. So they're bringing them business. Is that right? Do they? Okay,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.120
 because I didn't know that. I just thought it was maybe people couldn't go to Heathrow,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.840
 so they were going to Amsterdam instead. But that's not right. It's a bit of both, basically.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.800
 It's just, it's a capacity thing. Heathrow uses about 99% of its all available capacity, which

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.560
 sounds great. But actually, if there was more space, there would be more flights going through

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:53.120
 there. So, yeah, so that is definitely advantage for them. Yeah, skiphole. It comes from a word

00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:00.560
 meaning shiphole. That's what it comes from. It's a real shiphole. Well, the reason it was called

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:07.440
 shiphole is because it used to be in the water, skiphole. In fact, there was a sea battle there

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:14.240
 in 1573, where the airport is today. And that's because it's all reclaimed land. They basically,

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.560
 they wanted more land. Obviously, it's the Netherlands. There's lots of kind of, a lot of

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.640
 the area is below sea level. So they created this massive steam engine, and they sucked all of the

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.520
 water away to give them loads more land. And it was the largest steam engine of all time when it

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.400
 was built. Oh, that's awesome. The SUP dry the airport. It was named after a guy called Nicholas

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.520
 Creek. Okay. And it was called the Kwee engine. And they didn't drain the lake for the airport,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.560
 did they? They just drain the lake to reclaim the land. To reclaim the land, and it became

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:50.720
 later on the airport. It's a really old airport. It's been used for civilian aircraft since 1920,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.160
 which is very old. And because of that reclaim thing that James just said, the runways are 11 feet

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.880
 below sea level. So cool. When the airline KLM, so that's the Dutch national carrier,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.640
 isn't it, some flagship one, when they turned 100 years old in 2019, it was given a really cool salute,

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.960
 the KLM flight arriving in Edinburgh. Have you seen this before? It's when a plane arrives

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.320
 for a special occasion, it gets a water cannon salute. Oh, yeah, yeah. And it means that so

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.720
 airports have these huge, powerful water cannons that it's like fire engines, basically, or water

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:29.200
 jets. And they fire them in an arc over the plane as it's arriving. That feels dangerous to me.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.200
 I guess, but they used to rain on the thing. And it's sort of a nice celebratory arch. And it's

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.680
 if a captain is retiring, or if a plane is retiring, or you know, there are all these occasions where

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.280
 they have a lovely little water cannon salute. You wouldn't want to do it at the Shippell airport,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:49.440
 where it's sort of refilling the reservoir. There was a thing on Shippell airport website,

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.800
 which was, it was like frequently asked questions and things you might have wondered about it said,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.520
 you may have noticed a plane on fire while you were taking off from Shippell,

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.720
 which I would have thought would be so terrifying. And they need to make a bigger deal of this,

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.360
 but apparently it's nothing to be scared of is what we call our firefly. And it's a plane,

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.400
 which they regularly set on fire for the fire department. They claim it's used by the fire

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.080
 department for training every day, which I can't believe they need to come every day to repractice

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.840
 a plane being on fire. But there must be different crews from around the country. And how, I mean,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.840
 how many places in the country are going to have a every day though? It's a lot. It's a lot. It's

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:31.680
 suggested not getting it right. Okay, we'll do this again tomorrow, guys. I see a load of clowns

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.640
 with a chain of buckets going to the plane. Yeah. Skippal has, did you know this? It's

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.880
 experimenting at the moment with guard pigs. Okay. Do you see this? Okay, guarding from what? Well,

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:54.560
 exactly. Truffle. I don't want to create a bit of suspense. So last year, Skippal did this experiment

00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:01.920
 with installing pigs around the runways. Real pigs. Real pigs to scare away the geese. Okay. Or

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.920
 in fact, not to scare away the geese, but to eat the food that the geese love to eat. Okay. Because

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.200
 there is farming around and they grow sugar beet and geese love sugar beet. And so when they,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.600
 you know, land there, eat the beet, then they fly off, they might fly into the

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.120
 entrance of a plane. That creates a big ol' problem. And so there's a place called the

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.840
 beaten gawonga varkens, pigory, which translates as extraordinary pigs.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.280
 Did they give up for the final word?

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:36.800
 We'll give up segment in our own language and just go to English. God, our language as well.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:46.000
 It's for pigory. Yeah, but they're a pigory which regularly hires out pigs for various purposes,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.960
 mostly to eat stuff which people want to eat. Because you never hear about pig strike

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:58.080
 with planes, do you? You never do. No pigs don't fly. They don't famously. I've got some cool stuff

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:05.760
 about airports which are neither Skippal or Heathrow. Would you like to hear a fact about

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:12.080
 moss or golf? Golf? Absolutely. Moss, please. Yes. Wait, no, but you get a vote too.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:21.440
 Pittsburgh International Airport, they have a place called X-Bridge, which is an innovation

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:29.360
 centre. And in there, they have a giant CMOS air purifier, which does all the air purification

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:37.440
 in the whole airport. So what you're breathing, it holds 125 gallons of spirulina algae, which is

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.040
 also known as CMOS. And this CMOS takes in the CO2 and it kind of works it through its body and then

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:50.000
 sends out the oxygen. So you're breathing in, the moss has breathed it out, the CMOS has breathed

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.040
 out. That's nice. That's awesome. Yeah, like having a Brita filter. That's wicked. Golf? The thing is,

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.240
 you know that we have to ask about the golf now. It's a trick question, wasn't it? Yes. It was great.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.520
 So there's an airport called Don Muyang International in Bangkok. It used to be the main

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:13.760
 airport in Bangkok until another one opened quite recently. But it has a full golf course between

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:20.560
 two of its runways. So you're playing golf and there's planes literally taken off on your left

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.880
 and on your right. You have to pass through security before you get to the golf course,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.320
 so you have to take all your clubs through the metal detectors and stuff like that.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.760
 Is there a golf test? As in I'm bad enough at golf that I can imagine myself accidentally,

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.840
 you know, walloping of 747. Yeah. Hitting it out of the sky. How hard are you hitting that

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.240
 ball there? I'm arguing. I don't think you would, if you've never played golf before, you wouldn't

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:47.200
 be able to do that. So you have to be good enough to be able to hit it a long way, but bad enough

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.720
 that you hit it in the wrong direction. But actually, one of the people who plays there said,

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.720
 in theory, you could hit one of the aircraft, but it would have to be a very deliberate act.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.200
 Okay. Yeah. So you basically have to turn in a different direction that you're supposed to be

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.320
 playing and just whack the ball at it. But then they also said the article I read that, you know,

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:12.240
 a jet engine, it's kind of designed to hit geese and, you know, birds and stuff like that. So

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.760
 little golf balls not going to hurt it anyway. Right. That'll just be crunched up. It's a

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.320
 weight of effort, Andy, for you learning how to play golf really well. Moving to Bangkok.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:28.560
 Yeah. There's another airport near Heathrow called Northolt Airport. Northolt is a very

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:34.320
 small airport. It's more like an aerodrome really. And they used to have a gasometer

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:41.360
 in front of Northolt Airport right next to the runway. Gasometer is like a huge sort of cylinder

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:47.440
 that keep natural gas in. There was also one right next to Heathrow. And people used to use

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:54.480
 these things to guide their way into Heathrow Airport. And so one time in 1960, an airplane

00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.000
 who thought they were landing in Heathrow accidentally landed in Northolt. Okay. It's

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.240
 only like a bus ride to get back to Heathrow. So they got off, the passengers got off, they

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.840
 realized very clearly they were in the wrong place. So the passengers all got the bus back to Heathrow.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:16.000
 No problem. Okay. However, it's one thing landing a plane in Northolt Airport. Another

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.640
 thing taking off because you need a certain length of runway in order to take off. And Northolt did

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:27.760
 not have a long enough runway. So there was no way to get the aeroplane out of Northolt Airport.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:33.840
 Yeah. Did they drive it down Oxford Street? What happened? Well, what happened was a maintenance

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:39.600
 team came along, they removed all of the seats, all of the carpet, anything in the cabin that

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.000
 they could get rid of, pretty much all of the fuel apart from the tiny amount they needed to get

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.480
 back to Heathrow and managed to make it just about light enough that it would be able to just

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:54.800
 The calculations are extraordinary when it comes to that. Apparently the captain was immediately

00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:00.400
 fired by Panam once he got it back. I don't know if that's true, but probably not fair because it

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.960
 happened two more times after that. So that was the first time it happened. And two times after

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.280
 that, airplanes landed in Northolt when they should have landed in Heathrow. And in the end,

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.840
 what they did was they started, they painted letters on these giant gas canisters.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:21.200
 Go away. The NH was painted on top of the one next to Northolt and LH was painted on the one

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:29.200
 next to London Heathrow. Why? I know. Why put the H in both? It's so stupid, isn't it? They painted one

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.520
 of them blue and the other one wasn't painted blue. It feels like you could have done more.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.800
 Do you know the airport that was the Heathrow before Heathrow?

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:46.400
 Gallic. Croydon. Croydon, yeah. And Croydon Aerojome has quite a cool history. So it was the UK's

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.760
 first international airport. It was 1920 until basically Heathrow became the big deal in 1946.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:58.480
 And it was like, that's really exciting. 1920. Passengers would just come for the sake of seeing

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.200
 it. It had a five-star restaurant up the viewing tower so that people could sit and watch planes

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:10.400
 take off. 1928 was the world's biggest airport. Good old Croydon. Is it still there in its shape?

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.480
 It's obviously not an international airport. It was eventually decommissioned. I think it just

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.120
 about went on until the '50s. But there used to be so many checks. If we think it's rough going

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:24.160
 through security now, in the '20s, if you went to Croydon Airport, before you departed, you were

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:30.560
 assessed by a customs officer, normal, and then you went to an exam hall. In your pants.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.200
 And you didn't know what any of the questions were going to be. And you were investigated by the

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.160
 criminal investigation department, and then an immigration officer, and then a medical officer,

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:49.040
 and then you were weighed. Wow. For the plane's distribution, of course. I've been weighed before

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.960
 getting on a plane before. Yeah, small planes, I think. Yeah. Wasn't that where you were told

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.480
 that you had some more different times? Have I ever said this on this? I'm not sure. But yeah,

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.200
 I did get a plane once. Where was it? Maybe in Hawaii or somewhere, or somewhere like that. But

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:07.360
 yeah, it was a very small plane, and they made me move to balance out the airplane. And I thought

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:13.360
 that was a bit insulting, actually. It was only supermodels and children, wasn't it, on the rest of the plane.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:24.720
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that in the

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.760
 16th century, hundreds of lives in Portugal were saved by a special sausage.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:37.360
 It must have been a very special sausage. So this is 16th century Portugal. The Spanish

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:43.760
 Inquisition has been going on for a while in Spain, especially hence the name. I actually began in

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:53.600
 Italy, but it has gotten to Portugal. And basically, if you're Jewish or Islamic, and you claim to be

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.640
 a Catholic, but you're not really, then they're going to try and find you out, and they're going

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.760
 to try and try you and try and burn you even. But one thing that would identify you as a heathen

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:09.840
 would be a lack of sausages by your front door, because people used to hang their sausages to dry

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:16.560
 out. And the sausages would often contain pork. And obviously, if you were Jewish, for instance,

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:21.520
 then you wouldn't eat pork. So you would not have these sausages. So what can you do? Well,

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:28.080
 you can get a decoy sausage. This is according to a book I was reading called Gastro Obscura.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.760
 And they wrote about this thing called the Alhira sausage. And it was made to look exactly like

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:39.920
 one of these pork sausages, but it was actually made of chicken and bread. So it was a fake pork

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.720
 sausage, and it saved people's lives because the Inquisition couldn't find them. Food-wise,

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.040
 it must have been a very rough time because of these Islam and Judaism have very strict rules

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.000
 about pork and shellfish and rabbits and other things. And so there would be some village feasts

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.400
 in Spain and Portugal, where they would serve up paella, paella. And they would add mussels and pork,

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:07.440
 and then they'd watch and see who said, "Oh, I don't want any paella. Thank you." And then those

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:14.240
 people would be on the suspicious list for being inquisited. And it was very Jewish people who were

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.360
 at the majority of the victims, really in the Spanish Inquisition, I think. Jewish people did

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:24.560
 have to practice crypto-Judaism for a very long time, which was concealing. I know it sounds

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.800
 more exciting than it was. They just bought everything with bit kind. So ahead of their time.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.520
 So yeah, because a lot of Jews had fled to Portugal from Spain when they thought the Spanish

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.160
 Inquisition would just stick to its namesake, and then it came to Portugal. And so they did

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.880
 things like they wrote Hebrew prayers, but in Catholic prayer books, and I think in, you know,

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.880
 the Roman alphabet. And so people wouldn't know, they would observe their Black Passover and Yom Kippur,

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:54.720
 but at slightly different days, so people wouldn't catch on. And yeah, they all hung these sausages.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:00.320
 And there was this amazing story that one community was found in Portugal in a little place called

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:08.640
 Bel Monte in 1917, which had kept its faith completely secret since the 1490s. It's been

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:14.240
 crypto-Jewish since then. That's like that Japanese soldier, isn't it, in the Second World War?

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.880
 Well, that's all who kept fighting until 1975, I think it was. Heru, Heru, something, Anoda.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.120
 Because a lot of it was food related, it meant there was a high proportion of women who appeared

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.360
 before the tribunal in the Spanish Inquisition, because of course they did a lot of the cooking.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:34.240
 And when you look at the wordings of people being tried, they're quite often active. So it's like,

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.600
 you prepared this food, you lit these candles, you did this, whereas the men who were tried

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:47.520
 were often like, you allowed yourself to eat this food. It was Eve's apple all over again.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.400
 It was a bit of that, I'm afraid. Well, I wonder as well with the Jewish tradition of, let's say,

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.200
 children born to be Jewish, it's through the bloodline of the mother as well, isn't it? So I

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.920
 guess they're more prime target as well. That's true. But a few other things, like basically

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:08.080
 cooking a really big meal on a Friday was a surefire on you must be Jewish.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.760
 Because of the Sabbath. Because yeah, you weren't allowed to do it on the Sabbath. So even if you

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:18.400
 just were hungry on a Friday. You were going on a long working week. I know. And also cooking with

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:24.080
 olive oil. And the reason is that olive oil was a lot more expensive than like lard or pork fat.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.120
 But obviously Jewish people couldn't use the lard or couldn't use the pork fat, so they would use

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:37.040
 olive oil. And that was supposedly a sign that they were to be tried. So many rules. Cuscus was

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:42.240
 also a danger food. Seen as being more Islamic, you know, sort of North African grain. Cuscus.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.520
 If you, yeah, it was introduced by the Moors when it was all the Moorish.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:56.320
 If you refuse to eat a conga eel, trouble. Whenever you hear conga eel,

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.360
 you do just think of it as a proverbial thing.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:07.040
 I'm refusing to eat a strangled bird. Okay. That was apparently a worrying sign or,

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.000
 you know, a sign that you might be secretly Jewish, because apparently there are rules

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.320
 against eating strangled birds. I see right. Specifically strangled.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.320
 Specifically strangled. Really, you could, it could be decapitated or boiled alive.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:23.680
 There's an old old QI fact, which is quite possibly one of my favorites, which is that

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.600
 everybody expected the Spanish Inquisition. They were required to give you 30 days notice.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.400
 Was part of the 30 days notice the idea that there's a sort of printed menu of things that you

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.680
 would be expected to, like how much did, how much did they help out people to, because as they say,

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.360
 and I have to say, I don't know much about the Spanish Inquisition. And a lot of what I've read

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:48.080
 to prepare for this fact has been really kind of like, they were actually really polite. And

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:53.760
 yes, 5,000 people were killed overall, but actually they were dissolved in 1834,

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.920
 which is an incredibly recent time for when I would think about when the Spanish Inquisition

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.320
 was, but it was a period of hundreds of hundreds of years that they existed for 5,000 deaths over

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:07.040
 400 years. It's still a lot. It's still a lot, absolutely. But it's not yet. The figures are

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.640
 so disputed. Yeah, some people say that, you know, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.760
 Well, they would say they would, yeah, okay. Yeah, exactly. So it's really hard to know.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.800
 And then all the accounts are sort of saying what they didn't want to do was kill you. What

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.200
 they really wanted to do was change your moral compass and make you more Catholic and make you

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:28.560
 believe more like there's so much that then say they're really brutal. And then it's, yeah,

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.320
 I mean, obviously forced, forced to conversion. And it was also forcing people to leave the country

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:38.080
 if they refused to convert and things like this. So they used to have proper, they made a proper

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.320
 big thing of it when they burned people, the Inquisition. They didn't sort of just sort of

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.800
 keep it quiet. It wasn't just slip it onto the carpet. Don't want to make a big deal. Strange.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:53.280
 It was very attention seeking. It was the auto-defe ritual. And you, and this is when the

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.440
 people who've been sentenced were paraded through town. And you'd go and look and you would book

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.640
 a seat. It was announced a month beforehand. Who have you time to book your spot?

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.680
 Everything was booked a month beforehand. Everything was like the Inquisition's arriving

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:08.000
 a month beforehand. We're going to kill you a month beforehand. The people who were accused

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.720
 didn't know until the morning, I don't think, what they'd been found guilty, what their sentence was.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.680
 So I think there were largely three kind of options and you had it revealed

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.080
 by what you were wearing. So you'd be given clothes to wear that represented what was going

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:26.480
 to happen to you. Were there sort of betting things on the side where people were trying to

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.000
 guess, you know, prisoner number three? What's it going to come out in? Yeah. Hang on, are you

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.920
 saying they give you, for example, a green cloak, but you don't know what the green cloak means

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.520
 until they announce it? Or do you think, oh no, they give me the green cloak. That's a burning.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.360
 You know, once you've got the cloak. A yellow hat is an admonition or something.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.800
 They whip the cloak out. They walk into your cell and they say, oh, what have I got behind

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:50.640
 my back? And then they whip the cloak out and then you know. So the first one is the Samara

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.920
 and that's the worst one and it's amazing tunic and then you wear a very, very tall hat. Looks

00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:01.520
 like a dunce's hat. A little really stupid, actually. I like the ones they were in the festivals

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:08.720
 in Spain. Yes, yes. Because they look a bit KKK. But they're not and that means you're being

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.960
 burned alive at the stake. If it's got dragons and devils and flames on it and a picture of you

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:18.880
 as well, they put a little picture of you on your tunic. That's a nice touch, isn't it? Yeah.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:24.880
 It's a bit personalised. Is that so that you can't like accidentally swap your tunic for someone else?

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.040
 Maybe it is. Yeah. Well, I don't know how good the pictures were. Someone sewed this on at the

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.840
 last minute. So that meant you were being burned alive at the stake. They had the Fuego Revolto,

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:40.000
 which was flames pointed downwards and that was you didn't get burned at the stake. You got strangled

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.680
 beforehand and then burned when you were dead. So that's much nicer. Okay. I think you've got

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.040
 to be grateful. And then you had the San Benito, which was had some red salt tires on it and that

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:55.600
 just meant you had to do some penance. So that's the one you're really holding out for. Red salt

00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.080
 tires. Look for the red salt tires. It's a big leap. Salt tires are like a cross, right? Yeah.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.640
 But that is a big difference between the second best and the first best,

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.680
 doesn't it? It is. Yeah. You don't want them to be trying to choose between the two of them and

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.800
 going, "Oh, I've got one of each left. I can't decide." Wow. I didn't know that. It's still kind

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:21.280
 of going on. It's not the Spanish Inquisition. No. There was in 2015 Spain passed a law which was

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.480
 related to the Spanish Inquisition, which I find amazing. And they passed a law saying that people

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:31.680
 who were descended from Sephardic Jews, who were the people who lived in Spain and Portugal,

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:37.200
 they could request Spanish nationality if they could prove certain things about their ancestry.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:43.520
 So, and this was a law of atonement, basically, for the expulsion of the Jews in the 15th century.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:48.000
 If you could prove a family connection with Medieval Spain, and if you were competent in Spanish

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:57.360
 or Ladino, you could come back. There's loads of students. I've never heard of Ladino before.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:03.600
 It's the Judeo-Spanish language. It's an old Spanish language, and it's mostly spoken in Israel

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:08.240
 these days. And it's called Ladino. I've never heard of it. So, this is your set for anyone

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.960
 listening, your second route into getting an EU passport, right? If you don't have that Irish

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.360
 connection that we're all trying to prove. Absolutely. Brush off your Ladino. If you're Jewish, then

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:24.560
 you've got, yeah. And they had 127,000 people applied. Wow. Yeah. First task, 10 shots of

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.880
 Sambuca, and then you're in. And I'll give you some other sausages that were in this book.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:35.680
 The Caccio Cavello della Migrente sounds like the most delicious thing in the world. So,

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:40.640
 in the early 20th century, if you were an immigrant to America, you were allowed to bring

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.720
 cheese in, but you weren't allowed to bring meat products. But a lot of the people coming from

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:50.960
 Europe were big fans of salami and other cured meats. And so, they invented this thing where it was

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:59.680
 salami hidden inside cheese. Oh. Crypto salami. Crypto salami. I practice crypto salami eating.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:09.760
 And another one. This is a Finnish sausage called Makara, M-A-K-A-R-A. And how do you think that's

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:16.480
 cooked? It's an unusual way of cooking. Oh, Finland. They have a lot of saunas. You got it.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:25.040
 They have a special soapstone holder, which is like, it's like, it's basically a tube that you stick

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.600
 your sausage in. Yeah. And then you put it on top of the coals in a sauna, and then it cooks it up.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.840
 How cool is that? The last thing you want, though, when you're sweltering in a 60-degree

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:40.000
 sauna, you still want to go, all right, boiling hot sausage straight off the sauna coals. I think

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.160
 that's so good, because you could run around outside with it in the snow. That would be nice.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.640
 What, branching your sausage? Absolutely. You plunge it into a snowdrift to cool it down.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:53.840
 And then get to it. That sounds like something from Carrie on Finland.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:05.680
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna. My fact this week is that if you

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:11.200
 count the number of lemmings at their peak somewhere, and then you go back four years later and you

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:19.440
 count them again, there will be a thousand times fewer of them. Wow. A thousand times fewer. Yeah.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.480
 Well, that to me says that there's going to be a lot of lemmings in the first place. How many

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:27.040
 lemmings? I can't even imagine a thousand lemmings. That's, wow, you can't even stretch that far.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.880
 You're a little imagination. A hundred is maximum, but that might be the video game.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:34.560
 That's a tenth of a lemming is left when you come back. You can't criticise James's imagination.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:40.640
 Last week, you couldn't imagine a draw big enough to fit a human skull. My imagination is too full

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:46.560
 of lemmings to fit anything else. How many lemmings would you have in a group to match your percentage

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.360
 here? No, any number of lemmings. So basically, it must be in the thousands. It's in the thousands.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, when lemmings are at their peak, I guess they're going to, like,

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.440
 lemming communities are going to peak way, way over a thousand. And then if you come back four

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.200
 years after they've plummeted, exactly four years after that, there'll be a thousand times more

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:10.320
 again. Okay. And they have this, these amazing population cycles, which some animals have,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:16.160
 but they just do it in a much more pronounced and extreme way than others. And also they're

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:21.280
 proper mammals, right? They're actual, like sometimes you might have a load of flies that

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.520
 you get loads of flies or loads of crickets or something at once, but like to have thousands

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.080
 of mammals. Yeah, it's a lot. And to have it that regular literally every four years.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:37.840
 The cicadas of the Arctic. They are. Yes, indeed. And this was, we still don't really know why

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:45.440
 this happens. There's, it's kind of the obvious two options of either they, when the lemming numbers

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.840
 go up and up, then their predators numbers increase as well, because there are lots of lemmings to

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.000
 eat. So eventually their predator numbers get so high that they're, they can eat all the lemmings,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.160
 or it's like the opposite thing where the lemmings, when there are hardly any of them,

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:02.960
 they have loads to eat because they're hardly any of them. And so they eat loads, but as their

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:07.280
 numbers go up and up, then they, they don't have as much food. So eventually they suddenly

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:12.400
 starve to death. Or that they jump off cliffs. Or they hold themselves off cliffs. Let's get

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.480
 into it. Sure. Right. Should we address the elephant in the room straight away? The lemming

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:21.760
 on the cliff. The lemming on the cliff. Christ. Who wants to talk us through that then? Well,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.360
 that's the theory, isn't it, that lemmings would just follow each other off the cliffs.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.760
 A bit mass suicide. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, I believed it for a long time when I was a child.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:36.240
 Yeah. I think we all did. It is such a gruesome story. And it's, so the mass suicide lemming myth

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:42.800
 from 1958, it's from the Disney film White Wilderness, which won a BAFTA, White, sorry, won an

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.520
 Oscar for best documentary. And I think we'll all agree after this, it should be retracted.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:55.040
 And I'm afraid Jeff, the lemming isn't here to accept his award, but we've got,

00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:02.080
 oh, they're not here. Oh, not them. Oh, no. I love the idea of the, the anti Oscar awards,

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:07.760
 where it's retracting. I think that's a really fun idea. How many for this year's retraction

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:14.640
 of best actor include? That's a lot of people thinking Harvey Weinstein. I would like to

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.920
 unthank you. You can unthank you if you like in your speech. So basically what I'm saying is that

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.960
 Disney made this film called White Wilderness in 1958, which showed the lemmings, it showed hundreds

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:29.360
 of thousands of lemmings, you know, crowding along and, and them jumping off cliffs to their doom,

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.640
 which they were suddenly, were they migrating? They were trying to migrate. The idea was,

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.760
 the ideas they're trying to migrate and they jump into the Arctic Ocean and they all die.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.720
 They don't know where they're going. And then they drown. And then the truth is that they had,

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.320
 they put them on a, the Disney cinematographers have put them on a turntable.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.920
 Yeah, like a lazy Susan. Yeah, revolved them around for a bit and then throw them off the cliff.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.280
 And they revolved them around so it looked like there were loads more. This species of lemming

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.280
 didn't even migrate. So they just have to pretend there were loads more. And the really horrible

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.760
 thing is they bought them from some Inuit children. They basically took some pet hamsters

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.920
 from some children and threw them off a cliff. And just threw them literally off a cliff. Yeah.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:08.240
 It's the least Disney, if you can think of the least Disney acts you could do, it's probably this.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.720
 After shooting Bambi's mum is this. Yeah. Yeah. And we believe that they never did that.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:18.160
 Haven't seen it, but I'm sure they definitely did that. But we believed it for years and years

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.640
 and years and then suddenly till the 80s. Yeah. And there was a scat of the Canadian broadcasting

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:28.560
 company didn't expose a on a 24 year old Disney film. It's so strange. They called it cruel camera.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:33.040
 It was about animal cruelty, basically. Yeah. In films. Yeah. So in the Disney film as well,

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.680
 by the way, they use a species of lemming that you don't find where they were filming it. So it

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:42.000
 was filmed in Alberta, Canada. It was in Calgary, but they presented that it was being filmed in

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.720
 Lapland and the lemmings that they got for the filming, which they got North and the Arctic,

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:51.120
 you don't find them in Lapland. So it's just a completely wrong species anyway, in the film.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:55.360
 Yeah. And the species they show, they don't migrate or anything like that. Do they?

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.840
 So it's completely implausible. Yeah. And Calgary is nowhere near the Arctic circle,

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:04.960
 case you're wondering. So well, it's, it's near in global terms. It's in the north and the

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.720
 heavens. It's sadly quite far north. But yeah, you would not find them. But the other thing is

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:18.240
 that people say that the myth comes from Disney and certainly that didn't hurt the myth. But the

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:23.280
 myth existed well before that. Oh, did it? Yeah. So for a long time, people thought that lemmings

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.200
 jumped off clips to kill themselves. And presumably because of these population cycles, they must

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.920
 have thought that. Exactly. So there's a book called the Arthur Meese Children's Encyclopedia,

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.960
 which was first published in 1908. And it mentions this myth there. And that was one of the most

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:42.000
 popular kids books of the time. So it was a thing that people already knew, even though it's not

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.640
 true. But then Disney really, really perpetuated that myth. That makes loads of sense because,

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.920
 because otherwise, why would Disney have a kid? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So your director's out there,

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.360
 he's going, why are they not running off the cliff? Let's make them do the thing that they

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.560
 definitely do because we read it in a book. I don't know, I've been something of that, yeah.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.520
 There was a thing that I read that because lemmings can swim. And the problem is, is when they get

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.560
 to, if they go under the water, I think their fur takes on too much water and they drown,

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:13.600
 but they can swim if they don't go fully under. And so the ones that would drown would then later

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.080
 on wash up to shore. And people would be like, what are they doing here? And that helped with

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.240
 the myth as well, that maybe they jumped off a cliff. And that's why they're in the water at all.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.680
 Do you think there was a moment, I just, I'm trying to imagine being in that film crew,

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:30.000
 there must have been 20, 30 people there all pushing thousands of lemmings off a cliff.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.120
 Like, well, not some of them are going, this is definitely a good idea.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.960
 Yeah, I probably shouldn't have signed up for this internship.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:42.960
 There was a, there was a bit of a metaculper from Disney when the expose film came out in 1982,

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:50.480
 Roy, Roy Disney, or the son or the nephew of Walt Disney said, we may have lost a few lemmings.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.480
 We call him lemming Chucker Jr.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:43:02.640
 Just on them swimming and on them swimming in migratory terms, which they do. So this was

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:08.880
 being considered even in the 19th century. So I was reading something from popular science

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.280
 monthly in 1877. And I was a writer called W. Duppa Crotch.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:21.840
 Who was writing about it? W. Unclear, what is his first name? But his initial was W.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.560
 And then Duppa, D-U-P-P-A Crotch. Maybe he was called Willy.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.880
 It could be Willy Crotch. Willy Duppa Crotch.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:38.320
 And basically he was writing about, you know, the extraordinary swarms that you got.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:42.800
 And you know, they just, nothing stops them. Nothing stops this huge horde of lemmings as

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.760
 they proceed. And that some years they were exorcised by the church and they were anti-lemming

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:55.200
 prayers, allegedly. And Crotch wrote that sometimes so many lemmings took to sea to swim to new lands

00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:01.200
 that in 1868, a ship had sailed for 15 hours through a swarm of lemmings.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.200
 A swarm, hey! Wow! Just not as far as the eye can see.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:10.960
 Probably exaggerated. But he was trying to work out why they were doing this, you know.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.240
 Because it is true that populations of lemmings, some of them will strike out for a bit of new

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:22.320
 land and they might get confused and drown. He reckoned, Crotch, this is, he said they maybe

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:27.920
 were looking for a kind of lemming Atlantis. So that's somewhere which had sunk into the sea,

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.160
 but had been a landmass that had food on it. And that they had... Oh, the memory has stayed.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.760
 ...instinctual species memory. Amazing. And that they were looking for it and kept from like, you

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:42.160
 know... Host's theory done, by the way. Host's theory. No, I know. And it's, yeah. But like, if,

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:46.320
 if, you know, swallows fly to Africa for the winter... Yeah, no, that does happen.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.000
 If Africa sank, would they keep doing it? Would swallows keep going? What would they do?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.240
 Well, we spoke about monarch butterflies and they migrate over a lake. And for no reason at all,

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.600
 they take a turn and then go around. And it's because supposedly a mountain used to exist there,

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.480
 and it doesn't anymore, but in their path, genetically, that's been handed on, the map.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:12.960
 Crazy. How exciting. Lemming Atlantis. No, kill it. Kill the myth now. Before someone makes the film.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:19.680
 I'm on it already. Did you guys see that really incredible photo which was taken in 2014

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:25.920
 in Canada in the Nunavut territory? And it was of a lemming... Yes, I saw hundreds of photos from

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.720
 that specific time and place. Narrow it down. Go through your photos in your head. It was a snowy

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:38.720
 owl nest. Oh, yeah. I didn't see this. This is insane. So it's basically a snowy owl nest that

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:44.640
 is lined with over 70 dead lemmings. And it's extraordinary. Oh my god. And it's late. The

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:52.320
 lemmings are laid around the nest all dead. So cozy. So cozy. It looks, Andy, not dissimilar to one of

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:57.760
 the cakes that have been sent over. If you look down, it looks like a beautiful flower. Exactly.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:03.760
 It really does. Like a big furry flower with these eggs in the middle. I mean,

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:09.360
 it's a astonishing pattern that they create around it. I mean, there's no planning to the

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:13.280
 pattern. It's just dead lemmings laying down. You squashed enough dead lemmings together. It looks

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.360
 quite neat because they're very tightly packed. And they've just got eyes bigger than their

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.720
 stomachs. And it's like, obviously, a lemming bus period. And the owl is like, "Well, I love

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.880
 eating lemming. I'm just going to pick up as many lemmings as I can and catch them." Presumably,

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:30.080
 it insulates the nest. That's lovely and warm. So it's like a fur coat but that you can eat.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.480
 It's like a fur coat with meat in every pocket. But it doesn't look tight enough that the birds

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.400
 would benefit from that to me when I saw the photo. It looks like it's just wringing around. It's like

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:45.280
 if you had insulation in your house, but it was made of sausage rolls. The dream. Imagine piping

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:52.640
 huge sausage rolls into your roof. Do you know where they live? Lemmings. In the clay. Up north,

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:58.720
 yes. They live underground. They live... This is really cool. They have these tunnels. They have

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:04.480
 these nests which are made of grass and feathers and ox wool, which I didn't know was a thing. I

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:11.280
 guess of course it is. Discarded wool from an ox. But the young lemming pups, they grow up between

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:17.280
 the ground and the snow. So there's the snow layer across everything. And there is this... Because

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:22.880
 the ground radiates heat, it melts the snow directly above it. It's incredible. There's this

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:28.000
 tiny gap and the lemmings live in that and it's called the subnivian space. I think it's so cool

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.640
 that. It's mad. Incredible. There's this whole world. And this is where the adults live in like the

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:37.920
 frozen winter period, isn't it? Running around in this secret world between the snow and the ground.

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:42.560
 So how thick is the snow above that if you were a human walking across it? Is it so

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.480
 packed tightly? It's quite thick and that's kind of the point because they don't hibernate. So when

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:51.520
 it gets really, really cold, you think a lot of animals would kind of dig a little hole and hibernate,

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:56.160
 but they don't have to because the snow is such a good insulator that like you say, it's warm enough

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.840
 to melt that little layer and so they can live in there and run around and they're not frozen. That's

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:05.040
 incredible. But I do... Maybe one of you guys did more research on this than me. What's the snow

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:12.880
 resting on? Is it floating? It must be tunnels, right? So you would have an arch, which is where

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:19.200
 they were. That makes more sense than my favorite. It's resting at two very precarious points.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:26.480
 That's how lemming Atlantis operated. Gravity had a different set of rules.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:35.840
