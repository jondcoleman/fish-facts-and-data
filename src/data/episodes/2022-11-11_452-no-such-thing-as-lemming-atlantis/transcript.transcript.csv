00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to"
00:00:20,00:00:25,"you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here with"
00:00:25,00:00:30,"Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski and once again we have gathered around the"
00:00:30,00:00:35,microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here
00:00:35,00:00:41,"we go. Starting with fact number one and that is my fact, my fact this week is that not long"
00:00:41,00:00:48,after Benjamin Franklin invented the lightning rod it took off as a fashion. A lightning rod's
00:00:48,00:00:55,very tall metal objects. Yeah and very sexy when combined. You could dance around them.
00:00:55,00:01:03,Now this was in Paris in 1778. If you were walking the streets of Paris you would have seen
00:01:03,00:01:09,women with lightning rod hats so this is a hat that would have a sort of protruding rod. As far as
00:01:09,00:01:13,I can see in the drawings of the time they might dress that up a bit with a bit of sort of floral
00:01:13,00:01:18,stuff going around it. Yeah something to disguise it but what you didn't really disguise was the
00:01:18,00:01:23,big chain that came out of the hat that ran to the ground so that should you be struck by
00:01:23,00:01:28,lightning you could then ground the lightning via this big chain. Umbrellas did it as well so you
00:01:28,00:01:32,had umbrella with a giant lightning rod on top. How long do these women tend to survive
00:01:32,00:01:40,during thunderstorms? We don't know. The interesting thing is like was there any use for it do you
00:01:40,00:01:44,think? Do you think they deliberately had them to try and get the lightning away from them?
00:01:44,00:01:50,It's just for fashion. Well I think you know if it functioned as it was meant to then yeah
00:01:50,00:01:54,absolutely. They wanted it to function definitely. No hang on if you were hit by lightning wearing
00:01:54,00:01:59,one of these rods which it would ground it to the ground it's just I think it should work it just
00:01:59,00:02:04,that it would probably be too close to you. You'd die. You would die. If your hat had this and then
00:02:04,00:02:10,you had a Faraday cage all the way around you then that would save you. I've seen the pictures
00:02:10,00:02:15,and they didn't. No. Maybe your sedan chair was a Faraday sedan chair and then you're laughing.
00:02:15,00:02:18,I gotta say I empathize more and more with the French Revolution hearing what was going on in
00:02:18,00:02:25,Paris in the 1780s you know I think yeah that's pretty extravagant outlandish stuff. I don't
00:02:25,00:02:30,think this was to do with Franklin by the way but I think it was his specifically the French
00:02:30,00:02:35,"Benjamin Franklin it was his translator who then turned it so he was a guy who was a botanist,"
00:02:35,00:02:41,a physician and he was called Jacques and then he has two French names off of that.
00:02:41,00:02:48,Babur de Bourg. Yeah that'll do. Yeah looks good to me. Jacques Babur de Bourg and he was a
00:02:48,00:02:57,physician. Are you gonna do the rest of the book? Because he was the guy who translated all
00:02:57,00:03:03,Franklin's stuff into French didn't he? Yeah and because he was friends with Franklin he was also
00:03:03,00:03:09,supposed to go to America and then be kind of you know helping the revolution in a way but he
00:03:09,00:03:14,never went because no one liked him. Oh really? Well like he asked the Americans do you want my
00:03:14,00:03:19,help and they said we're okay. Well they were between a couple of different people and he was
00:03:19,00:03:24,really brash and people weren't really sure about him so he never got to do that. That is mad. Well
00:03:24,00:03:30,but thank god because otherwise you might not design this umbrella. Yeah and the UK might have
00:03:30,00:03:37,still owned America and well on that the America project thing I have a fact about George the
00:03:37,00:03:43,Third related to this and Benjamin Franklin because they had a disagreement about lightning rods.
00:03:43,00:03:46,Guess who was right? George the Third or Benjamin Franklin considering the scientific backgrounds
00:03:46,00:03:51,of the two guys. So one of them famously mad. One of them one of the greatest scientists who's
00:03:51,00:03:59,ever lived. And a fashionable guy. I guess you wouldn't be asking us if it wasn't the
00:03:59,00:04:04,exactly. George the Third was right in their disagreement so Franklin thought that lightning
00:04:04,00:04:10,rods should be incredibly sharp tipped at the top. Sharp tops. George the Third said no I want blunt
00:04:10,00:04:14,ones and he fitted the pallets with blunt ones and he was right they are more effective at
00:04:14,00:04:19,earthing lightning. Okay. For the reason that the field above blunt rods is stronger and I think
00:04:19,00:04:24,that means it intercepts lightning more. It helps to draw the lightning down. So actually I didn't
00:04:24,00:04:29,know that lightning rods were to stop lightning happening. Not the secondary purpose initially
00:04:29,00:04:33,was to ground it but the primary purpose according to Franklin and his people was
00:04:33,00:04:38,stop it happening by this sharp rod attracting this charge so dissipating it before it all
00:04:38,00:04:41,built up in the cloud. But it turns out that it's just not nearly big enough a field so it
00:04:41,00:04:45,doesn't really matter. So yeah George the Third was right you can have a knob. A door knob.
00:04:45,00:04:51,So another thing about the bulbous versus the spike right is that basically because Benjamin
00:04:51,00:04:57,Franklin was you know one of the signatories of the declaration of independence he was like a real
00:04:57,00:05:03,patriot and he invented the lightning rod. Basically this was a symbol of the new country
00:05:03,00:05:08,and so Britain did not like this upstart having its new symbol and that was another reason why
00:05:08,00:05:14,George the Third said that you had to put a knob on every single lightning rod in the entire empire.
00:05:14,00:05:20,Do you think it was a bit of a sly you know Franklin such a knob kind of gesture? Almost
00:05:20,00:05:24,certainly. Really? Yeah definitely that kind of work. That's a George the Third move. Yeah.
00:05:24,00:05:28,Can I tell you something about Benjamin Franklin getting in trouble for inventing the lightning
00:05:28,00:05:34,rod? So there was an earthquake at Cape Anne which is off the coast of Massachusetts and it was
00:05:34,00:05:39,soon after the lightning rod was invented and the pastor who was there was called Reverend Thomas
00:05:39,00:05:43,Prince and he said the earthquake happened because everyone's been putting up lightning rods.
00:05:43,00:05:50,Basically man has been thwarting God by trying to you know harness the lightning or channel it
00:05:50,00:05:55,so God has reacted by sending an earthquake. Well his idea was since God can't send down
00:05:55,00:06:00,lightning bolts to kill us anymore he's going to have to go from below instead. Exactly and it's
00:06:00,00:06:04,like you don't you're not showing much faith in your God you'll be able to do that wherever he likes.
00:06:04,00:06:10,People were very anti weren't they because of that you know you're trying to prevent God from
00:06:10,00:06:13,doing his work if he wants to strike you with lightning he should strike you with lightning
00:06:13,00:06:18,and there was a big push among scientists to try and convert people to it. There was a guy in
00:06:18,00:06:23,Germany called Johann Jakob Hemmer and he was a big lightning rod advocate in Germany this is in
00:06:23,00:06:28,the 18th century and he designed like a cross-shaped one which you can still see on the Mannheim Palace
00:06:28,00:06:32,and he had it so that each bit of the cross was detachable so that whenever lightning struck any
00:06:32,00:06:37,bit of the cross and caused a bit of damage he would then detach it bring it down to the masses
00:06:37,00:06:42,and put it on display to say look the lightning struck this and damaged it but it didn't damage
00:06:42,00:06:48,the building so it must work. That's clever because what people thought was that like Andy said that
00:06:48,00:06:54,maybe God was sending down lightning bolts to punish people but the problem is the tallest
00:06:54,00:07:02,building in most towns was a church whereby the brothels were quite like that and so if anything
00:07:02,00:07:07,got struck by lightning it usually was a church and the brothels usually got away scot-free so no
00:07:07,00:07:13,one could really explain what the problem was. The church's thing was an issue there's another
00:07:13,00:07:17,reason why it's good the lightning rod was invented because the way they repelled lightning before
00:07:17,00:07:23,the rod was to ring loads of church bells and so being a bell ringer was an extremely dangerous
00:07:23,00:07:28,job and that you know they were often hit by lightning they I think many of them used to die
00:07:28,00:07:32,because you'd be sent up to the church tower to ring the bell when there was a storm yeah when
00:07:32,00:07:37,you're most likely to get hit and there was actually in 1769 there was a church in Brescia
00:07:37,00:07:43,which was storing a hundred tons of gunpowder in its vaults for safekeeping and it got struck
00:07:43,00:07:47,by lightning because of the church spire and it blew up a sixth of the city three thousand people
00:07:47,00:07:54,died. Oh my god I know. Unbelievable. It started raining quite hard outside from where we're sitting.
00:07:54,00:08:00,And then you've got a massive spike coming out of your head. It's all the fashion darling.
00:08:00,00:08:06,The church bells they had written on them or you know inscribed on them the words fulgra frango
00:08:06,00:08:12,meaning I chase lightning. And the idea I think was that demons would kind of send down the
00:08:12,00:08:16,bolts like God would send the demons and the bells would scare them away. Yeah we have actually
00:08:16,00:08:20,mentioned them before. How interesting though that they would go and ring the bells during the
00:08:20,00:08:26,storms because in my head the wind was kind of doing that anyway. Oh yeah. Like I would always
00:08:26,00:08:30,have thought this. Maybe those big church bells aren't too worried by wind so much. Yeah yeah yeah.
00:08:30,00:08:35,So you can't get a good rhythm going maybe. The wind's very bad at getting exactly getting the right
00:08:35,00:08:42,"beats. You can't get a canterbury, peeled, vicar, pleasure going. Whatever the first canterbury"
00:08:42,00:08:46,pleasure that's a that's a bell ringing thing. Is it? The first canterbury pleasure just sounds
00:08:46,00:08:50,like a porn film based around the art of canterbury. That's why I didn't say it. Oh really? That's why
00:08:50,00:08:53,I didn't say it because I thought it sounds too weird but I think it's a question from the very
00:08:53,00:09:01,earliest QI episodes. I was thinking it was what the wife of BAFTA did. Yeah. I read that they were
00:09:01,00:09:08,all saying this. If I can't do jokes from the 14th century what jokes can I do? In the age
00:09:08,00:09:12,where lightning rods were becoming fashionable and people were skeptical there was one really famous
00:09:12,00:09:19,trial and this was in 1783 in France and it was a guy who'd installed a lightning rod on his house.
00:09:19,00:09:24,He was like an early adopter. The first person to get an iPhone in the village and the villagers
00:09:24,00:09:28,didn't like it. They said you know that's God's not going to like that. We didn't like it. We
00:09:28,00:09:34,don't believe it works and the alderman told him to remove it and he hired a lawyer and took the
00:09:34,00:09:39,alderman to court saying I'm allowed to keep my lightning rod and they won the case and he was
00:09:39,00:09:44,allowed to keep it and his lawyer was Maximilien Robespierre. The sort of one of the leading figures
00:09:44,00:09:50,in the French Revolution. Responsible for a lot of heads getting chopped up. Lots. Yeah and he made
00:09:50,00:09:56,his name in this case as the standout lawyer. This was 1783 but he didn't electrocute and he
00:09:56,00:10:01,actually saved maybe a lot of lives by defending this guy's lightning rod to compensate for the
00:10:01,00:10:05,head chopping off. But you're saying he was like a planning dispute lawyer. Everyone's
00:10:05,00:10:11,got to start somewhere. Yeah absolutely. He also loved physics. Like he was a science. He was like
00:10:11,00:10:16,one of these you know men of the century and he really liked science. They called him the barometer
00:10:16,00:10:22,when he was younger because he was so good at science. That's a cool name. I presumably knew
00:10:22,00:10:26,what the weather was going to be like. Always under pressure. Always under pressure. I got
00:10:26,00:10:31,another cool nickname for someone so barometer. Benjamin Franklin's grandson. Do you know he was
00:10:31,00:10:42,called? The the the thermometer. Lightning Rod Jr. was his name. Okay. Lightning Rod Jr. Not his real
00:10:42,00:10:48,name. His nickname. His grandson right. Yeah. Okay. You would think it would be Lightning Rod the
00:10:48,00:10:53,third. Maybe his dad didn't want the Lightning Rod nickname and said you know what let's just hold
00:10:53,00:10:59,this my son. Yes. That's cool. Do we know why? Just do you like Lightning Rods? No no no. He was
00:10:59,00:11:05,I think he was a journalist. I think he ran a magazine or a newspaper. I think possibly the
00:11:05,00:11:11,nickname was a bit of a slur on him. But I am I am just riffing off. Because he attracted controversy.
00:11:11,00:11:16,I like that. Could be. I like that. Because he always used to sit on the top of people's houses.
00:11:16,00:11:18,Yeah. So he had a knob on his head.
00:11:18,00:11:31,Okay. It's time for fact number two and that is Andy. My fact is that every time the UK delays a
00:11:31,00:11:38,"decision on expanding Heathrow, the head of Skipple Airport in the Netherlands sends Heathrow a"
00:11:38,00:11:44,congratulatory cake to thank them for all the extra custom. Ouch. I love the way you
00:11:44,00:11:49,"pronounced Heathrow two different ways. Heathrow and then Heathrow. Heathrow. It's Heathrow,"
00:11:49,00:11:55,isn't it? It's Heathrow. I was so worried about how to pronounce Skipple. I forgot how to pronounce
00:11:55,00:12:01,Heathrow. This was reported in 2016 and so Skipple is the the main Dutch airport. It's huge. It's
00:12:01,00:12:06,really really massive. Yeah. And Heathrow has been having a debate for about 70 80 years about
00:12:06,00:12:12,whether it's it's it's insane how long this debate's been going on. And so the third runway.
00:12:12,00:12:17,"The third runway. Yeah, exactly. And so Skipple keeps sending them cakes. I find this very funny"
00:12:17,00:12:21,and they said it was to congratulate Heathrow with the positive advice of the Airports Commission
00:12:21,00:12:25,on London. Heathrow's third runway. It's sarcastic. It's a sarcasm cake basically that they're
00:12:25,00:12:30,"sending. What kind of cake is it? Do we know? Well, they showed a photo of the last one they sent"
00:12:30,00:12:34,"and it was one of those. It was a slightly fancy, you know, a coffee cake. It looked like a flower,"
00:12:34,00:12:38,"like a lake. If you were looking aerial shot over a flower, it was very beautiful."
00:12:40,00:12:44,"Like a flower, like a beautiful, it looked like a cake, you know. It was a different kind of cake."
00:12:44,00:12:50,"Yeah, it was very pretty. Is there any chance we keep delaying this Heathrow runway decision because"
00:12:50,00:12:54,the people that Heathrow love this cake so much? It's very possible. It wouldn't make much less
00:12:54,00:12:58,"sense than anything else. But they've been doing it for years. In 2016, this year of this article,"
00:12:58,00:13:03,"Heathrow finally sent their own cake back because of the approval of the third runway. So they said,"
00:13:03,00:13:07,"thanks for letting us borrow your runway, Amsterdam. We shouldn't need it much longer."
00:13:07,00:13:13,"And then the cake's on the way. Six years ago. That's hubris, I'm afraid."
00:13:13,00:13:19,"We haven't quite said this, I don't think, but the reason that they're sending them this cake is"
00:13:19,00:13:24,because of the lack of this third runway. It means that the planes have to pit stop on a bigger
00:13:24,00:13:29,"journey at this airport. So they're bringing them business. Is that right? Do they? Okay,"
00:13:29,00:13:33,"because I didn't know that. I just thought it was maybe people couldn't go to Heathrow,"
00:13:33,00:13:37,"so they were going to Amsterdam instead. But that's not right. It's a bit of both, basically."
00:13:37,00:13:42,"It's just, it's a capacity thing. Heathrow uses about 99% of its all available capacity, which"
00:13:42,00:13:46,"sounds great. But actually, if there was more space, there would be more flights going through"
00:13:46,00:13:53,"there. So, yeah, so that is definitely advantage for them. Yeah, skiphole. It comes from a word"
00:13:53,00:14:00,"meaning shiphole. That's what it comes from. It's a real shiphole. Well, the reason it was called"
00:14:00,00:14:07,"shiphole is because it used to be in the water, skiphole. In fact, there was a sea battle there"
00:14:07,00:14:14,"in 1573, where the airport is today. And that's because it's all reclaimed land. They basically,"
00:14:14,00:14:20,"they wanted more land. Obviously, it's the Netherlands. There's lots of kind of, a lot of"
00:14:20,00:14:26,"the area is below sea level. So they created this massive steam engine, and they sucked all of the"
00:14:26,00:14:31,water away to give them loads more land. And it was the largest steam engine of all time when it
00:14:31,00:14:36,"was built. Oh, that's awesome. The SUP dry the airport. It was named after a guy called Nicholas"
00:14:36,00:14:41,"Creek. Okay. And it was called the Kwee engine. And they didn't drain the lake for the airport,"
00:14:41,00:14:44,"did they? They just drain the lake to reclaim the land. To reclaim the land, and it became"
00:14:44,00:14:50,"later on the airport. It's a really old airport. It's been used for civilian aircraft since 1920,"
00:14:50,00:14:56,"which is very old. And because of that reclaim thing that James just said, the runways are 11 feet"
00:14:56,00:15:02,"below sea level. So cool. When the airline KLM, so that's the Dutch national carrier,"
00:15:02,00:15:08,"isn't it, some flagship one, when they turned 100 years old in 2019, it was given a really cool salute,"
00:15:08,00:15:12,the KLM flight arriving in Edinburgh. Have you seen this before? It's when a plane arrives
00:15:12,00:15:18,"for a special occasion, it gets a water cannon salute. Oh, yeah, yeah. And it means that so"
00:15:18,00:15:22,"airports have these huge, powerful water cannons that it's like fire engines, basically, or water"
00:15:22,00:15:29,jets. And they fire them in an arc over the plane as it's arriving. That feels dangerous to me.
00:15:29,00:15:33,"I guess, but they used to rain on the thing. And it's sort of a nice celebratory arch. And it's"
00:15:33,00:15:37,"if a captain is retiring, or if a plane is retiring, or you know, there are all these occasions where"
00:15:37,00:15:41,"they have a lovely little water cannon salute. You wouldn't want to do it at the Shippell airport,"
00:15:41,00:15:49,"where it's sort of refilling the reservoir. There was a thing on Shippell airport website,"
00:15:49,00:15:52,"which was, it was like frequently asked questions and things you might have wondered about it said,"
00:15:52,00:15:57,"you may have noticed a plane on fire while you were taking off from Shippell,"
00:15:57,00:16:00,"which I would have thought would be so terrifying. And they need to make a bigger deal of this,"
00:16:00,00:16:05,"but apparently it's nothing to be scared of is what we call our firefly. And it's a plane,"
00:16:05,00:16:10,which they regularly set on fire for the fire department. They claim it's used by the fire
00:16:10,00:16:16,"department for training every day, which I can't believe they need to come every day to repractice"
00:16:16,00:16:19,"a plane being on fire. But there must be different crews from around the country. And how, I mean,"
00:16:19,00:16:25,how many places in the country are going to have a every day though? It's a lot. It's a lot. It's
00:16:25,00:16:31,"suggested not getting it right. Okay, we'll do this again tomorrow, guys. I see a load of clowns"
00:16:31,00:16:36,"with a chain of buckets going to the plane. Yeah. Skippal has, did you know this? It's"
00:16:36,00:16:42,"experimenting at the moment with guard pigs. Okay. Do you see this? Okay, guarding from what? Well,"
00:16:42,00:16:54,"exactly. Truffle. I don't want to create a bit of suspense. So last year, Skippal did this experiment"
00:16:54,00:17:01,with installing pigs around the runways. Real pigs. Real pigs to scare away the geese. Okay. Or
00:17:01,00:17:05,"in fact, not to scare away the geese, but to eat the food that the geese love to eat. Okay. Because"
00:17:05,00:17:11,"there is farming around and they grow sugar beet and geese love sugar beet. And so when they,"
00:17:12,00:17:15,"you know, land there, eat the beet, then they fly off, they might fly into the"
00:17:15,00:17:21,entrance of a plane. That creates a big ol' problem. And so there's a place called the
00:17:21,00:17:25,"beaten gawonga varkens, pigory, which translates as extraordinary pigs."
00:17:25,00:17:27,Did they give up for the final word?
00:17:27,00:17:36,"We'll give up segment in our own language and just go to English. God, our language as well."
00:17:38,00:17:46,"It's for pigory. Yeah, but they're a pigory which regularly hires out pigs for various purposes,"
00:17:46,00:17:50,mostly to eat stuff which people want to eat. Because you never hear about pig strike
00:17:50,00:17:58,"with planes, do you? You never do. No pigs don't fly. They don't famously. I've got some cool stuff"
00:17:58,00:18:05,about airports which are neither Skippal or Heathrow. Would you like to hear a fact about
00:18:05,00:18:12,"moss or golf? Golf? Absolutely. Moss, please. Yes. Wait, no, but you get a vote too."
00:18:12,00:18:21,"Pittsburgh International Airport, they have a place called X-Bridge, which is an innovation"
00:18:21,00:18:29,"centre. And in there, they have a giant CMOS air purifier, which does all the air purification"
00:18:29,00:18:37,"in the whole airport. So what you're breathing, it holds 125 gallons of spirulina algae, which is"
00:18:37,00:18:43,also known as CMOS. And this CMOS takes in the CO2 and it kind of works it through its body and then
00:18:43,00:18:50,"sends out the oxygen. So you're breathing in, the moss has breathed it out, the CMOS has breathed"
00:18:50,00:18:57,"out. That's nice. That's awesome. Yeah, like having a Brita filter. That's wicked. Golf? The thing is,"
00:18:57,00:19:02,"you know that we have to ask about the golf now. It's a trick question, wasn't it? Yes. It was great."
00:19:02,00:19:07,So there's an airport called Don Muyang International in Bangkok. It used to be the main
00:19:07,00:19:13,airport in Bangkok until another one opened quite recently. But it has a full golf course between
00:19:13,00:19:20,two of its runways. So you're playing golf and there's planes literally taken off on your left
00:19:20,00:19:24,"and on your right. You have to pass through security before you get to the golf course,"
00:19:24,00:19:28,so you have to take all your clubs through the metal detectors and stuff like that.
00:19:28,00:19:33,"Is there a golf test? As in I'm bad enough at golf that I can imagine myself accidentally,"
00:19:33,00:19:37,"you know, walloping of 747. Yeah. Hitting it out of the sky. How hard are you hitting that"
00:19:37,00:19:42,"ball there? I'm arguing. I don't think you would, if you've never played golf before, you wouldn't"
00:19:42,00:19:47,"be able to do that. So you have to be good enough to be able to hit it a long way, but bad enough"
00:19:47,00:19:52,"that you hit it in the wrong direction. But actually, one of the people who plays there said,"
00:19:52,00:19:56,"in theory, you could hit one of the aircraft, but it would have to be a very deliberate act."
00:19:56,00:20:01,Okay. Yeah. So you basically have to turn in a different direction that you're supposed to be
00:20:01,00:20:06,"playing and just whack the ball at it. But then they also said the article I read that, you know,"
00:20:06,00:20:12,"a jet engine, it's kind of designed to hit geese and, you know, birds and stuff like that. So"
00:20:12,00:20:15,little golf balls not going to hurt it anyway. Right. That'll just be crunched up. It's a
00:20:15,00:20:20,"weight of effort, Andy, for you learning how to play golf really well. Moving to Bangkok."
00:20:20,00:20:28,Yeah. There's another airport near Heathrow called Northolt Airport. Northolt is a very
00:20:28,00:20:34,small airport. It's more like an aerodrome really. And they used to have a gasometer
00:20:34,00:20:41,in front of Northolt Airport right next to the runway. Gasometer is like a huge sort of cylinder
00:20:41,00:20:47,that keep natural gas in. There was also one right next to Heathrow. And people used to use
00:20:47,00:20:54,"these things to guide their way into Heathrow Airport. And so one time in 1960, an airplane"
00:20:54,00:21:00,who thought they were landing in Heathrow accidentally landed in Northolt. Okay. It's
00:21:00,00:21:04,"only like a bus ride to get back to Heathrow. So they got off, the passengers got off, they"
00:21:04,00:21:09,realized very clearly they were in the wrong place. So the passengers all got the bus back to Heathrow.
00:21:09,00:21:16,"No problem. Okay. However, it's one thing landing a plane in Northolt Airport. Another"
00:21:16,00:21:20,thing taking off because you need a certain length of runway in order to take off. And Northolt did
00:21:20,00:21:27,not have a long enough runway. So there was no way to get the aeroplane out of Northolt Airport.
00:21:27,00:21:33,"Yeah. Did they drive it down Oxford Street? What happened? Well, what happened was a maintenance"
00:21:33,00:21:39,"team came along, they removed all of the seats, all of the carpet, anything in the cabin that"
00:21:39,00:21:44,"they could get rid of, pretty much all of the fuel apart from the tiny amount they needed to get"
00:21:44,00:21:48,back to Heathrow and managed to make it just about light enough that it would be able to just
00:21:48,00:21:54,The calculations are extraordinary when it comes to that. Apparently the captain was immediately
00:21:54,00:22:00,"fired by Panam once he got it back. I don't know if that's true, but probably not fair because it"
00:22:00,00:22:04,happened two more times after that. So that was the first time it happened. And two times after
00:22:04,00:22:09,"that, airplanes landed in Northolt when they should have landed in Heathrow. And in the end,"
00:22:09,00:22:13,"what they did was they started, they painted letters on these giant gas canisters."
00:22:13,00:22:21,Go away. The NH was painted on top of the one next to Northolt and LH was painted on the one
00:22:21,00:22:29,"next to London Heathrow. Why? I know. Why put the H in both? It's so stupid, isn't it? They painted one"
00:22:29,00:22:33,of them blue and the other one wasn't painted blue. It feels like you could have done more.
00:22:33,00:22:38,Do you know the airport that was the Heathrow before Heathrow?
00:22:39,00:22:46,"Gallic. Croydon. Croydon, yeah. And Croydon Aerojome has quite a cool history. So it was the UK's"
00:22:46,00:22:51,first international airport. It was 1920 until basically Heathrow became the big deal in 1946.
00:22:51,00:22:58,"And it was like, that's really exciting. 1920. Passengers would just come for the sake of seeing"
00:22:58,00:23:03,it. It had a five-star restaurant up the viewing tower so that people could sit and watch planes
00:23:03,00:23:10,take off. 1928 was the world's biggest airport. Good old Croydon. Is it still there in its shape?
00:23:10,00:23:14,It's obviously not an international airport. It was eventually decommissioned. I think it just
00:23:14,00:23:19,about went on until the '50s. But there used to be so many checks. If we think it's rough going
00:23:19,00:23:24,"through security now, in the '20s, if you went to Croydon Airport, before you departed, you were"
00:23:24,00:23:30,"assessed by a customs officer, normal, and then you went to an exam hall. In your pants."
00:23:32,00:23:37,And you didn't know what any of the questions were going to be. And you were investigated by the
00:23:37,00:23:42,"criminal investigation department, and then an immigration officer, and then a medical officer,"
00:23:42,00:23:49,"and then you were weighed. Wow. For the plane's distribution, of course. I've been weighed before"
00:23:49,00:23:52,"getting on a plane before. Yeah, small planes, I think. Yeah. Wasn't that where you were told"
00:23:52,00:23:56,"that you had some more different times? Have I ever said this on this? I'm not sure. But yeah,"
00:23:56,00:24:01,"I did get a plane once. Where was it? Maybe in Hawaii or somewhere, or somewhere like that. But"
00:24:01,00:24:07,"yeah, it was a very small plane, and they made me move to balance out the airplane. And I thought"
00:24:07,00:24:13,"that was a bit insulting, actually. It was only supermodels and children, wasn't it, on the rest of the plane."
00:24:13,00:24:24,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that in the"
00:24:24,00:24:29,"16th century, hundreds of lives in Portugal were saved by a special sausage."
00:24:29,00:24:37,It must have been a very special sausage. So this is 16th century Portugal. The Spanish
00:24:37,00:24:43,"Inquisition has been going on for a while in Spain, especially hence the name. I actually began in"
00:24:43,00:24:53,"Italy, but it has gotten to Portugal. And basically, if you're Jewish or Islamic, and you claim to be"
00:24:53,00:24:58,"a Catholic, but you're not really, then they're going to try and find you out, and they're going"
00:24:58,00:25:03,to try and try you and try and burn you even. But one thing that would identify you as a heathen
00:25:03,00:25:09,"would be a lack of sausages by your front door, because people used to hang their sausages to dry"
00:25:09,00:25:16,"out. And the sausages would often contain pork. And obviously, if you were Jewish, for instance,"
00:25:16,00:25:21,"then you wouldn't eat pork. So you would not have these sausages. So what can you do? Well,"
00:25:21,00:25:28,you can get a decoy sausage. This is according to a book I was reading called Gastro Obscura.
00:25:28,00:25:33,And they wrote about this thing called the Alhira sausage. And it was made to look exactly like
00:25:33,00:25:39,"one of these pork sausages, but it was actually made of chicken and bread. So it was a fake pork"
00:25:39,00:25:44,"sausage, and it saved people's lives because the Inquisition couldn't find them. Food-wise,"
00:25:44,00:25:49,it must have been a very rough time because of these Islam and Judaism have very strict rules
00:25:49,00:25:54,about pork and shellfish and rabbits and other things. And so there would be some village feasts
00:25:54,00:26:02,"in Spain and Portugal, where they would serve up paella, paella. And they would add mussels and pork,"
00:26:02,00:26:07,"and then they'd watch and see who said, ""Oh, I don't want any paella. Thank you."" And then those"
00:26:07,00:26:14,people would be on the suspicious list for being inquisited. And it was very Jewish people who were
00:26:14,00:26:19,"at the majority of the victims, really in the Spanish Inquisition, I think. Jewish people did"
00:26:19,00:26:24,"have to practice crypto-Judaism for a very long time, which was concealing. I know it sounds"
00:26:24,00:26:28,more exciting than it was. They just bought everything with bit kind. So ahead of their time.
00:26:28,00:26:33,"So yeah, because a lot of Jews had fled to Portugal from Spain when they thought the Spanish"
00:26:33,00:26:38,"Inquisition would just stick to its namesake, and then it came to Portugal. And so they did"
00:26:38,00:26:42,"things like they wrote Hebrew prayers, but in Catholic prayer books, and I think in, you know,"
00:26:42,00:26:48,"the Roman alphabet. And so people wouldn't know, they would observe their Black Passover and Yom Kippur,"
00:26:48,00:26:54,"but at slightly different days, so people wouldn't catch on. And yeah, they all hung these sausages."
00:26:54,00:27:00,And there was this amazing story that one community was found in Portugal in a little place called
00:27:00,00:27:08,"Bel Monte in 1917, which had kept its faith completely secret since the 1490s. It's been"
00:27:08,00:27:14,"crypto-Jewish since then. That's like that Japanese soldier, isn't it, in the Second World War?"
00:27:14,00:27:18,"Well, that's all who kept fighting until 1975, I think it was. Heru, Heru, something, Anoda."
00:27:18,00:27:23,"Because a lot of it was food related, it meant there was a high proportion of women who appeared"
00:27:23,00:27:27,"before the tribunal in the Spanish Inquisition, because of course they did a lot of the cooking."
00:27:27,00:27:34,"And when you look at the wordings of people being tried, they're quite often active. So it's like,"
00:27:34,00:27:39,"you prepared this food, you lit these candles, you did this, whereas the men who were tried"
00:27:39,00:27:47,"were often like, you allowed yourself to eat this food. It was Eve's apple all over again."
00:27:47,00:27:52,"It was a bit of that, I'm afraid. Well, I wonder as well with the Jewish tradition of, let's say,"
00:27:52,00:27:57,"children born to be Jewish, it's through the bloodline of the mother as well, isn't it? So I"
00:27:57,00:28:01,"guess they're more prime target as well. That's true. But a few other things, like basically"
00:28:01,00:28:08,cooking a really big meal on a Friday was a surefire on you must be Jewish.
00:28:08,00:28:11,"Because of the Sabbath. Because yeah, you weren't allowed to do it on the Sabbath. So even if you"
00:28:11,00:28:18,just were hungry on a Friday. You were going on a long working week. I know. And also cooking with
00:28:18,00:28:24,olive oil. And the reason is that olive oil was a lot more expensive than like lard or pork fat.
00:28:24,00:28:29,"But obviously Jewish people couldn't use the lard or couldn't use the pork fat, so they would use"
00:28:29,00:28:37,olive oil. And that was supposedly a sign that they were to be tried. So many rules. Cuscus was
00:28:37,00:28:42,"also a danger food. Seen as being more Islamic, you know, sort of North African grain. Cuscus."
00:28:42,00:28:45,"If you, yeah, it was introduced by the Moors when it was all the Moorish."
00:28:45,00:28:56,"If you refuse to eat a conga eel, trouble. Whenever you hear conga eel,"
00:28:56,00:28:59,you do just think of it as a proverbial thing.
00:28:59,00:29:07,"I'm refusing to eat a strangled bird. Okay. That was apparently a worrying sign or,"
00:29:07,00:29:10,"you know, a sign that you might be secretly Jewish, because apparently there are rules"
00:29:10,00:29:14,against eating strangled birds. I see right. Specifically strangled.
00:29:14,00:29:18,"Specifically strangled. Really, you could, it could be decapitated or boiled alive."
00:29:18,00:29:23,"There's an old old QI fact, which is quite possibly one of my favorites, which is that"
00:29:24,00:29:29,everybody expected the Spanish Inquisition. They were required to give you 30 days notice.
00:29:29,00:29:34,Was part of the 30 days notice the idea that there's a sort of printed menu of things that you
00:29:34,00:29:39,"would be expected to, like how much did, how much did they help out people to, because as they say,"
00:29:39,00:29:43,"and I have to say, I don't know much about the Spanish Inquisition. And a lot of what I've read"
00:29:43,00:29:48,"to prepare for this fact has been really kind of like, they were actually really polite. And"
00:29:48,00:29:53,"yes, 5,000 people were killed overall, but actually they were dissolved in 1834,"
00:29:53,00:29:57,which is an incredibly recent time for when I would think about when the Spanish Inquisition
00:29:57,00:30:02,"was, but it was a period of hundreds of hundreds of years that they existed for 5,000 deaths over"
00:30:02,00:30:07,"400 years. It's still a lot. It's still a lot, absolutely. But it's not yet. The figures are"
00:30:07,00:30:10,"so disputed. Yeah, some people say that, you know, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands."
00:30:10,00:30:15,"Well, they would say they would, yeah, okay. Yeah, exactly. So it's really hard to know."
00:30:15,00:30:18,And then all the accounts are sort of saying what they didn't want to do was kill you. What
00:30:18,00:30:23,they really wanted to do was change your moral compass and make you more Catholic and make you
00:30:23,00:30:28,"believe more like there's so much that then say they're really brutal. And then it's, yeah,"
00:30:28,00:30:32,"I mean, obviously forced, forced to conversion. And it was also forcing people to leave the country"
00:30:32,00:30:38,"if they refused to convert and things like this. So they used to have proper, they made a proper"
00:30:38,00:30:42,"big thing of it when they burned people, the Inquisition. They didn't sort of just sort of"
00:30:42,00:30:46,keep it quiet. It wasn't just slip it onto the carpet. Don't want to make a big deal. Strange.
00:30:46,00:30:53,"It was very attention seeking. It was the auto-defe ritual. And you, and this is when the"
00:30:53,00:30:57,people who've been sentenced were paraded through town. And you'd go and look and you would book
00:30:57,00:31:00,a seat. It was announced a month beforehand. Who have you time to book your spot?
00:31:00,00:31:03,Everything was booked a month beforehand. Everything was like the Inquisition's arriving
00:31:03,00:31:08,a month beforehand. We're going to kill you a month beforehand. The people who were accused
00:31:08,00:31:12,"didn't know until the morning, I don't think, what they'd been found guilty, what their sentence was."
00:31:12,00:31:17,So I think there were largely three kind of options and you had it revealed
00:31:17,00:31:22,by what you were wearing. So you'd be given clothes to wear that represented what was going
00:31:22,00:31:26,to happen to you. Were there sort of betting things on the side where people were trying to
00:31:26,00:31:30,"guess, you know, prisoner number three? What's it going to come out in? Yeah. Hang on, are you"
00:31:30,00:31:33,"saying they give you, for example, a green cloak, but you don't know what the green cloak means"
00:31:33,00:31:37,"until they announce it? Or do you think, oh no, they give me the green cloak. That's a burning."
00:31:37,00:31:41,"You know, once you've got the cloak. A yellow hat is an admonition or something."
00:31:41,00:31:44,"They whip the cloak out. They walk into your cell and they say, oh, what have I got behind"
00:31:44,00:31:50,my back? And then they whip the cloak out and then you know. So the first one is the Samara
00:31:50,00:31:55,"and that's the worst one and it's amazing tunic and then you wear a very, very tall hat. Looks"
00:31:55,00:32:01,"like a dunce's hat. A little really stupid, actually. I like the ones they were in the festivals"
00:32:01,00:32:08,"in Spain. Yes, yes. Because they look a bit KKK. But they're not and that means you're being"
00:32:08,00:32:12,burned alive at the stake. If it's got dragons and devils and flames on it and a picture of you
00:32:12,00:32:18,"as well, they put a little picture of you on your tunic. That's a nice touch, isn't it? Yeah."
00:32:18,00:32:24,It's a bit personalised. Is that so that you can't like accidentally swap your tunic for someone else?
00:32:24,00:32:29,"Maybe it is. Yeah. Well, I don't know how good the pictures were. Someone sewed this on at the"
00:32:29,00:32:33,"last minute. So that meant you were being burned alive at the stake. They had the Fuego Revolto,"
00:32:33,00:32:40,which was flames pointed downwards and that was you didn't get burned at the stake. You got strangled
00:32:40,00:32:45,beforehand and then burned when you were dead. So that's much nicer. Okay. I think you've got
00:32:45,00:32:51,"to be grateful. And then you had the San Benito, which was had some red salt tires on it and that"
00:32:51,00:32:55,just meant you had to do some penance. So that's the one you're really holding out for. Red salt
00:32:55,00:33:00,"tires. Look for the red salt tires. It's a big leap. Salt tires are like a cross, right? Yeah."
00:33:01,00:33:06,"But that is a big difference between the second best and the first best,"
00:33:06,00:33:09,doesn't it? It is. Yeah. You don't want them to be trying to choose between the two of them and
00:33:09,00:33:14,"going, ""Oh, I've got one of each left. I can't decide."" Wow. I didn't know that. It's still kind"
00:33:14,00:33:21,of going on. It's not the Spanish Inquisition. No. There was in 2015 Spain passed a law which was
00:33:21,00:33:26,"related to the Spanish Inquisition, which I find amazing. And they passed a law saying that people"
00:33:26,00:33:31,"who were descended from Sephardic Jews, who were the people who lived in Spain and Portugal,"
00:33:31,00:33:37,they could request Spanish nationality if they could prove certain things about their ancestry.
00:33:37,00:33:43,"So, and this was a law of atonement, basically, for the expulsion of the Jews in the 15th century."
00:33:43,00:33:48,"If you could prove a family connection with Medieval Spain, and if you were competent in Spanish"
00:33:48,00:33:57,"or Ladino, you could come back. There's loads of students. I've never heard of Ladino before."
00:33:57,00:34:03,"It's the Judeo-Spanish language. It's an old Spanish language, and it's mostly spoken in Israel"
00:34:03,00:34:08,"these days. And it's called Ladino. I've never heard of it. So, this is your set for anyone"
00:34:08,00:34:12,"listening, your second route into getting an EU passport, right? If you don't have that Irish"
00:34:12,00:34:17,"connection that we're all trying to prove. Absolutely. Brush off your Ladino. If you're Jewish, then"
00:34:17,00:34:24,"you've got, yeah. And they had 127,000 people applied. Wow. Yeah. First task, 10 shots of"
00:34:24,00:34:28,"Sambuca, and then you're in. And I'll give you some other sausages that were in this book."
00:34:28,00:34:35,"The Caccio Cavello della Migrente sounds like the most delicious thing in the world. So,"
00:34:35,00:34:40,"in the early 20th century, if you were an immigrant to America, you were allowed to bring"
00:34:40,00:34:44,"cheese in, but you weren't allowed to bring meat products. But a lot of the people coming from"
00:34:44,00:34:50,"Europe were big fans of salami and other cured meats. And so, they invented this thing where it was"
00:34:50,00:34:59,salami hidden inside cheese. Oh. Crypto salami. Crypto salami. I practice crypto salami eating.
00:34:59,00:35:09,"And another one. This is a Finnish sausage called Makara, M-A-K-A-R-A. And how do you think that's"
00:35:09,00:35:16,"cooked? It's an unusual way of cooking. Oh, Finland. They have a lot of saunas. You got it."
00:35:16,00:35:25,"They have a special soapstone holder, which is like, it's like, it's basically a tube that you stick"
00:35:25,00:35:29,"your sausage in. Yeah. And then you put it on top of the coals in a sauna, and then it cooks it up."
00:35:29,00:35:33,"How cool is that? The last thing you want, though, when you're sweltering in a 60-degree"
00:35:33,00:35:40,"sauna, you still want to go, all right, boiling hot sausage straight off the sauna coals. I think"
00:35:40,00:35:44,"that's so good, because you could run around outside with it in the snow. That would be nice."
00:35:44,00:35:48,"What, branching your sausage? Absolutely. You plunge it into a snowdrift to cool it down."
00:35:48,00:35:53,And then get to it. That sounds like something from Carrie on Finland.
00:35:59,00:36:05,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna. My fact this week is that if you"
00:36:05,00:36:11,"count the number of lemmings at their peak somewhere, and then you go back four years later and you"
00:36:11,00:36:19,"count them again, there will be a thousand times fewer of them. Wow. A thousand times fewer. Yeah."
00:36:19,00:36:22,"Well, that to me says that there's going to be a lot of lemmings in the first place. How many"
00:36:22,00:36:27,"lemmings? I can't even imagine a thousand lemmings. That's, wow, you can't even stretch that far."
00:36:27,00:36:30,"You're a little imagination. A hundred is maximum, but that might be the video game."
00:36:30,00:36:34,That's a tenth of a lemming is left when you come back. You can't criticise James's imagination.
00:36:34,00:36:40,"Last week, you couldn't imagine a draw big enough to fit a human skull. My imagination is too full"
00:36:40,00:36:46,of lemmings to fit anything else. How many lemmings would you have in a group to match your percentage
00:36:46,00:36:51,"here? No, any number of lemmings. So basically, it must be in the thousands. It's in the thousands."
00:36:51,00:36:54,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, when lemmings are at their peak, I guess they're going to, like,"
00:36:54,00:36:59,"lemming communities are going to peak way, way over a thousand. And then if you come back four"
00:36:59,00:37:03,"years after they've plummeted, exactly four years after that, there'll be a thousand times more"
00:37:03,00:37:10,"again. Okay. And they have this, these amazing population cycles, which some animals have,"
00:37:10,00:37:16,but they just do it in a much more pronounced and extreme way than others. And also they're
00:37:16,00:37:21,"proper mammals, right? They're actual, like sometimes you might have a load of flies that"
00:37:21,00:37:25,"you get loads of flies or loads of crickets or something at once, but like to have thousands"
00:37:25,00:37:30,"of mammals. Yeah, it's a lot. And to have it that regular literally every four years."
00:37:30,00:37:37,"The cicadas of the Arctic. They are. Yes, indeed. And this was, we still don't really know why"
00:37:37,00:37:45,"this happens. There's, it's kind of the obvious two options of either they, when the lemming numbers"
00:37:45,00:37:49,"go up and up, then their predators numbers increase as well, because there are lots of lemmings to"
00:37:49,00:37:54,"eat. So eventually their predator numbers get so high that they're, they can eat all the lemmings,"
00:37:54,00:37:58,"or it's like the opposite thing where the lemmings, when there are hardly any of them,"
00:37:58,00:38:02,"they have loads to eat because they're hardly any of them. And so they eat loads, but as their"
00:38:02,00:38:07,"numbers go up and up, then they, they don't have as much food. So eventually they suddenly"
00:38:07,00:38:12,starve to death. Or that they jump off cliffs. Or they hold themselves off cliffs. Let's get
00:38:12,00:38:16,into it. Sure. Right. Should we address the elephant in the room straight away? The lemming
00:38:16,00:38:21,"on the cliff. The lemming on the cliff. Christ. Who wants to talk us through that then? Well,"
00:38:21,00:38:25,"that's the theory, isn't it, that lemmings would just follow each other off the cliffs."
00:38:25,00:38:29,"A bit mass suicide. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, I believed it for a long time when I was a child."
00:38:29,00:38:36,"Yeah. I think we all did. It is such a gruesome story. And it's, so the mass suicide lemming myth"
00:38:36,00:38:42,"from 1958, it's from the Disney film White Wilderness, which won a BAFTA, White, sorry, won an"
00:38:42,00:38:47,"Oscar for best documentary. And I think we'll all agree after this, it should be retracted."
00:38:47,00:38:55,"And I'm afraid Jeff, the lemming isn't here to accept his award, but we've got,"
00:38:55,00:39:02,"oh, they're not here. Oh, not them. Oh, no. I love the idea of the, the anti Oscar awards,"
00:39:02,00:39:07,where it's retracting. I think that's a really fun idea. How many for this year's retraction
00:39:07,00:39:14,of best actor include? That's a lot of people thinking Harvey Weinstein. I would like to
00:39:14,00:39:19,unthank you. You can unthank you if you like in your speech. So basically what I'm saying is that
00:39:19,00:39:24,"Disney made this film called White Wilderness in 1958, which showed the lemmings, it showed hundreds"
00:39:24,00:39:29,"of thousands of lemmings, you know, crowding along and, and them jumping off cliffs to their doom,"
00:39:29,00:39:32,"which they were suddenly, were they migrating? They were trying to migrate. The idea was,"
00:39:32,00:39:35,the ideas they're trying to migrate and they jump into the Arctic Ocean and they all die.
00:39:35,00:39:40,"They don't know where they're going. And then they drown. And then the truth is that they had,"
00:39:40,00:39:44,"they put them on a, the Disney cinematographers have put them on a turntable."
00:39:44,00:39:47,"Yeah, like a lazy Susan. Yeah, revolved them around for a bit and then throw them off the cliff."
00:39:47,00:39:51,And they revolved them around so it looked like there were loads more. This species of lemming
00:39:51,00:39:55,didn't even migrate. So they just have to pretend there were loads more. And the really horrible
00:39:55,00:39:59,thing is they bought them from some Inuit children. They basically took some pet hamsters
00:39:59,00:40:03,from some children and threw them off a cliff. And just threw them literally off a cliff. Yeah.
00:40:03,00:40:08,"It's the least Disney, if you can think of the least Disney acts you could do, it's probably this."
00:40:08,00:40:12,After shooting Bambi's mum is this. Yeah. Yeah. And we believe that they never did that.
00:40:12,00:40:18,"Haven't seen it, but I'm sure they definitely did that. But we believed it for years and years"
00:40:18,00:40:22,and years and then suddenly till the 80s. Yeah. And there was a scat of the Canadian broadcasting
00:40:22,00:40:28,company didn't expose a on a 24 year old Disney film. It's so strange. They called it cruel camera.
00:40:28,00:40:33,"It was about animal cruelty, basically. Yeah. In films. Yeah. So in the Disney film as well,"
00:40:33,00:40:37,"by the way, they use a species of lemming that you don't find where they were filming it. So it"
00:40:37,00:40:42,"was filmed in Alberta, Canada. It was in Calgary, but they presented that it was being filmed in"
00:40:42,00:40:46,"Lapland and the lemmings that they got for the filming, which they got North and the Arctic,"
00:40:46,00:40:51,"you don't find them in Lapland. So it's just a completely wrong species anyway, in the film."
00:40:51,00:40:55,"Yeah. And the species they show, they don't migrate or anything like that. Do they?"
00:40:55,00:40:59,"So it's completely implausible. Yeah. And Calgary is nowhere near the Arctic circle,"
00:40:59,00:41:04,"case you're wondering. So well, it's, it's near in global terms. It's in the north and the"
00:41:04,00:41:10,"heavens. It's sadly quite far north. But yeah, you would not find them. But the other thing is"
00:41:10,00:41:18,that people say that the myth comes from Disney and certainly that didn't hurt the myth. But the
00:41:18,00:41:23,"myth existed well before that. Oh, did it? Yeah. So for a long time, people thought that lemmings"
00:41:23,00:41:27,"jumped off clips to kill themselves. And presumably because of these population cycles, they must"
00:41:27,00:41:31,"have thought that. Exactly. So there's a book called the Arthur Meese Children's Encyclopedia,"
00:41:31,00:41:36,which was first published in 1908. And it mentions this myth there. And that was one of the most
00:41:36,00:41:42,"popular kids books of the time. So it was a thing that people already knew, even though it's not"
00:41:42,00:41:46,"true. But then Disney really, really perpetuated that myth. That makes loads of sense because,"
00:41:46,00:41:51,"because otherwise, why would Disney have a kid? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So your director's out there,"
00:41:51,00:41:55,"he's going, why are they not running off the cliff? Let's make them do the thing that they"
00:41:55,00:41:58,"definitely do because we read it in a book. I don't know, I've been something of that, yeah."
00:41:58,00:42:03,"There was a thing that I read that because lemmings can swim. And the problem is, is when they get"
00:42:03,00:42:08,"to, if they go under the water, I think their fur takes on too much water and they drown,"
00:42:08,00:42:13,but they can swim if they don't go fully under. And so the ones that would drown would then later
00:42:13,00:42:18,"on wash up to shore. And people would be like, what are they doing here? And that helped with"
00:42:18,00:42:22,"the myth as well, that maybe they jumped off a cliff. And that's why they're in the water at all."
00:42:22,00:42:25,"Do you think there was a moment, I just, I'm trying to imagine being in that film crew,"
00:42:25,00:42:30,"there must have been 20, 30 people there all pushing thousands of lemmings off a cliff."
00:42:30,00:42:33,"Like, well, not some of them are going, this is definitely a good idea."
00:42:33,00:42:36,"Yeah, I probably shouldn't have signed up for this internship."
00:42:36,00:42:42,"There was a, there was a bit of a metaculper from Disney when the expose film came out in 1982,"
00:42:42,00:42:50,"Roy, Roy Disney, or the son or the nephew of Walt Disney said, we may have lost a few lemmings."
00:42:50,00:42:52,We call him lemming Chucker Jr.
00:42:52,00:43:02,"Just on them swimming and on them swimming in migratory terms, which they do. So this was"
00:43:02,00:43:08,being considered even in the 19th century. So I was reading something from popular science
00:43:08,00:43:13,monthly in 1877. And I was a writer called W. Duppa Crotch.
00:43:16,00:43:21,"Who was writing about it? W. Unclear, what is his first name? But his initial was W."
00:43:21,00:43:26,"And then Duppa, D-U-P-P-A Crotch. Maybe he was called Willy."
00:43:26,00:43:30,It could be Willy Crotch. Willy Duppa Crotch.
00:43:30,00:43:38,"And basically he was writing about, you know, the extraordinary swarms that you got."
00:43:38,00:43:42,"And you know, they just, nothing stops them. Nothing stops this huge horde of lemmings as"
00:43:42,00:43:47,they proceed. And that some years they were exorcised by the church and they were anti-lemming
00:43:47,00:43:55,"prayers, allegedly. And Crotch wrote that sometimes so many lemmings took to sea to swim to new lands"
00:43:55,00:44:01,"that in 1868, a ship had sailed for 15 hours through a swarm of lemmings."
00:44:01,00:44:05,"A swarm, hey! Wow! Just not as far as the eye can see."
00:44:05,00:44:10,"Probably exaggerated. But he was trying to work out why they were doing this, you know."
00:44:12,00:44:16,"Because it is true that populations of lemmings, some of them will strike out for a bit of new"
00:44:16,00:44:22,"land and they might get confused and drown. He reckoned, Crotch, this is, he said they maybe"
00:44:22,00:44:27,"were looking for a kind of lemming Atlantis. So that's somewhere which had sunk into the sea,"
00:44:27,00:44:32,"but had been a landmass that had food on it. And that they had... Oh, the memory has stayed."
00:44:32,00:44:37,"...instinctual species memory. Amazing. And that they were looking for it and kept from like, you"
00:44:37,00:44:42,"know... Host's theory done, by the way. Host's theory. No, I know. And it's, yeah. But like, if,"
00:44:42,00:44:46,"if, you know, swallows fly to Africa for the winter... Yeah, no, that does happen."
00:44:46,00:44:50,"If Africa sank, would they keep doing it? Would swallows keep going? What would they do?"
00:44:50,00:44:54,"Well, we spoke about monarch butterflies and they migrate over a lake. And for no reason at all,"
00:44:54,00:44:59,"they take a turn and then go around. And it's because supposedly a mountain used to exist there,"
00:44:59,00:45:04,"and it doesn't anymore, but in their path, genetically, that's been handed on, the map."
00:45:05,00:45:12,"Crazy. How exciting. Lemming Atlantis. No, kill it. Kill the myth now. Before someone makes the film."
00:45:12,00:45:19,I'm on it already. Did you guys see that really incredible photo which was taken in 2014
00:45:19,00:45:25,"in Canada in the Nunavut territory? And it was of a lemming... Yes, I saw hundreds of photos from"
00:45:25,00:45:30,that specific time and place. Narrow it down. Go through your photos in your head. It was a snowy
00:45:30,00:45:38,"owl nest. Oh, yeah. I didn't see this. This is insane. So it's basically a snowy owl nest that"
00:45:38,00:45:44,is lined with over 70 dead lemmings. And it's extraordinary. Oh my god. And it's late. The
00:45:44,00:45:52,"lemmings are laid around the nest all dead. So cozy. So cozy. It looks, Andy, not dissimilar to one of"
00:45:52,00:45:57,"the cakes that have been sent over. If you look down, it looks like a beautiful flower. Exactly."
00:45:57,00:46:03,"It really does. Like a big furry flower with these eggs in the middle. I mean,"
00:46:03,00:46:09,"it's a astonishing pattern that they create around it. I mean, there's no planning to the"
00:46:09,00:46:13,pattern. It's just dead lemmings laying down. You squashed enough dead lemmings together. It looks
00:46:13,00:46:17,quite neat because they're very tightly packed. And they've just got eyes bigger than their
00:46:17,00:46:20,"stomachs. And it's like, obviously, a lemming bus period. And the owl is like, ""Well, I love"
00:46:20,00:46:24,"eating lemming. I'm just going to pick up as many lemmings as I can and catch them."" Presumably,"
00:46:24,00:46:30,it insulates the nest. That's lovely and warm. So it's like a fur coat but that you can eat.
00:46:30,00:46:34,It's like a fur coat with meat in every pocket. But it doesn't look tight enough that the birds
00:46:34,00:46:38,would benefit from that to me when I saw the photo. It looks like it's just wringing around. It's like
00:46:38,00:46:45,"if you had insulation in your house, but it was made of sausage rolls. The dream. Imagine piping"
00:46:45,00:46:52,"huge sausage rolls into your roof. Do you know where they live? Lemmings. In the clay. Up north,"
00:46:52,00:46:58,yes. They live underground. They live... This is really cool. They have these tunnels. They have
00:46:58,00:47:04,"these nests which are made of grass and feathers and ox wool, which I didn't know was a thing. I"
00:47:04,00:47:11,"guess of course it is. Discarded wool from an ox. But the young lemming pups, they grow up between"
00:47:11,00:47:17,the ground and the snow. So there's the snow layer across everything. And there is this... Because
00:47:17,00:47:22,"the ground radiates heat, it melts the snow directly above it. It's incredible. There's this"
00:47:22,00:47:28,tiny gap and the lemmings live in that and it's called the subnivian space. I think it's so cool
00:47:28,00:47:32,that. It's mad. Incredible. There's this whole world. And this is where the adults live in like the
00:47:32,00:47:37,"frozen winter period, isn't it? Running around in this secret world between the snow and the ground."
00:47:37,00:47:42,So how thick is the snow above that if you were a human walking across it? Is it so
00:47:42,00:47:46,packed tightly? It's quite thick and that's kind of the point because they don't hibernate. So when
00:47:46,00:47:51,"it gets really, really cold, you think a lot of animals would kind of dig a little hole and hibernate,"
00:47:51,00:47:56,"but they don't have to because the snow is such a good insulator that like you say, it's warm enough"
00:47:56,00:47:59,to melt that little layer and so they can live in there and run around and they're not frozen. That's
00:47:59,00:48:05,incredible. But I do... Maybe one of you guys did more research on this than me. What's the snow
00:48:05,00:48:12,"resting on? Is it floating? It must be tunnels, right? So you would have an arch, which is where"
00:48:12,00:48:19,they were. That makes more sense than my favorite. It's resting at two very precarious points.
00:48:19,00:48:26,That's how lemming Atlantis operated. Gravity had a different set of rules.
00:48:26,00:48:35,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get"
