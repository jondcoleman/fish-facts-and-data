 going to do the Edinburgh Festival. We'll be doing the 26th to the 30th of August

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.160
 and it's going to be a real real great laugh and we really hope that you come

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.780
 along and watch us. If you want to get details go to qi.com/fishevents and

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.800
 that'll take you everywhere you need to go to get the tickets. On with the show.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:38.520
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.900
 coming to you from the qi offices in Covern Garden. My name is Dan

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.840
 Triver. I'm sitting here with Anichesensky Andy Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.760
 Once again we have gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.240
 from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.640
 you Chazinski. My fact is that instead of being one of the founders of the USA

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.840
 Benjamin Franklin almost stayed in Britain to found a swimming school on the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.080
 Thames. This was his big idea in his early 20s so he lived in London. He was

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.480
 working for a printer as the printer's apprentice and he liked to swim and

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.200
 he nobleman used to queue up along the size of the Thames and be like what

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.640
 is this guy doing? He's swimming. Which bit of the Thames is this sort of London.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.680
 So he used to swim from black fries to Chelsea which was three miles I think

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.040
 or roughly three miles so that bit of the Thames. How long was he here for? He came

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.360
 back and forth I think so he was here initially for a few years and then he

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.600
 considered selling up a swimming school because he was teaching all these

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.680
 nobleman's kids to swim and he asked a friend for advice as to whether he

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.320
 should and this friend said I don't think that's a regular idea why didn't you

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.920
 come and work for me in America again so he left Britain in about 1726 I think.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.240
 He also one of his lesser spoken about inventions is that he invented

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.480
 basically flippers for the hands. This is how much he loves swimming. He invented

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.160
 hand flippers for while you were swimming. And I think he was a child in fact when

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.560
 he did that wasn't he? He was about 11. Yeah. Another crazy invention of his

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.360
 which I just love his lesser ones. Basically he invented a method for getting a

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.600
 book down from a bookshelf. It was way too high. He invented what's called the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.760
 book arm and it was basically an extended stick that you would reach up and

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.680
 grip on to books and take them down off the shelf. Have you heard his pseudonyms?

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.640
 Because he had a load of pseudonyms. He had female ones didn't he? Yes he did so

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.200
 he when he was a boy he wanted to write in his brother's newspaper and his

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.200
 brother didn't let him. So he wrote in the guise of a middle-aged widow. Silence

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.400
 do good. That was the widow's name. The later one was Polly Baker who was a

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.920
 fictional woman who had had children out of wedlock and being punished for it.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.920
 And there was Alice Adetung who was another widow. Celia Shortface, Martha Careful

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.840
 and Miss Busy Body. He also the one of the women you mentioned and I can't remember

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.800
 which one, maybe the first one. I hope it's Celia Shortface. It's not Celia Shortface

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.520
 was he created her quite ahead of his time in order to show the one you had

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.960
 religious met children and stuff. Oh Polly Baker. Yeah Polly Baker was

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.960
 created to comment on society's prejudice towards women in their attitudes

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.360
 women who'd been mistreated. Amazing before we think it. I think you have more

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.280
 female pseudonyms than male ones. I've certainly found a lot more female ones. I don't

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.880
 like Polly Baker because it's not like a funny one like the others is it? That's a

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.400
 typical man's response. Polly Baker would have been all over that. When it was hot

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.480
 he said you should you should sleep in two beds. What at the same time? He said

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.960
 you should sleep in one until you're uncomfortable and you just go to the other

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.040
 one. He obviously not discovered the pillow over to get the cold side. No it's been

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.080
 attributed to him but I don't think he invented it. He should have invented a

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.720
 claw to turn it out. But he also said it's okay if you just have a very large bed

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.040
 you can just get up and go to a different bit of the bed. I don't know sorry I

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.720
 don't see why you don't have a large bed you don't have to get up and go to another

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.360
 part of the bed. How large a bed? Really large. You're going to get a taxi to

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.480
 the other part. You get up you pack a snack and a few toiletries and head off. Top left corner

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.040
 please. But he also invented, this isn't really an invention. He invented a device

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.800
 by which he could unlock and lock his bedroom door from his bed without having to

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.160
 get up. Really? So maybe that was also a cruelling device.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.800
 It's an invention one of those as well. Did he? Well they're probably having a big fight

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.880
 up in heaven right now. Of a right. Of a property? Yes. To the incredibly successful

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.960
 invention that they both come up with that everyone can't do without these days. Do you

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.040
 know until the 1930s there were water slides along the Thames? Floating baths, temporary

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.360
 lidoes, pontoons and water slides all the way along the Thames because people used to

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.120
 swim in it so much. Oh my god. That's amazing. And now it's illegal. So the first of a swimming

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.960
 book was written in 1539 by a German guy called Nicolaus Weinmann or Vinmann and it recommended

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.040
 various different swimming aids of buoyancy which included belts made of cork which they used

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.360
 of in life preserve us for centuries, bundles of reeds and my favourite air filled cow

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.320
 bladders. Oh that's good. Nice. Yeah. They had, I think people used pigs bladders in England

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.800
 in the 16th century for it. The first guy to swimming in Britain, it was written in response

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.240
 to that because it was thought that that didn't really tell you how to swim in more just

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.680
 described swimming. I mean all I've got is how to float from it. So I have a whole thing

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.600
 that isn't Latin but if you don't have bovine bladders then you're you're bugged. So this guy,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.920
 the first guy to swim was written by a guy called Everard Digby in 1587. He is not to be confused

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.960
 with Everard Digby who was involved in the gunpowder plot or in fact the father of Everard Digby

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.440
 of the gunpowder plot who's also called Everard Digby but also don't confuse this guy who

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.320
 wrote the swimming book with the guy who replaced him as a clergyman who was also called Everard Digby.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.360
 Wait, one of the gunpowder plot was wrote a swimming guide. No, that's why I said don't confuse

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.520
 him. I have to be ready. There was one thing they asked you to do and you just, I sort of didn't

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.880
 hear the bit where she said don't and I just had confused him with. Was Everard Digby just like

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.400
 the John Smith of its day? I think he must have been. What a great world to live in. Everyone's

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.840
 called Everard Digby. I'm really Tom Dick and Everard Digby has been coming in here. Can I just say

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:30.240
 the first person to get a call back to Everard Digby? So Everard Digby, the swimmer, he was a

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.240
 clergyman who wrote a guide to swimming and why he comes out most strongly as I think BBC history

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.960
 is reporting on this is in exhibitionist swimming so he describes what you should do. Is that like

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.120
 synchronized swimming? Well, yeah, I think he's sort of like the grandfather of synchronized swimming

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.360
 really because he explains how you can look good in the water. So he advises, think to do well

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.160
 swimming. He showed you how to sit on the water while keeping a float, carry things in both hands

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:00.960
 across the water, swimming holding one foot with one hand, useful, he says, useful if you happen

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.200
 to get cramp. So before you ridicule, that's great. Swimming while dancing with both legs in the air.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.160
 Also maybe he's with a cramp and this is the best one. He also explains how to swim while

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.480
 cutting your toenails in the water by lying on your back, bringing your knee up to your chest and

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.400
 using a knife. So using a knife to cut your toenails in the water while floating on your back.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.880
 That's really cool. Yeah, it sounds great. I was reading about strokes because breast stroke

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.680
 seems to be the oldest stroke that we know about. There's in fact cave paintings in Egypt where they

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:43.200
 show people doing breast stroke. Really? No, not how do you know. How do they know that it's

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.640
 breast stroke? I guess it just looks like it. The motion looks like it. But there's no motion in cave

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.760
 paintings. I think they've got one of those peelable books but in stone. So you flip the book,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.160
 you see it moving. You flip the rock. You've got to run really fast when one came to the other.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.040
 And it's very untrue to say there's no flip paintings. Have you seen the documentary by

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.040
 Bernard Herzog? Oh, so good. Extraordinary. And did you know about this? It's called Cave of

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.160
 Forgotten Tree. Yeah, haven't seen it yet. They have there's one drawing of a horse. They would

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.800
 draw horses and they would draw them with like five legs in motion. And you kind of think why they

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.040
 doing that? Why does it look like that? And they realized that if you had a fire inside this cave

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.160
 and you were looking at it, the flames would create the motion. Like a flicker. Exactly. So it would

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.800
 give it like flip book kind of artistic running horse on the inside of a cave. So anyway, breast stroke

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:37.440
 really old thing. This is a story that I read which I really like. 1844, breast stroke was the big

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:44.000
 stroke for swimming in England. Two guys came over. Native Americans had a race and they used

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.320
 front crawl. Yeah. Totally whipped ass like they just killed this race right. But no one liked it

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.960
 because they thought it looked un-European. This is how British, British people are. They did not

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:01.680
 take on that stroke until 1873. That was in 1844 that that happened. So what was the generation?

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:08.160
 Yeah, a whole new thousands of hours wasted. Get this. In the 1900 Olympics, there was a 200 metre

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.880
 obstacle swimming course. You were able to swim with the current because it was in moving water,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.360
 but you had to make it past three obstacles. You had to climb over two of them. One was a pole

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.560
 and one was a row of boats and then you had to swim under the other one which was another row of

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.880
 boats. That sounds great. Why have we not kept this? Yeah, that sounds amazing. Yeah. I've got another

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:34.640
 Olympic one that I just want to flag up. 1896 summer Olympics. Athens. Athens. These were all of the

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.920
 sporting events for swimming. Okay. 100 metre freestyle. Yeah. 500 metre freestyle. Yeah.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:47.040
 1200 metre freestyle. Yeah. Sailors. 100 metre freestyle. In which only sailors from Greece

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.040
 who happen to be sailors who could enter the competition. Which country won gold? Yep. So

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.240
 Greece won gold silver bronze. Well done. And no one lost because only three people entered the race.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:06.400
 We were talking about races and stuff like that in swimming. In 1791, three men swam from Westminster

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.520
 bridge to London bridge for an eight guinea wager. The winner was carried to a pub to celebrate

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:19.200
 where he drank so much gin he expired. Presumably the the the other two just split the four guinea's

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:26.400
 each. I think second place would get it though. Yeah. The people used to swim loads in the

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.000
 Thames didn't they? Yeah. I read that in 1880 there was a man dog race in the Thames and the dog one.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.360
 Really? So I think Windsor baths were these to have little bits of the Thames as James said at

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.240
 the side. I think like Lido's set apart so you could swim in them and they had to move Windsor baths

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:49.280
 in 1870 because it allowed Queen Victoria a view of the naked men. No. It was inappropriate.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:55.760
 Oh what? They moved it so that she couldn't see it. Sorry. No, the way you said it. It's like

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.320
 in the Olympics how they moved the end of the marathon. So that the Queen could see the end.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.040
 The end of the race. The Victoria is like I really would like to see this thing. I rather

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:11.600
 than have a good Queen Victoria the hidden pervert. Did you guys see the giant swastika that's been

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.440
 spotted in a swimming pool? So there was a helicopter on a kidnapping mission to

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:22.720
 imagine when you're you're doing a kidnapping mission but you like but we have to tell someone

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:30.160
 about this pool. I'm so torn like I've got this letter from someone saying they've taken my child

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:37.360
 and also apparently there's a sticker. Police said the unnamed homeowner would not be charged

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.160
 as the swastika is on private land and was not on display to promote Nazism was you'd do wonder

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:48.720
 why it was on display in just a Hindu side of peace which those clumsy, clumsy tylers put

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.360
 in the wrong way around. If I wasn't a Hindu and so peaceful I'd be furious.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:05.760
 Okay time for fact number two. That's my fact. My fact this week is that sumo wrestling referees

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.800
 carry a knife on them so that in the event that they make a bad decision during a match they can kill

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:18.560
 themselves. How often does that happen? It hasn't actually happened traditionally the idea is that

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.040
 they always made brilliant decisions or they thought actually it was bad but it wasn't that bad.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.040
 Sumo wrestler referees is it's a very high ranking they actually have rankings you become the sort

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.960
 of the head of sumo wrestling referees they are the ones who carry the knife traditionally the idea

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.720
 was that they would kill themselves because it was such an honor to be that high if they do bank

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.000
 a bad decision these days they'll hand in their papers and say I'm retiring. So it's seen as yeah

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.720
 but the knife is out to remind them that you should kill yourself. So if like the best football referee

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.840
 like Howard Webb or someone would carry it but all the others wouldn't. Yes exactly. I love the idea

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.760
 of a player going oh referee the referee thinking you're going no you're right you're

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:06.720
 so the reason I found this fact is Anna and I were having a drink with her friend Meg. Meg was

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.760
 telling us that sumo wrestlers are incredibly flexible and they can all do the splits. So I went

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.120
 home and googled that straight away and they can. If you googled sumo wrestler splits on the internet

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.960
 have a field day it's wonderful. I think it's easier because it's the weight of your torso just

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:27.200
 jams. They're incredibly flexible. I assume they have to be athletic because it's it's a

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.040
 weird double thing isn't it because they're they're really really heavy but also they're very very

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.640
 athletic. Yeah yeah it is extremely hardcore the training isn't in the stables which is what the

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.960
 schools that they kind of train in and I think one of the bits of training is you get your tutor

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.200
 you have to do the splits and then your tutor forces your chest down onto the ground. Yeah it's

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.560
 amazing so Anna's just said stables that's what they call it. It's sumo's have a kind of hog warts

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.960
 where you get you go you're like you're like you've been picked as a sumo wrestler and you go and you

00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:04.960
 do put on your life. You put on the sorting nappy when you go in. Yeah and they live their lives in

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.440
 there they they have to they do they do sit in class wearing nothing except the nappy when you

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.320
 see their lessons they're just sitting in a class taking notes from the black board and you just

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.120
 got all these huge tockless men. What's it called? It has got a proper name it's an M word I think.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:25.840
 It's the Mawashi. Mawashi. And if you if your Mawashi comes off during a fight then you have to

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.720
 fall for the fight. There wasn't thing because obviously people think that it's a bit strange if they

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.080
 haven't seen sumo before that they're wearing what look like nappies. Yeah. So there was a few years

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:42.000
 ago they the a few years ago the Japanese amateur sumo association announced this plan to let young

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.360
 players compete in shorts and because normally you're any fight wearing the Mawashi and it was

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.240
 thought it would get more young people involved in it because they have a problem with this. So is it

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.400
 shorts as well as them? No it's just shorts. There was a lot there was like you don't have anything to

00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.080
 grab on to. Surely that's an issue like because they kind of grab on to those. Yeah. So anyway it didn't

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.400
 happen because the professional body said over our dead body that nobody in shorts would be allowed

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:11.040
 into youth tournaments so it just completely died a death the idea. It's incredible the respect that

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.960
 they have for all of the traditions including that and even the audience there are no heckles

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:22.640
 whatsoever and this goes back to the referee thing if the referee makes a call regardless of what an

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.760
 audience member thinks and regardless what the sumo wrestler thinks they just accept it. There's no

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.440
 yelling there's no contending it's okay he called it that's his job it must be right. That's good. Yeah

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.600
 it's a total respect and you have to be a good loser don't you and yeah never betray this

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.840
 satisfaction with the result. Yeah it's like it's sort of like the polar opposite of a football match

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:48.560
 basically really the crowd is singing the referee's an excellent half a turn. Yeah well he's got a knife

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:56.000
 the most popular referee in the 19th century was called um ever-odd digby.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:09.120
 Damn it. Come on I held that up for you. The most prominent referee in the 19th century was called

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Seagar Bastard and so that's why referees are nasty. I think you know there was a suggestion of that

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.920
 but that actually came about about 60 years after he died but yeah and he became know he was so

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.840
 good he became known as Knight of the Whistle so I like to think they made a call Tim Sir Bastard

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:31.920
 after that. The Knight of the Whistle. Yeah. Do you want to hear something about the UK sumo scene?

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:39.680
 This is from the UK Sumo website and it's it's also sad um at present the sport of sumo in the

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:45.120
 UK has a very limited following. Regressively behind Dover's Whitecliffs there are no known

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.480
 organizations or individuals with any recent training experience at any Japanese sumo clubs or

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:56.080
 establishments although one Englishman did once join the sport in Japan. The UK is something of a

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:02.080
 sumo desert. Oh that's sad. It is sad but it's not true for everyone because loads of top sumo

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.320
 wrestlers at Eastern European. Yeah the Czech Republic is quite popular there as well. It's amazing

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:12.320
 yeah and um of the Yorkazooners which is a top kind of thing um there's not any Japanese ones at the

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:17.120
 moment I think they're all Mongolian. Wow really. Yeah I think the last something like the last 36

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.800
 competitions have all been won by young Japanese people mainly in Mongolia. This is like the England

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.680
 cricket team isn't it? We invent it everyone else beats us at it. Actually it is like that because if

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.600
 you look it up it's exactly the articles are exactly like English people writing about cricket.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.760
 Articles are like what has happened to Japanese sumo wrestling we're being thrashed by foreigners

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.280
 and it's a real problem I think and it's because it's really unpopular now amongst the youth isn't it

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:44.240
 so the average age of like a sumo audience is over 60 and yeah so not a lot of young because young

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.280
 people start to fall in country the UK we're we're never going to get cricket back or football back

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:57.040
 we should maybe go into sumo. And the standard sumo diet is 10,000 calories a day I think in their

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.160
 schools and they get force fed in thousand calories a day. Yeah it's a lot isn't it it's a good amount

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:09.920
 that's a lot a blue whale can eat a million calories in one mouthful so that is what how many more

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.880
 it's a thousand times that is it? It's not a competition between sumo wrestlers and blue whales a hundred

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.520
 hundred times that so a hundred sumo wrestlers equals one blue whale. Wow. We do miss a day in a

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.320
 mouthful. One blue whale mouthful. So a blue whale could eat a hundred sumo wrestlers in one mouthful

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.240
 that's not quite what I say. And they do they all do that's why the sport is unpopular in Japan at

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.440
 the moment. It's very hard to get people to sign up because they know. That's why the Japanese go

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:44.240
 after the whales. It's revenge. So ex sumo wrestlers. Yeah again as with you know we have footballers

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.200
 over here who go into weird and wacky things after they leave football. Oh yeah. One of the most famous

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:55.920
 ones Konnishiki Yasukuchi became a hip-hop artist and hosted a children's TV show. One of my favorites

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.000
 Yasuyuki Hirose. I got this on an article about ex sumo wrestlers from the Guardian. He can drink a

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.880
 two litre bottle of orange phanta in ten seconds. That's his trick. He's also in a comedy group and

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.520
 I quote directly his obesity related difficulties are often the topic of the group's jokes.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.920
 I think an alternative comedy revolution might be required.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:25.120
 Yeah. Ten seconds. Two litres of orange phanta. I can't drink two litres in a day.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.520
 I think I could drink two litres of water in that much time but orange phanta is pretty fizzy.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:35.600
 Two leases. How many pints is that? It's about four isn't it? I know I can't do that. I was drunk.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:43.040
 I think I had to drink four pints for a bet in ten minutes and I did that and I was violently sick.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:52.960
 I was working as a waiter. Excuse me. We asked some water ages ago. It hasn't arrived.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:20:02.880
 I could throw it off in the corner. Speaking of so they're overweight. As I think you mentioned,

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.480
 they have to eat a lot and I was looking at overweight people in other sports and in the 1952

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:14.400
 Olympics there was no weight restriction on the bobslay and there was no weight restriction

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:20.080
 and only the German team I think it was realized that the way to go fast in bobslay is obviously

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.640
 to put really heavy people on and so the average weight of a German bobslay entry in the 1952

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:31.200
 Olympics was £260 which is almost 20 stone isn't it? I reckon they learned a lesson from that

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:38.160
 Olympics and weight restriction is everywhere now. What was shame? So on referees? Oh yeah. I did not

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.480
 know because I know nothing of sport that one man invented yellow cards and he was called Ken

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.720
 Aston and he was a really tough referee. He was really good. He was involved in football. He was a

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:54.080
 football referee. I was British and he was I think if it was in around the 50s or 60s but he just

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.120
 seen an England Argentine match which was so rough that afterwards the Argentinian team tried to

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.360
 break into the English dressing room. That's how bad it got. Wow. And one Argentinian player had been

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.040
 pleading with the ref and it's just being very passionate about saying that was not a foul,

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.000
 that wasn't offside whatever it was and he got sent off for violence of the tongue was the phrase

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.240
 that was used and as Ken Aston was driving home he thought there must be a way of punishing someone

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.000
 without just sending them off because there must be an intermediate stage and he said as I drove

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.840
 down Kensington High Street the traffic light turned red I thought yellow take it easy red stop you're

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:34.080
 off. So it's based on traffic lights. Yeah which is I mean it's what you deserve. Should be an

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.520
 amber card. That's why I'm going to call it from that one. Oh god you're going to be even less

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:46.800
 popular football matches. That was never an amber. On his ideas list was there carrier dagger in

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.880
 order to commit suicide anywhere this is that feature in his brain storm. I once went to a party

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.560
 where the host of the party employed the yellow card red card system. Yeah the idea was if you got

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.040
 too drunk too rowdy you'd get a yellow card if you then repeated an offense you'd get a red card.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:08.000
 What happened when you got a record you had to go home. Yeah I had to go home. I got red carded.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.040
 I'm qualified. I'm a qualified referee do you know. Are you a football referee? Really? Yeah.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:19.760
 What level of you qualified could you do a premiership match? I did yeah I did a Marcel versus Swansea

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.400
 this week but he's not allowed on the pitch anymore because of his new amber card system which is

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:30.080
 met some resistance. James was actually a very successful referee for a long time but he was fired

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.640
 after drinking all the halftime water. Four players died at first.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:46.800
 Okay time for fact number three and that is Harkin. My fact this week is a trailer for the longest

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:53.680
 movie ever made has just been released and it's 72 minutes long. Wow. I like to think that the film

00:22:53.680 --> 00:23:00.320
 is just 73 minutes and they had a terrible editor. Is that okay? There's a lot of spoilers in this trailer.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:10.240
 No sadly the movie is 30 days long. Is it? The guy who's making this film I looked him

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.480
 up a bit. He's called Anders Daybergs that right? That's right yeah. And he said it would be an

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.040
 abstract non-linear narrative summary of the artist's time spent with the moving image.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.360
 Sounds great. And that it will show how space and time is intertwined into a surreal dream like

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.040
 journey beyond places. Are there any action scenes? I don't know if there's a chase.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:34.160
 Isn't it going to be screen just once? Yeah I think that's the plan yeah although you know due to

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.840
 popular demand they roll it out. DVD sales might be huge. You get 10 DVDs in the post.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.720
 It's supposedly it's going to be screen just once on every continent from the 31st of December 2020

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:50.480
 onward so it's not here out for a while. Yeah and then it's going to be destroyed by the audiences.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.760
 Sounds terrible. Has anyone watched the trailer? No. Basically there's not enough time to watch

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.560
 a 72 minute trailer. You can imagine going into the cinema to watch another film and this trailer

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:08.480
 comes on and for the first couple of minutes it's really into it. I think by 45 minutes and you're thinking

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:15.840
 God the trailers they go for ages this day. I really like in trailers now they do this they've

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.360
 been doing it for a long time actually they show bits of movie that never make it to the final

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.840
 movie. Really? Yeah. So many movies though because they'll release a trailer while they're still

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.840
 cutting the movie and then a decision will be made when the final movie edit is happening we don't

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.560
 need that scene and then they just go that's fine. It doesn't matter that it's in the trailer.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.880
 So like famously a lot of people know this about this particular movie but there's a movie called

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:43.440
 the Transporter or Transporter. Jason Statham. That's right. In the movie they did not include

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.160
 a classic scene in the trailer and it is a classic scene in the trailer where a missile is

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:56.480
 launched to Jason Statham and he deflects it using a T-Tray. He just smacks it out of the way

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.920
 like not interested. That's amazing. Why was that not put in the final film? Because Jason Statham

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.480
 I think said no one's going to believe this and so but it made that they filmed it like he didn't

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.560
 point that out before shooting it. He saw it in the script and went that's fantastic. But I continued

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:18.080
 reading. I found this on IMDB. I continued reading just movie trivia for that particular movie. Can I

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:25.600
 give you a couple? Yes please. Okay so one of them is that in the garage scene what was thought to be

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:32.480
 transmission oil was in fact molasses syrup. Jason Statham reported to be a very sticky situation.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:42.240
 And then underneath the T-Tray knocking the missiles away to facts below it says that Jason Statham

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:49.600
 did most of his own stunts. That's not a great. Weirdly there's an inventor of trailers. Didn't know

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:55.120
 that. Yeah very famously a guy called nils grandland and he made the first trailer and it was for a

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.440
 play called the pleasure secrets and it was in 1913. So he wanted people to come to the play so he

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.240
 thought he would shoot incidents from the play and they showed it and then they realized that this

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.840
 was a fantastic idea so they applied it to movies and he then made the first ever trailer for a movie

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.400
 which was for a trolley chaplain movie. Yeah so chaplain had the first ever trailer. Is it right that

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.480
 they're called trailers because they used to go after the movie? Yes. They used to trail the movie.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.720
 Exactly. They were trail the movie and get you excited about the next thing you could go and see.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.560
 And then presumably they stopped doing that because people just left. One of the things I find

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:32.640
 weird is that the director who's doing the film you're talking about wayberg is he's only ever done

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:38.880
 short films. So this is what I've extended. I call my next film. I love to mix out that in between

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:44.800
 that. He really is. I have attached all the short films to each other to make a mega film.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:50.960
 But the run-or-up. So the longest film ever until, well the current longest film ever because

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.240
 it's almost released yet. Yeah this one will be in the future. Yeah. It is modern times forever

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:04.080
 and it's finished film. It's 240 hours long and IMTB describes its plotliners. The ever-slow decay

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.600
 of Helsinki's store and so headquarters building. So that's what modern times forever is about.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:16.000
 It sounds really good film. Get a 6.4 on IMTB. It's how the headquarters are going to decay

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.120
 over the next few thousand years. I think they projected it onto the building itself didn't they?

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:27.120
 Oh did they? So you could kind of watch it happen as if it's happened. Oh wow. That's harsh as well.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.960
 That's harsh for the building. Well the building didn't mind. You like someone projecting your own

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.920
 gruesome death onto you or something. Yeah. As you just hang out in the street. That's true.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:43.120
 Okay so have you heard of Don Lefontein? No. Okay he is the man that he's dead now unfortunately but

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:50.560
 he was the one who is very famous for doing trailer voices. He's done more than 5000 film trailers

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:56.880
 and his famous catchphrases in a world. Yeah. Because there was a film that satirized that

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:04.160
 wasn't there. Oh yeah yeah with Lake Bell. Yes. In our world. That's so cool. Yeah he was a really

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:10.800
 really amazing guy. His voice cracked at the age of 13 mid-sentence. His final role on television

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:17.200
 was in the Phineas and the Ferb episode, The Chronicles of Meep. And he says the final line he ever

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:26.000
 said which was in a world there. I said it. Happy. Oh really? This is a really cool. This is a thing

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.760
 that almost predates. In fact it definitely predates film. It's a kind of early version of a movie.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:39.040
 It's so fantastic. It was a 19th century showman. His name was John Banvert and he invented this show

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:48.240
 which consisted of 1,320 foot long painting of the Mississippi. It was a mural and it was on two

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:54.400
 spindles like a VHS cassette. So at the start of the show it was all on one spindle and then you

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.760
 pull it across to the other spindle and you start winding the other one round and it pulls it across

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:04.800
 like a tape, like a videotape, but it shows this moving panorama of the river and he would do a show

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.120
 for about you know for two hours telling stories about what was on the river and his wife played

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.720
 music as it went and he was telling you know adventure stories and all the things that were happening.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.480
 Was there stuff on the river like pictures of boats and things? I think so. Yeah yeah exactly.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:22.240
 I think it wasn't just muddy. I think it wasn't just water for two hours and one thousand feet.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.800
 But isn't that amazing. It was an incredible long panorama and it was basically a very very early

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:32.640
 proto film. When was that? Did you say? That was in the mid-19th century. So you know 50 years before

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.040
 Blumia and Maddie. I remember reading about him in a book called Banvert's Folly. Have you heard of

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.920
 that? No. Not much more to say about it apart from everyone should read it because it is a brilliant

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.720
 book. It's just about famous people from history who are famous at the time but then they've been

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:52.960
 completely forgotten. Oh wow. That sounds awesome. Such a great book. That's really cool. Yeah. Who

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.280
 was Ben Fard? He was the guy who was talking about it. I've been talking about him for a minute.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:04.560
 Have you? Also yeah. How to go. Oh it's not great. Okay so before they had the talkies they had

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:11.040
 the silent films and there was one patent that I found for the idea of getting the dialogue across

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.920
 without being able to have the sound. Yep. And that was to have speech bubbles that came out of

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:23.760
 acts as mouths like a party blower. Wow. So if you wanted to say good evening Mr. Shriver then I would

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.000
 blow this party bubble and you'd be able to see the words and then it would come back and then you'd

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.800
 say oh nice the mutual was dark. That is so I've never heard of that. That's fantastic. That's amazing.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:38.800
 That would be really cool. They never did it but it was a patent. I love that. In some way in

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.680
 some alternative universe that is still how we're doing it. Yeah. That's the only difference

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:48.880
 between this universe and that one. Because it was tried and it was just so good. It's so much fun

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.520
 to watch. That's how all news reading is done. Yeah. Because it lightens bad news doesn't it?

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.960
 So no one took it seriously. That's true. So what the actors and the actors would have to pause,

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.760
 put it out of their pocket, put it in them, make sure they get the right one. And also you'd run out

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:08.320
 of puff very fast. Yeah. After a while you'd be. Yeah. For a for a monologue. Now is the

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:16.160
 winter of our discontent. One of the great silent film directors of the 1920s was this guy called

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:22.480
 Eric von Stroheim. And I really like him because have you guys seen Sunset Boulevard? Yes. You have it.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.560
 So he's yeah me too. So he is the main character in that. He wasn't really an actor but he was a

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.480
 director in the silent film generation. Sunset Boulevard is all about the decline of silent films

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:35.040
 about this woman who's you know as big in the silent film age and her downfall and her servant is

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:40.000
 played by this huge director and it always feels really poignant when you watch it because it's

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.360
 actually about his decline and his demise. But what I also quite like about Eric von Stroheim is that

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:53.200
 he created the best film ever made apparently in 1924 in 1924. So not many films. But it's called

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:59.840
 Greed and it was another long one. So it was eight hours long and it was only watched by 12 people

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:05.600
 in the end and most of those 12 people yeah because as well as by 12 people and then people decided

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.840
 people aren't going to go and see this. So it was edited down by his producers and he was really

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.400
 angry about that and they've lost the original eight hour film reel but apparently this is the

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:20.560
 holy grail of like movie reels. This is the greatest film ever made according to those 12 people.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:26.000
 Wow that's great. So where has it gone like literally no one knows if we knew that then it wouldn't

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:38.240
 be the holy grail. So where is the holy grail? I have a weird sort of this isn't really related but

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:44.560
 it's to do with missing film as well. Which is a holy grail of missing film as well. When Mallory was

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.480
 found on Everest because they found his body. The big hope was that they were going to find on him

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.960
 his camera. Didn't have his camera on there. Does that prove what he'd been to the top on up?

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.680
 The idea is if they made it there they would have just taken a photo that was the hope and they could

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.280
 have seen on the camera they might have found there were no photos but the idea is maybe it was he

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:07.280
 didn't have the camera on him which means that Irvin who's the other missing one of the two of Mallory

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:12.080
 and Irvin was up there. He must have the camera on him and Kodak have said because of the way and

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.480
 the nature of the height and the coldness that's going on that if that film is still out there it can

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.240
 still be developed but only for a few more years. So they're desperately trying to find it because

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.080
 it may hold the answer to whether or not they got up there. We've got to get out there. But it's

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:30.480
 an amazing because that's from the 20s like that's built in obsolescence and technology these days

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:35.360
 where they say it'll definitely run out after 90 years. I'm really sick of it. Yeah. If anyone's ever

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.960
 been up to the top of Everest and not taking a photo. I bet it's so cold and uncomfortable and you

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.920
 got to take your gloves off. I would take a photo of my thumb. That's what I'd do. Oh yes it's my

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:53.440
 thumb at the top of Everest. Thumbs up. Thumbs down. No one is cranked up to me. Yes.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:34:00.320
 Tripiviser, two stars. Hillary when he got up there he took a piss. So I'm just saying he got

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.640
 something out straight away. Okay. Despite the cold. He didn't take a photo of it.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:18.720
 Well that was a little trip. Okay time for our final fact of the show and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.840
 My fact actually this comes from we did a live show in Brussels a while ago and someone from the audience

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.280
 volunteered this fact and it was so fantastic that I wrote it in my files and I've only just

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:33.600
 rediscovered it. So this is the fact. It's that in the middle ages lots of churches had statues of

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.320
 Jesus which had moving arms so that he could be taken down from the cross and carried around the

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.720
 church and there were other statues which had the Virgin Mary with a working belly and you could

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:49.440
 take out a model of the infant Christ. So these were four ceremonies in churches. So things like

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:54.000
 Easter, good Friday you'd have the model of the Christ on the cross and you'd take it down and you

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.400
 carry it to a version of his tomb for example. So the arms had to be fold downable so that you could

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:05.200
 move him and carry him and there is an incredible I think it's a book on this it's about 300 pages

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.640
 long it's huge it's called animated sculptures of the crucified Christ and it's incredible scholarly

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:16.480
 work which you know it's every single one all across the world there are 126 which exist still

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:22.480
 the vast majority were made between 1419 and 1530 it's as though they became huge and then

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:31.280
 immediately disappeared yeah most of words like Pogs like when Pogs used in Easter to represent

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.640
 the crucified Christ yeah. There's that really gruesome statue in Mexico isn't there which is a

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:42.640
 statue of Jesus and he's covered in blood and stuff and it's when he's just been crucified and

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.680
 they recently did an x-way of it and they realized that his teeth are real human teeth whoa and we

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.320
 don't know why it's really disgusting it like human size Dodgers you have a massive mouth

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:59.920
 what human is he like a tiny dog Jesus. He's life size humanity probably is life size. He's life

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:05.600
 size yeah he's normal human size and he's yeah it's a grotesque statue but why are the human incisors

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:11.680
 in it? I read about that and supposedly it was a custom a few centuries ago to donate body parts

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:17.040
 of yours not for science but for religion. You donate them to the church so you could have like

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:22.160
 a statue of Jesus with lots of different body parts from different people. I don't think that was

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.520
 ever done because that's incredibly gruesome although this teeth one is real yeah and it was yeah

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.200
 it was 18th century and I think they were donated by people as a way of showing their gratitude to

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.960
 Christ. So what other ways could you give your body to? So people would give their own hair and

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:42.320
 that could be used as sort of wigs and things like that. Another statue of the baby Jesus has

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:50.320
 rabbit teeth in it. It's really peculiar. What's it Jesus has got these two buck teeth. What's up

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:57.200
 God. So some of these other ones that were in churches in the Middle Ages some of them are

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:03.200
 movable arms as I say. Some of them had mechanisms to open and close Christ's eyes. Wow yeah and

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.160
 some of them were quite detailed and sort of advanced in terms of modeling and puppetry. Just

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:14.320
 and a curiosity is this like an early action man like is that would that have inspired how toys move?

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:21.040
 Well okay it's not as silly as it sounds because early Mary Annette were based on the Virgin Mary.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:26.560
 Is that why they call Mary Annette? Yes the Mary Annette comes from little Mary because it was a

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:32.240
 model of the Virgin Mary which was used in devotional plays to show to teach children about religion

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:37.600
 basically and some grownups. Yeah so depictions of Jesus. Yeah so early depictions of Jesus is quite

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.160
 interesting because in the very early days people were very effe about depicting him as a person

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:48.080
 because it was thought of being idolatrous and that was a no-no. So he was shown as a fifth. He was

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:56.080
 shown as a fish. As a sif. He was shown as a fish because you know Iqthus was the the acronym that

00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:01.440
 they used is that right? It was an old way of Catholics talking to each other about fallacies and

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.360
 yeah supposedly you draw a fish and that was the sign that you were saying that someone else dotted

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.680
 the eye that was the sign they were a christian and then you could talk properly you know. And in some

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:17.120
 depictions of Jesus these are about fifth century AD he has a magic wand. Oh wow. Is that all his

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:21.680
 miracles? No no no it's not. He uses it to turn the water to wine and to raise Lazarus from the

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:26.960
 dead and to create the loaves and the fishes. That's so cool. You know years ago James was telling me

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:33.200
 that there were lost gospels and within those one of them Jesus fights a dragon. Yeah they're called

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:40.720
 the infancy gospels and they're like gospels which were written around the time of today's

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:47.040
 gospels but they were never used in the official Matthew, Matthew, and John kind of thing. There is one

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:54.400
 where he kills dragons another one where he explodes snakes and another one where he kills a boy who

00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:00.640
 accidentally brushed against him. Wow. These sound much more exciting. Why weren't these the guys

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.440
 that were being published? They were disappointed. They sounded a bit like young Jesus adventures.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.360
 You know you get young Indiana Jones and young James Bond things. Yeah. It sounded a bit like the

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:17.440
 adventures of young fiction. The idea I think is that he does like slightly that with the child

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:22.160
 brushing against him I think the idea is that he started and he was quite angry but then eventually

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:27.440
 turned into a good peaceful person. I think that's the transformation. But you can see why those were not

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.680
 sort of turned into proper gospel doctrine. I can see why they left the dragon ones out. Yeah.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:37.440
 Yeah. The censorship is what that was really wasn't it? I think this is cool speaking of statues.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:42.960
 The Statue of David, Michelangelo Statue of David, three of the four turtles were involved in

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:51.600
 the making of it. Leonardo Michelangelo, Donatello. Yes. So Raphael wasn't involved. Where was Splinter

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:57.040
 over all of this? It's such a good guy. He was master mining the whole thing. So the Statue of David

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.040
 was commissioned about 100 years before it was actually built and Donatello was one on the sort of

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.800
 committee that decided to be built and his students had some attempts and they cocked it up. And

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:10.880
 eventually there was a sort of people applied to be the one who got to design the Statue of David

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:17.280
 and Leonardo Da Vinci was considered but rejected and Michelangelo was accepted and he made it in two

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:23.040
 years and everyone agreed it was this masterpiece but I quite enjoy that. That is totally awesome.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:29.680
 Except Leonardo wasn't like that because there was a committee that had to decide where to put it.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.680
 So at the moment it's outside the huge entrance of the Duomo Cathedral in Florence,

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.840
 really prone in place. And the committee decided to put it there but Leonardo Da Vinci was on

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:43.360
 that committee and he suggested that they put it in a little niche on the side of a much less

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.760
 well-known building where it would be completely obscured because I'm guessing a little bit of

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:54.480
 professional jealousy. Yeah, it must be right. That's great. I was looking into a statue that I've

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.960
 known since childhood which has been a famous one for me. Do you remember when Michael Jackson released

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:04.560
 his history album and he made that there was huge giant statues of himself? Do you remember?

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:11.120
 I don't know but okay yeah yeah. So they made 10 massive statues of Michael Jackson which we

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:15.040
 came to see in them. Yeah it became the cover and it was on the Thames. They floated it through the

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.640
 Thames and I mean it was it's anyone except you know. Well I hope they got permission from the

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:30.800
 Port of London Authority. So I was just looking at water slides. I was just looking into it like where

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:36.640
 because there was a huge I think there were like 30 feet high where have they gone and nine of them

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:46.080
 we don't know where they've gone which is really interesting. We do know where one is it's at the best

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:52.000
 McDonald's which is... Is that a personal opinion? No it's actually a town called Best

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:03.280
 that boarded and so they're by town of worst and in between the two second best. So it stands currently

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:09.040
 at McDonald's best parking lot and it's become a big gathering place for Michael Jackson fans and

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.560
 actually I've got slightly wrong there are two that are known of that still exist. The other one

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:18.000
 the pedestal that they made to put Michael Jackson on was using all of the statue stones from a very

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.040
 famous Stalin monument called the Q from Meet. Do you remember that it was that extraordinary famous

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:28.640
 Stalin monument about... I think it had another one you mean? Yeah it's it's if you if you google Stalin

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.200
 monument it's incredibly famous and they use that to make a thing for Michael Jackson stand on.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:39.680
 Did you guys read about the Ottoman statue taking a selfie? What? There was a statue that was

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.480
 recently erected it was in the city of Amacia. Amacia I don't know if I pronounced that anyway it's

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:50.880
 on the black sea and it was a statue of an old Ottoman prince and he's taking a selfie of himself

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.520
 with his smartphone and I guess it's supposed to represent the glory of Ottoman princes and also

00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.000
 meant to be a bit hip and down at the times. It's not that great because people were really angry

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:09.360
 about it and thought that it kind of demeaned the Ottoman. So they within 24 hours of the statue being

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:15.920
 put up they've broken off his smartphone and most of his sword it's been destroyed. There was a thing

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.320
 though there was a there was a trend of taking photos because you know how ancient statues often

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:25.440
 stretching out a hand. Yeah there's a trend for taking photos in that position to show what the

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:30.720
 selfie of the statue looks like. Yeah that's a good trend it's a great trend. What's on the people?

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:35.440
 Did you guys read about the 45 foot statue of Pope John Paul that was commissioned by

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:42.960
 this guy called Lezek Leisen and basically he this guy saved the life of his own son who was

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.880
 who fell into a lake when they were on holiday in Croatia I think we'll fall into the sea and he

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:52.560
 decided that that was thanks to the Pope and so he commissioned and paid for a 45 foot tool

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:59.280
 fiberglass bright white statue of Pope John Paul II to be erected and he's disgusting.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:04.640
 Why do you think it was thanks to the Pope? Because I guess it's God and the Pope is the Pope.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.560
 The Pope's the Pope sort of came to him and his hour of need and gave him the courage to save his son.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.880
 Yeah I guess so. I mean I think he should give himself more credit but I like it so another

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.520
 issue said yeah but you can imagine the headlines. Local dickhead builds statue of himself

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:24.320
 after saving son from drowning. He should do that more in local papers.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:34.880
