00:00:10,00:00:16,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:20,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Adelaide.
00:00:20,00:00:24,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:24,00:00:26,My name is Darren Shriver.
00:00:26,00:00:29,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:29,00:00:31,and James Harkin.
00:00:31,00:00:33,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:33,00:00:36,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:36,00:00:39,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:42,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:42,00:00:45,"Okay, my fact this week is that during World War I,"
00:00:45,00:00:50,Australia invented a hand grenade that was shaped like a boomerang.
00:00:50,00:00:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:00:53,00:00:56,Now. Now.
00:00:56,00:00:58,Can I ask the obvious question?
00:00:58,00:00:59,Yeah.
00:00:59,00:01:01,Did it come back?
00:01:01,00:01:03,"Well, it depends how you threw it."
00:01:03,00:01:04,"Right, okay."
00:01:04,00:01:05,Depends how good you were at throwing it.
00:01:05,00:01:06,Right.
00:01:06,00:01:10,"I think mainly it was to get people who were around the corner,"
00:01:10,00:01:14,"or let's say there was a high wall, you could throw it,"
00:01:14,00:01:18,"and then run, and then it would come and hit the people behind the wall."
00:01:18,00:01:19,Right.
00:01:19,00:01:22,I should say it was never used in the world.
00:01:22,00:01:23,"Oh, really?"
00:01:23,00:01:25,But it was invented.
00:01:25,00:01:27,"This one that's on the screen that we can see,"
00:01:27,00:01:30,it's in the Auckland War Memorial Museum.
00:01:30,00:01:32,So it was that one that went but didn't come back
00:01:32,00:01:33,if it's in New Zealand?
00:01:33,00:01:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:35,00:01:37,Were we at war with New Zealand in World War I?
00:01:37,00:01:39,I imagine it was used as a test.
00:01:39,00:01:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:41,00:01:45,"So it was tried out, and this was in 1915."
00:01:45,00:01:48,And one of the people who was there at the tryout
00:01:48,00:01:50,was a guy called Colonel Dengar.
00:01:50,00:01:53,"And when they did the first trial, he said,"
00:01:53,00:01:55,"""Dad, let's donish the turks."""
00:01:55,00:01:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:57,00:02:00,"What's amazing is the one that we have on the screen here,"
00:02:00,00:02:03,"if you were describing it, it's a leather item,"
00:02:03,00:02:08,"and it's got embossed on it in the leather, an emu, and a kangaroo,"
00:02:08,00:02:10,in case you didn't know what nation.
00:02:10,00:02:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:11,00:02:14,"And it's got the words, ""Some worries across the top."""
00:02:14,00:02:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:17,00:02:20,But the amazing thing is this one that we've got here
00:02:20,00:02:22,is not the only one.
00:02:22,00:02:25,"There's an online forum called Great War Forum,"
00:02:25,00:02:27,"and they found out about this as well,"
00:02:27,00:02:29,"and they went to look for other ones,"
00:02:29,00:02:31,and they found loads of other ones.
00:02:31,00:02:33,"So there was one invented in the UK,"
00:02:33,00:02:35,"which had a hinge in its middle,"
00:02:35,00:02:37,"so sometimes you could make it come back,"
00:02:37,00:02:39,and sometimes you could make it fly straight.
00:02:39,00:02:41,"And that one had knife-like edges,"
00:02:41,00:02:43,"so that if you threw it at the enemy,"
00:02:43,00:02:45,"they couldn't catch it and throw it back,"
00:02:45,00:02:47,and there was one...
00:02:47,00:02:49,"That's unsporting, so just to say."
00:02:49,00:02:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:50,00:02:52,There was one that was in Melbourne
00:02:52,00:02:54,"that was shown to the Army Intentions Board,"
00:02:54,00:02:56,and it was a professional boomerang thrower
00:02:56,00:02:58,"who threw it to show them,"
00:02:58,00:03:01,and he managed to land it on a piece of paper 140 yards away.
00:03:01,00:03:02,What?
00:03:02,00:03:04,"This boomerang, because I think boomerangs"
00:03:04,00:03:06,"are just really good for throwing, aren't they?"
00:03:06,00:03:09,"For that kind of accuracy, sorry, that feels..."
00:03:09,00:03:11,"Well, he was a pro, what can I say?"
00:03:11,00:03:14,It also doesn't say how big the piece of paper was.
00:03:14,00:03:17,Or how many goes he had.
00:03:17,00:03:18,Yes.
00:03:18,00:03:20,"It was actually A6, so well done."
00:03:20,00:03:22,But one of the reasons that it didn't happen
00:03:22,00:03:24,"is because it is difficult to throw a boomerang,"
00:03:24,00:03:26,"and even if you know how to do it,"
00:03:26,00:03:29,"two soldiers are always going to throw it slightly differently,"
00:03:29,00:03:32,so it's very different thing to regulate.
00:03:32,00:03:35,I can't get past this guy who landed a boomerang
00:03:35,00:03:37,on a piece of paper 120.
00:03:37,00:03:40,"I imagine it was a total fluke, it landed,"
00:03:40,00:03:42,"and he turned to the troops and went,"
00:03:42,00:03:45,"""Easy peasy,"" and then went back home and said to his wife,"
00:03:45,00:03:48,"""You will not believe what happened."""
00:03:48,00:03:50,"I've just remembered, I found his name on my notes,"
00:03:50,00:03:52,"he was called Frank Donnellan,"
00:03:52,00:03:54,and he was a famous boomerang thrower in the 1950s.
00:03:54,00:03:56,That was for World War II that he was...
00:03:56,00:03:57,"Ah, OK."
00:03:57,00:03:59,"When you think grenade,"
00:03:59,00:04:02,I imagine a lot of people think of the sort of pomegranate-shaped thing
00:04:02,00:04:04,with the lumps all over it.
00:04:04,00:04:06,"It's green, it's got the handle, it's got the pin,"
00:04:06,00:04:07,it's got all of that.
00:04:07,00:04:10,"That is basically all thanks to one man called William Mills,"
00:04:10,00:04:13,"who had the first grenade, which became classic."
00:04:13,00:04:17,"And he was knighted, because it was a very successful invention,"
00:04:17,00:04:19,"it was rolled out everywhere, he was knighted."
00:04:19,00:04:22,"His coat of arms in 1922, when he was knighted,"
00:04:22,00:04:24,had four hand grenades on it.
00:04:24,00:04:28,It's very weird seeing something that modern on a coat of arms.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"But it was so necessary, because before then,"
00:04:30,00:04:34,"it was all cans on a stick, was the basic shape of a grenade."
00:04:34,00:04:36,It was a canned stick.
00:04:36,00:04:38,"And often they would bounce off the edge of the trench,"
00:04:38,00:04:40,"so they were really ungainly, they were really hard to use,"
00:04:40,00:04:42,and they weren't built for...
00:04:42,00:04:44,"They weren't built like something that people had practiced throwing,"
00:04:44,00:04:46,"like a ball, or whatever it might be."
00:04:46,00:04:48,They are then named after pomegranates.
00:04:48,00:04:50,That's why they have a similar name.
00:04:50,00:04:51,Really?
00:04:51,00:04:52,"Yeah, yeah."
00:04:52,00:04:55,"So the Russian for ""grenade"" is ""grenata"","
00:04:55,00:04:57,"and the Russian for ""pomegranate"" is ""grenat""."
00:04:57,00:05:00,And that was a problem for one Russian-speaking man
00:05:00,00:05:02,"in a Portuguese bar in 2023,"
00:05:02,00:05:04,"who wanted to ask for pomegranate juice,"
00:05:04,00:05:07,and found himself handcuffed and surrounded by armed police.
00:05:07,00:05:08,(LAUGHTER)
00:05:08,00:05:11,I just want to know at what point the people in that restaurant
00:05:11,00:05:12,thought we'd fucks up here.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"A, why is he asking us for a grenade?"
00:05:15,00:05:16,Is that what you would do?
00:05:16,00:05:18,"That's the opposite of a threat, isn't it?"
00:05:18,00:05:19,Exactly.
00:05:19,00:05:21,"B, he's sitting there saying,"
00:05:21,00:05:23,"""What's going on? The police are on their way."""
00:05:23,00:05:25,He's pointing at the pomegranate juice.
00:05:25,00:05:26,Surely.
00:05:26,00:05:28,I am addicted to silly grenades.
00:05:28,00:05:29,Silly things that have happened.
00:05:29,00:05:32,"It's either always someone finding a grenade and thinking,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,"""Well, this looks like a rock."""
00:05:34,00:05:37,Or there was someone recently on the Isle of Wight in the UK
00:05:37,00:05:40,who brought back a lovely old fossil from the beach
00:05:40,00:05:43,and caused the entire resort to be evacuated
00:05:43,00:05:45,because it was an old hand grenade.
00:05:45,00:05:48,I think my favourite one of these is in 2016.
00:05:48,00:05:50,"And, stupidly, I didn't write down the country."
00:05:50,00:05:52,"I think it was in India, but it might have been in Germany,"
00:05:52,00:05:53,so just watch that.
00:05:53,00:05:55,"Potato batata, right?"
00:05:55,00:05:59,It was a policeman who took a grenade to a courtroom
00:05:59,00:06:02,during a trial as a piece of evidence.
00:06:02,00:06:05,And he was trying to demonstrate how the grenade was detonated.
00:06:05,00:06:07,And what he was trying to show
00:06:07,00:06:09,"was that, contrary to the defendant's assertion"
00:06:09,00:06:12,"that it was a very complicated thing to set off,"
00:06:12,00:06:15,it was actually incredibly simple to use.
00:06:15,00:06:17,He assured the court that it had been safely disarmed
00:06:17,00:06:19,"before accidentally detonating it,"
00:06:19,00:06:22,like knocking the judge off his chair.
00:06:22,00:06:24,Is that all that happened?
00:06:24,00:06:25,"Pretty much, yeah."
00:06:25,00:06:28,It's like his wig fell off.
00:06:28,00:06:31,"Fortunately, it wasn't bad."
00:06:31,00:06:34,It was the country cartoon world.
00:06:34,00:06:38,There was a guy in China who was in his small village
00:06:38,00:06:40,and the police went around with leaflets
00:06:40,00:06:42,talking about unclaimed grenades
00:06:42,00:06:44,that were still out in the wild.
00:06:44,00:06:46,And he freaked out because he suddenly realised
00:06:46,00:06:49,the thing that was in the picture was what he had been using
00:06:49,00:06:52,"to crack nuts, like walnuts and stuff,"
00:06:52,00:06:56,"but not just recently, for 25 years,"
00:06:56,00:06:58,it was his nutcracker.
00:06:58,00:07:00,And he freaked out and they took it away
00:07:00,00:07:03,and they didn't know at least at the time of this reporting
00:07:03,00:07:06,whether it had been disarmed or not.
00:07:06,00:07:08,"I suppose as long as you don't crack your nuts in a fire,"
00:07:08,00:07:10,"then you're safe, aren't you?"
00:07:10,00:07:12,"That's the thing, just try not to like them."
00:07:12,00:07:15,"China, of course, being the place that invented grenades"
00:07:15,00:07:18,"way before the rest of us, like all of that kind of war stuff,"
00:07:18,00:07:21,but they had the earliest version from at least the 12th century
00:07:21,00:07:24,and they were called thundercrash bombs.
00:07:24,00:07:27,"And they were very cool, but also they were thrown mostly at sea"
00:07:27,00:07:29,from these paddle boats
00:07:29,00:07:32,where everyone would have a thundercrash bomb in their hands
00:07:32,00:07:35,"and you paddled the boat like a pedalo,"
00:07:35,00:07:37,so you had little treadmills instead of oars
00:07:37,00:07:39,and they'd all be treadmilling along.
00:07:39,00:07:43,That's so cool. Imagine a war when everyone's in like a swan-shaped pedalo.
00:07:43,00:07:45,That'd be so cool.
00:07:45,00:07:47,"I don't know which aquatic animal they were shaped like, actually,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,but it could have been.
00:07:49,00:07:53,"If the Aussies had a boomerang-shaped grenade,"
00:07:53,00:07:56,the American went also towards their stereotype
00:07:56,00:08:01,"and had a NFL football, a gridiron ball-shaped grenade"
00:08:01,00:08:03,that they trialed in the 1970s
00:08:03,00:08:06,and it largely wasn't a gridiron ball
00:08:06,00:08:09,that they just hollowed out and put the explosives in.
00:08:09,00:08:12,"They needed something that looked not like a grenade,"
00:08:12,00:08:14,"so if they were in trouble, the enemy would see,"
00:08:14,00:08:17,"""Oh, they've just got a bunch of NFL footballs around them,"""
00:08:17,00:08:19,and they would pick it up and be able to throw
00:08:19,00:08:22,"and they thought, because most American soldiers probably played NFL,"
00:08:22,00:08:24,they'd have a great understanding of accuracy.
00:08:24,00:08:26,"Some of them would have been wide receivers,"
00:08:26,00:08:29,"so some of them would have been trained to catch the ball,"
00:08:29,00:08:31,which I think could be a problem.
00:08:31,00:08:34,"Yeah, I think that was a problem because the result was,"
00:08:34,00:08:37,"as they say in quotes, ""unpredictable,"""
00:08:37,00:08:40,"and so it was never properly used, but that was a good one as well."
00:08:40,00:08:44,"That's cool. The British made some that were shaped like cricket balls,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,which is a sport that we play.
00:08:46,00:08:49,I don't know if you guys in Australia know that.
00:08:49,00:08:53,"So even if we lost the war, we'd at least have the moral victory."
00:08:53,00:08:55,(Laughter)
00:08:55,00:08:57,"This is sledging, isn't it?"
00:08:57,00:09:00,"That was self-sledging, really."
00:09:00,00:09:03,"You know, Grenadiers, Grenadiers,"
00:09:03,00:09:08,they obviously started as people who threw grenades in the 17th century
00:09:08,00:09:11,"and they pretty much stopped throwing grenades by the Napoleonic Wars,"
00:09:11,00:09:14,"so Grenadiers were only throwing grenades for about 100 years,"
00:09:14,00:09:17,but they've kept referring to people in the army who were super elite
00:09:17,00:09:19,"because you had to be the strongest,"
00:09:19,00:09:22,"you had to have amazing upper-body strength to throw those grenades,"
00:09:22,00:09:26,but you also famously had in Britain the tall mitre hats.
00:09:26,00:09:28,It looks a bit like the Pope's hat in my head.
00:09:28,00:09:30,"Well, yeah, the mitre is the name for a bishop's hat."
00:09:30,00:09:34,"Indeed, it looks much like that, but do you know why they had the tall hats?"
00:09:34,00:09:36,Deflection of grenades.
00:09:36,00:09:39,So people aimed for the top of their head and they knocked the hat off?
00:09:39,00:09:41,"That's very clever. Yeah, a good no."
00:09:41,00:09:43,(Laughter)
00:09:43,00:09:46,"They wanted to blend in in a group of bishops, maybe."
00:09:46,00:09:47,(Laughter)
00:09:47,00:09:50,There's a conclave happening and they just hide in there.
00:09:50,00:09:53,"All grenades were thrown from the Vatican, yes."
00:09:53,00:09:57,"No, it was because all other soldiers' hats at the time had rims,"
00:09:57,00:09:59,"but if you had to light a grenade, you're holding your rifle,"
00:09:59,00:10:01,and then suddenly you have to sling it over your shoulder
00:10:01,00:10:03,"in order to light the grenade with your match,"
00:10:03,00:10:05,"and when they were slinging it over their shoulder,"
00:10:05,00:10:08,"it kept getting caught on the brim of their hats and knocking their hats off,"
00:10:08,00:10:12,so they were given special dispensation to have hats without a brim.
00:10:12,00:10:14,I don't know why they then had to be super tall.
00:10:14,00:10:17,"You're making it sound like a Dunce's cap, basically, that people are aware of."
00:10:17,00:10:21,"You know Bayonets are invented by grenade throwers as well,"
00:10:21,00:10:23,"just because we were saying that,"
00:10:23,00:10:25,just because you had a grenade in one hand
00:10:25,00:10:27,"and you had your gun in the other hand,"
00:10:27,00:10:30,"but what if the enemy get close to you, you want a knife as well,"
00:10:30,00:10:33,"but they couldn't hold their knife because they didn't have enough hands,"
00:10:33,00:10:35,so they attached it to the end of the gun.
00:10:35,00:10:38,"As soon as you said that, I thought, ""Three armed soldiers."""
00:10:38,00:10:40,(Laughter)
00:10:40,00:10:42,That's how we got the three armed soldiers.
00:10:42,00:10:46,There's quite a famous boomerang that I think is in Adelaide at the moment.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"It certainly was for a while, which is..."
00:10:48,00:10:51,"There's a space museum here, isn't there, in Adelaide?"
00:10:51,00:10:53,Is that yes? Yeah.
00:10:53,00:10:55,And there's a boomerang that went up into space.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"Oh, that one's not there."
00:10:57,00:10:59,"That's in the South Australian Museum, because I saw it this morning."
00:10:59,00:11:01,"Oh, you saw it? Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:01,00:11:03,"Oh, wow. And so, yeah, it went to space,"
00:11:03,00:11:05,"and I don't know if it's the exact one,"
00:11:05,00:11:08,"but they showed that if you throw a boomerang into space,"
00:11:08,00:11:10,it still comes back to you.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"Oh, so it wasn't thrown... Sorry, it was an incredibly strong boomerang thrower"
00:11:13,00:11:15,who hurled it all the way up.
00:11:15,00:11:18,"He comes back home, ""Huddy, you're not going to believe what else I did!"""
00:11:18,00:11:20,(Laughter)
00:11:20,00:11:22,Get your telescope out now.
00:11:22,00:11:25,So that proved that a boomerang still works in space.
00:11:25,00:11:28,"And James, you studied physics, right?"
00:11:28,00:11:31,"Yeah, but don't ask me how that works, because it doesn't feel like it should."
00:11:31,00:11:33,"Yeah, because I'm curious if you..."
00:11:33,00:11:36,"OK, so one of the big problems with space travel"
00:11:36,00:11:39,is having enough fuel to get you back right.
00:11:39,00:11:42,And often we need to swing around planets and use their...
00:11:42,00:11:45,"Yeah, are you saying we should build our spaceships to look like boomerangs?"
00:11:45,00:11:48,"Shape like a boomerang, chuck them out into space."
00:11:48,00:11:50,Surely they return back to sender.
00:11:50,00:11:52,But... (Laughter)
00:11:52,00:11:55,"I mean, yes, obviously that would work."
00:11:55,00:11:57,"Yeah, yeah, but..."
00:11:57,00:11:59,We need to move on in the same place.
00:11:59,00:12:02,Can I tell you one more daft invention?
00:12:02,00:12:05,A military invention. This was the BE-9 plane.
00:12:05,00:12:08,"Again, early days of flight, like the First World War or pre."
00:12:08,00:12:10,"So, right, you're in your plane."
00:12:10,00:12:13,"It's all two-man planes of that, you know, one pilot and one gunner."
00:12:13,00:12:16,"Gunner traditionally sits behind the pilot, like shoots the gun behind."
00:12:16,00:12:18,"Right, you want to fire forward though,"
00:12:18,00:12:20,but the problem is you would shoot the propeller.
00:12:20,00:12:22,How do you solve it?
00:12:22,00:12:26,"Um, like back up to the enemy, so you can shoot that way."
00:12:26,00:12:27,Fly backwards.
00:12:27,00:12:28,"Yeah, reverse."
00:12:28,00:12:30,Yep. Good.
00:12:30,00:12:32,"I don't know, didn't they not..."
00:12:32,00:12:34,"I thought they shot between the blades, didn't they?"
00:12:34,00:12:36,They eventually worked out how to do that.
00:12:36,00:12:38,This was their previous solution.
00:12:38,00:12:41,We just put the gunner in front of the propeller.
00:12:41,00:12:44,"So, this plane was built and it flew."
00:12:44,00:12:47,"You've got a normal plane pilot, propeller on the front of the plane,"
00:12:47,00:12:51,"and then in front of him is this mad box with the gunner sitting,"
00:12:51,00:12:53,with his gun sitting out the front of it.
00:12:53,00:12:55,"Unfortunately, they cannot communicate at all."
00:12:55,00:12:58,They just can't talk to each other because the propeller's in the middle.
00:12:58,00:12:59,Right.
00:12:59,00:13:01,"So, they're just sort of stuck, not talking to each other."
00:13:01,00:13:03,They wouldn't need to. All that gunner's saying is...
00:13:05,00:13:08,And then it's a problem if he shits himself for the guy behind.
00:13:08,00:13:09,"Oh, God!"
00:13:09,00:13:17,"We are going to move on now to fact number two,"
00:13:17,00:13:19,and that is Anna.
00:13:19,00:13:23,"My fact this week is that the number four is two squared,"
00:13:23,00:13:25,"the number eight is two cubed,"
00:13:25,00:13:31,and the number 256 is two zenzi-zenzi-zenzigt.
00:13:31,00:13:33,Yeah. Bet you didn't know that.
00:13:33,00:13:36,"You thought at first my fact was going to be the number four is two squared,"
00:13:36,00:13:38,and you got worried.
00:13:38,00:13:40,"But yeah, zenzi-zenzi-zenzigt is a thing."
00:13:40,00:13:41,It's a great word.
00:13:41,00:13:43,It is. It's not a common word.
00:13:43,00:13:48,It was the word that was invented by a mathematician.
00:13:48,00:13:53,A Welsh mathematician called Robert Record in 1557
00:13:53,00:13:55,in a book The Whetstone of Witt.
00:13:55,00:13:58,"And he got annoyed because, you know,"
00:13:58,00:14:02,we didn't have any way of saying to the power eight that was easy.
00:14:02,00:14:05,"We've all struggled with that, so he said..."
00:14:05,00:14:07,Did he say when we would need it?
00:14:07,00:14:09,Like outside of deep math?
00:14:09,00:14:11,"Yeah, I don't think he imagined in the shop, you'd ask for."
00:14:11,00:14:14,"Can I have three zenzi-zenzi-zenzigt potatoes, please?"
00:14:14,00:14:15,No.
00:14:15,00:14:17,But in deep math.
00:14:17,00:14:21,"And so he said, well, zenzig was the German for squared at the time."
00:14:21,00:14:24,"So for the power four, something to the power four,"
00:14:24,00:14:28,"he said, let's say, zenzi-zenzigt, which is the square of squares,"
00:14:28,00:14:32,"the power six, well, that's obviously the square of a cube."
00:14:32,00:14:34,So it's zenzi-cubic.
00:14:34,00:14:36,"And then to the power eight, zenzi-zenzizendzigt."
00:14:36,00:14:40,"And if you really want to know, the power 16 is zenzi-zenzizendzizendzigt."
00:14:40,00:14:43,And I find that very useful to know.
00:14:43,00:14:46,"The power 16, he didn't write that down, did he?"
00:14:46,00:14:49,"It was someone else came along and went, oh, he could just add another zenzi."
00:14:49,00:14:50,"Oh, really?"
00:14:50,00:14:53,"He is an amazing guy, this Robert Record guy."
00:14:53,00:14:54,I've never heard of him before.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"I mean, why would you have done it?"
00:14:56,00:14:59,"He was a 16th century mathematician, but he was also a doctor."
00:14:59,00:15:01,And he wrote maths textbooks.
00:15:01,00:15:05,"And get this, he invented the equals sign."
00:15:05,00:15:08,"Oh, I feel that deserve more."
00:15:08,00:15:11,"You know what we mean, right?"
00:15:11,00:15:13,"You know, the equals sign."
00:15:13,00:15:15,"Wait, what did they..."
00:15:15,00:15:17,"Lovely, thank you."
00:15:17,00:15:20,"But just, I think, actually, if I just put that to the end,"
00:15:20,00:15:23,"I was like, wow, the people of Adelaide really love the equals sign."
00:15:23,00:15:27,"So what did we do before? Like, what were math tests like before?"
00:15:27,00:15:29,We used to write is equal to.
00:15:29,00:15:33,"Yeah, but in Latin, you had to write equalis, which is the Latin for is equal to."
00:15:33,00:15:37,"And so in his book, he says to avoid the tedious repetition of these words,"
00:15:37,00:15:41,"I will set, as I do often work, use a pair of parallels,"
00:15:41,00:15:44,because no two other things can be equal.
00:15:44,00:15:47,Two parallel lines is the most equal thing that you can get in the world
00:15:47,00:15:48,according to Robert Record.
00:15:48,00:15:49,It's so cool.
00:15:49,00:15:52,"But he loves the stuff. Like, he brought linear..."
00:15:52,00:15:55,"The words linear, denominate, binomial, equation."
00:15:55,00:15:58,"He came up with definitions for square, compound, rational number,"
00:15:58,00:16:00,irrational number in English.
00:16:00,00:16:02,He was the first to do all those things.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"And we don't really know about him,"
00:16:04,00:16:07,"because no one gives a shit about any of those words, is that?"
00:16:07,00:16:11,"I would say, like, to me, he's quite famous, someone who studied maths."
00:16:11,00:16:13,"OK, because I'd never heard of him."
00:16:13,00:16:15,"And maybe if you were a doctor as well,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,"because he also wrote loads of medical textbooks, including one called"
00:16:18,00:16:20,the Urinal of Physics.
00:16:20,00:16:21,The Urinal?
00:16:21,00:16:22,The Urinal of Physics.
00:16:22,00:16:24,"And like, physicists and physicians."
00:16:24,00:16:26,And it's about what doctors can learn from their patients urine.
00:16:26,00:16:27,Yeah?
00:16:27,00:16:28,So this was a...
00:16:28,00:16:29,I read... Did you read it?
00:16:29,00:16:30,I... No.
00:16:30,00:16:32,But you did?
00:16:32,00:16:33,I didn't actually read it.
00:16:33,00:16:36,"Well, I've just had some issues lately, so I wanted to take a shed of your light."
00:16:36,00:16:40,And he gives tips for collecting urine samples.
00:16:40,00:16:42,"And one of the things that confused me was, he said,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,"when you're as a patient collecting your sample to give to the doctor,"
00:16:44,00:16:47,make sure you don't just give the watery bit and throw away the dregs.
00:16:47,00:16:49,Because a lot of people do that.
00:16:49,00:16:52,And the dregs are an important part of the urine.
00:16:52,00:16:53,And I thought...
00:16:53,00:16:54,What are the dregs?
00:16:54,00:16:55,Dregs!
00:16:55,00:16:58,"Sorry, does everyone else have dregs in the bottom?"
00:16:58,00:17:01,"If you had a bladder stone, you might have dregs."
00:17:01,00:17:03,"Right, maybe they were very common back in the day."
00:17:03,00:17:07,"He said urine comes in three varieties, thick, thin and mean."
00:17:07,00:17:09,"Red, white and rosé."
00:17:09,00:17:13,Mean was a third one.
00:17:13,00:17:16,"Weirdly, mean is just the one in between thick and thin."
00:17:16,00:17:18,"I suppose it's like the mean, the average."
00:17:18,00:17:19,The average.
00:17:19,00:17:21,And it also has three levels.
00:17:21,00:17:25,"The ground, brackets, the sediment, the swim and the cloud."
00:17:25,00:17:26,Okay.
00:17:26,00:17:27,"Which is quite nice, isn't it?"
00:17:27,00:17:28,I sort of... I see that.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"Because it does have a little cloud, doesn't it, above it?"
00:17:30,00:17:31,Yeah.
00:17:31,00:17:32,Bubbles.
00:17:32,00:17:33,It's like foam.
00:17:33,00:17:34,"A bit of foam, yeah."
00:17:34,00:17:35,Foam?
00:17:35,00:17:37,Yours doesn't foam.
00:17:37,00:17:41,"Dan, get yourself to your urinal physician immediately."
00:17:41,00:17:42,Yeah.
00:17:42,00:17:45,It should have about an inch of foam on the top of it.
00:17:45,00:17:46,It might do.
00:17:46,00:17:49,It might be underneath all the dregs that I have floating on top.
00:17:49,00:17:52,"If you pour it slower, you don't get that amazing effect."
00:17:52,00:17:54,"So, yeah, you have to pour it at the right speed."
00:17:54,00:17:56,The toilet at an angle.
00:17:56,00:18:00,Did you guys know that four used to be five?
00:18:00,00:18:04,"So, one, two, three, five, four?"
00:18:04,00:18:05,Sort of.
00:18:05,00:18:07,"If you were reading it, that's what you think it would be."
00:18:07,00:18:08,Right.
00:18:08,00:18:12,Because Arabic numerals first came to Europe in the 10th century.
00:18:12,00:18:15,"And it's really cool if you look at charts of how they've all progressed,"
00:18:15,00:18:17,"the numbers one to ten, what they looked like."
00:18:17,00:18:20,"But basically, one, two, three, six, seven, eight, nine,"
00:18:20,00:18:24,throughout the years are vaguely recognizable as how we would write them today.
00:18:24,00:18:29,But then four was drawn like this weird curly B-shaped thing.
00:18:29,00:18:31,And five was just written as we'd write four.
00:18:31,00:18:34,And it was about 300 years that five was just written as four.
00:18:34,00:18:36,And then eventually they sort of swapped around.
00:18:36,00:18:41,"So, if you do go back in time about 500 years and someone writes down to you,"
00:18:41,00:18:44,that they have five children.
00:18:44,00:18:46,I know this is unlikely.
00:18:46,00:18:50,That's useful.
00:18:50,00:18:52,"Well, I'm trying to share some useful math tips."
00:18:52,00:18:54,I thought that was interesting.
00:18:54,00:18:58,"Dan was wondering before what used Zenziz-Zenzik could have,"
00:18:58,00:19:00,"like, two to the power of eight."
00:19:00,00:19:03,"Zenziz-Zenziz-Zenziz-Zenzik, the two to the power of sixteen,"
00:19:03,00:19:06,"that is 65,536."
00:19:06,00:19:08,"That is a very useful number to remember,"
00:19:08,00:19:14,because that is the maximum number of characters you can use for one message in WhatsApp.
00:19:14,00:19:15,Really?
00:19:15,00:19:16,Really?
00:19:16,00:19:17,Really?
00:19:17,00:19:18,How many?
00:19:18,00:19:19,"It's so high you've never reached it, right?"
00:19:19,00:19:20,Did you test it?
00:19:20,00:19:23,Did you just keep writing until you got to the limit?
00:19:23,00:19:26,Why do you think I sent you all those messages yesterday?
00:19:26,00:19:27,How many characters?
00:19:27,00:19:30,"65,536 characters."
00:19:30,00:19:31,That's not words.
00:19:31,00:19:32,Not words.
00:19:32,00:19:35,"Yeah, but it's effectively to a WhatsApp user,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"it's infinity because no one's ever going to reach it, right?"
00:19:37,00:19:40,"I don't know, I leave some pretty long messages, you guys have very noticed."
00:19:40,00:19:43,"I reckon I'm coming, I just think I'm scraping the ceiling of that."
00:19:43,00:19:46,"It'll be like Twitter eventually, they'll be pressurised to double it."
00:19:46,00:19:52,"Two to the power of 24, which is 16,777,216,"
00:19:52,00:19:56,is the number of unique colours you can see on most computer monitors.
00:19:56,00:20:00,"And two to the power of 32, which is just over four trillion,"
00:20:00,00:20:03,is the total number of possible IP addresses
00:20:03,00:20:05,under the original number of IP addresses.
00:20:05,00:20:06,Really?
00:20:06,00:20:07,Yeah.
00:20:07,00:20:08,It is useful.
00:20:08,00:20:14,"And two to the power of 136,279,841, minus one,"
00:20:14,00:20:19,"is the largest known prime number, which was found just a couple of weeks ago, I think."
00:20:19,00:20:21,"Well, maybe last week or, I'm not sure."
00:20:21,00:20:22,How did they find it?
00:20:22,00:20:24,"Well, there was a guy called Luke Durant,"
00:20:24,00:20:30,and he sort of borrowed a load of computers from around the world in 17 different countries
00:20:30,00:20:34,and got them all running this computer programme together to look for prime numbers.
00:20:34,00:20:35,"Oh, so it's beautiful."
00:20:35,00:20:37,"It's never just like this guy was counting,"
00:20:37,00:20:40,"and then he thought, ""Wait a minute."""
00:20:40,00:20:44,He just reached the limit of the WhatsApp.
00:20:44,00:20:48,"Did you guys see that mass news actually yesterday, which was,"
00:20:48,00:20:52,"you know that old adage that if you left enough monkeys with enough typewriters,"
00:20:52,00:20:53,they'd eventually type out the works of Shakespeare?
00:20:53,00:20:54,Yes.
00:20:54,00:20:58,Did you see that mathematicians have just worked out that they wouldn't?
00:20:58,00:21:02,"They worked out that if you got all the monkeys that we have,"
00:21:02,00:21:03,and all the monkey-like things...
00:21:03,00:21:05,"Yeah, but that's all the monkeys."
00:21:05,00:21:06,There aren't that many monkeys.
00:21:06,00:21:08,Isn't it infinite monkeys with infinite types?
00:21:08,00:21:09,It is infinite monkeys.
00:21:09,00:21:12,"Or is it, like, however many monkeys we have access to?"
00:21:12,00:21:13,"Yeah, do you know what..."
00:21:13,00:21:14,That's such a boring calculation.
00:21:14,00:21:16,It's quite interesting to know how many monkeys there are.
00:21:16,00:21:18,"These guys said, until the end of the universe,"
00:21:18,00:21:20,"as many monkeys as there will be,"
00:21:20,00:21:23,and said that it almost is a one in a million chance it would happen.
00:21:23,00:21:24,So you're right.
00:21:24,00:21:25,"With infinite, yeah."
00:21:25,00:21:26,Okay.
00:21:26,00:21:27,What would they come up with?
00:21:27,00:21:28,Because that's more interesting in a way.
00:21:28,00:21:29,"They said, ""Sure, sir."""
00:21:29,00:21:30,Probably.
00:21:32,00:21:35,Have you guys heard of the semiotic alliance?
00:21:35,00:21:36,"Oh, no."
00:21:36,00:21:37,This is kind of cool.
00:21:37,00:21:40,"I was reading about, you know, Alex Belos, the mathematician."
00:21:40,00:21:41,Yeah.
00:21:41,00:21:42,"He wrote a book about his adventures in math, basically."
00:21:42,00:21:44,"And he wrote about meeting this guy called Greg Rowland,"
00:21:44,00:21:46,who works at the semiotic alliance.
00:21:46,00:21:49,And he basically provides consultancy for companies
00:21:49,00:21:51,on what number they should have in their product name.
00:21:51,00:21:56,"So he says KFC, 11 herbs and spices, is perfect."
00:21:56,00:21:57,Oh.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"Like, 10 herbs and spices would be too dull and too round."
00:21:59,00:22:01,And 12 is too spicy.
00:22:01,00:22:02,It's much too spicy.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"And 11, perfect."
00:22:04,00:22:05,Levi 501.
00:22:05,00:22:06,Interesting.
00:22:06,00:22:09,"501, bit more than, like, Levi 500 is a bit mechanistic, isn't it?"
00:22:09,00:22:10,It's a bit dull.
00:22:10,00:22:11,Right.
00:22:11,00:22:13,And did he come up with these or are these just examples of...
00:22:13,00:22:15,He has consulted for various companies.
00:22:15,00:22:17,I don't know if he says which he's come up with or which he hasn't.
00:22:17,00:22:20,"But he says WD 40, that's good."
00:22:20,00:22:21,That's a reliable number.
00:22:21,00:22:25,"But that was actually his 40th attempt at making WD, whatever that is."
00:22:25,00:22:27,"What a displacement, 40th attempt."
00:22:27,00:22:28,That's what it does.
00:22:28,00:22:29,Right.
00:22:29,00:22:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:30,00:22:32,He just came up with a reliable number.
00:22:32,00:22:35,"It was actually his 39th and he thought, ""Fuck it, let's tip it over."""
00:22:35,00:22:36,Shit.
00:22:36,00:22:37,Why Andy?
00:22:37,00:22:39,Why did he say 40 doesn't need...
00:22:39,00:22:40,"Well, it's solid, isn't it?"
00:22:40,00:22:41,It's reliable.
00:22:41,00:22:42,"Right, okay."
00:22:42,00:22:43,"You know, you want a good product in your home."
00:22:43,00:22:46,"WD 37, fussy."
00:22:46,00:22:47,WD 40.
00:22:47,00:22:50,Because you're not looking something interesting and creative.
00:22:50,00:22:52,You're looking for something reliable and boring.
00:22:52,00:22:53,"Yeah, exactly."
00:22:53,00:22:54,"Nice, okay."
00:22:54,00:22:56,So I think there's a lot in this.
00:22:56,00:22:57,"Okay, yeah."
00:22:57,00:22:59,"I don't know about a lot, but there's something."
00:22:59,00:23:02,"Hey, can I ask a quick question of the crowd?"
00:23:02,00:23:07,We mentioned this on a show ages ago and I got a lot of people writing in saying that
00:23:07,00:23:08,this is not true.
00:23:08,00:23:14,"But supposedly a measurement, a unit of measurement, often in Australia, if it's really tight,"
00:23:14,00:23:19,"like if something like whisks past your ear, like it's that close, you describe that unit"
00:23:19,00:23:22,of distance as a bee's dick.
00:23:22,00:23:23,Yeah?
00:23:23,00:23:25,You would say that.
00:23:25,00:23:27,"You missed it by a bee's dick, mate."
00:23:27,00:23:28,"Oh, great."
00:23:28,00:23:31,"Because we said this on the show and I had a bunch of Aussies writing in saying,"
00:23:31,00:23:32,"""Never heard that, that's bullshit."""
00:23:32,00:23:35,"I can imagine every other city in Australia going,"
00:23:35,00:23:38,"""Yeah, but it's those guys in Adelaide, isn't it?"""
00:23:38,00:23:41,They've got very badly endowed bees in Adelaide.
00:23:41,00:23:43,We know that.
00:23:43,00:23:52,"It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:23:52,00:24:00,My fact this week is that Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 has been translated into over 30 languages
00:24:00,00:24:07,"under the same title, except in Denmark, where it was published as 233 Celsius."
00:24:07,00:24:17,"Yeah, so it was published in over 30 different languages and every single one had either a"
00:24:17,00:24:21,direct translation into the language or just used outright the title Fahrenheit 451.
00:24:21,00:24:22,That's cool.
00:24:22,00:24:23,Except for Denmark.
00:24:23,00:24:25,So do we know why the Danes did it?
00:24:25,00:24:27,"Because I thought it might have been because Celsius was Danish,"
00:24:27,00:24:28,but he was Swedish.
00:24:28,00:24:30,Wasn't he the guy who came up with the Celsius chart?
00:24:30,00:24:32,"Oh, and does Celsius?"
00:24:32,00:24:33,Celsius.
00:24:33,00:24:36,"Was it just because they thought our people will understand that better, maybe?"
00:24:36,00:24:39,"There's not an amazing amount of literature on what happened,"
00:24:39,00:24:40,and there's not many books as well.
00:24:40,00:24:43,"So when you go online, there's a few copies that you can see photos of"
00:24:43,00:24:45,and collectors desperately try to get in.
00:24:45,00:24:46,They all got burned.
00:24:46,00:24:47,That was a sad thing.
00:24:47,00:24:52,"Ironically, I think Ray Bradbury, from the little I could find,"
00:24:52,00:24:56,"did not like that this had this new title, and so they did effectively..."
00:24:56,00:24:57,Really?
00:24:57,00:24:59,"He didn't like any changes, did he?"
00:24:59,00:25:00,I think that was it.
00:25:00,00:25:03,"Like, every now and then, his book would get changed very slightly in America"
00:25:03,00:25:05,"or something like that, and he hated it."
00:25:05,00:25:07,"Yes, he hated the internet."
00:25:07,00:25:11,"He didn't want it published in e-book form, and he resisted for a long time."
00:25:11,00:25:14,"I think that's totally fair enough, given that the entire point of Fahrenheit 451"
00:25:14,00:25:19,"is that screens are really, really bad and totally ruin human society."
00:25:19,00:25:23,"I can empathise with him saying, ""Please don't turn my book into a bookie."""
00:25:23,00:25:27,"It's so amazing, because when you read it, like, because I re-read it on the plane over,"
00:25:27,00:25:31,"because I read it when I was younger, and the bit where they kind of explained the whole plot,"
00:25:31,00:25:34,"they might as well be saying, ""Tick-tock is shit."""
00:25:34,00:25:36,Do you know what I mean?
00:25:36,00:25:38,"Basically, it's like, ""All right, no one reads long things."
00:25:38,00:25:42,"Everyone wants shorter and shorter media, and no one's got a good attention span,"""
00:25:42,00:25:43,and all that kind of stuff.
00:25:43,00:25:44,Yeah.
00:25:44,00:25:46,It's a very good book. It's a brilliant book.
00:25:46,00:25:48,"Obviously, it's a classic."
00:25:48,00:25:53,It's great. He wrote it. I love this on a coin-operated typewriter.
00:25:53,00:25:58,"It's so cool. He wrote it in his local library at UCLA in California,"
00:25:58,00:26:00,"and he carried a little bag of loose change,"
00:26:00,00:26:02,"and if you put in ten cents, it would give you half an hour."
00:26:02,00:26:05,So it cost him $9.80 to write.
00:26:05,00:26:07,That's quite good.
00:26:07,00:26:11,"As a writer yourself, Andy, I don't know if you get writer's block,"
00:26:11,00:26:14,but do you think it would help you to churn out those words?
00:26:14,00:26:16,"I think it probably would, yeah."
00:26:16,00:26:18,I'll try anything at this point.
00:26:18,00:26:23,"Interestingly, churning out the words was a thing that he had a philosophy about."
00:26:23,00:26:26,So he had eventually his own typewriter at home.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"He left the library, and above his typewriter,"
00:26:29,00:26:31,"he would have the words ""don't think,"""
00:26:31,00:26:34,"and it was a reminder for him to feel the stories,"
00:26:34,00:26:39,as opposed to sit mulling on them and getting stuck into writer's block effectively.
00:26:39,00:26:40,That was his philosophy.
00:26:40,00:26:42,"And it certainly was what happened, wasn't it?"
00:26:42,00:26:44,"I think three of us might have read it on the fly,"
00:26:44,00:26:46,"but in the version that I read,"
00:26:46,00:26:48,"he writes an introduction and he talks about the process,"
00:26:48,00:26:52,"and he said, ""I didn't write the book, it wrote me."""
00:26:52,00:26:55,"And he said, ""The main character was the person who was speaking through me."
00:26:55,00:26:56,"It wasn't me speaking at all."""
00:26:56,00:26:58,And it's amazing him describing the process.
00:26:58,00:27:01,"For a guy who is famous for his words, it wrote me."
00:27:01,00:27:03,"Look, he's not a great writer."
00:27:03,00:27:05,"It wrote me. No, it didn't, buddy."
00:27:05,00:27:06,But he made a lot of weird claims.
00:27:06,00:27:07,So that's quite mystical.
00:27:07,00:27:09,A lot of authors do say that.
00:27:09,00:27:12,They say sometimes an idea is downloaded into their head
00:27:12,00:27:15,and they are merely a vessel for whatever came to them.
00:27:15,00:27:16,They channeled it.
00:27:16,00:27:19,"That's just because they plagiarized it from somewhere else, isn't it?"
00:27:19,00:27:21,"Oh, no, it just came from there."
00:27:21,00:27:23,I know it's quite similar to this.
00:27:23,00:27:26,But he also made odd claims.
00:27:26,00:27:30,"Like, he claims his memory was so good he remembers the moment of birth."
00:27:30,00:27:32,And he would always tell this at dinner parties.
00:27:32,00:27:34,"He would say, ""I remember being born."
00:27:34,00:27:36,"I remember coming out and being like,"
00:27:36,00:27:39,"'Hey, he has full recollection.'"""
00:27:39,00:27:42,"And people would say, ""No, you need to see a psychologist for it."""
00:27:42,00:27:45,"And he would, and he would tell them, and they couldn't dissuade him."
00:27:45,00:27:48,"He was saying, ""I remember. I remember being circumcised."
00:27:48,00:27:51,"Man, that was painful when I was six days old or whatever it was."""
00:27:51,00:27:52,Wow.
00:27:52,00:27:55,"Yeah, he had total recall of his life, according to him."
00:27:55,00:27:56,"Yeah, wow."
00:27:56,00:27:57,Pretty cool.
00:27:57,00:27:59,"He had good recall, probably, according to him again."
00:27:59,00:28:01,"He said while he was in the library,"
00:28:01,00:28:03,"he literally just tipped books down off the shelves,"
00:28:03,00:28:05,powered through them and remembered quotes.
00:28:05,00:28:07,"And, in fact, in Fahrenheit 451,"
00:28:07,00:28:09,"there's a bit without giving away the ending,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,"which assumes that once people have read a book,"
00:28:11,00:28:15,they can retain all of the words in it and then re-quote them at will.
00:28:15,00:28:16,Which is not true of me.
00:28:16,00:28:18,"People used to be able to do that, I'm sure."
00:28:18,00:28:20,There's a verbal recall of what you'd seen
00:28:20,00:28:24,was fantastic before mass literacy.
00:28:24,00:28:25,"So, in Shakespearean times,"
00:28:25,00:28:28,you would remember a lot more of a speech from a played scene.
00:28:28,00:28:30,"So, you would be able to go home from this show tonight"
00:28:30,00:28:33,"and just do, like, big bits of the show all over again."
00:28:33,00:28:34,Lucky you.
00:28:34,00:28:36,"Fahrenheit 451, by the way, which used to be called"
00:28:36,00:28:40,"Fahrenheit 541, when four and five used to be different numbers."
00:28:40,00:28:41,"Of course, yeah."
00:28:41,00:28:45,"Well, the good thing about 451 is that it's one more."
00:28:45,00:28:47,"Like, it's a high 450, very bad title."
00:28:47,00:28:49,"Very boring, workman-like."
00:28:49,00:28:52,"He did decide on the title because it sounded good, though."
00:28:52,00:28:54,"So, I'd like to know what Alex Bellos had to say,"
00:28:54,00:28:56,"because it was called ""The Fireman"" at first,"
00:28:56,00:28:58,"and his publisher said, ""Give it a better title."""
00:28:58,00:29:01,"And so, he called the local fire department, as you do,"
00:29:01,00:29:04,"and said, ""What temperature does paper burn at?"""
00:29:04,00:29:06,And they said it's 451 Fahrenheit.
00:29:06,00:29:08,"And so, he thought, ""That's a cool number."""
00:29:08,00:29:11,"But I wonder what number would have made him think, ""Nah."""
00:29:11,00:29:13,"Apparently, it doesn't burn at that."
00:29:13,00:29:14,"Yeah, I've heard that."
00:29:14,00:29:16,It depends on the type of paper and stuff.
00:29:16,00:29:17,"Right, I see."
00:29:17,00:29:19,"And it's off the top of his head, this poor fireman,"
00:29:19,00:29:21,and he's got fires to be putting out.
00:29:21,00:29:24,He's just said the first things that comes to him.
00:29:24,00:29:26,Do you guys want a little quiz of original titles for books
00:29:26,00:29:28,under which they should have been published?
00:29:28,00:29:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:29,00:29:30,Andy.
00:29:30,00:29:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:32,00:29:33,OK.
00:29:33,00:29:36,Let's say that's the jet lag talking.
00:29:36,00:29:39,We're going to do it anyway.
00:29:39,00:29:41,"""Les dents de la mer."""
00:29:41,00:29:43,"Oh, ""Les mers"" are rather blah, blah, blah."
00:29:43,00:29:44,No.
00:29:44,00:29:46,"""Les dents de la mer."""
00:29:46,00:29:47,The teeth of the sea.
00:29:47,00:29:48,Jaws.
00:29:48,00:29:49,Jaws.
00:29:49,00:29:50,Jaws.
00:29:50,00:29:51,Jaws.
00:29:51,00:29:52,"Wait, sorry."
00:29:52,00:29:54,That was the original title in the English language.
00:29:54,00:29:55,"No, it was probably to French."
00:29:55,00:29:56,Sorry.
00:29:56,00:29:57,"Someone said they were going to call it,"
00:29:57,00:29:58,"""What's that noshing on my leg?"""
00:29:58,00:30:00,That was his dad's suggestion.
00:30:00,00:30:02,His dad or his father-in-law said that's a good title
00:30:02,00:30:03,when he was struggling for it.
00:30:03,00:30:04,That is a good title.
00:30:04,00:30:05,"""Chocolate for breakfast."""
00:30:05,00:30:06,"This is quite guessable, I think."
00:30:06,00:30:07,"Oh, breakfast."
00:30:07,00:30:08,No.
00:30:08,00:30:09,Chocolate for breakfast.
00:30:09,00:30:10,Yeah.
00:30:10,00:30:12,"Who's a sort of stereotypically messy, crazy character?"
00:30:12,00:30:13,Willie Wonka.
00:30:13,00:30:15,And a good Charlie and the Chocolate.
00:30:15,00:30:16,No.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Chocolate for breakfast.
00:30:17,00:30:19,"Like, who's a classic, like, crazy protagonist"
00:30:19,00:30:21,who's always getting in scrapes?
00:30:21,00:30:22,Borat.
00:30:22,00:30:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:23,00:30:24,Yeah.
00:30:24,00:30:25,"Yeah, Borat the novel."
00:30:25,00:30:26,It's the novelisation of Borat.
00:30:26,00:30:27,And the novel came first.
00:30:27,00:30:28,Interestingly.
00:30:28,00:30:29,Everything happens in the film.
00:30:29,00:30:30,"I prefer the novel, actually."
00:30:30,00:30:31,Really?
00:30:31,00:30:33,"Yeah, I think it's more true to the character."
00:30:33,00:30:34,"For me, the stage show?"
00:30:34,00:30:36,"Yeah, the stage show is very good."
00:30:36,00:30:38,Is it just William?
00:30:38,00:30:40,It's Bridget Jones' diary.
00:30:40,00:30:42,"Sort of, you know, like, messy, messy character."
00:30:42,00:30:43,"OK, here's one."
00:30:43,00:30:44,Twilight.
00:30:44,00:30:45,Oh.
00:30:45,00:30:46,Oh.
00:30:46,00:30:48,"Well, Fifty Shades of Grey was based on Twilight."
00:30:48,00:30:49,Dracula.
00:30:49,00:30:50,Yes.
00:30:50,00:30:51,So good.
00:30:51,00:30:53,"No, it was William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury."
00:30:53,00:30:54,No.
00:30:54,00:30:55,It was called Twilight.
00:30:55,00:30:57,Twilight was originally called Forks.
00:30:57,00:30:59,But I couldn't find a novel that was originally called Forks
00:30:59,00:31:01,and changed to whatever the third one would be
00:31:01,00:31:03,to complete it.
00:31:03,00:31:06,"My favourite, just a super quick one on translations."
00:31:06,00:31:10,The Mexican title for the movie Grease is Vaselina.
00:31:10,00:31:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:13,00:31:15,So Temperatures.
00:31:15,00:31:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:16,00:31:17,"Fahrenheit, Celsius."
00:31:17,00:31:18,Yeah.
00:31:18,00:31:21,Sir Isaac Newton had his own version.
00:31:21,00:31:24,And it was a temperature scale that only went from 0 to 12.
00:31:24,00:31:27,And 0 was the freezing point of water.
00:31:27,00:31:32,And 12 was his body temperature on the middle of the month of July.
00:31:32,00:31:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:33,00:31:34,OK.
00:31:34,00:31:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:35,00:31:38,"And then he, like, he realised that this wasn't enough,"
00:31:38,00:31:40,"because you'd need to go higher than that, right?"
00:31:40,00:31:42,So then he added higher numbers.
00:31:42,00:31:43,So at 14--
00:31:43,00:31:45,We already had numbers higher than 12.
00:31:45,00:31:47,It's not like he had to-- he was like--
00:31:47,00:31:49,"Yeah, but he needed to define what they were"
00:31:49,00:31:50,"as the temperature, didn't he?"
00:31:50,00:31:53,"So, like, 14 was the greatest heat of a bath,"
00:31:53,00:31:55,which one can endure for some time
00:31:55,00:31:58,when his hand is dipped in and is kept in constant movement.
00:31:58,00:32:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:02,00:32:03,"Oh, that does help."
00:32:03,00:32:05,"Now that I'm picturing how I check a bath, that does--"
00:32:05,00:32:07,You're not meant to test it with your hand anyway.
00:32:07,00:32:08,You shouldn't be putting your hand in the bath.
00:32:08,00:32:09,What do you test it with?
00:32:09,00:32:10,Elbow.
00:32:10,00:32:11,Elbow.
00:32:11,00:32:13,"Which doesn't work, by the way, as any parent will tell you."
00:32:13,00:32:14,Yeah.
00:32:14,00:32:16,Thermometers used to be upside down.
00:32:16,00:32:19,And this was Celsius himself
00:32:19,00:32:22,"made his own thermometer upside down, idiot."
00:32:22,00:32:24,"It was just to make any sense in our minds, right?"
00:32:24,00:32:26,The boiling point of water was nought degrees
00:32:26,00:32:28,and the freezing point was 100.
00:32:28,00:32:29,And what we call today is a Celsius scale
00:32:29,00:32:32,because someone flipped it shortly afterwards.
00:32:32,00:32:34,"Linnaeus, in fact, flipped it."
00:32:34,00:32:36,"It was, but it was, yeah, I think two people suggested flipping it"
00:32:36,00:32:37,and he was one.
00:32:37,00:32:39,But I thought the reason that he did it upside down
00:32:39,00:32:41,was quite interesting and I didn't know.
00:32:41,00:32:45,And it was because he was also very involved
00:32:45,00:32:46,in measuring the brightness of stars
00:32:46,00:32:48,and he came up with a much more accurate way
00:32:48,00:32:50,to measure the brightness of stars.
00:32:50,00:32:52,And I didn't realise that we do that upside down.
00:32:52,00:32:56,So a star's magnitude is inversely proportional
00:32:56,00:32:57,to how bright it is.
00:32:57,00:33:00,So the brightest stars have the lowest magnitude.
00:33:00,00:33:02,"And that's literally just because Ptolemy,"
00:33:02,00:33:04,"you know, a thousand years earlier,"
00:33:04,00:33:05,had said that should be the case.
00:33:05,00:33:06,And so everyone copied him.
00:33:06,00:33:09,"And so Celsius was saying, OK, well, if stars,"
00:33:09,00:33:11,"you know, the brighter they are, the lower they are,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,then we'll do the same with everything else.
00:33:13,00:33:14,I like that.
00:33:14,00:33:15,I think it's fine.
00:33:15,00:33:17,"I think as long as we're not using Fahrenheit, it's fine."
00:33:17,00:33:20,I think Fahrenheit is such a stupid-- it's so stupid.
00:33:20,00:33:23,"No, but it's only America that is using Fahrenheit"
00:33:23,00:33:24,in any big way.
00:33:24,00:33:25,I think it's like a couple of other countries
00:33:25,00:33:26,that use Fahrenheit.
00:33:26,00:33:27,"I think Micronesia is still on Fahrenheit, to be fair."
00:33:27,00:33:28,Sure.
00:33:28,00:33:29,"But like, it's really bad."
00:33:29,00:33:32,And America has tried to change.
00:33:32,00:33:34,"Like, the French adopted Celsius partly"
00:33:34,00:33:35,because of the French Revolution.
00:33:35,00:33:37,Everything has to be sort of metricised
00:33:37,00:33:38,"and, you know, made rational on all of this."
00:33:38,00:33:40,"And America, they actually passed a law,"
00:33:40,00:33:42,"the Metric Conversion Act in 1975,"
00:33:42,00:33:44,which was beginning the process of metrification.
00:33:44,00:33:45,It was going to be great.
00:33:45,00:33:46,America was going to be sensible.
00:33:46,00:33:48,And no one wanted to do it.
00:33:48,00:33:50,And Ronald Reagan dismantled the board in 1982.
00:33:50,00:33:52,"Well, they made it voluntary, didn't they?"
00:33:52,00:33:54,Which is the one thing you're not supposed to do with the law.
00:33:54,00:33:57,"You can't say, ""Don't commit murder if you don't want to."""
00:33:57,00:33:59,And that was basically what they said.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"They were like, ""Change to Celsius if you want to,"
00:34:02,00:34:03,"""but don't if you don't."""
00:34:03,00:34:18,"So everyone was like, ""Well, I'm not going to then."""
00:34:18,00:34:22,"I just so did not expect that to be the answer to my question, just saying."
00:34:22,00:34:25,"I think they might have been there or thereabouts, basically."
00:34:25,00:34:26,Right.
00:34:26,00:34:28,"I'm going to have to move us on, guys."
00:34:28,00:34:29,Can I just quickly...
00:34:29,00:34:31,I feel like we haven't covered enough
00:34:31,00:34:32,the kind of guy Ray Bradby was.
00:34:32,00:34:33,"Oh, yeah, okay."
00:34:33,00:34:34,"I didn't massively warm him,"
00:34:34,00:34:36,"so I want to quickly tell you one thing about him,"
00:34:36,00:34:38,which is very representative.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"He was quite egotistical, which is clear when you read him."
00:34:41,00:34:43,He kind of thinks everyone's an idiot
00:34:43,00:34:45,"who is going to become braindead from TV,"
00:34:45,00:34:47,"except a few academics have gone to Cambridge,"
00:34:47,00:34:49,is one way of reading the book.
00:34:49,00:34:53,"And he said he was really unhappy a lot of times in his teens,"
00:34:53,00:34:56,because he didn't fit in a lot of the time.
00:34:56,00:35:00,"And he said, ""You pay a certain penalty for going your own way."
00:35:00,00:35:04,"You're not as popular with girls as you should be."""
00:35:04,00:35:09,I used to take my short stories to girls' homes and read them.
00:35:09,00:35:11,And they didn't want to hear about it.
00:35:11,00:35:14,They just wanted me to pour at them how pathetic is that.
00:35:14,00:35:18,And I just think a man who thinks the world is the problem
00:35:18,00:35:20,when he takes his short stories to a party
00:35:20,00:35:24,and reads them to a girl who doesn't like it is the problem.
00:35:24,00:35:25,Yeah.
00:35:25,00:35:27,"At the same time, when he died,"
00:35:27,00:35:29,he wanted his ashes to be sent to Mars in a soup can.
00:35:29,00:35:32,So that's like a fun guy to me.
00:35:32,00:35:33,OK.
00:35:33,00:35:42,"We need to head into our final fact, and that is Andy."
00:35:42,00:35:45,"My fact is that when young ants are sick,"
00:35:45,00:35:49,their mothers immediately eat them and recycle them into more ants.
00:35:49,00:35:50,Mmm.
00:35:50,00:35:51,There's no...
00:35:51,00:35:54,"There's no like, ""Oh, well, just go to sleep it off."""
00:35:54,00:35:56,"It's really like, ""Right, this happens now."""
00:35:56,00:35:59,"And it's because if an infection spreads through a hive,"
00:35:59,00:36:02,"it can be really dangerous, and there aren't many protections against it."
00:36:02,00:36:08,"And scientists tested this out by giving an ant queen a small fungal pathogen,"
00:36:08,00:36:12,and they would eat lots and lots and lots of infected larvae.
00:36:12,00:36:15,"Sorry, the larvae have been infected, and the ant queens just ate them,"
00:36:15,00:36:19,as well as 6% of controlled larvae which were not infected at all.
00:36:19,00:36:23,"And it's going to ask what a sick ant is like,"
00:36:23,00:36:25,but it funguses it.
00:36:25,00:36:28,"Yeah, exactly, if they just have a bit of this on them."
00:36:28,00:36:31,"And as soon as the queen ant finds a sick larvae, she just starts chomping."
00:36:31,00:36:33,"And the queen ants, which did this and ate them,"
00:36:33,00:36:35,then produced lots more eggs.
00:36:35,00:36:38,And it happens at the very first rifle.
00:36:38,00:36:40,And that is those.
00:36:40,00:36:44,"So it sounds sort of crazy and frankly uncoined, but..."
00:36:44,00:36:48,"I read that the recycled ants have got better immune systems, as well."
00:36:48,00:36:52,"So actually, you eat them, and then they come back, and they're super ants, kind of."
00:36:52,00:36:55,So why not keep eating and eating and eating and regurgitating and regurgitating?
00:36:55,00:36:58,"I'd spend my whole life as a mother eating, remaking."
00:36:58,00:36:59,"Yeah, exactly."
00:36:59,00:37:01,And then you'll make Superman.
00:37:01,00:37:06,I think it's like what we're doing with astronauts with them drinking their own urine and recycling.
00:37:06,00:37:07,It's exactly like that.
00:37:07,00:37:08,"Yeah, it's like a recycling."
00:37:08,00:37:09,So that's the future.
00:37:09,00:37:13,"Eat the infected astronauts in your boomerang spaceship,"
00:37:13,00:37:15,and we will be into the stars.
00:37:15,00:37:16,Yeah.
00:37:16,00:37:20,"It's amazing with ants how primed they are to be aware of disease,"
00:37:20,00:37:23,"and it makes, obviously, perfect sense because they live in gigantic colonies,"
00:37:23,00:37:26,"where the moment someone gets sick, you've got to know about it, and you've got to deal with it."
00:37:26,00:37:29,"But I mean, queen ants also will eat their best friend."
00:37:29,00:37:32,"So I actually didn't realize this about ant colonies,"
00:37:32,00:37:38,"but about a fifth of them are founded by a pair of queens, not just one, so there'll be two best pals"
00:37:38,00:37:41,"who get together and say, ""Let's form a colony together."""
00:37:41,00:37:44,"If one of them dies, which sadly sometimes they do,"
00:37:44,00:37:47,the other one quickly chops them up into pieces
00:37:47,00:37:50,"and buries all the pieces in different places,"
00:37:50,00:37:54,and that's to make sure that whatever infection it was cannot spread through the colony.
00:37:54,00:37:56,But a tough job with your best friend.
00:37:56,00:37:57,Yeah.
00:37:57,00:37:58,I thought you said something.
00:37:58,00:37:59,They ate them.
00:37:59,00:38:00,"Yeah, I thought so too."
00:38:00,00:38:04,"Sorry, they put them in their mouths to chop them into pieces, and then they bury them."
00:38:04,00:38:05,"I don't know why they don't eat them, actually."
00:38:05,00:38:07,Maybe they don't taste very nice when they're raw.
00:38:07,00:38:08,"Well, because they might be infected with something."
00:38:08,00:38:09,Possibly.
00:38:09,00:38:10,"No, but the queen ants have protections."
00:38:10,00:38:13,"They have a special anti-venom gland, which they begin to massage."
00:38:13,00:38:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:14,00:38:18,"If they detect any illness, they just start massaging their gland."
00:38:18,00:38:19,It's so amazing.
00:38:19,00:38:20,They do it before and after.
00:38:20,00:38:22,"Yeah, they're just there massaging this gland."
00:38:22,00:38:26,"They call it, I think it's a positive PR kind of spin on it."
00:38:26,00:38:29,They call it hygienic cannibalism.
00:38:29,00:38:30,So it's...
00:38:30,00:38:33,It's still not the word cannibalism in it.
00:38:33,00:38:35,"I think if you really want to go positive PR,"
00:38:35,00:38:36,get rid of the word cannibalism.
00:38:36,00:38:38,"But it's more appealing, isn't it, when you say,"
00:38:38,00:38:40,"""No, it's hygienic cannibalism."""
00:38:40,00:38:42,"Yeah, it sounds like you're saying, ""It's vegan."""
00:38:42,00:38:43,"No, it is."
00:38:43,00:38:45,"No, it is not vegan."
00:38:45,00:38:47,"But the ant queens are all single mums, or by and large."
00:38:47,00:38:50,So they have a tough or gig.
00:38:50,00:38:52,What? They're the queen.
00:38:52,00:38:54,They can do what they want.
00:38:54,00:38:57,They go very hungry to raise their workers.
00:38:57,00:39:00,"They will eat any old crap, though, ants, won't they?"
00:39:00,00:39:01,Will they?
00:39:01,00:39:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:39:02,00:39:05,"In 1904, there was a problem with ants in New Orleans."
00:39:05,00:39:07,"Right, it was a hospital."
00:39:07,00:39:09,And they were completely overpowered with ants.
00:39:09,00:39:11,There was millions and millions and millions of them.
00:39:11,00:39:14,And so a group of entomologists went over there to see what they could do.
00:39:14,00:39:16,A guy called Edward Titus was in charge.
00:39:16,00:39:20,And he found that they were eating human sputum.
00:39:20,00:39:23,"Basically, there were a lot of tuberculosis patients."
00:39:23,00:39:26,"And so the ants would march, march, march, march,"
00:39:26,00:39:28,"pick up someone's phlegm,"
00:39:28,00:39:32,"and then march, march, march back to the nest and eat it."
00:39:32,00:39:34,I feel like I've lost the audience.
00:39:34,00:39:35,Yeah.
00:39:35,00:39:37,"The ants are going nuts for this, though."
00:39:37,00:39:39,You just don't hear them.
00:39:39,00:39:43,One thing that they'll do is they will not go to work.
00:39:43,00:39:45,"They'll take the day off if they're sick, right?"
00:39:45,00:39:48,"Yeah, because your mum's waiting at the office."
00:39:48,00:39:49,But it's not amazing.
00:39:49,00:39:51,They'll take sick days.
00:39:51,00:39:55,So they will wait outside the nest if they feel they've got a cold
00:39:55,00:39:58,"and they just let it pass so that they don't spread it, get killed,"
00:39:58,00:40:02,and then hygienically or non-hygienically dealt with.
00:40:02,00:40:05,Do we know how many malingering ants there are in the world?
00:40:05,00:40:06,I know we do.
00:40:06,00:40:10,40% of them aren't actually sick but just don't really like the job.
00:40:10,00:40:12,"No, we do. There are studies on this."
00:40:12,00:40:18,So a study found in 2015 that 40% of all ants are doing nothing all day.
00:40:18,00:40:20,"They're not hardworking. They're very, very lazy."
00:40:20,00:40:22,"But it's not the same ants all the time, right?"
00:40:22,00:40:24,"No, this is the weird thing."
00:40:24,00:40:26,The theory is actually they're in reserve.
00:40:26,00:40:27,They're not needed at the moment.
00:40:27,00:40:32,But if one of their colleagues gets ill or is eaten by the queen...
00:40:32,00:40:34,That's what I said when I was unemployed for six months.
00:40:34,00:40:36,I'm in reserve.
00:40:36,00:40:39,But the idea is basically they're living pantries.
00:40:39,00:40:41,"I mean, some of them might just be lazy."
00:40:41,00:40:43,That is another theory that's currently going around.
00:40:43,00:40:45,But a scientist called Dr. Daniel Chabonot worked this out.
00:40:45,00:40:48,"But he put dots of paint on particular ants, right?"
00:40:48,00:40:51,"He worked out which ones were the hardest working in the colony,"
00:40:51,00:40:53,and then he removed the hardworking ones.
00:40:53,00:40:56,"So, you know, this should have presented a work problem for the colony."
00:40:56,00:41:00,"Actually, if you remove the hardworking ones, others step up"
00:41:00,00:41:01,and they fill their place.
00:41:01,00:41:03,And so the same amount of work gets done.
00:41:03,00:41:06,So the lazy ones are just hardworking ones waiting.
00:41:06,00:41:07,They're smart.
00:41:07,00:41:10,They're hardworking ones who know that someone else is going to do the shit.
00:41:10,00:41:11,"Yeah, exactly. Yeah."
00:41:11,00:41:12,"Yeah, good on them."
00:41:12,00:41:15,"They're very good at looking after they're injured, as well as they're sick."
00:41:15,00:41:17,I think this is absolutely incredible about ants.
00:41:17,00:41:19,They're often in big battles.
00:41:19,00:41:22,"It's usually ant against termites, so they'll attack termite colonies."
00:41:22,00:41:28,"And if an ant gets injured, it will get carried off the battlefield by its friends,"
00:41:28,00:41:30,because it's not useful in battle anymore.
00:41:30,00:41:34,"It will get evacuated back to the nest if it has an injury which is salvageable,"
00:41:34,00:41:36,where their lives can be saved.
00:41:36,00:41:40,Their injuries are licked clean and they're left to rest until they recover.
00:41:40,00:41:44,"And amazingly, they've quite recently discovered that they do amputation."
00:41:44,00:41:45,"And not only this, but they..."
00:41:45,00:41:47,Antiputations.
00:41:47,00:41:48,Antiputations.
00:41:48,00:41:52,"I'll tell you what, by the time I edit that, that will be such a tight word."
00:41:52,00:41:55,It's going to take so much editing.
00:41:55,00:41:57,I always want to make you say it again.
00:41:57,00:41:59,But I'll leave you to suffer.
00:41:59,00:42:02,"Yes, they do amputations and..."
00:42:02,00:42:05,How did you say that so well?
00:42:05,00:42:09,And they know which amputations are most likely to be survivable.
00:42:09,00:42:16,So scientists were really confused about the fact that ants only amputated injured ants' legs above the knee.
00:42:16,00:42:21,"So if they were injured in the thigh area, if they were injured below the knee, they would not amputate."
00:42:21,00:42:26,"So obviously, scientists being what they are took a bunch of ants and they amputated their legs below the knee."
00:42:26,00:42:29,"And lo and behold, they were like, ""Oh, look, they all die."""
00:42:29,00:42:31,Or they only had a 20% survival rate.
00:42:31,00:42:33,I guess the other ants know this.
00:42:33,00:42:40,"But yes, because if you amputate below the knee, apparently the infection spreads more easily because of the way the blood's pumping round."
00:42:40,00:42:41,And they know this.
00:42:41,00:42:45,I think you do get wound care in the form of licking if your lower leg is injured.
00:42:45,00:42:47,"Oh, you still get wound care?"
00:42:47,00:42:49,"Yeah, that's the advice."
00:42:49,00:42:55,"What's interesting is, when they were doing this study, they were trying to work out if it was empathy that was bringing them back."
00:42:55,00:43:02,"They discovered that it's not because if an ant was passing an injured ant, not in battle, on the way to the battle,"
00:43:02,00:43:06,"they would just be like, ""Okay, see, there was nothing that made them want to care about it."""
00:43:06,00:43:10,So what it largely was is that they need their army numbers up.
00:43:10,00:43:11,And so bring them back.
00:43:11,00:43:14,"They can recover in a few days and they're back out again, back into the war zone."
00:43:14,00:43:15,"Oh, interesting."
00:43:15,00:43:18,"A lot of the battles around Tonantant, they had the moment."
00:43:18,00:43:21,You have lots of these big colonies.
00:43:21,00:43:28,"There was a group, a couple of groups in Southern California, the very large colony and the Lake Hodges colony."
00:43:28,00:43:31,And they were in a battle for six months.
00:43:31,00:43:38,"And it was over a line that was just a few centimeters wide, but it was several kilometers long."
00:43:38,00:43:50,"And 15 million ants died in a six-month period, which is equivalent to most of the highest estimates of the number of people who died in World War I in the human wars."
00:43:50,00:43:52,But there are 20 quadrillion ants on Earth.
00:43:52,00:44:00,"We almost got to find out what life was like as an ant, because it was this amazing game that was pitched a few years ago called Ant Simulator."
00:44:00,00:44:06,And it was a Kickstarter or one of those crowdfunding campaigns where they raised a bunch of money for it.
00:44:06,00:44:08,And unfortunately--
00:44:08,00:44:10,They realized that it would be incredibly boring.
00:44:10,00:44:11,"Well, no."
00:44:11,00:44:14,"I mean, I think it's funding really quickly."
00:44:14,00:44:16,Everyone thought it was an amazing idea.
00:44:16,00:44:23,"They couldn't do it because his two other business partners took the money and, according to reports, spent it all on booze and strippers."
00:44:23,00:44:31,"And so he had to write to everyone saying, ""I'm sorry, the money's gone on a porch, like hangover, movie-style weekend."""
00:44:31,00:44:36,He just saw a huge wallet being carried slowly past his office away from him.
00:44:36,00:44:39,Can I say something about-- we've talked a lot about ant war.
00:44:39,00:44:40,Can we talk a bit about ant peace?
00:44:40,00:44:41,"Yes, please do."
00:44:41,00:44:44,Ant can make yogurt.
00:44:44,00:44:46,Is that nice?
00:44:46,00:44:49,"Is that an inherently peaceful product, yogurt?"
00:44:49,00:44:51,I think it's about as peaceful as it gets.
00:44:51,00:44:52,Yeah?
00:44:52,00:44:53,Is it?
00:44:53,00:44:54,Do you do it out--
00:44:54,00:44:56,"I mean, if you make them make yogurt."
00:44:56,00:45:00,"If you drop live ants in milk, you get yogurt eventually."
00:45:00,00:45:01,"Oh, really?"
00:45:01,00:45:03,That's got quite violent again quite quickly.
00:45:03,00:45:04,"No, you're right."
00:45:04,00:45:10,"But this is a traditional method around the world of making-- like Turkey and Albania and Bulgaria, this is how you make yogurt."
00:45:10,00:45:11,It's a recognized method.
00:45:11,00:45:15,It's as few as four ants in a picture of milk.
00:45:15,00:45:16,What happens?
00:45:16,00:45:24,"They release formic acid, and that makes it acidify and then coagulate, and you end up with yogurt."
00:45:24,00:45:26,"So, I mean, can this sometimes happen accidentally?"
00:45:26,00:45:32,"I mean, I'll leave an open bottle of milk in the fridge sometimes, and would it be that I've got fromage fray at the end of the day?"
00:45:32,00:45:34,"If you've got ants in your fridge, it could happen."
00:45:34,00:45:39,"I think some people, when this study came out, some people suggested that that might have been where yogurt came from."
00:45:39,00:45:44,"Like, accidentally some ants fell into some milk once, and they went, ""Oh, let's do this properly."""
00:45:44,00:45:45,"Yeah, I buy that."
00:45:45,00:45:46,I do buy that.
00:45:46,00:45:47,Do you?
00:45:47,00:45:48,"Well, you leave your milk out, don't you?"
00:45:48,00:45:53,"And then you get your ants-- I can see how it would happen, unlike most inventions, which happen by mistake."
00:45:53,00:45:55,"We're going to have to wrap up, guys."
00:45:55,00:45:59,What's the fastest you can spin any part of your body?
00:45:59,00:46:04,"Like, move it in an arc, let's say like a baseball player moves their arm in an arc."
00:46:04,00:46:09,"I mean, there is a very naughty thing called the helicopter, which--"
00:46:09,00:46:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:46:10,00:46:15,You reckon you can do that quicker than a baseball player can spin their arm or something like that?
00:46:15,00:46:20,"Well, yeah, I think the thing I'm using is smaller, so I think it can make the turns quicker."
00:46:20,00:46:22,It can go as fast as a bee's dick.
00:46:22,00:46:30,"I'll tell you what the fastest thing you can do, and it's this."
00:46:30,00:46:37,"So when you click your fingers, the rotational speed is 20 times faster than the blink of an eye."
00:46:37,00:46:38,It's the fastest thing.
00:46:38,00:46:43,Dracula ants can do a similar thing by moving their thorax.
00:46:43,00:46:47,"They kind of-- they make a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure, and then release it."
00:46:47,00:46:48,They snap their body.
00:46:48,00:46:53,"They snap their body, and they can do it 1,000 times quicker than you can click your finger."
00:46:53,00:46:54,Okay?
00:46:54,00:46:57,And they do it to stun centipedes.
00:46:57,00:46:58,Wow.
00:46:58,00:47:03,"So centipedes coming along, they go, and the centipede goes, ""What the fuck was that?"""
00:47:03,00:47:06,"But at the time they've done that, they bug it off."
00:47:06,00:47:12,"It's like, it's as if you could, like, go into a field and click your fingers and the cow would fall over."
00:47:12,00:47:13,I thought you--
00:47:13,00:47:16,"Oh, the dream, the dream."
00:47:16,00:47:18,"Is that what you mean, though?"
00:47:18,00:47:21,"It's not-- it's not-- they literally stun them into, like--"
00:47:21,00:47:22,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, stun them, like--"
00:47:22,00:47:24,"I thought you meant they're like, ""Whoa, whoa, what was that?"""
00:47:24,00:47:28,I thought I meant-- that was fabulous. That was absolutely-- I'm stunned. I'm stunned.
00:47:28,00:47:33,"So every ant is Darren Brown, basically, going, ""Look into my eyes, look into my eyes, look into my eyes."""
00:47:33,00:47:35,"You're under, and that's it."
00:47:35,00:47:43,That is it. That is all of our facts.
00:47:43,00:47:48,"We can't thank you enough, Adelaide, for having-- this is our first bit of the Down Under Tour,"
00:47:48,00:47:50,and it's been awesome. Thank you for having us.
00:47:50,00:47:52,We will be back again.
00:47:52,00:47:56,And we will also be back again next week with another episode. We'll see you then.
00:47:56,00:47:58,Good bye!
00:47:58,00:48:01,(cheering and applause)
00:48:02,00:48:05,(upbeat music)
00:48:05,00:48:07,(upbeat music)
