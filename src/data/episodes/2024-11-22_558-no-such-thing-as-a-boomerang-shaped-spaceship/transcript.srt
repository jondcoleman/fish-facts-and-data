00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Adelaide.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 My name is Darren Shriver.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 and James Harkin.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that during World War I,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Australia invented a hand grenade that was shaped like a boomerang.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 [LAUGHTER]

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Now. Now.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Can I ask the obvious question?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Yeah.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Did it come back?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Well, it depends how you threw it.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Right, okay.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Depends how good you were at throwing it.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Right.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I think mainly it was to get people who were around the corner,

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 or let's say there was a high wall, you could throw it,

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 and then run, and then it would come and hit the people behind the wall.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Right.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I should say it was never used in the world.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Oh, really?

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 But it was invented.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 This one that's on the screen that we can see,

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 it's in the Auckland War Memorial Museum.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So it was that one that went but didn't come back

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 if it's in New Zealand?

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 [LAUGHTER]

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Were we at war with New Zealand in World War I?

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I imagine it was used as a test.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 [LAUGHTER]

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 So it was tried out, and this was in 1915.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And one of the people who was there at the tryout

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 was a guy called Colonel Dengar.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And when they did the first trial, he said,

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 "Dad, let's donish the turks."

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 [LAUGHTER]

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 What's amazing is the one that we have on the screen here,

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 if you were describing it, it's a leather item,

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 and it's got embossed on it in the leather, an emu, and a kangaroo,

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 in case you didn't know what nation.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 [LAUGHTER]

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And it's got the words, "Some worries across the top."

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 [LAUGHTER]

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 But the amazing thing is this one that we've got here

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 is not the only one.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 There's an online forum called Great War Forum,

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 and they found out about this as well,

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 and they went to look for other ones,

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 and they found loads of other ones.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 So there was one invented in the UK,

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 which had a hinge in its middle,

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 so sometimes you could make it come back,

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 and sometimes you could make it fly straight.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And that one had knife-like edges,

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 so that if you threw it at the enemy,

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 they couldn't catch it and throw it back,

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 and there was one...

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 That's unsporting, so just to say.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 [LAUGHTER]

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 There was one that was in Melbourne

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 that was shown to the Army Intentions Board,

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 and it was a professional boomerang thrower

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 who threw it to show them,

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 and he managed to land it on a piece of paper 140 yards away.

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 What?

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 This boomerang, because I think boomerangs

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 are just really good for throwing, aren't they?

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 For that kind of accuracy, sorry, that feels...

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Well, he was a pro, what can I say?

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 It also doesn't say how big the piece of paper was.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Or how many goes he had.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Yes.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 It was actually A6, so well done.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 But one of the reasons that it didn't happen

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 is because it is difficult to throw a boomerang,

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 and even if you know how to do it,

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 two soldiers are always going to throw it slightly differently,

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 so it's very different thing to regulate.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I can't get past this guy who landed a boomerang

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 on a piece of paper 120.

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I imagine it was a total fluke, it landed,

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 and he turned to the troops and went,

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 "Easy peasy," and then went back home and said to his wife,

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 "You will not believe what happened."

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I've just remembered, I found his name on my notes,

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 he was called Frank Donnellan,

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 and he was a famous boomerang thrower in the 1950s.

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 That was for World War II that he was...

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Ah, OK.

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 When you think grenade,

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I imagine a lot of people think of the sort of pomegranate-shaped thing

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 with the lumps all over it.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 It's green, it's got the handle, it's got the pin,

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 it's got all of that.

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 That is basically all thanks to one man called William Mills,

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 who had the first grenade, which became classic.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And he was knighted, because it was a very successful invention,

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 it was rolled out everywhere, he was knighted.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 His coat of arms in 1922, when he was knighted,

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 had four hand grenades on it.

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 It's very weird seeing something that modern on a coat of arms.

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 But it was so necessary, because before then,

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 it was all cans on a stick, was the basic shape of a grenade.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 It was a canned stick.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And often they would bounce off the edge of the trench,

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 so they were really ungainly, they were really hard to use,

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 and they weren't built for...

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 They weren't built like something that people had practiced throwing,

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 like a ball, or whatever it might be.

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 They are then named after pomegranates.

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 That's why they have a similar name.

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Really?

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Yeah, yeah.

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 So the Russian for "grenade" is "grenata",

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 and the Russian for "pomegranate" is "grenat".

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And that was a problem for one Russian-speaking man

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 in a Portuguese bar in 2023,

125
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 who wanted to ask for pomegranate juice,

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 and found himself handcuffed and surrounded by armed police.

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 (LAUGHTER)

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I just want to know at what point the people in that restaurant

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 thought we'd fucks up here.

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 A, why is he asking us for a grenade?

131
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Is that what you would do?

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 That's the opposite of a threat, isn't it?

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Exactly.

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 B, he's sitting there saying,

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 "What's going on? The police are on their way."

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 He's pointing at the pomegranate juice.

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Surely.

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 I am addicted to silly grenades.

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Silly things that have happened.

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 It's either always someone finding a grenade and thinking,

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 "Well, this looks like a rock."

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Or there was someone recently on the Isle of Wight in the UK

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 who brought back a lovely old fossil from the beach

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 and caused the entire resort to be evacuated

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 because it was an old hand grenade.

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I think my favourite one of these is in 2016.

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And, stupidly, I didn't write down the country.

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I think it was in India, but it might have been in Germany,

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 so just watch that.

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Potato batata, right?

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 It was a policeman who took a grenade to a courtroom

152
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 during a trial as a piece of evidence.

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And he was trying to demonstrate how the grenade was detonated.

154
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And what he was trying to show

155
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 was that, contrary to the defendant's assertion

156
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 that it was a very complicated thing to set off,

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 it was actually incredibly simple to use.

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 He assured the court that it had been safely disarmed

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 before accidentally detonating it,

160
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 like knocking the judge off his chair.

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Is that all that happened?

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Pretty much, yeah.

163
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 It's like his wig fell off.

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Fortunately, it wasn't bad.

165
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 It was the country cartoon world.

166
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 There was a guy in China who was in his small village

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 and the police went around with leaflets

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 talking about unclaimed grenades

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 that were still out in the wild.

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And he freaked out because he suddenly realised

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 the thing that was in the picture was what he had been using

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 to crack nuts, like walnuts and stuff,

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 but not just recently, for 25 years,

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 it was his nutcracker.

175
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And he freaked out and they took it away

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 and they didn't know at least at the time of this reporting

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 whether it had been disarmed or not.

178
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I suppose as long as you don't crack your nuts in a fire,

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 then you're safe, aren't you?

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 That's the thing, just try not to like them.

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 China, of course, being the place that invented grenades

182
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 way before the rest of us, like all of that kind of war stuff,

183
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 but they had the earliest version from at least the 12th century

184
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 and they were called thundercrash bombs.

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And they were very cool, but also they were thrown mostly at sea

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 from these paddle boats

187
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 where everyone would have a thundercrash bomb in their hands

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 and you paddled the boat like a pedalo,

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 so you had little treadmills instead of oars

190
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 and they'd all be treadmilling along.

191
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 That's so cool. Imagine a war when everyone's in like a swan-shaped pedalo.

192
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 That'd be so cool.

193
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I don't know which aquatic animal they were shaped like, actually,

194
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 but it could have been.

195
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 If the Aussies had a boomerang-shaped grenade,

196
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 the American went also towards their stereotype

197
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 and had a NFL football, a gridiron ball-shaped grenade

198
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 that they trialed in the 1970s

199
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 and it largely wasn't a gridiron ball

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 that they just hollowed out and put the explosives in.

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 They needed something that looked not like a grenade,

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 so if they were in trouble, the enemy would see,

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 "Oh, they've just got a bunch of NFL footballs around them,"

204
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 and they would pick it up and be able to throw

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 and they thought, because most American soldiers probably played NFL,

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 they'd have a great understanding of accuracy.

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Some of them would have been wide receivers,

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 so some of them would have been trained to catch the ball,

209
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 which I think could be a problem.

210
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Yeah, I think that was a problem because the result was,

211
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 as they say in quotes, "unpredictable,"

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 and so it was never properly used, but that was a good one as well.

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 That's cool. The British made some that were shaped like cricket balls,

214
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 which is a sport that we play.

215
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I don't know if you guys in Australia know that.

216
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 So even if we lost the war, we'd at least have the moral victory.

217
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 (Laughter)

218
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 This is sledging, isn't it?

219
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 That was self-sledging, really.

220
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 You know, Grenadiers, Grenadiers,

221
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 they obviously started as people who threw grenades in the 17th century

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 and they pretty much stopped throwing grenades by the Napoleonic Wars,

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 so Grenadiers were only throwing grenades for about 100 years,

224
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 but they've kept referring to people in the army who were super elite

225
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 because you had to be the strongest,

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 you had to have amazing upper-body strength to throw those grenades,

227
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 but you also famously had in Britain the tall mitre hats.

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 It looks a bit like the Pope's hat in my head.

229
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Well, yeah, the mitre is the name for a bishop's hat.

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Indeed, it looks much like that, but do you know why they had the tall hats?

231
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Deflection of grenades.

232
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 So people aimed for the top of their head and they knocked the hat off?

233
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 That's very clever. Yeah, a good no.

234
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 (Laughter)

235
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 They wanted to blend in in a group of bishops, maybe.

236
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 (Laughter)

237
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 There's a conclave happening and they just hide in there.

238
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 All grenades were thrown from the Vatican, yes.

239
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 No, it was because all other soldiers' hats at the time had rims,

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 but if you had to light a grenade, you're holding your rifle,

241
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 and then suddenly you have to sling it over your shoulder

242
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 in order to light the grenade with your match,

243
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 and when they were slinging it over their shoulder,

244
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 it kept getting caught on the brim of their hats and knocking their hats off,

245
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 so they were given special dispensation to have hats without a brim.

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 I don't know why they then had to be super tall.

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 You're making it sound like a Dunce's cap, basically, that people are aware of.

248
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 You know Bayonets are invented by grenade throwers as well,

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 just because we were saying that,

250
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 just because you had a grenade in one hand

251
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 and you had your gun in the other hand,

252
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 but what if the enemy get close to you, you want a knife as well,

253
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 but they couldn't hold their knife because they didn't have enough hands,

254
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 so they attached it to the end of the gun.

255
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 As soon as you said that, I thought, "Three armed soldiers."

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 (Laughter)

257
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 That's how we got the three armed soldiers.

258
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 There's quite a famous boomerang that I think is in Adelaide at the moment.

259
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 It certainly was for a while, which is...

260
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 There's a space museum here, isn't there, in Adelaide?

261
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Is that yes? Yeah.

262
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And there's a boomerang that went up into space.

263
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Oh, that one's not there.

264
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 That's in the South Australian Museum, because I saw it this morning.

265
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Oh, you saw it? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Oh, wow. And so, yeah, it went to space,

267
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 and I don't know if it's the exact one,

268
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 but they showed that if you throw a boomerang into space,

269
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 it still comes back to you.

270
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Oh, so it wasn't thrown... Sorry, it was an incredibly strong boomerang thrower

271
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 who hurled it all the way up.

272
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 He comes back home, "Huddy, you're not going to believe what else I did!"

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 (Laughter)

274
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Get your telescope out now.

275
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 So that proved that a boomerang still works in space.

276
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And James, you studied physics, right?

277
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Yeah, but don't ask me how that works, because it doesn't feel like it should.

278
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Yeah, because I'm curious if you...

279
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 OK, so one of the big problems with space travel

280
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 is having enough fuel to get you back right.

281
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And often we need to swing around planets and use their...

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Yeah, are you saying we should build our spaceships to look like boomerangs?

283
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Shape like a boomerang, chuck them out into space.

284
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Surely they return back to sender.

285
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 But... (Laughter)

286
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 I mean, yes, obviously that would work.

287
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Yeah, yeah, but...

288
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 We need to move on in the same place.

289
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Can I tell you one more daft invention?

290
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 A military invention. This was the BE-9 plane.

291
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Again, early days of flight, like the First World War or pre.

292
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 So, right, you're in your plane.

293
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 It's all two-man planes of that, you know, one pilot and one gunner.

294
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Gunner traditionally sits behind the pilot, like shoots the gun behind.

295
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Right, you want to fire forward though,

296
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 but the problem is you would shoot the propeller.

297
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 How do you solve it?

298
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Um, like back up to the enemy, so you can shoot that way.

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Fly backwards.

300
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Yeah, reverse.

301
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Yep. Good.

302
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I don't know, didn't they not...

303
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 I thought they shot between the blades, didn't they?

304
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 They eventually worked out how to do that.

305
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 This was their previous solution.

306
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 We just put the gunner in front of the propeller.

307
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 So, this plane was built and it flew.

308
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 You've got a normal plane pilot, propeller on the front of the plane,

309
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 and then in front of him is this mad box with the gunner sitting,

310
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 with his gun sitting out the front of it.

311
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Unfortunately, they cannot communicate at all.

312
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 They just can't talk to each other because the propeller's in the middle.

313
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Right.

314
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 So, they're just sort of stuck, not talking to each other.

315
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 They wouldn't need to. All that gunner's saying is...

316
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And then it's a problem if he shits himself for the guy behind.

317
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Oh, God!

318
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 We are going to move on now to fact number two,

319
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 and that is Anna.

320
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 My fact this week is that the number four is two squared,

321
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 the number eight is two cubed,

322
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 and the number 256 is two zenzi-zenzi-zenzigt.

323
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Yeah. Bet you didn't know that.

324
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 You thought at first my fact was going to be the number four is two squared,

325
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 and you got worried.

326
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 But yeah, zenzi-zenzi-zenzigt is a thing.

327
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 It's a great word.

328
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 It is. It's not a common word.

329
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 It was the word that was invented by a mathematician.

330
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 A Welsh mathematician called Robert Record in 1557

331
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 in a book The Whetstone of Witt.

332
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And he got annoyed because, you know,

333
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 we didn't have any way of saying to the power eight that was easy.

334
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 We've all struggled with that, so he said...

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Did he say when we would need it?

336
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Like outside of deep math?

337
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Yeah, I don't think he imagined in the shop, you'd ask for.

338
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Can I have three zenzi-zenzi-zenzigt potatoes, please?

339
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 No.

340
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 But in deep math.

341
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And so he said, well, zenzig was the German for squared at the time.

342
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 So for the power four, something to the power four,

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 he said, let's say, zenzi-zenzigt, which is the square of squares,

344
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 the power six, well, that's obviously the square of a cube.

345
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 So it's zenzi-cubic.

346
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And then to the power eight, zenzi-zenzizendzigt.

347
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And if you really want to know, the power 16 is zenzi-zenzizendzizendzigt.

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And I find that very useful to know.

349
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 The power 16, he didn't write that down, did he?

350
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 It was someone else came along and went, oh, he could just add another zenzi.

351
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Oh, really?

352
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 He is an amazing guy, this Robert Record guy.

353
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 I've never heard of him before.

354
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 I mean, why would you have done it?

355
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 He was a 16th century mathematician, but he was also a doctor.

356
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And he wrote maths textbooks.

357
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And get this, he invented the equals sign.

358
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Oh, I feel that deserve more.

359
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 You know what we mean, right?

360
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 You know, the equals sign.

361
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Wait, what did they...

362
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Lovely, thank you.

363
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 But just, I think, actually, if I just put that to the end,

364
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I was like, wow, the people of Adelaide really love the equals sign.

365
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 So what did we do before? Like, what were math tests like before?

366
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 We used to write is equal to.

367
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Yeah, but in Latin, you had to write equalis, which is the Latin for is equal to.

368
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And so in his book, he says to avoid the tedious repetition of these words,

369
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 I will set, as I do often work, use a pair of parallels,

370
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 because no two other things can be equal.

371
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Two parallel lines is the most equal thing that you can get in the world

372
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 according to Robert Record.

373
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 It's so cool.

374
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 But he loves the stuff. Like, he brought linear...

375
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 The words linear, denominate, binomial, equation.

376
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 He came up with definitions for square, compound, rational number,

377
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 irrational number in English.

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 He was the first to do all those things.

379
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And we don't really know about him,

380
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 because no one gives a shit about any of those words, is that?

381
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I would say, like, to me, he's quite famous, someone who studied maths.

382
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 OK, because I'd never heard of him.

383
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And maybe if you were a doctor as well,

384
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 because he also wrote loads of medical textbooks, including one called

385
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 the Urinal of Physics.

386
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 The Urinal?

387
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 The Urinal of Physics.

388
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And like, physicists and physicians.

389
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And it's about what doctors can learn from their patients urine.

390
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Yeah?

391
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 So this was a...

392
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 I read... Did you read it?

393
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 I... No.

394
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 But you did?

395
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I didn't actually read it.

396
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Well, I've just had some issues lately, so I wanted to take a shed of your light.

397
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And he gives tips for collecting urine samples.

398
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And one of the things that confused me was, he said,

399
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 when you're as a patient collecting your sample to give to the doctor,

400
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 make sure you don't just give the watery bit and throw away the dregs.

401
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Because a lot of people do that.

402
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And the dregs are an important part of the urine.

403
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And I thought...

404
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 What are the dregs?

405
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Dregs!

406
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Sorry, does everyone else have dregs in the bottom?

407
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 If you had a bladder stone, you might have dregs.

408
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Right, maybe they were very common back in the day.

409
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 He said urine comes in three varieties, thick, thin and mean.

410
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Red, white and rosé.

411
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Mean was a third one.

412
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Weirdly, mean is just the one in between thick and thin.

413
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 I suppose it's like the mean, the average.

414
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 The average.

415
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And it also has three levels.

416
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 The ground, brackets, the sediment, the swim and the cloud.

417
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Okay.

418
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Which is quite nice, isn't it?

419
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 I sort of... I see that.

420
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Because it does have a little cloud, doesn't it, above it?

421
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Yeah.

422
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Bubbles.

423
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 It's like foam.

424
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 A bit of foam, yeah.

425
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Foam?

426
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Yours doesn't foam.

427
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Dan, get yourself to your urinal physician immediately.

428
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Yeah.

429
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 It should have about an inch of foam on the top of it.

430
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 It might do.

431
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 It might be underneath all the dregs that I have floating on top.

432
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 If you pour it slower, you don't get that amazing effect.

433
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 So, yeah, you have to pour it at the right speed.

434
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 The toilet at an angle.

435
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Did you guys know that four used to be five?

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So, one, two, three, five, four?

437
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Sort of.

438
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 If you were reading it, that's what you think it would be.

439
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Right.

440
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Because Arabic numerals first came to Europe in the 10th century.

441
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And it's really cool if you look at charts of how they've all progressed,

442
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 the numbers one to ten, what they looked like.

443
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 But basically, one, two, three, six, seven, eight, nine,

444
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 throughout the years are vaguely recognizable as how we would write them today.

445
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 But then four was drawn like this weird curly B-shaped thing.

446
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And five was just written as we'd write four.

447
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And it was about 300 years that five was just written as four.

448
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And then eventually they sort of swapped around.

449
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 So, if you do go back in time about 500 years and someone writes down to you,

450
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 that they have five children.

451
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 I know this is unlikely.

452
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 That's useful.

453
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Well, I'm trying to share some useful math tips.

454
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 I thought that was interesting.

455
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Dan was wondering before what used Zenziz-Zenzik could have,

456
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 like, two to the power of eight.

457
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Zenziz-Zenziz-Zenziz-Zenzik, the two to the power of sixteen,

458
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 that is 65,536.

459
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 That is a very useful number to remember,

460
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 because that is the maximum number of characters you can use for one message in WhatsApp.

461
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Really?

462
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Really?

463
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Really?

464
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 How many?

465
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 It's so high you've never reached it, right?

466
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Did you test it?

467
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Did you just keep writing until you got to the limit?

468
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Why do you think I sent you all those messages yesterday?

469
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 How many characters?

470
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 65,536 characters.

471
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 That's not words.

472
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Not words.

473
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Yeah, but it's effectively to a WhatsApp user,

474
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 it's infinity because no one's ever going to reach it, right?

475
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 I don't know, I leave some pretty long messages, you guys have very noticed.

476
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 I reckon I'm coming, I just think I'm scraping the ceiling of that.

477
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 It'll be like Twitter eventually, they'll be pressurised to double it.

478
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Two to the power of 24, which is 16,777,216,

479
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 is the number of unique colours you can see on most computer monitors.

480
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And two to the power of 32, which is just over four trillion,

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 is the total number of possible IP addresses

482
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 under the original number of IP addresses.

483
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Really?

484
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Yeah.

485
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 It is useful.

486
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And two to the power of 136,279,841, minus one,

487
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 is the largest known prime number, which was found just a couple of weeks ago, I think.

488
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Well, maybe last week or, I'm not sure.

489
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 How did they find it?

490
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Well, there was a guy called Luke Durant,

491
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 and he sort of borrowed a load of computers from around the world in 17 different countries

492
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 and got them all running this computer programme together to look for prime numbers.

493
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Oh, so it's beautiful.

494
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 It's never just like this guy was counting,

495
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 and then he thought, "Wait a minute."

496
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 He just reached the limit of the WhatsApp.

497
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Did you guys see that mass news actually yesterday, which was,

498
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 you know that old adage that if you left enough monkeys with enough typewriters,

499
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 they'd eventually type out the works of Shakespeare?

500
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Yes.

501
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Did you see that mathematicians have just worked out that they wouldn't?

502
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 They worked out that if you got all the monkeys that we have,

503
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 and all the monkey-like things...

504
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Yeah, but that's all the monkeys.

505
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 There aren't that many monkeys.

506
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Isn't it infinite monkeys with infinite types?

507
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 It is infinite monkeys.

508
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Or is it, like, however many monkeys we have access to?

509
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Yeah, do you know what...

510
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 That's such a boring calculation.

511
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It's quite interesting to know how many monkeys there are.

512
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 These guys said, until the end of the universe,

513
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 as many monkeys as there will be,

514
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 and said that it almost is a one in a million chance it would happen.

515
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 So you're right.

516
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 With infinite, yeah.

517
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Okay.

518
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 What would they come up with?

519
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Because that's more interesting in a way.

520
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 They said, "Sure, sir."

521
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Probably.

522
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Have you guys heard of the semiotic alliance?

523
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Oh, no.

524
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 This is kind of cool.

525
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I was reading about, you know, Alex Belos, the mathematician.

526
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Yeah.

527
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 He wrote a book about his adventures in math, basically.

528
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 And he wrote about meeting this guy called Greg Rowland,

529
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 who works at the semiotic alliance.

530
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And he basically provides consultancy for companies

531
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 on what number they should have in their product name.

532
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 So he says KFC, 11 herbs and spices, is perfect.

533
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Oh.

534
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Like, 10 herbs and spices would be too dull and too round.

535
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 And 12 is too spicy.

536
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 It's much too spicy.

537
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And 11, perfect.

538
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Levi 501.

539
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Interesting.

540
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 501, bit more than, like, Levi 500 is a bit mechanistic, isn't it?

541
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 It's a bit dull.

542
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Right.

543
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And did he come up with these or are these just examples of...

544
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 He has consulted for various companies.

545
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 I don't know if he says which he's come up with or which he hasn't.

546
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 But he says WD 40, that's good.

547
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 That's a reliable number.

548
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 But that was actually his 40th attempt at making WD, whatever that is.

549
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 What a displacement, 40th attempt.

550
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 That's what it does.

551
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Right.

552
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Yeah, yeah.

553
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 He just came up with a reliable number.

554
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 It was actually his 39th and he thought, "Fuck it, let's tip it over."

555
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Shit.

556
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Why Andy?

557
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Why did he say 40 doesn't need...

558
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Well, it's solid, isn't it?

559
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 It's reliable.

560
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Right, okay.

561
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 You know, you want a good product in your home.

562
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 WD 37, fussy.

563
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 WD 40.

564
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Because you're not looking something interesting and creative.

565
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 You're looking for something reliable and boring.

566
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Yeah, exactly.

567
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Nice, okay.

568
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 So I think there's a lot in this.

569
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Okay, yeah.

570
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 I don't know about a lot, but there's something.

571
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Hey, can I ask a quick question of the crowd?

572
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 We mentioned this on a show ages ago and I got a lot of people writing in saying that

573
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 this is not true.

574
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 But supposedly a measurement, a unit of measurement, often in Australia, if it's really tight,

575
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 like if something like whisks past your ear, like it's that close, you describe that unit

576
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 of distance as a bee's dick.

577
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Yeah?

578
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 You would say that.

579
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 You missed it by a bee's dick, mate.

580
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Oh, great.

581
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Because we said this on the show and I had a bunch of Aussies writing in saying,

582
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 "Never heard that, that's bullshit."

583
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 I can imagine every other city in Australia going,

584
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 "Yeah, but it's those guys in Adelaide, isn't it?"

585
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 They've got very badly endowed bees in Adelaide.

586
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 We know that.

587
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

588
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 My fact this week is that Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 has been translated into over 30 languages

589
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 under the same title, except in Denmark, where it was published as 233 Celsius.

590
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Yeah, so it was published in over 30 different languages and every single one had either a

591
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 direct translation into the language or just used outright the title Fahrenheit 451.

592
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 That's cool.

593
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Except for Denmark.

594
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 So do we know why the Danes did it?

595
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Because I thought it might have been because Celsius was Danish,

596
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 but he was Swedish.

597
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Wasn't he the guy who came up with the Celsius chart?

598
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Oh, and does Celsius?

599
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Celsius.

600
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Was it just because they thought our people will understand that better, maybe?

601
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 There's not an amazing amount of literature on what happened,

602
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 and there's not many books as well.

603
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 So when you go online, there's a few copies that you can see photos of

604
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 and collectors desperately try to get in.

605
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 They all got burned.

606
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 That was a sad thing.

607
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Ironically, I think Ray Bradbury, from the little I could find,

608
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 did not like that this had this new title, and so they did effectively...

609
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Really?

610
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 He didn't like any changes, did he?

611
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 I think that was it.

612
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Like, every now and then, his book would get changed very slightly in America

613
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 or something like that, and he hated it.

614
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Yes, he hated the internet.

615
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 He didn't want it published in e-book form, and he resisted for a long time.

616
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 I think that's totally fair enough, given that the entire point of Fahrenheit 451

617
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 is that screens are really, really bad and totally ruin human society.

618
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 I can empathise with him saying, "Please don't turn my book into a bookie."

619
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 It's so amazing, because when you read it, like, because I re-read it on the plane over,

620
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 because I read it when I was younger, and the bit where they kind of explained the whole plot,

621
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 they might as well be saying, "Tick-tock is shit."

622
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Do you know what I mean?

623
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Basically, it's like, "All right, no one reads long things.

624
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Everyone wants shorter and shorter media, and no one's got a good attention span,"

625
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 and all that kind of stuff.

626
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Yeah.

627
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 It's a very good book. It's a brilliant book.

628
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Obviously, it's a classic.

629
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 It's great. He wrote it. I love this on a coin-operated typewriter.

630
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 It's so cool. He wrote it in his local library at UCLA in California,

631
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 and he carried a little bag of loose change,

632
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 and if you put in ten cents, it would give you half an hour.

633
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 So it cost him $9.80 to write.

634
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 That's quite good.

635
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 As a writer yourself, Andy, I don't know if you get writer's block,

636
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 but do you think it would help you to churn out those words?

637
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I think it probably would, yeah.

638
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 I'll try anything at this point.

639
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Interestingly, churning out the words was a thing that he had a philosophy about.

640
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 So he had eventually his own typewriter at home.

641
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 He left the library, and above his typewriter,

642
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 he would have the words "don't think,"

643
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 and it was a reminder for him to feel the stories,

644
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 as opposed to sit mulling on them and getting stuck into writer's block effectively.

645
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 That was his philosophy.

646
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And it certainly was what happened, wasn't it?

647
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 I think three of us might have read it on the fly,

648
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 but in the version that I read,

649
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 he writes an introduction and he talks about the process,

650
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 and he said, "I didn't write the book, it wrote me."

651
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And he said, "The main character was the person who was speaking through me.

652
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 It wasn't me speaking at all."

653
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And it's amazing him describing the process.

654
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 For a guy who is famous for his words, it wrote me.

655
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Look, he's not a great writer.

656
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 It wrote me. No, it didn't, buddy.

657
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 But he made a lot of weird claims.

658
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 So that's quite mystical.

659
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 A lot of authors do say that.

660
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 They say sometimes an idea is downloaded into their head

661
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 and they are merely a vessel for whatever came to them.

662
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 They channeled it.

663
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 That's just because they plagiarized it from somewhere else, isn't it?

664
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Oh, no, it just came from there.

665
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I know it's quite similar to this.

666
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 But he also made odd claims.

667
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Like, he claims his memory was so good he remembers the moment of birth.

668
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And he would always tell this at dinner parties.

669
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 He would say, "I remember being born.

670
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 I remember coming out and being like,

671
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 'Hey, he has full recollection.'"

672
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 And people would say, "No, you need to see a psychologist for it."

673
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And he would, and he would tell them, and they couldn't dissuade him.

674
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 He was saying, "I remember. I remember being circumcised.

675
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Man, that was painful when I was six days old or whatever it was."

676
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Wow.

677
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Yeah, he had total recall of his life, according to him.

678
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Yeah, wow.

679
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Pretty cool.

680
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 He had good recall, probably, according to him again.

681
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 He said while he was in the library,

682
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 he literally just tipped books down off the shelves,

683
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 powered through them and remembered quotes.

684
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 And, in fact, in Fahrenheit 451,

685
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 there's a bit without giving away the ending,

686
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 which assumes that once people have read a book,

687
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 they can retain all of the words in it and then re-quote them at will.

688
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Which is not true of me.

689
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 People used to be able to do that, I'm sure.

690
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 There's a verbal recall of what you'd seen

691
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 was fantastic before mass literacy.

692
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 So, in Shakespearean times,

693
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 you would remember a lot more of a speech from a played scene.

694
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 So, you would be able to go home from this show tonight

695
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 and just do, like, big bits of the show all over again.

696
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Lucky you.

697
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Fahrenheit 451, by the way, which used to be called

698
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Fahrenheit 541, when four and five used to be different numbers.

699
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Of course, yeah.

700
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Well, the good thing about 451 is that it's one more.

701
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Like, it's a high 450, very bad title.

702
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Very boring, workman-like.

703
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 He did decide on the title because it sounded good, though.

704
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 So, I'd like to know what Alex Bellos had to say,

705
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 because it was called "The Fireman" at first,

706
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 and his publisher said, "Give it a better title."

707
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 And so, he called the local fire department, as you do,

708
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 and said, "What temperature does paper burn at?"

709
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 And they said it's 451 Fahrenheit.

710
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And so, he thought, "That's a cool number."

711
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 But I wonder what number would have made him think, "Nah."

712
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Apparently, it doesn't burn at that.

713
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Yeah, I've heard that.

714
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 It depends on the type of paper and stuff.

715
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Right, I see.

716
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And it's off the top of his head, this poor fireman,

717
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 and he's got fires to be putting out.

718
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 He's just said the first things that comes to him.

719
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Do you guys want a little quiz of original titles for books

720
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 under which they should have been published?

721
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Oh, yeah.

722
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Andy.

723
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 [LAUGHTER]

724
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 OK.

725
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Let's say that's the jet lag talking.

726
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 We're going to do it anyway.

727
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 "Les dents de la mer."

728
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Oh, "Les mers" are rather blah, blah, blah.

729
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 No.

730
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 "Les dents de la mer."

731
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 The teeth of the sea.

732
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Jaws.

733
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Jaws.

734
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Jaws.

735
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Jaws.

736
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Wait, sorry.

737
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 That was the original title in the English language.

738
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 No, it was probably to French.

739
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Sorry.

740
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Someone said they were going to call it,

741
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 "What's that noshing on my leg?"

742
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 That was his dad's suggestion.

743
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 His dad or his father-in-law said that's a good title

744
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 when he was struggling for it.

745
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 That is a good title.

746
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 "Chocolate for breakfast."

747
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 This is quite guessable, I think.

748
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Oh, breakfast.

749
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 No.

750
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Chocolate for breakfast.

751
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Yeah.

752
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Who's a sort of stereotypically messy, crazy character?

753
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Willie Wonka.

754
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 And a good Charlie and the Chocolate.

755
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 No.

756
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Chocolate for breakfast.

757
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Like, who's a classic, like, crazy protagonist

758
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 who's always getting in scrapes?

759
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Borat.

760
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 [LAUGHTER]

761
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Yeah.

762
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Yeah, Borat the novel.

763
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 It's the novelisation of Borat.

764
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 And the novel came first.

765
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Interestingly.

766
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Everything happens in the film.

767
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I prefer the novel, actually.

768
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Really?

769
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Yeah, I think it's more true to the character.

770
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 For me, the stage show?

771
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Yeah, the stage show is very good.

772
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Is it just William?

773
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 It's Bridget Jones' diary.

774
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Sort of, you know, like, messy, messy character.

775
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 OK, here's one.

776
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Twilight.

777
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Oh.

778
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Oh.

779
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Well, Fifty Shades of Grey was based on Twilight.

780
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Dracula.

781
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Yes.

782
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 So good.

783
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 No, it was William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury.

784
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 No.

785
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 It was called Twilight.

786
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Twilight was originally called Forks.

787
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 But I couldn't find a novel that was originally called Forks

788
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 and changed to whatever the third one would be

789
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 to complete it.

790
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 My favourite, just a super quick one on translations.

791
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 The Mexican title for the movie Grease is Vaselina.

792
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 [LAUGHTER]

793
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 So Temperatures.

794
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Oh, yeah.

795
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Fahrenheit, Celsius.

796
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Yeah.

797
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Sir Isaac Newton had his own version.

798
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And it was a temperature scale that only went from 0 to 12.

799
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 And 0 was the freezing point of water.

800
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 And 12 was his body temperature on the middle of the month of July.

801
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 [LAUGHTER]

802
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 OK.

803
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 [LAUGHTER]

804
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 And then he, like, he realised that this wasn't enough,

805
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 because you'd need to go higher than that, right?

806
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 So then he added higher numbers.

807
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 So at 14--

808
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 We already had numbers higher than 12.

809
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 It's not like he had to-- he was like--

810
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Yeah, but he needed to define what they were

811
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 as the temperature, didn't he?

812
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 So, like, 14 was the greatest heat of a bath,

813
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 which one can endure for some time

814
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 when his hand is dipped in and is kept in constant movement.

815
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 [LAUGHTER]

816
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Oh, that does help.

817
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Now that I'm picturing how I check a bath, that does--

818
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 You're not meant to test it with your hand anyway.

819
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 You shouldn't be putting your hand in the bath.

820
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 What do you test it with?

821
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Elbow.

822
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Elbow.

823
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Which doesn't work, by the way, as any parent will tell you.

824
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Yeah.

825
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 Thermometers used to be upside down.

826
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And this was Celsius himself

827
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 made his own thermometer upside down, idiot.

828
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 It was just to make any sense in our minds, right?

829
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 The boiling point of water was nought degrees

830
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 and the freezing point was 100.

831
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And what we call today is a Celsius scale

832
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 because someone flipped it shortly afterwards.

833
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Linnaeus, in fact, flipped it.

834
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 It was, but it was, yeah, I think two people suggested flipping it

835
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 and he was one.

836
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 But I thought the reason that he did it upside down

837
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 was quite interesting and I didn't know.

838
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And it was because he was also very involved

839
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 in measuring the brightness of stars

840
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 and he came up with a much more accurate way

841
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 to measure the brightness of stars.

842
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 And I didn't realise that we do that upside down.

843
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 So a star's magnitude is inversely proportional

844
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 to how bright it is.

845
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 So the brightest stars have the lowest magnitude.

846
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And that's literally just because Ptolemy,

847
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 you know, a thousand years earlier,

848
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 had said that should be the case.

849
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 And so everyone copied him.

850
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And so Celsius was saying, OK, well, if stars,

851
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 you know, the brighter they are, the lower they are,

852
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 then we'll do the same with everything else.

853
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I like that.

854
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 I think it's fine.

855
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 I think as long as we're not using Fahrenheit, it's fine.

856
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 I think Fahrenheit is such a stupid-- it's so stupid.

857
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 No, but it's only America that is using Fahrenheit

858
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 in any big way.

859
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 I think it's like a couple of other countries

860
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 that use Fahrenheit.

861
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 I think Micronesia is still on Fahrenheit, to be fair.

862
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Sure.

863
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 But like, it's really bad.

864
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 And America has tried to change.

865
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Like, the French adopted Celsius partly

866
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 because of the French Revolution.

867
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Everything has to be sort of metricised

868
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 and, you know, made rational on all of this.

869
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And America, they actually passed a law,

870
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 the Metric Conversion Act in 1975,

871
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 which was beginning the process of metrification.

872
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 It was going to be great.

873
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 America was going to be sensible.

874
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 And no one wanted to do it.

875
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 And Ronald Reagan dismantled the board in 1982.

876
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Well, they made it voluntary, didn't they?

877
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Which is the one thing you're not supposed to do with the law.

878
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 You can't say, "Don't commit murder if you don't want to."

879
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 And that was basically what they said.

880
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 They were like, "Change to Celsius if you want to,

881
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 "but don't if you don't."

882
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 So everyone was like, "Well, I'm not going to then."

883
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 I just so did not expect that to be the answer to my question, just saying.

884
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 I think they might have been there or thereabouts, basically.

885
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Right.

886
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I'm going to have to move us on, guys.

887
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Can I just quickly...

888
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 I feel like we haven't covered enough

889
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 the kind of guy Ray Bradby was.

890
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Oh, yeah, okay.

891
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I didn't massively warm him,

892
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 so I want to quickly tell you one thing about him,

893
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 which is very representative.

894
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 He was quite egotistical, which is clear when you read him.

895
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 He kind of thinks everyone's an idiot

896
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 who is going to become braindead from TV,

897
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 except a few academics have gone to Cambridge,

898
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 is one way of reading the book.

899
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 And he said he was really unhappy a lot of times in his teens,

900
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 because he didn't fit in a lot of the time.

901
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 And he said, "You pay a certain penalty for going your own way.

902
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 You're not as popular with girls as you should be."

903
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 I used to take my short stories to girls' homes and read them.

904
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And they didn't want to hear about it.

905
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 They just wanted me to pour at them how pathetic is that.

906
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 And I just think a man who thinks the world is the problem

907
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 when he takes his short stories to a party

908
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 and reads them to a girl who doesn't like it is the problem.

909
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Yeah.

910
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 At the same time, when he died,

911
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 he wanted his ashes to be sent to Mars in a soup can.

912
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 So that's like a fun guy to me.

913
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 OK.

914
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 We need to head into our final fact, and that is Andy.

915
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 My fact is that when young ants are sick,

916
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 their mothers immediately eat them and recycle them into more ants.

917
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Mmm.

918
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 There's no...

919
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 There's no like, "Oh, well, just go to sleep it off."

920
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 It's really like, "Right, this happens now."

921
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 And it's because if an infection spreads through a hive,

922
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 it can be really dangerous, and there aren't many protections against it.

923
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And scientists tested this out by giving an ant queen a small fungal pathogen,

924
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 and they would eat lots and lots and lots of infected larvae.

925
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Sorry, the larvae have been infected, and the ant queens just ate them,

926
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 as well as 6% of controlled larvae which were not infected at all.

927
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 And it's going to ask what a sick ant is like,

928
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 but it funguses it.

929
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Yeah, exactly, if they just have a bit of this on them.

930
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 And as soon as the queen ant finds a sick larvae, she just starts chomping.

931
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 And the queen ants, which did this and ate them,

932
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 then produced lots more eggs.

933
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 And it happens at the very first rifle.

934
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 And that is those.

935
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 So it sounds sort of crazy and frankly uncoined, but...

936
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 I read that the recycled ants have got better immune systems, as well.

937
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 So actually, you eat them, and then they come back, and they're super ants, kind of.

938
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 So why not keep eating and eating and eating and regurgitating and regurgitating?

939
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 I'd spend my whole life as a mother eating, remaking.

940
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Yeah, exactly.

941
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 And then you'll make Superman.

942
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 I think it's like what we're doing with astronauts with them drinking their own urine and recycling.

943
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 It's exactly like that.

944
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Yeah, it's like a recycling.

945
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 So that's the future.

946
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Eat the infected astronauts in your boomerang spaceship,

947
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 and we will be into the stars.

948
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Yeah.

949
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 It's amazing with ants how primed they are to be aware of disease,

950
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 and it makes, obviously, perfect sense because they live in gigantic colonies,

951
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 where the moment someone gets sick, you've got to know about it, and you've got to deal with it.

952
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 But I mean, queen ants also will eat their best friend.

953
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 So I actually didn't realize this about ant colonies,

954
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 but about a fifth of them are founded by a pair of queens, not just one, so there'll be two best pals

955
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 who get together and say, "Let's form a colony together."

956
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 If one of them dies, which sadly sometimes they do,

957
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 the other one quickly chops them up into pieces

958
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 and buries all the pieces in different places,

959
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 and that's to make sure that whatever infection it was cannot spread through the colony.

960
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 But a tough job with your best friend.

961
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Yeah.

962
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 I thought you said something.

963
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 They ate them.

964
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Yeah, I thought so too.

965
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 Sorry, they put them in their mouths to chop them into pieces, and then they bury them.

966
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 I don't know why they don't eat them, actually.

967
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 Maybe they don't taste very nice when they're raw.

968
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Well, because they might be infected with something.

969
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 Possibly.

970
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 No, but the queen ants have protections.

971
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 They have a special anti-venom gland, which they begin to massage.

972
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 Oh, yeah.

973
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 If they detect any illness, they just start massaging their gland.

974
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 It's so amazing.

975
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 They do it before and after.

976
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Yeah, they're just there massaging this gland.

977
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 They call it, I think it's a positive PR kind of spin on it.

978
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 They call it hygienic cannibalism.

979
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 So it's...

980
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 It's still not the word cannibalism in it.

981
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 I think if you really want to go positive PR,

982
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 get rid of the word cannibalism.

983
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 But it's more appealing, isn't it, when you say,

984
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 "No, it's hygienic cannibalism."

985
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Yeah, it sounds like you're saying, "It's vegan."

986
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 No, it is.

987
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 No, it is not vegan.

988
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 But the ant queens are all single mums, or by and large.

989
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 So they have a tough or gig.

990
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 What? They're the queen.

991
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 They can do what they want.

992
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 They go very hungry to raise their workers.

993
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 They will eat any old crap, though, ants, won't they?

994
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 Will they?

995
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 Yeah, yeah.

996
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 In 1904, there was a problem with ants in New Orleans.

997
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Right, it was a hospital.

998
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 And they were completely overpowered with ants.

999
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 There was millions and millions and millions of them.

1000
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 And so a group of entomologists went over there to see what they could do.

1001
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 A guy called Edward Titus was in charge.

1002
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 And he found that they were eating human sputum.

1003
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 Basically, there were a lot of tuberculosis patients.

1004
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 And so the ants would march, march, march, march,

1005
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 pick up someone's phlegm,

1006
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 and then march, march, march back to the nest and eat it.

1007
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 I feel like I've lost the audience.

1008
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Yeah.

1009
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 The ants are going nuts for this, though.

1010
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 You just don't hear them.

1011
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 One thing that they'll do is they will not go to work.

1012
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 They'll take the day off if they're sick, right?

1013
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 Yeah, because your mum's waiting at the office.

1014
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 But it's not amazing.

1015
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 They'll take sick days.

1016
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 So they will wait outside the nest if they feel they've got a cold

1017
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 and they just let it pass so that they don't spread it, get killed,

1018
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 and then hygienically or non-hygienically dealt with.

1019
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 Do we know how many malingering ants there are in the world?

1020
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 I know we do.

1021
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 40% of them aren't actually sick but just don't really like the job.

1022
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 No, we do. There are studies on this.

1023
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 So a study found in 2015 that 40% of all ants are doing nothing all day.

1024
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 They're not hardworking. They're very, very lazy.

1025
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 But it's not the same ants all the time, right?

1026
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 No, this is the weird thing.

1027
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 The theory is actually they're in reserve.

1028
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 They're not needed at the moment.

1029
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 But if one of their colleagues gets ill or is eaten by the queen...

1030
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 That's what I said when I was unemployed for six months.

1031
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 I'm in reserve.

1032
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 But the idea is basically they're living pantries.

1033
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 I mean, some of them might just be lazy.

1034
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 That is another theory that's currently going around.

1035
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 But a scientist called Dr. Daniel Chabonot worked this out.

1036
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 But he put dots of paint on particular ants, right?

1037
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 He worked out which ones were the hardest working in the colony,

1038
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 and then he removed the hardworking ones.

1039
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 So, you know, this should have presented a work problem for the colony.

1040
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Actually, if you remove the hardworking ones, others step up

1041
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 and they fill their place.

1042
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 And so the same amount of work gets done.

1043
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 So the lazy ones are just hardworking ones waiting.

1044
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 They're smart.

1045
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 They're hardworking ones who know that someone else is going to do the shit.

1046
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1047
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 Yeah, good on them.

1048
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 They're very good at looking after they're injured, as well as they're sick.

1049
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 I think this is absolutely incredible about ants.

1050
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 They're often in big battles.

1051
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 It's usually ant against termites, so they'll attack termite colonies.

1052
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 And if an ant gets injured, it will get carried off the battlefield by its friends,

1053
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 because it's not useful in battle anymore.

1054
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 It will get evacuated back to the nest if it has an injury which is salvageable,

1055
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 where their lives can be saved.

1056
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Their injuries are licked clean and they're left to rest until they recover.

1057
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 And amazingly, they've quite recently discovered that they do amputation.

1058
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 And not only this, but they...

1059
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 Antiputations.

1060
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Antiputations.

1061
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 I'll tell you what, by the time I edit that, that will be such a tight word.

1062
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 It's going to take so much editing.

1063
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 I always want to make you say it again.

1064
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 But I'll leave you to suffer.

1065
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Yes, they do amputations and...

1066
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 How did you say that so well?

1067
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 And they know which amputations are most likely to be survivable.

1068
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 So scientists were really confused about the fact that ants only amputated injured ants' legs above the knee.

1069
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 So if they were injured in the thigh area, if they were injured below the knee, they would not amputate.

1070
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 So obviously, scientists being what they are took a bunch of ants and they amputated their legs below the knee.

1071
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 And lo and behold, they were like, "Oh, look, they all die."

1072
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 Or they only had a 20% survival rate.

1073
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 I guess the other ants know this.

1074
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 But yes, because if you amputate below the knee, apparently the infection spreads more easily because of the way the blood's pumping round.

1075
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 And they know this.

1076
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 I think you do get wound care in the form of licking if your lower leg is injured.

1077
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Oh, you still get wound care?

1078
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 Yeah, that's the advice.

1079
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 What's interesting is, when they were doing this study, they were trying to work out if it was empathy that was bringing them back.

1080
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 They discovered that it's not because if an ant was passing an injured ant, not in battle, on the way to the battle,

1081
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 they would just be like, "Okay, see, there was nothing that made them want to care about it."

1082
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 So what it largely was is that they need their army numbers up.

1083
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 And so bring them back.

1084
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 They can recover in a few days and they're back out again, back into the war zone.

1085
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Oh, interesting.

1086
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 A lot of the battles around Tonantant, they had the moment.

1087
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 You have lots of these big colonies.

1088
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 There was a group, a couple of groups in Southern California, the very large colony and the Lake Hodges colony.

1089
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 And they were in a battle for six months.

1090
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 And it was over a line that was just a few centimeters wide, but it was several kilometers long.

1091
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 And 15 million ants died in a six-month period, which is equivalent to most of the highest estimates of the number of people who died in World War I in the human wars.

1092
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 But there are 20 quadrillion ants on Earth.

1093
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 We almost got to find out what life was like as an ant, because it was this amazing game that was pitched a few years ago called Ant Simulator.

1094
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 And it was a Kickstarter or one of those crowdfunding campaigns where they raised a bunch of money for it.

1095
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 And unfortunately--

1096
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 They realized that it would be incredibly boring.

1097
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 Well, no.

1098
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 I mean, I think it's funding really quickly.

1099
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 Everyone thought it was an amazing idea.

1100
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 They couldn't do it because his two other business partners took the money and, according to reports, spent it all on booze and strippers.

1101
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 And so he had to write to everyone saying, "I'm sorry, the money's gone on a porch, like hangover, movie-style weekend."

1102
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 He just saw a huge wallet being carried slowly past his office away from him.

1103
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 Can I say something about-- we've talked a lot about ant war.

1104
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 Can we talk a bit about ant peace?

1105
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 Yes, please do.

1106
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 Ant can make yogurt.

1107
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 Is that nice?

1108
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 Is that an inherently peaceful product, yogurt?

1109
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 I think it's about as peaceful as it gets.

1110
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 Yeah?

1111
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Is it?

1112
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 Do you do it out--

1113
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 I mean, if you make them make yogurt.

1114
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 If you drop live ants in milk, you get yogurt eventually.

1115
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 Oh, really?

1116
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 That's got quite violent again quite quickly.

1117
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 No, you're right.

1118
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 But this is a traditional method around the world of making-- like Turkey and Albania and Bulgaria, this is how you make yogurt.

1119
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 It's a recognized method.

1120
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 It's as few as four ants in a picture of milk.

1121
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 What happens?

1122
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 They release formic acid, and that makes it acidify and then coagulate, and you end up with yogurt.

1123
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 So, I mean, can this sometimes happen accidentally?

1124
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 I mean, I'll leave an open bottle of milk in the fridge sometimes, and would it be that I've got fromage fray at the end of the day?

1125
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 If you've got ants in your fridge, it could happen.

1126
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 I think some people, when this study came out, some people suggested that that might have been where yogurt came from.

1127
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 Like, accidentally some ants fell into some milk once, and they went, "Oh, let's do this properly."

1128
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 Yeah, I buy that.

1129
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 I do buy that.

1130
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 Do you?

1131
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 Well, you leave your milk out, don't you?

1132
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 And then you get your ants-- I can see how it would happen, unlike most inventions, which happen by mistake.

1133
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 We're going to have to wrap up, guys.

1134
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 What's the fastest you can spin any part of your body?

1135
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 Like, move it in an arc, let's say like a baseball player moves their arm in an arc.

1136
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 I mean, there is a very naughty thing called the helicopter, which--

1137
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 Oh, yeah.

1138
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 You reckon you can do that quicker than a baseball player can spin their arm or something like that?

1139
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 Well, yeah, I think the thing I'm using is smaller, so I think it can make the turns quicker.

1140
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 It can go as fast as a bee's dick.

1141
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 I'll tell you what the fastest thing you can do, and it's this.

1142
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 So when you click your fingers, the rotational speed is 20 times faster than the blink of an eye.

1143
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 It's the fastest thing.

1144
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 Dracula ants can do a similar thing by moving their thorax.

1145
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 They kind of-- they make a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure, and then release it.

1146
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 They snap their body.

1147
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 They snap their body, and they can do it 1,000 times quicker than you can click your finger.

1148
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 Okay?

1149
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 And they do it to stun centipedes.

1150
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 Wow.

1151
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 So centipedes coming along, they go, and the centipede goes, "What the fuck was that?"

1152
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 But at the time they've done that, they bug it off.

1153
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 It's like, it's as if you could, like, go into a field and click your fingers and the cow would fall over.

1154
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 I thought you--

1155
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 Oh, the dream, the dream.

1156
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 Is that what you mean, though?

1157
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 It's not-- it's not-- they literally stun them into, like--

1158
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, stun them, like--

1159
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 I thought you meant they're like, "Whoa, whoa, what was that?"

1160
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 I thought I meant-- that was fabulous. That was absolutely-- I'm stunned. I'm stunned.

1161
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 So every ant is Darren Brown, basically, going, "Look into my eyes, look into my eyes, look into my eyes."

1162
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 You're under, and that's it.

1163
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 That is it. That is all of our facts.

1164
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 We can't thank you enough, Adelaide, for having-- this is our first bit of the Down Under Tour,

1165
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 and it's been awesome. Thank you for having us.

1166
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 We will be back again.

1167
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 And we will also be back again next week with another episode. We'll see you then.

1168
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 Good bye!

1169
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 (cheering and applause)

1170
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 (upbeat music)

1171
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,580
 (upbeat music)

1172
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,160
 (upbeat music)
