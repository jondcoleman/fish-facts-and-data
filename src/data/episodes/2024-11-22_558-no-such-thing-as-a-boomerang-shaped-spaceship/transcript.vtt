00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Adelaide.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 My name is Darren Shriver.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 and James Harkin.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that during World War I,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Australia invented a hand grenade that was shaped like a boomerang.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Now. Now.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Can I ask the obvious question?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Yeah.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Did it come back?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Well, it depends how you threw it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Right, okay.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Depends how good you were at throwing it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Right.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 I think mainly it was to get people who were around the corner,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 or let's say there was a high wall, you could throw it,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 and then run, and then it would come and hit the people behind the wall.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Right.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 I should say it was never used in the world.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Oh, really?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 But it was invented.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 This one that's on the screen that we can see,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 it's in the Auckland War Memorial Museum.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 So it was that one that went but didn't come back

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 if it's in New Zealand?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Were we at war with New Zealand in World War I?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 I imagine it was used as a test.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 So it was tried out, and this was in 1915.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 And one of the people who was there at the tryout

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 was a guy called Colonel Dengar.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 And when they did the first trial, he said,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 "Dad, let's donish the turks."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 What's amazing is the one that we have on the screen here,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 if you were describing it, it's a leather item,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 and it's got embossed on it in the leather, an emu, and a kangaroo,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 in case you didn't know what nation.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 And it's got the words, "Some worries across the top."

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 But the amazing thing is this one that we've got here

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 is not the only one.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 There's an online forum called Great War Forum,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 and they found out about this as well,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 and they went to look for other ones,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 and they found loads of other ones.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 So there was one invented in the UK,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 which had a hinge in its middle,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 so sometimes you could make it come back,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 and sometimes you could make it fly straight.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 And that one had knife-like edges,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 so that if you threw it at the enemy,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 they couldn't catch it and throw it back,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 and there was one...

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 That's unsporting, so just to say.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 There was one that was in Melbourne

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 that was shown to the Army Intentions Board,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 and it was a professional boomerang thrower

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 who threw it to show them,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 and he managed to land it on a piece of paper 140 yards away.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 What?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 This boomerang, because I think boomerangs

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 are just really good for throwing, aren't they?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 For that kind of accuracy, sorry, that feels...

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Well, he was a pro, what can I say?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 It also doesn't say how big the piece of paper was.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Or how many goes he had.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Yes.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 It was actually A6, so well done.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 But one of the reasons that it didn't happen

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 is because it is difficult to throw a boomerang,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 and even if you know how to do it,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 two soldiers are always going to throw it slightly differently,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 so it's very different thing to regulate.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 I can't get past this guy who landed a boomerang

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 on a piece of paper 120.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 I imagine it was a total fluke, it landed,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 and he turned to the troops and went,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 "Easy peasy," and then went back home and said to his wife,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 "You will not believe what happened."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 I've just remembered, I found his name on my notes,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 he was called Frank Donnellan,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 and he was a famous boomerang thrower in the 1950s.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 That was for World War II that he was...

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Ah, OK.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 When you think grenade,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 I imagine a lot of people think of the sort of pomegranate-shaped thing

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 with the lumps all over it.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 It's green, it's got the handle, it's got the pin,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 it's got all of that.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 That is basically all thanks to one man called William Mills,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 who had the first grenade, which became classic.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 And he was knighted, because it was a very successful invention,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 it was rolled out everywhere, he was knighted.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 His coat of arms in 1922, when he was knighted,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 had four hand grenades on it.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 It's very weird seeing something that modern on a coat of arms.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 But it was so necessary, because before then,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 it was all cans on a stick, was the basic shape of a grenade.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 It was a canned stick.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 And often they would bounce off the edge of the trench,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 so they were really ungainly, they were really hard to use,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 and they weren't built for...

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 They weren't built like something that people had practiced throwing,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 like a ball, or whatever it might be.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 They are then named after pomegranates.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 That's why they have a similar name.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Really?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 So the Russian for "grenade" is "grenata",

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 and the Russian for "pomegranate" is "grenat".

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 And that was a problem for one Russian-speaking man

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 in a Portuguese bar in 2023,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 who wanted to ask for pomegranate juice,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 and found himself handcuffed and surrounded by armed police.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 I just want to know at what point the people in that restaurant

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 thought we'd fucks up here.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 A, why is he asking us for a grenade?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Is that what you would do?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 That's the opposite of a threat, isn't it?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Exactly.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 B, he's sitting there saying,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 "What's going on? The police are on their way."

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 He's pointing at the pomegranate juice.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Surely.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 I am addicted to silly grenades.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Silly things that have happened.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 It's either always someone finding a grenade and thinking,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 "Well, this looks like a rock."

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Or there was someone recently on the Isle of Wight in the UK

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 who brought back a lovely old fossil from the beach

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 and caused the entire resort to be evacuated

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 because it was an old hand grenade.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 I think my favourite one of these is in 2016.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 And, stupidly, I didn't write down the country.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 I think it was in India, but it might have been in Germany,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 so just watch that.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Potato batata, right?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 It was a policeman who took a grenade to a courtroom

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 during a trial as a piece of evidence.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 And he was trying to demonstrate how the grenade was detonated.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 And what he was trying to show

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 was that, contrary to the defendant's assertion

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 that it was a very complicated thing to set off,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 it was actually incredibly simple to use.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 He assured the court that it had been safely disarmed

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 before accidentally detonating it,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 like knocking the judge off his chair.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Is that all that happened?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Pretty much, yeah.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 It's like his wig fell off.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Fortunately, it wasn't bad.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 It was the country cartoon world.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 There was a guy in China who was in his small village

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 and the police went around with leaflets

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 talking about unclaimed grenades

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 that were still out in the wild.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 And he freaked out because he suddenly realised

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 the thing that was in the picture was what he had been using

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 to crack nuts, like walnuts and stuff,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 but not just recently, for 25 years,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 it was his nutcracker.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 And he freaked out and they took it away

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 and they didn't know at least at the time of this reporting

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 whether it had been disarmed or not.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 I suppose as long as you don't crack your nuts in a fire,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 then you're safe, aren't you?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 That's the thing, just try not to like them.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 China, of course, being the place that invented grenades

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 way before the rest of us, like all of that kind of war stuff,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 but they had the earliest version from at least the 12th century

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 and they were called thundercrash bombs.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 And they were very cool, but also they were thrown mostly at sea

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 from these paddle boats

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 where everyone would have a thundercrash bomb in their hands

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 and you paddled the boat like a pedalo,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 so you had little treadmills instead of oars

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 and they'd all be treadmilling along.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 That's so cool. Imagine a war when everyone's in like a swan-shaped pedalo.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 That'd be so cool.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 I don't know which aquatic animal they were shaped like, actually,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 but it could have been.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 If the Aussies had a boomerang-shaped grenade,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 the American went also towards their stereotype

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 and had a NFL football, a gridiron ball-shaped grenade

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 that they trialed in the 1970s

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 and it largely wasn't a gridiron ball

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 that they just hollowed out and put the explosives in.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 They needed something that looked not like a grenade,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 so if they were in trouble, the enemy would see,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 "Oh, they've just got a bunch of NFL footballs around them,"

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 and they would pick it up and be able to throw

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 and they thought, because most American soldiers probably played NFL,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 they'd have a great understanding of accuracy.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Some of them would have been wide receivers,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 so some of them would have been trained to catch the ball,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 which I think could be a problem.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Yeah, I think that was a problem because the result was,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 as they say in quotes, "unpredictable,"

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 and so it was never properly used, but that was a good one as well.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 That's cool. The British made some that were shaped like cricket balls,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 which is a sport that we play.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 I don't know if you guys in Australia know that.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 So even if we lost the war, we'd at least have the moral victory.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 (Laughter)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 This is sledging, isn't it?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 That was self-sledging, really.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 You know, Grenadiers, Grenadiers,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 they obviously started as people who threw grenades in the 17th century

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 and they pretty much stopped throwing grenades by the Napoleonic Wars,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 so Grenadiers were only throwing grenades for about 100 years,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 but they've kept referring to people in the army who were super elite

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 because you had to be the strongest,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 you had to have amazing upper-body strength to throw those grenades,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 but you also famously had in Britain the tall mitre hats.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 It looks a bit like the Pope's hat in my head.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Well, yeah, the mitre is the name for a bishop's hat.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Indeed, it looks much like that, but do you know why they had the tall hats?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Deflection of grenades.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 So people aimed for the top of their head and they knocked the hat off?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 That's very clever. Yeah, a good no.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 (Laughter)

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 They wanted to blend in in a group of bishops, maybe.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 (Laughter)

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 There's a conclave happening and they just hide in there.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 All grenades were thrown from the Vatican, yes.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 No, it was because all other soldiers' hats at the time had rims,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 but if you had to light a grenade, you're holding your rifle,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 and then suddenly you have to sling it over your shoulder

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 in order to light the grenade with your match,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 and when they were slinging it over their shoulder,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 it kept getting caught on the brim of their hats and knocking their hats off,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 so they were given special dispensation to have hats without a brim.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 I don't know why they then had to be super tall.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 You're making it sound like a Dunce's cap, basically, that people are aware of.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 You know Bayonets are invented by grenade throwers as well,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 just because we were saying that,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 just because you had a grenade in one hand

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 and you had your gun in the other hand,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 but what if the enemy get close to you, you want a knife as well,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 but they couldn't hold their knife because they didn't have enough hands,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 so they attached it to the end of the gun.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 As soon as you said that, I thought, "Three armed soldiers."

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 (Laughter)

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 That's how we got the three armed soldiers.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 There's quite a famous boomerang that I think is in Adelaide at the moment.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 It certainly was for a while, which is...

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 There's a space museum here, isn't there, in Adelaide?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Is that yes? Yeah.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 And there's a boomerang that went up into space.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Oh, that one's not there.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 That's in the South Australian Museum, because I saw it this morning.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Oh, you saw it? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 Oh, wow. And so, yeah, it went to space,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 and I don't know if it's the exact one,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 but they showed that if you throw a boomerang into space,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 it still comes back to you.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Oh, so it wasn't thrown... Sorry, it was an incredibly strong boomerang thrower

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 who hurled it all the way up.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 He comes back home, "Huddy, you're not going to believe what else I did!"

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 (Laughter)

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Get your telescope out now.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 So that proved that a boomerang still works in space.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 And James, you studied physics, right?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Yeah, but don't ask me how that works, because it doesn't feel like it should.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Yeah, because I'm curious if you...

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 OK, so one of the big problems with space travel

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 is having enough fuel to get you back right.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 And often we need to swing around planets and use their...

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Yeah, are you saying we should build our spaceships to look like boomerangs?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Shape like a boomerang, chuck them out into space.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Surely they return back to sender.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 But... (Laughter)

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 I mean, yes, obviously that would work.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Yeah, yeah, but...

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 We need to move on in the same place.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 Can I tell you one more daft invention?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 A military invention. This was the BE-9 plane.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Again, early days of flight, like the First World War or pre.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 So, right, you're in your plane.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 It's all two-man planes of that, you know, one pilot and one gunner.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Gunner traditionally sits behind the pilot, like shoots the gun behind.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Right, you want to fire forward though,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 but the problem is you would shoot the propeller.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 How do you solve it?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 Um, like back up to the enemy, so you can shoot that way.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 Fly backwards.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Yeah, reverse.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Yep. Good.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 I don't know, didn't they not...

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 I thought they shot between the blades, didn't they?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 They eventually worked out how to do that.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 This was their previous solution.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 We just put the gunner in front of the propeller.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 So, this plane was built and it flew.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 You've got a normal plane pilot, propeller on the front of the plane,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 and then in front of him is this mad box with the gunner sitting,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 with his gun sitting out the front of it.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Unfortunately, they cannot communicate at all.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 They just can't talk to each other because the propeller's in the middle.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Right.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 So, they're just sort of stuck, not talking to each other.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 They wouldn't need to. All that gunner's saying is...

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 And then it's a problem if he shits himself for the guy behind.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 Oh, God!

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 We are going to move on now to fact number two,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 and that is Anna.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 My fact this week is that the number four is two squared,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 the number eight is two cubed,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 and the number 256 is two zenzi-zenzi-zenzigt.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Yeah. Bet you didn't know that.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 You thought at first my fact was going to be the number four is two squared,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 and you got worried.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 But yeah, zenzi-zenzi-zenzigt is a thing.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 It's a great word.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 It is. It's not a common word.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 It was the word that was invented by a mathematician.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 A Welsh mathematician called Robert Record in 1557

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 in a book The Whetstone of Witt.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 And he got annoyed because, you know,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 we didn't have any way of saying to the power eight that was easy.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 We've all struggled with that, so he said...

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Did he say when we would need it?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Like outside of deep math?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 Yeah, I don't think he imagined in the shop, you'd ask for.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Can I have three zenzi-zenzi-zenzigt potatoes, please?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 No.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 But in deep math.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 And so he said, well, zenzig was the German for squared at the time.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 So for the power four, something to the power four,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 he said, let's say, zenzi-zenzigt, which is the square of squares,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 the power six, well, that's obviously the square of a cube.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 So it's zenzi-cubic.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 And then to the power eight, zenzi-zenzizendzigt.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 And if you really want to know, the power 16 is zenzi-zenzizendzizendzigt.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 And I find that very useful to know.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 The power 16, he didn't write that down, did he?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 It was someone else came along and went, oh, he could just add another zenzi.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Oh, really?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 He is an amazing guy, this Robert Record guy.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 I've never heard of him before.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 I mean, why would you have done it?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 He was a 16th century mathematician, but he was also a doctor.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 And he wrote maths textbooks.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 And get this, he invented the equals sign.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 Oh, I feel that deserve more.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 You know what we mean, right?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 You know, the equals sign.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Wait, what did they...

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 Lovely, thank you.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 But just, I think, actually, if I just put that to the end,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 I was like, wow, the people of Adelaide really love the equals sign.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 So what did we do before? Like, what were math tests like before?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 We used to write is equal to.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Yeah, but in Latin, you had to write equalis, which is the Latin for is equal to.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 And so in his book, he says to avoid the tedious repetition of these words,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 I will set, as I do often work, use a pair of parallels,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 because no two other things can be equal.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Two parallel lines is the most equal thing that you can get in the world

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 according to Robert Record.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 It's so cool.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 But he loves the stuff. Like, he brought linear...

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 The words linear, denominate, binomial, equation.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 He came up with definitions for square, compound, rational number,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 irrational number in English.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 He was the first to do all those things.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 And we don't really know about him,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 because no one gives a shit about any of those words, is that?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 I would say, like, to me, he's quite famous, someone who studied maths.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 OK, because I'd never heard of him.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And maybe if you were a doctor as well,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 because he also wrote loads of medical textbooks, including one called

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 the Urinal of Physics.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 The Urinal?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 The Urinal of Physics.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 And like, physicists and physicians.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 And it's about what doctors can learn from their patients urine.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Yeah?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 So this was a...

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 I read... Did you read it?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 I... No.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 But you did?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 I didn't actually read it.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Well, I've just had some issues lately, so I wanted to take a shed of your light.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 And he gives tips for collecting urine samples.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 And one of the things that confused me was, he said,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 when you're as a patient collecting your sample to give to the doctor,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 make sure you don't just give the watery bit and throw away the dregs.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 Because a lot of people do that.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 And the dregs are an important part of the urine.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 And I thought...

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 What are the dregs?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Dregs!

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Sorry, does everyone else have dregs in the bottom?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 If you had a bladder stone, you might have dregs.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Right, maybe they were very common back in the day.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 He said urine comes in three varieties, thick, thin and mean.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Red, white and rosé.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Mean was a third one.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 Weirdly, mean is just the one in between thick and thin.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 I suppose it's like the mean, the average.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 The average.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 And it also has three levels.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 The ground, brackets, the sediment, the swim and the cloud.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Okay.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 Which is quite nice, isn't it?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 I sort of... I see that.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Because it does have a little cloud, doesn't it, above it?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Yeah.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 Bubbles.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 It's like foam.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 A bit of foam, yeah.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Foam?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Yours doesn't foam.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Dan, get yourself to your urinal physician immediately.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 Yeah.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 It should have about an inch of foam on the top of it.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 It might do.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 It might be underneath all the dregs that I have floating on top.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 If you pour it slower, you don't get that amazing effect.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 So, yeah, you have to pour it at the right speed.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 The toilet at an angle.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Did you guys know that four used to be five?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 So, one, two, three, five, four?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Sort of.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 If you were reading it, that's what you think it would be.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Right.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 Because Arabic numerals first came to Europe in the 10th century.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 And it's really cool if you look at charts of how they've all progressed,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 the numbers one to ten, what they looked like.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 But basically, one, two, three, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 throughout the years are vaguely recognizable as how we would write them today.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 But then four was drawn like this weird curly B-shaped thing.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 And five was just written as we'd write four.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 And it was about 300 years that five was just written as four.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 And then eventually they sort of swapped around.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 So, if you do go back in time about 500 years and someone writes down to you,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 that they have five children.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 I know this is unlikely.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 That's useful.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Well, I'm trying to share some useful math tips.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 I thought that was interesting.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Dan was wondering before what used Zenziz-Zenzik could have,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 like, two to the power of eight.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Zenziz-Zenziz-Zenziz-Zenzik, the two to the power of sixteen,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 that is 65,536.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 That is a very useful number to remember,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 because that is the maximum number of characters you can use for one message in WhatsApp.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Really?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Really?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Really?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 How many?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 It's so high you've never reached it, right?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Did you test it?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Did you just keep writing until you got to the limit?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Why do you think I sent you all those messages yesterday?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 How many characters?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 65,536 characters.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 That's not words.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Not words.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Yeah, but it's effectively to a WhatsApp user,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 it's infinity because no one's ever going to reach it, right?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 I don't know, I leave some pretty long messages, you guys have very noticed.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 I reckon I'm coming, I just think I'm scraping the ceiling of that.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 It'll be like Twitter eventually, they'll be pressurised to double it.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Two to the power of 24, which is 16,777,216,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 is the number of unique colours you can see on most computer monitors.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 And two to the power of 32, which is just over four trillion,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 is the total number of possible IP addresses

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 under the original number of IP addresses.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Really?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 Yeah.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 It is useful.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 And two to the power of 136,279,841, minus one,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 is the largest known prime number, which was found just a couple of weeks ago, I think.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Well, maybe last week or, I'm not sure.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 How did they find it?

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Well, there was a guy called Luke Durant,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 and he sort of borrowed a load of computers from around the world in 17 different countries

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 and got them all running this computer programme together to look for prime numbers.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Oh, so it's beautiful.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 It's never just like this guy was counting,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 and then he thought, "Wait a minute."

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 He just reached the limit of the WhatsApp.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Did you guys see that mass news actually yesterday, which was,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 you know that old adage that if you left enough monkeys with enough typewriters,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 they'd eventually type out the works of Shakespeare?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Yes.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 Did you see that mathematicians have just worked out that they wouldn't?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 They worked out that if you got all the monkeys that we have,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 and all the monkey-like things...

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Yeah, but that's all the monkeys.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 There aren't that many monkeys.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Isn't it infinite monkeys with infinite types?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 It is infinite monkeys.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Or is it, like, however many monkeys we have access to?

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Yeah, do you know what...

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 That's such a boring calculation.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 It's quite interesting to know how many monkeys there are.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 These guys said, until the end of the universe,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 as many monkeys as there will be,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 and said that it almost is a one in a million chance it would happen.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 So you're right.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 With infinite, yeah.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 Okay.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 What would they come up with?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Because that's more interesting in a way.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 They said, "Sure, sir."

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 Probably.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Have you guys heard of the semiotic alliance?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 Oh, no.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 This is kind of cool.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 I was reading about, you know, Alex Belos, the mathematician.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 Yeah.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 He wrote a book about his adventures in math, basically.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 And he wrote about meeting this guy called Greg Rowland,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 who works at the semiotic alliance.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 And he basically provides consultancy for companies

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 on what number they should have in their product name.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 So he says KFC, 11 herbs and spices, is perfect.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Oh.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Like, 10 herbs and spices would be too dull and too round.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 And 12 is too spicy.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 It's much too spicy.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 And 11, perfect.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 Levi 501.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Interesting.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 501, bit more than, like, Levi 500 is a bit mechanistic, isn't it?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 It's a bit dull.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Right.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 And did he come up with these or are these just examples of...

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 He has consulted for various companies.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 I don't know if he says which he's come up with or which he hasn't.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 But he says WD 40, that's good.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 That's a reliable number.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 But that was actually his 40th attempt at making WD, whatever that is.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 What a displacement, 40th attempt.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 That's what it does.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 Right.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 He just came up with a reliable number.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 It was actually his 39th and he thought, "Fuck it, let's tip it over."

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 Shit.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 Why Andy?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 Why did he say 40 doesn't need...

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Well, it's solid, isn't it?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 It's reliable.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Right, okay.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 You know, you want a good product in your home.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 WD 37, fussy.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 WD 40.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 Because you're not looking something interesting and creative.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 You're looking for something reliable and boring.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Nice, okay.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 So I think there's a lot in this.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Okay, yeah.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 I don't know about a lot, but there's something.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 Hey, can I ask a quick question of the crowd?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 We mentioned this on a show ages ago and I got a lot of people writing in saying that

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 this is not true.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 But supposedly a measurement, a unit of measurement, often in Australia, if it's really tight,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 like if something like whisks past your ear, like it's that close, you describe that unit

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 of distance as a bee's dick.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 Yeah?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 You would say that.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 You missed it by a bee's dick, mate.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 Oh, great.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Because we said this on the show and I had a bunch of Aussies writing in saying,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 "Never heard that, that's bullshit."

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 I can imagine every other city in Australia going,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 "Yeah, but it's those guys in Adelaide, isn't it?"

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 They've got very badly endowed bees in Adelaide.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 We know that.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 My fact this week is that Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 has been translated into over 30 languages

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 under the same title, except in Denmark, where it was published as 233 Celsius.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Yeah, so it was published in over 30 different languages and every single one had either a

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 direct translation into the language or just used outright the title Fahrenheit 451.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 That's cool.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Except for Denmark.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 So do we know why the Danes did it?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Because I thought it might have been because Celsius was Danish,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 but he was Swedish.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Wasn't he the guy who came up with the Celsius chart?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Oh, and does Celsius?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 Celsius.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Was it just because they thought our people will understand that better, maybe?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 There's not an amazing amount of literature on what happened,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 and there's not many books as well.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 So when you go online, there's a few copies that you can see photos of

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 and collectors desperately try to get in.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 They all got burned.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 That was a sad thing.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Ironically, I think Ray Bradbury, from the little I could find,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 did not like that this had this new title, and so they did effectively...

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Really?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 He didn't like any changes, did he?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 I think that was it.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 Like, every now and then, his book would get changed very slightly in America

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 or something like that, and he hated it.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Yes, he hated the internet.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 He didn't want it published in e-book form, and he resisted for a long time.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 I think that's totally fair enough, given that the entire point of Fahrenheit 451

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 is that screens are really, really bad and totally ruin human society.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 I can empathise with him saying, "Please don't turn my book into a bookie."

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 It's so amazing, because when you read it, like, because I re-read it on the plane over,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 because I read it when I was younger, and the bit where they kind of explained the whole plot,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 they might as well be saying, "Tick-tock is shit."

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Do you know what I mean?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Basically, it's like, "All right, no one reads long things.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 Everyone wants shorter and shorter media, and no one's got a good attention span,"

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 and all that kind of stuff.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Yeah.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 It's a very good book. It's a brilliant book.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Obviously, it's a classic.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 It's great. He wrote it. I love this on a coin-operated typewriter.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 It's so cool. He wrote it in his local library at UCLA in California,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 and he carried a little bag of loose change,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 and if you put in ten cents, it would give you half an hour.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 So it cost him $9.80 to write.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 That's quite good.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 As a writer yourself, Andy, I don't know if you get writer's block,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 but do you think it would help you to churn out those words?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 I think it probably would, yeah.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 I'll try anything at this point.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Interestingly, churning out the words was a thing that he had a philosophy about.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 So he had eventually his own typewriter at home.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 He left the library, and above his typewriter,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 he would have the words "don't think,"

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 and it was a reminder for him to feel the stories,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 as opposed to sit mulling on them and getting stuck into writer's block effectively.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 That was his philosophy.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 And it certainly was what happened, wasn't it?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 I think three of us might have read it on the fly,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 but in the version that I read,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 he writes an introduction and he talks about the process,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 and he said, "I didn't write the book, it wrote me."

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 And he said, "The main character was the person who was speaking through me.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 It wasn't me speaking at all."

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 And it's amazing him describing the process.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 For a guy who is famous for his words, it wrote me.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 Look, he's not a great writer.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 It wrote me. No, it didn't, buddy.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 But he made a lot of weird claims.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 So that's quite mystical.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 A lot of authors do say that.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 They say sometimes an idea is downloaded into their head

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 and they are merely a vessel for whatever came to them.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 They channeled it.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 That's just because they plagiarized it from somewhere else, isn't it?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 Oh, no, it just came from there.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 I know it's quite similar to this.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 But he also made odd claims.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Like, he claims his memory was so good he remembers the moment of birth.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 And he would always tell this at dinner parties.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 He would say, "I remember being born.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 I remember coming out and being like,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 'Hey, he has full recollection.'"

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 And people would say, "No, you need to see a psychologist for it."

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 And he would, and he would tell them, and they couldn't dissuade him.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 He was saying, "I remember. I remember being circumcised.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Man, that was painful when I was six days old or whatever it was."

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 Wow.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Yeah, he had total recall of his life, according to him.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Yeah, wow.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Pretty cool.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 He had good recall, probably, according to him again.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 He said while he was in the library,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 he literally just tipped books down off the shelves,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 powered through them and remembered quotes.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 And, in fact, in Fahrenheit 451,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 there's a bit without giving away the ending,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 which assumes that once people have read a book,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 they can retain all of the words in it and then re-quote them at will.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Which is not true of me.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 People used to be able to do that, I'm sure.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 There's a verbal recall of what you'd seen

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 was fantastic before mass literacy.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 So, in Shakespearean times,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 you would remember a lot more of a speech from a played scene.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 So, you would be able to go home from this show tonight

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 and just do, like, big bits of the show all over again.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Lucky you.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Fahrenheit 451, by the way, which used to be called

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Fahrenheit 541, when four and five used to be different numbers.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 Of course, yeah.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 Well, the good thing about 451 is that it's one more.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 Like, it's a high 450, very bad title.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 Very boring, workman-like.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 He did decide on the title because it sounded good, though.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 So, I'd like to know what Alex Bellos had to say,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 because it was called "The Fireman" at first,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 and his publisher said, "Give it a better title."

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 And so, he called the local fire department, as you do,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 and said, "What temperature does paper burn at?"

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 And they said it's 451 Fahrenheit.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 And so, he thought, "That's a cool number."

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 But I wonder what number would have made him think, "Nah."

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Apparently, it doesn't burn at that.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Yeah, I've heard that.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 It depends on the type of paper and stuff.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 Right, I see.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 And it's off the top of his head, this poor fireman,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 and he's got fires to be putting out.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 He's just said the first things that comes to him.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 Do you guys want a little quiz of original titles for books

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 under which they should have been published?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 Andy.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 OK.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Let's say that's the jet lag talking.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 We're going to do it anyway.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 "Les dents de la mer."

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 Oh, "Les mers" are rather blah, blah, blah.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 No.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 "Les dents de la mer."

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 The teeth of the sea.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 Jaws.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Jaws.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 Jaws.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Jaws.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Wait, sorry.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 That was the original title in the English language.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 No, it was probably to French.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Sorry.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Someone said they were going to call it,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 "What's that noshing on my leg?"

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 That was his dad's suggestion.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 His dad or his father-in-law said that's a good title

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 when he was struggling for it.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 That is a good title.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 "Chocolate for breakfast."

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 This is quite guessable, I think.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 Oh, breakfast.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 No.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Chocolate for breakfast.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Yeah.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 Who's a sort of stereotypically messy, crazy character?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 Willie Wonka.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 And a good Charlie and the Chocolate.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 No.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Chocolate for breakfast.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 Like, who's a classic, like, crazy protagonist

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 who's always getting in scrapes?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Borat.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Yeah.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Yeah, Borat the novel.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 It's the novelisation of Borat.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 And the novel came first.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 Interestingly.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 Everything happens in the film.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 I prefer the novel, actually.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 Really?

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 Yeah, I think it's more true to the character.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 For me, the stage show?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Yeah, the stage show is very good.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Is it just William?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 It's Bridget Jones' diary.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 Sort of, you know, like, messy, messy character.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 OK, here's one.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Twilight.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Oh.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 Oh.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Well, Fifty Shades of Grey was based on Twilight.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 Dracula.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 Yes.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 So good.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 No, it was William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 No.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 It was called Twilight.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 Twilight was originally called Forks.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 But I couldn't find a novel that was originally called Forks

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 and changed to whatever the third one would be

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 to complete it.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 My favourite, just a super quick one on translations.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 The Mexican title for the movie Grease is Vaselina.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 So Temperatures.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 Fahrenheit, Celsius.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Yeah.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Sir Isaac Newton had his own version.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 And it was a temperature scale that only went from 0 to 12.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 And 0 was the freezing point of water.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 And 12 was his body temperature on the middle of the month of July.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 OK.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 And then he, like, he realised that this wasn't enough,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 because you'd need to go higher than that, right?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 So then he added higher numbers.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 So at 14--

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 We already had numbers higher than 12.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 It's not like he had to-- he was like--

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 Yeah, but he needed to define what they were

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 as the temperature, didn't he?

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 So, like, 14 was the greatest heat of a bath,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 which one can endure for some time

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 when his hand is dipped in and is kept in constant movement.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Oh, that does help.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Now that I'm picturing how I check a bath, that does--

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 You're not meant to test it with your hand anyway.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 You shouldn't be putting your hand in the bath.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 What do you test it with?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Elbow.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Elbow.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Which doesn't work, by the way, as any parent will tell you.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 Yeah.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 Thermometers used to be upside down.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 And this was Celsius himself

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 made his own thermometer upside down, idiot.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 It was just to make any sense in our minds, right?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 The boiling point of water was nought degrees

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 and the freezing point was 100.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 And what we call today is a Celsius scale

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 because someone flipped it shortly afterwards.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Linnaeus, in fact, flipped it.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 It was, but it was, yeah, I think two people suggested flipping it

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 and he was one.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 But I thought the reason that he did it upside down

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 was quite interesting and I didn't know.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 And it was because he was also very involved

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 in measuring the brightness of stars

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 and he came up with a much more accurate way

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 to measure the brightness of stars.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 And I didn't realise that we do that upside down.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 So a star's magnitude is inversely proportional

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 to how bright it is.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 So the brightest stars have the lowest magnitude.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 And that's literally just because Ptolemy,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 you know, a thousand years earlier,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 had said that should be the case.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 And so everyone copied him.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 And so Celsius was saying, OK, well, if stars,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 you know, the brighter they are, the lower they are,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 then we'll do the same with everything else.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 I like that.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 I think it's fine.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 I think as long as we're not using Fahrenheit, it's fine.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 I think Fahrenheit is such a stupid-- it's so stupid.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 No, but it's only America that is using Fahrenheit

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 in any big way.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 I think it's like a couple of other countries

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 that use Fahrenheit.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 I think Micronesia is still on Fahrenheit, to be fair.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Sure.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 But like, it's really bad.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 And America has tried to change.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Like, the French adopted Celsius partly

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 because of the French Revolution.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 Everything has to be sort of metricised

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 and, you know, made rational on all of this.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 And America, they actually passed a law,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 the Metric Conversion Act in 1975,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 which was beginning the process of metrification.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 It was going to be great.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 America was going to be sensible.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 And no one wanted to do it.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 And Ronald Reagan dismantled the board in 1982.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Well, they made it voluntary, didn't they?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 Which is the one thing you're not supposed to do with the law.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 You can't say, "Don't commit murder if you don't want to."

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 And that was basically what they said.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 They were like, "Change to Celsius if you want to,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 "but don't if you don't."

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 So everyone was like, "Well, I'm not going to then."

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 I just so did not expect that to be the answer to my question, just saying.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 I think they might have been there or thereabouts, basically.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 Right.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 I'm going to have to move us on, guys.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Can I just quickly...

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 I feel like we haven't covered enough

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 the kind of guy Ray Bradby was.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 Oh, yeah, okay.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 I didn't massively warm him,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 so I want to quickly tell you one thing about him,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 which is very representative.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 He was quite egotistical, which is clear when you read him.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 He kind of thinks everyone's an idiot

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 who is going to become braindead from TV,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 except a few academics have gone to Cambridge,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 is one way of reading the book.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 And he said he was really unhappy a lot of times in his teens,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 because he didn't fit in a lot of the time.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 And he said, "You pay a certain penalty for going your own way.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 You're not as popular with girls as you should be."

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 I used to take my short stories to girls' homes and read them.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 And they didn't want to hear about it.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 They just wanted me to pour at them how pathetic is that.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 And I just think a man who thinks the world is the problem

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 when he takes his short stories to a party

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 and reads them to a girl who doesn't like it is the problem.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Yeah.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 At the same time, when he died,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 he wanted his ashes to be sent to Mars in a soup can.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 So that's like a fun guy to me.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 OK.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 We need to head into our final fact, and that is Andy.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 My fact is that when young ants are sick,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 their mothers immediately eat them and recycle them into more ants.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 Mmm.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 There's no...

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 There's no like, "Oh, well, just go to sleep it off."

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 It's really like, "Right, this happens now."

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 And it's because if an infection spreads through a hive,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 it can be really dangerous, and there aren't many protections against it.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 And scientists tested this out by giving an ant queen a small fungal pathogen,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 and they would eat lots and lots and lots of infected larvae.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 Sorry, the larvae have been infected, and the ant queens just ate them,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 as well as 6% of controlled larvae which were not infected at all.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 And it's going to ask what a sick ant is like,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 but it funguses it.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Yeah, exactly, if they just have a bit of this on them.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 And as soon as the queen ant finds a sick larvae, she just starts chomping.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 And the queen ants, which did this and ate them,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 then produced lots more eggs.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 And it happens at the very first rifle.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 And that is those.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 So it sounds sort of crazy and frankly uncoined, but...

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 I read that the recycled ants have got better immune systems, as well.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 So actually, you eat them, and then they come back, and they're super ants, kind of.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 So why not keep eating and eating and eating and regurgitating and regurgitating?

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 I'd spend my whole life as a mother eating, remaking.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 And then you'll make Superman.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 I think it's like what we're doing with astronauts with them drinking their own urine and recycling.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 It's exactly like that.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 Yeah, it's like a recycling.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 So that's the future.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 Eat the infected astronauts in your boomerang spaceship,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 and we will be into the stars.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 Yeah.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 It's amazing with ants how primed they are to be aware of disease,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 and it makes, obviously, perfect sense because they live in gigantic colonies,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 where the moment someone gets sick, you've got to know about it, and you've got to deal with it.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 But I mean, queen ants also will eat their best friend.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 So I actually didn't realize this about ant colonies,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 but about a fifth of them are founded by a pair of queens, not just one, so there'll be two best pals

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 who get together and say, "Let's form a colony together."

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 If one of them dies, which sadly sometimes they do,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 the other one quickly chops them up into pieces

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 and buries all the pieces in different places,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 and that's to make sure that whatever infection it was cannot spread through the colony.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 But a tough job with your best friend.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 Yeah.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 I thought you said something.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 They ate them.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 Yeah, I thought so too.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 Sorry, they put them in their mouths to chop them into pieces, and then they bury them.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 I don't know why they don't eat them, actually.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 Maybe they don't taste very nice when they're raw.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 Well, because they might be infected with something.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Possibly.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 No, but the queen ants have protections.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 They have a special anti-venom gland, which they begin to massage.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 If they detect any illness, they just start massaging their gland.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 It's so amazing.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 They do it before and after.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Yeah, they're just there massaging this gland.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 They call it, I think it's a positive PR kind of spin on it.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 They call it hygienic cannibalism.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 So it's...

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 It's still not the word cannibalism in it.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 I think if you really want to go positive PR,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 get rid of the word cannibalism.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 But it's more appealing, isn't it, when you say,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 "No, it's hygienic cannibalism."

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 Yeah, it sounds like you're saying, "It's vegan."

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 No, it is.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 No, it is not vegan.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 But the ant queens are all single mums, or by and large.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 So they have a tough or gig.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 What? They're the queen.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 They can do what they want.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 They go very hungry to raise their workers.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 They will eat any old crap, though, ants, won't they?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Will they?

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 In 1904, there was a problem with ants in New Orleans.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 Right, it was a hospital.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 And they were completely overpowered with ants.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 There was millions and millions and millions of them.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 And so a group of entomologists went over there to see what they could do.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 A guy called Edward Titus was in charge.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 And he found that they were eating human sputum.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 Basically, there were a lot of tuberculosis patients.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 And so the ants would march, march, march, march,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 pick up someone's phlegm,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 and then march, march, march back to the nest and eat it.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 I feel like I've lost the audience.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 Yeah.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 The ants are going nuts for this, though.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 You just don't hear them.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 One thing that they'll do is they will not go to work.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 They'll take the day off if they're sick, right?

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 Yeah, because your mum's waiting at the office.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 But it's not amazing.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 They'll take sick days.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 So they will wait outside the nest if they feel they've got a cold

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 and they just let it pass so that they don't spread it, get killed,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 and then hygienically or non-hygienically dealt with.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Do we know how many malingering ants there are in the world?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 I know we do.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 40% of them aren't actually sick but just don't really like the job.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 No, we do. There are studies on this.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 So a study found in 2015 that 40% of all ants are doing nothing all day.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 They're not hardworking. They're very, very lazy.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 But it's not the same ants all the time, right?

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 No, this is the weird thing.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 The theory is actually they're in reserve.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 They're not needed at the moment.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 But if one of their colleagues gets ill or is eaten by the queen...

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 That's what I said when I was unemployed for six months.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 I'm in reserve.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 But the idea is basically they're living pantries.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 I mean, some of them might just be lazy.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 That is another theory that's currently going around.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 But a scientist called Dr. Daniel Chabonot worked this out.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 But he put dots of paint on particular ants, right?

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 He worked out which ones were the hardest working in the colony,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 and then he removed the hardworking ones.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 So, you know, this should have presented a work problem for the colony.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 Actually, if you remove the hardworking ones, others step up

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 and they fill their place.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 And so the same amount of work gets done.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 So the lazy ones are just hardworking ones waiting.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 They're smart.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 They're hardworking ones who know that someone else is going to do the shit.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 Yeah, good on them.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 They're very good at looking after they're injured, as well as they're sick.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 I think this is absolutely incredible about ants.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 They're often in big battles.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 It's usually ant against termites, so they'll attack termite colonies.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 And if an ant gets injured, it will get carried off the battlefield by its friends,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 because it's not useful in battle anymore.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 It will get evacuated back to the nest if it has an injury which is salvageable,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 where their lives can be saved.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 Their injuries are licked clean and they're left to rest until they recover.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 And amazingly, they've quite recently discovered that they do amputation.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 And not only this, but they...

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 Antiputations.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 Antiputations.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 I'll tell you what, by the time I edit that, that will be such a tight word.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 It's going to take so much editing.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 I always want to make you say it again.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 But I'll leave you to suffer.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Yes, they do amputations and...

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 How did you say that so well?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 And they know which amputations are most likely to be survivable.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 So scientists were really confused about the fact that ants only amputated injured ants' legs above the knee.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 So if they were injured in the thigh area, if they were injured below the knee, they would not amputate.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 So obviously, scientists being what they are took a bunch of ants and they amputated their legs below the knee.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 And lo and behold, they were like, "Oh, look, they all die."

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 Or they only had a 20% survival rate.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 I guess the other ants know this.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 But yes, because if you amputate below the knee, apparently the infection spreads more easily because of the way the blood's pumping round.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 And they know this.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 I think you do get wound care in the form of licking if your lower leg is injured.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 Oh, you still get wound care?

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 Yeah, that's the advice.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 What's interesting is, when they were doing this study, they were trying to work out if it was empathy that was bringing them back.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 They discovered that it's not because if an ant was passing an injured ant, not in battle, on the way to the battle,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 they would just be like, "Okay, see, there was nothing that made them want to care about it."

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 So what it largely was is that they need their army numbers up.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 And so bring them back.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 They can recover in a few days and they're back out again, back into the war zone.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 Oh, interesting.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 A lot of the battles around Tonantant, they had the moment.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 You have lots of these big colonies.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 There was a group, a couple of groups in Southern California, the very large colony and the Lake Hodges colony.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 And they were in a battle for six months.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 And it was over a line that was just a few centimeters wide, but it was several kilometers long.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 And 15 million ants died in a six-month period, which is equivalent to most of the highest estimates of the number of people who died in World War I in the human wars.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 But there are 20 quadrillion ants on Earth.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 We almost got to find out what life was like as an ant, because it was this amazing game that was pitched a few years ago called Ant Simulator.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 And it was a Kickstarter or one of those crowdfunding campaigns where they raised a bunch of money for it.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 And unfortunately--

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 They realized that it would be incredibly boring.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 Well, no.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 I mean, I think it's funding really quickly.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 Everyone thought it was an amazing idea.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 They couldn't do it because his two other business partners took the money and, according to reports, spent it all on booze and strippers.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 And so he had to write to everyone saying, "I'm sorry, the money's gone on a porch, like hangover, movie-style weekend."

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 He just saw a huge wallet being carried slowly past his office away from him.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 Can I say something about-- we've talked a lot about ant war.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 Can we talk a bit about ant peace?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Yes, please do.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 Ant can make yogurt.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 Is that nice?

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 Is that an inherently peaceful product, yogurt?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 I think it's about as peaceful as it gets.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 Yeah?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 Is it?

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 Do you do it out--

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 I mean, if you make them make yogurt.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 If you drop live ants in milk, you get yogurt eventually.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 Oh, really?

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 That's got quite violent again quite quickly.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 No, you're right.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 But this is a traditional method around the world of making-- like Turkey and Albania and Bulgaria, this is how you make yogurt.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 It's a recognized method.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 It's as few as four ants in a picture of milk.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 What happens?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 They release formic acid, and that makes it acidify and then coagulate, and you end up with yogurt.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 So, I mean, can this sometimes happen accidentally?

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 I mean, I'll leave an open bottle of milk in the fridge sometimes, and would it be that I've got fromage fray at the end of the day?

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 If you've got ants in your fridge, it could happen.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 I think some people, when this study came out, some people suggested that that might have been where yogurt came from.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 Like, accidentally some ants fell into some milk once, and they went, "Oh, let's do this properly."

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 Yeah, I buy that.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 I do buy that.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 Do you?

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 Well, you leave your milk out, don't you?

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 And then you get your ants-- I can see how it would happen, unlike most inventions, which happen by mistake.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 We're going to have to wrap up, guys.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 What's the fastest you can spin any part of your body?

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 Like, move it in an arc, let's say like a baseball player moves their arm in an arc.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 I mean, there is a very naughty thing called the helicopter, which--

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 You reckon you can do that quicker than a baseball player can spin their arm or something like that?

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 Well, yeah, I think the thing I'm using is smaller, so I think it can make the turns quicker.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 It can go as fast as a bee's dick.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 I'll tell you what the fastest thing you can do, and it's this.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 So when you click your fingers, the rotational speed is 20 times faster than the blink of an eye.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 It's the fastest thing.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 Dracula ants can do a similar thing by moving their thorax.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 They kind of-- they make a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure, and then release it.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 They snap their body.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 They snap their body, and they can do it 1,000 times quicker than you can click your finger.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 Okay?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 And they do it to stun centipedes.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 Wow.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 So centipedes coming along, they go, and the centipede goes, "What the fuck was that?"

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 But at the time they've done that, they bug it off.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 It's like, it's as if you could, like, go into a field and click your fingers and the cow would fall over.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 I thought you--

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 Oh, the dream, the dream.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 Is that what you mean, though?

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 It's not-- it's not-- they literally stun them into, like--

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, stun them, like--

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 I thought you meant they're like, "Whoa, whoa, what was that?"

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 I thought I meant-- that was fabulous. That was absolutely-- I'm stunned. I'm stunned.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 So every ant is Darren Brown, basically, going, "Look into my eyes, look into my eyes, look into my eyes."

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 You're under, and that's it.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 That is it. That is all of our facts.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 We can't thank you enough, Adelaide, for having-- this is our first bit of the Down Under Tour,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 and it's been awesome. Thank you for having us.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 We will be back again.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 And we will also be back again next week with another episode. We'll see you then.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 Good bye!

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 (cheering and applause)

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 (upbeat music)

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.580
 (upbeat music)

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.160
 (upbeat music)
