00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski, and once again we've gathered around the microphones this time with our four favorite winter facts for our winter special as it's really cold and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Starting with you, Anna Chazinski.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 My fact this week is that Socrates had a spirit who spoke to him through the medium of sneezing.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 And this is one of the great thinkers of western civilization, just to be clear.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 I was guided by sneezes.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Aristotle wrote about sneezing as well.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Did he?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Yeah, so he said that sneezing was of divine origin, or he said that that was believed at the time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 So coughing wasn't, and if your nose was running that didn't mean anything.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 But he said, why is it that we think sneezing is divine?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Is it because it arises from the most divine part of us, the head, from where reasoning comes.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 But there's one other thing we know about Aristotle as well, which is that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 He was one of the people who, when they look at a bright light, they sneeze.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Oh, did he?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Yeah.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 And there's weirdos.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Socrates sneezing, and it only affects between one in three and one in ten people.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 But we know that he was one of them, because he said, why does this happen?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 How if we not managed to pin that down to a more precise statistic?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 How hard is it to interview a hundred people and find out if it's one in three or one in ten?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 I'll tell you why it's weird, because people like me who don't have this until they meet someone who has it,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 think that it's completely made up.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 You think, how is that even possible?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 And then people who have it think that everyone has it.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Wow.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 I've found in the past.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 I'm sure that's not...

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 I thought I've read it, because I haven't.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Yeah.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 I don't believe, I don't believe it's possible.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 I need to pee when I'm around books.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Is that a thing as well?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 That's why you're banned from foils.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 No, that is a thing.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Is that a thing?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Is it not a Japanese thing about, there's a word, which means the impulsion that you want to defecate in a life?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 It's an arrico aoki phenomenon.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 That's right.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 It's called, and it's named after the only ever sufferer of the history.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 And till now.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 But the rumor has loads of books in it, don't it?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 This must be a nightmare for you.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 You're constantly on edge.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 The cleaners of this office have a rough time at the weekend.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 There's a wiki page of what to say if people sneeze around the world.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 In Albanian, you say the Albanian word for health.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 It's quite similar around the world.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 You quite a lot of people say for health, or God bless you.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 In Amharic, they say may God forgive you.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 In Azari, they say be healthy.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 And in the Rithangu language of Australia, they say class bin kuruan, which means you have released nose water.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 I found that page as well.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 And the Filipino response to it.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Almost all of them are, you know, God bless you.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 You may God forgive you.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 God have mercy on you, sort of whatever.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 The Filipino response is to say, now Ligo akoa, which means, hey, I took a bath.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 What?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 I don't just say I took a bath in your mucus.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 I took a bath. No, I think it's I took a bath and now you sneeze, don't I?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 I have to take another one.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And the response from the sneezer is, who didn't take a bath?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Or maybe it's who didn't take a bath?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 I think that sounds like, you know, when if someone sneezes on you and we used to say his kids was,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 I asked for the news, not the weather.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Oh, that sounds similar to that.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Yeah. Just on sneezing, dog sneeze.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Do they?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Yeah.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 And what's interesting is they do it when they encounter another dog, but they actively sneeze.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 So they sort of fake sneeze in order to show that they're not aggressive.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 To say that they're just want to hang.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Really?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Yeah. So it's a sort of showing that they're friends.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 I found this on canineuniversity.com.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Did you know?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 No, the only university run by dogs, four dogs.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Spun just sneeze.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 What?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 How does that work?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 They, some of them have little chimneys which they can expel stuff out of and if they get something stuck in their bodies,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 then they can fire it out with a bit of a kind of puff of air.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 Is that what like a blowhole is for a whale?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 They're just sneezing out their back.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 No, a blowhole is like them breathing.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 But whales do.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Sometimes I thought they actually expel.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Like, and for example, isn't that how they now find out whether a whale is ill?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 They'll have a sort of a drone helicopter go over to catch snot.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 So they must be rocketing mucous out of their blowholes.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Yeah, but in the same way that you're rocketing mucous out of your mouth all the time.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Yeah.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 And moving your breath.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 I think a lot of the things dance as a very sensible joke.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 But in your breath, you'll have tiny particles of like mucous or spitter or whatever and the same way that they would.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Oh, okay.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 So they're not trying that.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 If they have whale flu, maybe then it would be, it would be more mucousy, I guess.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Which whale flu is I think?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Which, theoretically could pass over to you.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Really?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 No.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Yeah.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 I read the other day that there was a whale who died because he got a fish stuck in his blowhole.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Oh.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 That sounds like a horrible euphemism.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 That sounds like you've gone to the hospital with a hoover attached to your genitals.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Just swam in there.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 I was asleep.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 So this fish has been dead for three days.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Sneezing.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Sneezing, yeah, I should say that it's very hard to know what's true and what's not about Socrates.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 And this is an account by Plutarch, which is a couple of centuries later.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 So all these people followed Socrates around writing down everything he said because Socrates refused to write anything down himself.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 So Plato is his main disciple who wrote loads of stuff about him and then Xenophon wrote loads of stuff.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And they sort of refused to ever acknowledge each other's presence except they would have slide digs at each other's work when they wrote about Socrates.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 So, you know, it's thought they had a bit of a rivalry going.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Did Socrates have a really junior disciple who would just have to write down shopping lists and stuff like that?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Yeah.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Possibly.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Actually, he did have one called Simon the shoemaker who sounds kind of junior.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 What did he do?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 What did he do?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 He actually made Socrates socks.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Did he?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Yeah, weird.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Oddly.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Did they have shoes back then or sandals?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 What have been sandals?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 They did have shoes and ancient.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 I mean, they had democracy down.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 One of the other things about Socrates is sneezing was supposedly the sneeze demon would notify him with a sneeze or someone else sneezing when his wife was about to have what's been translated as a scolding fit.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 So he could run away.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Because apparently she's life's Zanthippy wasn't she?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Yeah.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 And she's famously like a scolder.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 She's like Maris in Frazier.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 And supposedly she got so angry that sometimes she would turn over the supper table even if there were guests.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Oh, my God.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Yeah, so I think she was like the Hulk.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 I wonder if she went to that.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 The angry table flip.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 I've never done that and it's my dream to one day do it properly.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 They really got there with everything before us.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Obviously.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 That's the same dimensions we don't talk about.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Zanthippy was supposedly the only person who ever beats Socrates in an argument.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 It was said.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Really?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Yeah.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 And he could speak and after one argument she poured a what do you call it?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 A chamber pot over his head.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And it led him to remark after the thunder comes the rain.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 And that's supposed to be a clever thing that he said.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Even invented.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 I asked for the news not the weather.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Okay, time for fact number two.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 My fact is that people used to hang their fridges from the ceiling.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 What people.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 And why?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Because.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 To create more room on the floor.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 No.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 To stop vermin from getting at your food.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 You suspend it from the ceiling like a bird feeder, but it's a person feeder.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 And this was I think in the 17th and 18th centuries.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Even into the 19th century I think people were so.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 So basically just before they got fridges.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Pretty much, yeah.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 It was called a meat safe.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 So it didn't actually involve artificial refrigeration.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 But it was the precursor to the fridge basically.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Some are like a ladder kind of thing.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Exactly.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Yeah.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 And so you would just get a box made of wood or metal with perforated sides.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 And you would hang it from the ceiling.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Really?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Some people mounted theirs on the wall.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 And some people just put them on the floor with long legs.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Right.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 So meat safes had doors.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Yeah.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Yet they still had to keep them off the ground because of vermin.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Yeah.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 They can chew through.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 I think they could be chewed through if they were wood or things.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 But basically the original safe was for keeping meat in.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Yes.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Oh really?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 So that's before they had safes.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Yeah.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Not only in stuff.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Yeah.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 People were quite against refrigeration when it sort of came in.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 So in the early 1900s when we started being able to transport ice in big batches.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 And we'd start creating refrigerator compartments to transport food.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 People were against it for two reasons.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 So I think this was mainly in America.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 It was quite interesting.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 They thought that first of all it meant that sellers of produce could manipulate the market.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Because now you could preserve food.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 You could create like an artificial scarcity.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Yeah.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 And then cause the prices to go up and then sell it for more.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Oh wow.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 And it also meant fewer end of the day bargains.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Because you didn't have to sell your food at the end of the day.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 So people often bound from refrigerating their foods overnight and preserving them

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 until the next day to sell them.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Because men, you couldn't do those things.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 And in fact also they thought that it meant food wouldn't be as fresh.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And so in 1880 I think one of France's most successful fruit wholesalers

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 was this guy called desu ghee or decou ghee.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 He used to transport his fruit all over France in trains and sell it everywhere.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 And he started refrigerating it in the in the trains in a cold chamber for advice.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 When people found out he was refrigerating it they were so outraged that

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 because it meant that his fruit wasn't fresh anymore because he put it in a cold chamber.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 That he had to invite people to a public ceremony in a public square where he burned the fridge.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 And agreed never to refrigerate food again.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Wow.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 And everyone got food poisoning.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 In France.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Yeah, it was when they used to get ice from lakes, didn't they?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 One of them was lake venom which was the most famous lake in the world in the 19th century.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Because they got ice there and they took it all the way around the world.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Was that the one in Massachusetts?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Yeah, it's near Boston.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Yeah.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 And now it's just like a reservoir, it's fenced off, you're not allowed to go there.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 It's just like a little rubbish reservoir.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 But it used to be the most famous lake in the world.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Because all the ice came from?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Yeah, and it was really, really clear, really seemed clean.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Somewhere in May for I think they used to keep some in a shop window with a newspaper behind it.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 So you could read the newspaper to show how clear it was.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Yeah.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 The first time they brought any over to the UK.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 They didn't know what to do it, what to tax it.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Because it was ice, they didn't know whether it was water or it was a solid oil.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 They didn't know whatever and they kind of spent about two months trying to work out and it all melted.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 And then there was in Sweden, they had a lake as well, which had really good ice.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And they renamed their lake, I think it's called Opus Guard or something.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 They renamed their lake Lake Venom, so that they could say they had lake Venom ice as well.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Wow.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Smart move, Swedes.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Yeah, I think that was, it was a guy called Frederick Tudor, who became known as Frederick,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 the ice king of the world, Tudor, who first decided, who first realised he can make his fortune out of getting all this ice off Lake Venom.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 And then he paired up with another guy who invented the ice plow, which I think is really cool.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 So you had horse-drawn ice plows in the 1830s, I think it was, which would go up and down the lake.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Cut and it would cut the ice into big blocks, so you didn't have to cut it by hand anymore.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 Yeah.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 This is really interesting.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Refrigerators, this is the line I read online.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Refrigerators have been used successfully to artificially hibernate many animals.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Snakes, lizards and even bats have been hibernated in domestic refrigerators.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 So, and this gives you a whole protocol of how you can hibernate artificially an animal of yours if you ever turtle or if you have a lizard.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Certainly why I bought my fridge.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Yeah, but I just didn't know that was possible.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 But they say that what the fridge will not do, definitely, is if it drops below what you're meant to have it as, as the hibernation coolness, it will kill the animal.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 So you've got to be really careful.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 I'm not sure we're advising people to do it though, are we?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Certainly still on a different shelf to the yogurt.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 There are two really dangerous things about fridges, really dangerous.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 The fact that the London fire brigade says that fridge freezers aren't the most dangerous household appliance when it comes to starting fires.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 They cause the most deaths.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 It's because they have a lot of plastic and flammable insulation and a lot of ice.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 And you would have thought, but not enough.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 When they turn up, you don't use ice.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Yeah, but ice when heated turns to water.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 And they do use water.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Because if there was a fire brigade who used ice, you could fit ring 999 or something.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 This is a really serious fire guys.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 They turn up with the horse ice plow.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 It's so many blockages in your hose pipe.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 So anyway, that's one dangerous thing about fridges.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 They're going to explode, set fire to your house.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 The other one is, so four in every five US fridges has fridge magnets on it.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 And I don't have the stats for the UK, but I would guess similar.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 And a lot of fridge magnets are so strong that if you have a pacemaker, can have deadly consequences.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 You walk past pacemakers and it disrupts the, or it can completely disrupt it.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 That's pretty strong fridge magnet, so right?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Apparently, you have to put warnings on a lot of fridge magnets now.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Because the fridge magnets do tend to be stronger than your standard magnet.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 Wow, wow, there's not enough space on a fridge magnet for a warning.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 As in that way, if you had a, oh, on the package.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 It would ruin the witty phrase.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 That's what I'm saying.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Walk a mile and someone else is shoes.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Then you'll be a mile away.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 And be wearing their shoes.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Brackets.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 Do get a lot of pacemakers in that.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Touch the internet these days.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Oh, yes.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Yeah, those kind of things.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 I don't really know what it does.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 What it does is you can do a number of things like it has a scanner.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 So anything that you put in, you scan the food that goes in.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Yeah.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 And then you run out of, you run out of milk and it knows you've run out of milk.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Well, it's part of the internet of things.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Yeah.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 And there was in 2014, there was the first hacking scandal where people were hacked through fridges, weren't they?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Yeah.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Really?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 750,000 phishing emails were sent from fridges to people's email accounts.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 Wow.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 I thought when you sort of said hacking into fridges that you'd just steal a banana or something.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Because that would be kind of hacking I'd be interested in.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 We have 500 kilograms of beef in the Nigerian accounts that we would like to send over to you.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 But yeah, I think that's really cool that we might be able to be hacked through all of our household gadgets.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Oh, fantastic.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 I can't wait for my own bedside lab to turn against me.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 Okay, time for fact number three.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 And that is my fact.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 My fact this week is that TV star David Frost used to host live shows eight nights a week.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Fantastic.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 David Frost.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Yeah, so this is the time zone thing.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 It is.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 It's surprisingly true.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 David Frost used to host a lot of night shows and afternoon shows.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 And what he used to do was do four shows in England.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 And then he would take Concorde over to New York.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 And Concorde famously bragged that you would often arrived before you left.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 And that allowed him to then do a show that night as well.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 And so he managed to do eight shows per week.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Very impressive.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 Yeah.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 So he used to just go back and forth on Concorde doing night shows.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 You could do these days because it takes like eight hours to get to New York.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Exactly.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Since Concorde has gone, this has become impossible.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 I don't think I appreciated enough of the time because I guess I was too young.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Concorde was extraordinary.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 He used to go over my house when I was very young.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 Yeah, I remember this amazing sound of it.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Yeah.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 When faster than a rifle bullet, I think.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Wow.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 So if you fired a bullet at the retreating Concorde, Concorde would accelerate away.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Wow.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 Wow.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Faster than the rotation of the earth.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Yeah.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 1,350 miles an hour is the top speed.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 I mean, it was twice the speed of sound, wasn't it?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 It wasn't like they just broke the speed of sound.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 I thought, well, let's linger around one or two miles an hour above it.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 They doubled it.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Yeah, they went twice.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 You're right.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 It's amazing.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 And they used to fly at a sort of altitude of 50 to 55,000 feet.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 People used to say that you could see the curvature of the earth when you're at that height.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Yeah.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 Which is astonishing.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 So cool.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 One of the most amazing things about it was that it had, I'm quoting here from an article about

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 a computer controlled engine air intakes, right?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Now, that doesn't sound very cool, but it is because what it means is that the air going into

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 the engine had to be slowed down by 1,000 miles an hour over a distance of 15 feet.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Wow.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 Yeah.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 It comes in at 1,300 miles an hour or whatever it might be.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 And it has to be slowed down only over four meters.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 That's whiplash.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 That air has serious whiplash.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 And without it, the engines just sort of blown up immediately.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 But that was the cool thing about it.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 It's the kind of fact you do not want to be told if you're me or down and it's about to take off.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 If we didn't do this, the engines would explode immediately.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Fortunately, we think it's going to go okay.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 Andy Warhol used to steal all of the items on the plane, sort of like little plates and silverware

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 and so on because he knew that it would be collectible.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 For some reason, like he just thought it would be collectible.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 And so he encouraged people.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 No excuse for stealing.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Yeah.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 I know a lot of stuff in the British Museum is collectible.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 There's an app sailed in there in the middle of the night to get it.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 Let's go to David Frost, shall we?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Yeah.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 He was offered a contract to play for Nottingham Forest, but he turned it down because the maximum wage for a football player at the time was £15 a week.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 And he predicted Concord and his desire to travel on it eight times a week.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 That's not going to sustain me.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Yeah.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 But obviously in those days before Jimmy Hill, there was a maximum wage for footballers.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And so it wasn't a very good profession to go into.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 We should just very quickly for younger listeners and people who made just a never heard of David Frost explain who he was.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 So he died not too long ago.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 He was a TV host.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 He used to do interviews very famously interviewed Richard Nixon.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 And there's a movie, Frost Nixon, which won a lot of awards.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 And he was just one of those guys that seemed to know everybody and be around for every major event on TV.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Some of his TV shows that he did.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Yeah, can I read a few out?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Yeah, go for it.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 A degree of Frost, the Frost report, Frost over England, Frost over America, Frost weekly, the Frost interview breakfast with Frost, talking with David Frost, headliners with David Frost, the David Frost show, Frost on Friday, Frost on Saturday, Frost on Sunday,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 the Frost program, Frost on sketch shows, Frost on interviews, Frost on satire, Frost tonight and Frost.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 But not a touch of Frost.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Wow, he really made the most of that name.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Yeah.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Was he paranoid people were going to forget it or something?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 There's a bit strange.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 There's a good name for an interviewer and a host or something, because it's a noun which is good, but it's not a bad noun like words.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Worms on Sunday, first with worms.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Touch of worms.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 We actually, so James and I, this show that we do, Museumicuriosity, we actually had Frost on the show.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 And weirdly, it was the last program he ever did.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Yeah, so Museumicuriosity, his appearance on that is his final appearance. It was quite amazing.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Because he was on the airways for more than 50 years, wasn't he?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 And constantly as well. I don't think you could escape him in the 70s, '70s, '80s.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Do you know what the longest career of any presenter in history was, according to the Guinness Book of Records?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 Is it someone in Japan?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 No.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 Someone in Cuba.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 I was close.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 She's called In Yes, Sanchez de Revuelta, and she was on TV for 52 years.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 She hosted the program Teleclub since 1963, and has never been off TV for more than 3.5 months all the time.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 That's something, isn't it?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 I really hope you're going to say more than 3.5 minutes.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Just for bathroom breaks and naps.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 While I was reading up on Nixon, just came across those facts.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Nixon used to love fireplaces. He used to love a roaring fire.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 So he used to at the White House make sure that there was always a fire roaring in the Lincoln room.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 The thing is, though, is that he was never interested in the heat.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 He just loved the fire.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 So he used to have all the aircons turned on to high in any room that he had a fire on.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Wow.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Yeah, because he just didn't, he was...

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 He just liked the sound and the look of it.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Yeah, he just wanted a roaring fire.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Just get a picture.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 You think?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 Yeah, well, much more environmentally friendly.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 If there's a fire going, it's easier to conceal the noise of the tapes being changed in the machine.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 You're recording people.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 It's offical as ever.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 He also, more weird behavior from Nixon, after his dog checkers died,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 a secret service agent saw him eating the dog biscuits.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 No, they didn't.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Really?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 But the crunching of the dog biscuits helps disguise the sound of the changing of the tapes.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 I'm frostsaid when he came on this on museumic curiosity that when he did the interviews with Nixon,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Nixon was the worst person for small talk.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 He had no small talk whatsoever.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 So it was so weird that he used to insist before any interview, five minutes of small talk.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Nixon would insist.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 Nixon would insist that he had five minutes of small talk with the person before an interview.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 But he just didn't know.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 In theory, that sounds like a good idea because you get to, you know, relax and, you know.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Yes, but so frost remembers those bits of small talk and he said they were truly awkward

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 because he just didn't know what to say.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 One thing he said when he came up to him was getting he fornicating done on the weekend.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 That was his opening line.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 Actually, he's speaking of fornicating.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Nixon once had delivered to him a naked woman and a trunk in a suitcase.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 Yes. And this was when he had a couple of kind of hard partying friends.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 So apparently with the only kind of people he properly relaxed in front of.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 He was notoriously uptight usually.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 And there's this guy called Robozo who can't believe that's his name.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 I've just read that and realized how ridiculous that is.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 So there's a guy called Robozo and his friend Amplenalp.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 These guys would never have had the same career as Frosthouse.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 Breakfast with Robozo.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 So yeah, they got a prostitute, I think, and got her into a suitcase and brought her to the White House

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 and bumped into the Secret Service agents.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 And we're like, we've got a delivery for Nixon.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 And unfortunately the Secret Service agent said, what is it?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 I thought there's a naked woman inside there and turned them away at the door.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 But so he never got his gift.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 A woman to do their job and not letting Robozo and Alpano get one of their capers away.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 There's a series of books about Robozo and Alpano's crazy adventures.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 It's always just another naked prostitute and some other kind.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 We're just here to give this wedding cake.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 We're just here to install this new chimney.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Okay.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Time for a final fact of the show and that is James.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 My fact this week is that the original chill pill was a pill that you took

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 when you had a chill.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Nice.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 That was a very good sort of thing.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 So yeah, this is from, let's say, 19th century.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 It was like a homemade pill that you would make.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 The ingredients would be sulfur quinine, arseneous acid, striccanine, prussian blue, and capsicum.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 And you would shove it all together into a pill form.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 And then you would take it if you had a cold.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 And was it cool?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 It was called chill pill.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 It was called a chill pill, yeah.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Cool.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 So yeah, that was the original chill pill.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 And the use of the word chill as in to relax only dates back to 1979.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 It dates back to a song called Rappers Delight, which is apparently by Travis Sicktrix, Isaac.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 Well, Rappers Delight, you will know.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 It's probably the most famous rap song all the time.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 It's like one of the first ever rap songs.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Yeah, it's a hip hop.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 A hippy, a hippy, a hippy, a hip hop hop.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 You don't stop rapping.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 Yeah.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 It's mentioned 14 times in the OED that song.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Wow.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 In the Oxford English dictionary.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 It's the first time that anyone used the word rhyme as in a set of lyrics, as in listen to my rhyme.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 The first time anyone used the word rapper to refer to someone who's rapping previously,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 it would either mean a massive lie, or it would mean someone who like wraps a table or something.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Wow.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 And it was the first place to use MC as in master of ceremonies.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Wow.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 So were people just listening to this song at the time going, "What is this guy talking about?"

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 No, as usual, these things were used, but this is the first citation that they have.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 Also, the first use of the word ill, meaning bad.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 But meaning good?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 Meaning good, it was seven years later.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 So it took seven years for ill to mean bad as in this is, "Oh, this is really ill, man."

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 Two meaning good, which is, "Oh, this is really ill, man."

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 I just wanted to point out that you can't pull off either of those phrases.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Did you say the date of the original chill pill?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 1879, but any time over the next 20 years, they still were making it.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 You know, because obviously a lot of wacky medicines were peddled in the 19th century, not all effective, and in pill form.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 And one of the most successful peddlers of these medicines was someone who made brandrists vegetable pills,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 which could fight off basically everything you'd ever have.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 So fever, sickness, headache, pimples, ulcers, yellow fever, and essentially they were just laxatives.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 And so the whole thing was that the point was that they got all impurities out of you.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 So I think one of the taglines was, "Brandrists pills put all your pains and impurities out of the system through the bowels."

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 But it was Charles Brandrist's great grandfather.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Really?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Who got really rich off them? Yeah, he gets, there's a street named after him in New York now, because he became so rich and famous because of these pills.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 And he gets a mention in Moby Dick, apparently.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 Really?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Wow.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 Charles Brandrist's great grandfather. Isn't that cool?

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 It's so weird when you hear about celebrities with a great, great, great, great grandfather who was notable.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 Yeah.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Like you just think, "Wow, that's just..."

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 I was reading Bear Grills' autobiography on holiday, and his great, great, great, great grandfather.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 I don't know how many grates wrote the very first self-help book.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 And it was called self-help.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Really?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Yeah. And it was so big in its day that it outsold on the origin of species, which is when it came out roughly at the same time.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Yeah.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 I can remember his name.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 That's it.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 I don't know that he was related to Bear Grills.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Directly related.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Wow.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Oh, with a name like Samuel Smiles, it's the ideal profession, isn't it?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Yeah.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 As is Bear Grills, if you want to be, you know, someone who lives in the wild.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 There is an amazing...

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 He'd be better if he was called Grills Bear.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 Yes.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 I think he called that.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 He is when he fills in forms.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 [laughter]

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Another weird relation I found out about speaking of that, actually, the other day, is that...

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 Is it Stephen Dubner, the guy from Freakonomic?

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Yes.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Who we love and think is great.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 His grandfather or great-grandfather wrote Rudolph in a Red Nose Reindeer?

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Did he?

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Did he?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Yeah.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 Wow.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 So I was looking up some slang terms of things that are older than you'd think they are.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 So, for example, the word "text" as a verb goes back to 1564.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Does it?

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Wow.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Yeah.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Obviously, it doesn't mean to write a text on a mother phone.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 It means to quote texts.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 And "dude" goes back to 1876, which was originally to make fun of a woman.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 The way a woman was dressed, you'd say, "Oh, she's a dude."

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 And there was even a feminine version of it.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 "Dudeine."

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 It was after "Dude became a male word."

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 And you'd say, "Right."

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 And there was this thing, "Jo went east and married a young dudeine out there."

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Wow.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Can't believe men hogged that.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 One of the few, you know, quite cool, fun nouns that's been applied to us.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And you guys had to get in there.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Clutch it away.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Now we're stuck with "Dude debt" or "Dudeine."

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 One slang term that I was reading about.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 "Kawa Bunga."

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 So, what do you associate "Kawa Bunga" when it was written into Turtles?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 Yeah, it was a Japanese word.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Is it not?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 So, I haven't done the total origin on this.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 It's just that I watched a documentary on the Ninja Turtles and they said,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 "The writers took "Kawa Bunga" from Snoopy."

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Did that really?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 It's a "Kawa Bunga" first appears in Snoopy.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 Really?

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Yeah.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 I think on a cover where Snoopy's are on a surfboard as well.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 Wow.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 That's very cool.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 Yeah.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 I looked up a timeline of slang terms.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 By Jonathan Green, who is an amazing slang-lexicographer.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 It's a complete slang dictionary.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 It's so good.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 So, he's done these really cool online slang terms for all sorts of different things.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 So, just idly, I was looking at slang terms for vagina over the centuries.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 These all date from the 19th and 20th century.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 Coffee grinder.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Front parlor.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Bumshop.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 Carnal man trap.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Central office.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 Bit on a fork.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 And my favorite.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 That thing.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 It kind of makes you sound like we used to repurpose vaginas for a lot of other things.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 Well, I sell my wares out a bit in the daytime.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 I sell my coffee grinder out of the front parlor.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 I use it as a central office.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Off to the bum shop.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 A really interesting thing on pills.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Here's that.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 So, the colour of the pill you're swallowing can affect how well it works.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 If you take a blue pill you wake up and you're bed and everything's the same.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 If you take the red pill.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 That's where a movie got the matrix.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 I get some of the references.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 Now, this is a placebo effect thing.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 So, red pills are more effective for treating pain.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 It's been found.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 Blue pills are more effective for pills to calm you down to have calming effects.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 And there's an exception to this.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Blue pills are more effective tranquilizers except for Italian men.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 It's been suggested that this could be because blue is associated with their football team.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 And so, with these football team.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Italian football teams.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Yeah.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 So, Italian men see a blue pill and just get really overexcited because it reminds them of their football team.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 That's genuinely what the researchers concluded.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 That is bizarre.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 They're the only people who don't get a karma when they swallow a blue pill.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 That's very cool.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Very weird.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 John Wesley, who found in Methodism, he had a lot of ideas of curing the cold.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 One of them was to make pills out of cobwebs.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Without that that would work.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Presumably, it didn't.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 He also thought you could take a very thin rind of an orange.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 Roll it inside out and thrust it into each nostril.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 So, not effective?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 No, not effective.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 When SARS came out, and when was that?

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 When it was released, the big launch party.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 They shouldn't have invited so many people to the launch party.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 But it was thought in some parts of China that vinegar would solve SARS.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 And what they would do is they put vinegar in the corner of the room and that would supposedly help to cure it.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 And it was like a folk remedy.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 But it was really good news for vinegar salesmen because it meant that they could sell tons of their wares, of course.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 But that was bad news because it meant that the vinegar salesmen were then traveling between village and village and village.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 They were spreading the cold.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Oh, wow.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Oh, wow.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 That's kind of like a, I mean, that could be a zombie film, couldn't it?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Based on vinegar salesmen spreading the common cold.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 Yeah, that's a really good idea.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Yeah, not a very exciting film.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 Or it sounds like another one of the brilliant schemes of Robozoo and Alphanel.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 Okay, that's it.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 That's all of our winter facts.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
