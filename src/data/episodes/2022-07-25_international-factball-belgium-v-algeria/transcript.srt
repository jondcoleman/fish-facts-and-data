00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of The No Such Things A Fish

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,360
 International Fact Ball brought to you by the QILs

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,920
 in association with visitingland.com.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,040
 My name is Anna Tishinsky and joining me today

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,640
 are Andy Murray, James Hocken and Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960
 And today's match is Belgium versus Algeria.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,520
 So guys, anything interesting about Algeria?

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,560
 Algeria is the oldest known country

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,560
 where magic mushrooms were taken.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,840
 Ah, yeah, really?

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,640
 Yep.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,960
 About 7 to 9,000 years ago, there is a mural

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,000
 which is thought to depict the species Silicaib Mary,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,360
 which is the magic mushroom.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,760
 It's also the first place that Orangina came from.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,440
 It's the soft drink Orangina is from Algeria.

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,000
 It only became French after the country.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 It was kind of won in the war.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,480
 The war of independence.

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,960
 What, so they, when they France gained Orangina?

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,720
 A lot of things that we think of French

22
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,120
 are actually Algerian, aren't they?

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,600
 Really?

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,720
 Albert Camus, here, Algerian?

25
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,520
 Yes.

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,960
 Was the goalkeeper for his Algerian university football team?

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
 No, we're really sucking.

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,520
 I'm not talking about football.

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,400
 Yeah, football.

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,240
 Yeah, sorry.

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,320
 Tarzan of the Apes was filmed in Algeria.

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,600
 It's a weird place to film Tarzan.

33
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,840
 They have very little jungle.

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,640
 They have, I think, almost 90% of Algeria

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,000
 is a Sahara desert, isn't it?

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,520
 Yeah.

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,400
 It is huge.

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
 Inside Algeria, you could fit most of Western Europe,

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,920
 including the whole of Germany, Spain, France,

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,120
 the UK, Poland, Italy, and Portugal.

41
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,040
 So it's pretty large.

42
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,760
 That's pretty big.

43
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,840
 But all their people, it's kind of like Australia.

44
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,960
 They're packed into about 12% of the land mass.

45
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,880
 Because all the rest of it is Sahara and desert.

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,600
 10% of the world's helium comes from Algeria.

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,120
 Are we running out of helium?

48
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,720
 Yes, yes, we are.

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,000
 That's why people's voices are getting deeper and deeper.

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,640
 There is more of a culture of women

51
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,720
 not having such a rough time in Algeria.

52
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,120
 But at the moment, women in Algeria make up 70% of its lawyers

53
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,760
 and 60% of its judges and 60% of university students

54
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,520
 are female.

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,640
 Yeah, I'm sorry, sorry.

56
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,840
 Someone who lived in Algeria until about the 18th century,

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,960
 they were known as Algerians.

58
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,480
 Really?

59
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,720
 Yeah, it was quite a nice word.

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,600
 Yeah, it sounds like a fruit.

61
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,200
 Yeah, exactly.

62
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,680
 And clementines come from Algeria.

63
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,720
 They were first grown in the North-Indian Algeria

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,880
 by father Clement Rodier.

65
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,960
 Oh, wow.

66
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,680
 Well, speaking of food, a bunch of Algerians

67
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,840
 publicly ate lunch during Ramadan to demonstrate against people

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,960
 being persecuted for not observing Ramadan.

69
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,240
 That's my kind of process.

70
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,360
 I can get on board with.

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
 Yeah.

72
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,200
 Pretty brave process.

73
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,240
 That was in August last year.

74
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,360
 That was August last year, yeah.

75
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,960
 OK.

76
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,160
 This is in 1999.

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,360
 149 Algerians died from scorpion bites.

78
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,760
 Wow.

79
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,800
 In 2007, in a marketplace in Algeria,

80
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,160
 one man was trying to sell a donkey to another man,

81
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,240
 and they were bartering over the price of the donkey.

82
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,120
 And they bartered for so long that the donkey ate the huge pile

83
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,400
 of cash that one man had brought to pay for the donkey.

84
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,240
 And they didn't notice until it all been consumed.

85
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,520
 And the case had to be referred to the supreme court

86
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,880
 in the end, because no one else could

87
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,880
 decide who the donkey therefore belonged to.

88
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,560
 Speaking of four-legged animals,

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,040
 there's one of the oldest traditional practices

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,280
 is ram fighting.

91
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,920
 People make rams fight each other.

92
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,440
 I don't think people fight rams.

93
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,240
 Oh, I thought it might as be where you ram into somebody.

94
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,640
 Yeah.

95
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,040
 St. Augustine, born in Algeria.

96
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,360
 Yeah, he was born in hippo, wasn't he?

97
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,760
 Born in hippo is the bishop of hippo.

98
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,240
 What's an Algerian city, hippo?

99
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
 Yes, meaning horse.

100
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
 What?

101
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,040
 Yeah, hippo means horse.

102
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,960
 So hippopotamus means river horse in Greek.

103
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,480
 Yeah.

104
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,680
 All hippos are actually horses.

105
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,600
 Didn't know that.

106
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,520
 Like a fancy dress party.

107
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,320
 Oh, oh, this is great.

108
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,800
 This is one horse in the front of the hippo,

109
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,120
 and there's another one in the back of the hippo.

110
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,040
 So there was an uprising in Algeria in 1856 of the Maribu people.

111
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,920
 And that was in French Algeria, it was at the time.

112
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,960
 And the Maribu people claimed they

113
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,400
 could perform what works of magic,

114
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,640
 and that was making them quite powerful.

115
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,400
 And the podium, the third-- French the podium,

116
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,240
 the third, obviously, wanted to quell this uprising.

117
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,560
 And so he sent the most famous magician of the era

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
 to go and prove to these Maribu people

119
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,320
 that their magician was more powerful than the Algerian

120
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,880
 magician, and they better chill out.

121
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,600
 Who was that?

122
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,560
 And that magician was Huda, who obviously--

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,400
 Who did?

124
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:17,920
 Who did?

125
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,800
 Who Dini's, the man who Dini took his name after.

126
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,080
 Indeed, yes.

127
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,680
 And he turned up, and he performed all sorts of incredible tricks.

128
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,440
 And apparently, he did intimidate the Algerians

129
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,480
 into submission.

130
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,400
 Yeah, did they use electromagnetism on a big metal box

131
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
 so that nobody else could lift it because it was held down

132
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,520
 by an electromagnet, and then he surreptitiously turned off

133
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,480
 the magnet and lifted it himself.

134
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,560
 I probably out of the magic circle now

135
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,520
 that I told you how he did that trick.

136
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,360
 Yeah, so that was--

137
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,240
 OK, it was an electromagnet book.

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,280
 You've already been excommunicated twice

139
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,360
 from the Roman Catholic Church.

140
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,680
 Now you're out of the magic circle.

141
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,200
 I know.

142
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
 You're going to have no more subs to pay by the end of the year.

143
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,840
 You're going to be very cheeky, doesn't it, 15 feet?

144
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,160
 And the largest meat-easing dinosaur known

145
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,520
 to have lived on Earth was found in Algeria.

146
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,120
 That's the Cuchero Dontosaurus Saharicus.

147
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,040
 It's a bit like a T-Rex only a little bit bigger.

148
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
 Small hands?

149
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,680
 Big heart.

150
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,360
 Dante, sorry.

151
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,080
 So that was the whistle for half time.

152
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,600
 So that's Algeria covered.

153
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,680
 And now we're going to bring you a QI quiz brought to you

154
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,520
 by visitingland.com.

155
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,320
 We've got three questions about England for you.

156
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,640
 Let's kick off with Andy.

157
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,600
 My question is, what is the only town in England

158
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,120
 named after a novel?

159
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,640
 It's also got punctuation in the actual place

160
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,800
 named Chaffee and other clue.

161
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
 50 Shades of Grey's in Essex.

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,400
 It is not.

163
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,160
 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

164
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,200
 That's got an apostrophe.

165
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,720
 Yes, but it's only a book, not a town.

166
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,760
 Stone is a town.

167
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
 I don't even know what that is.

168
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,880
 Anywho, no time for guessing.

169
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,080
 On to the next one, no time for more guessing.

170
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
 Question number two from James.

171
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,360
 My question is, why did Mad Jack give everybody

172
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,840
 in Shrewsbury 10 pounds?

173
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,880
 It was a bloody nice guy.

174
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,760
 Thanks for that.

175
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,760
 And now to question number three from Dunn.

176
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,880
 Yes, the Queen of England could be addressed

177
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,840
 in a number of ways.

178
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,160
 But what does Brian Blessed like to call her?

179
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,280
 Brian Blessed being the Thessian actor

180
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
 with a booming voice for those who don't know him.

181
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,920
 And also for those who don't know Dunn,

182
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,440
 Brian Blessed being his main life obsession.

183
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,240
 And for those people who don't know the Queen,

184
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,120
 look at your back notes.

185
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
 Visit visiting.com, I'm sure she's reference somewhere.

186
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,240
 OK, thanks for that, guys.

187
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,360
 And that's half time over onto the second half.

188
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,240
 And we are going to find out some interesting stuff about Belgium.

189
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,760
 French fries, French fries, one country-made Belgium.

190
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,080
 Really, Belgium fries.

191
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,840
 OK, well, they had a French fries revolution.

192
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,600
 Is that just an occasion where they turned

193
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,400
 all the French fries around?

194
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,600
 Nice.

195
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,720
 No.

196
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
 But it was.

197
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,440
 The Belgium went the longest of any country

198
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,360
 without a government.

199
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,600
 So young people started what they call the free-revolutie

200
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,960
 with the fries revolution, because that's

201
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
 a symbol of the country.

202
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,480
 Yeah.

203
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,720
 And there were lots of ideas that were demonstrations.

204
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,720
 Protesters in Gent occupied one of the city's squares.

205
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,760
 And then the country which had gone

206
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,480
 longest without a government before that was Iraq.

207
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,760
 So they invited an Iraqi delegate to come and hand over a trophy

208
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,640
 as the longest running country without a functioning government.

209
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,360
 541 days they went.

210
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,840
 And they went without a government.

211
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,640
 I think Belgium has the world's only carrot museum.

212
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,120
 Oh, they have a lot of very weird museums.

213
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,840
 In Brussels, there's a sewer museum.

214
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,440
 There's a street lighting museum.

215
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,640
 And there's also the wardrobe of the mannequin piss,

216
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
 you know, that little statue.

217
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,960
 They dress it up every year.

218
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,440
 And he has more than 800 costumes, which you can go and visit

219
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,240
 in this museum.

220
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,160
 There's also an underpants museum.

221
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,200
 What's the earth?

222
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,960
 Yeah.

223
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,480
 It's a Belgian artist called John Bequay.

224
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,800
 Are we sure his mom didn't just visit his flat one day walk

225
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,320
 any good?

226
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,440
 This is disgusting.

227
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
 And he went, no, no, no, it's my museum.

228
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,120
 No, mom.

229
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,480
 And you didn't pay the admission fee.

230
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,280
 Yeah.

231
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,760
 The give shops are a bit weird, but--

232
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,920
 Speaking of give shops, Brussels International Airport

233
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,720
 is the world's biggest chocolate selling point.

234
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,200
 The chocolate selling location.

235
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,120
 So that's a mess talking about what it sells more than 800 tons

236
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,880
 of chocolate every year.

237
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,120
 Oh, I feel like I've been there.

238
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,600
 And I feel like they sell a lot of smurfs as well.

239
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,440
 Smurfs were invented by a Belgian, right?

240
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,200
 Tintin as well, Belgian.

241
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,720
 It's he.

242
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,240
 That's cool.

243
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,440
 I believe so.

244
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,600
 Oh, he's based on a real-life war correspondent

245
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,960
 called Robert Sexay.

246
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
 That's all I know about Tintin.

247
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,880
 Amazing.

248
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,480
 Also, duffle coats, a Belgian.

249
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,000
 Oh, yeah.

250
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,240
 And the saxophone invented by not Robert Sexay,

251
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,600
 but Adolf Sax.

252
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,480
 Yes, and he has a museum in Brussels as well, which I've been to.

253
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,280
 They have a lot of very small, specific--

254
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
 they're quite like celebrating quite weird things

255
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,800
 in their museums.

256
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,320
 I like it.

257
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,040
 Yeah, I went to the Sax museum and was very disappointed

258
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,360
 when I went through the dark.

259
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,080
 There were a live sax show happen.

260
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,360
 But the thing is, it was an amazingly controversial thing

261
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,160
 for him to invent.

262
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,760
 So on one occasion at a show, before it was displayed

263
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,720
 as this new invention, they kicked one

264
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,160
 of his saxophones to death, so badly to death.

265
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,840
 Yeah.

266
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,160
 They kicked one of his saxophones.

267
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,520
 So it was so badly bent out of shape that he couldn't show it.

268
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,400
 And someone was killed on his doorstep,

269
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,920
 and he thought it was one of his apprentices

270
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,400
 who'd been mistaken for him.

271
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,480
 So it was an amazingly controversial thing to invent.

272
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,240
 The saxophone.

273
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,040
 Yeah, he spent years in the courts,

274
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,440
 and he was tricked out of money and driven to bankruptcy.

275
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,040
 Yeah.

276
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,680
 Here's something controversial.

277
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,120
 The cat and stoet was a medieval festival in Belgium,

278
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,920
 in which cats were thrown from a bell-free tower.

279
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,120
 Did you know that only 2% of Belgians

280
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,560
 know the words to their own national anthem?

281
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,640
 There is a very strong history of not knowing it.

282
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,000
 For example, in 2007, a Belgian politician was asked

283
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,640
 to sing the national anthem, and he accidentally sang

284
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,480
 the French one.

285
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,880
 I'm still at singing the Massey A's instead of Belgians.

286
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,400
 Oh, yeah.

287
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,640
 And Rabankon.

288
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,400
 They do celebrate weird things that you were

289
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
 saying earlier, Andy.

290
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,440
 Every year, on August 15th, Belgium

291
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,240
 has an international regatta of bathtubs.

292
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,880
 25,000 people tend to turn up.

293
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,360
 It's a 1-kilometer race down the river

294
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
 murs in the town of Dinal.

295
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,480
 They're going since 1982.

296
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,880
 And they just jump in bathtubs with various decorations

297
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
 on them, race down.

298
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,160
 I like the sound of Belgium.

299
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
 I'm really into this country.

300
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,200
 Yeah, it sounds good.

301
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,960
 They seem slightly nuts.

302
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,760
 But still cool at the same time.

303
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,880
 Great museums.

304
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,000
 I love the Belgian town, the Belgian exclave of Baal Hurtog.

305
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,600
 Oh, yeah, I've been there.

306
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,080
 Why is that?

307
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
 Have you?

308
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,440
 So to explain, it's a Belgian exclave.

309
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,320
 It's in the Netherlands.

310
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,640
 So it's within the Netherlands.

311
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,440
 But it's an exclave of Belgium.

312
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,760
 So it's 22 little pockets.

313
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
 And there are borders between Belgium and the Netherlands,

314
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
 all over the place, all over the city of town, aren't they?

315
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,440
 And they're marked with white crosses.

316
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,200
 Yeah, that's right.

317
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,560
 There are white crosses on the floor,

318
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,800
 so you can hop over from one country to the other whenever you want.

319
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,800
 And also, all of the houses have little flags on them.

320
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,920
 Either Belgian flags or Netherlands flags.

321
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,520
 So you know whether they're in Belgium or the Netherlands.

322
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,560
 So what's an exclave?

323
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,280
 It's just--

324
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,480
 So an exclave is a piece of a country

325
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,640
 that's fully surrounded by another country.

326
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,120
 Oh, OK.

327
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,360
 There are a lot of houses that are built across the border,

328
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,880
 so you decide what nationality your house is by where the front door is.

329
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,840
 That's right, yeah.

330
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,720
 Oh, wow.

331
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,960
 That's such a confusing place.

332
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,200
 It's a really cool place.

333
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,720
 I recommend anyone goes there.

334
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
 We're going to have to wrap on Belgium.

335
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,760
 Anyone want to throw in some--

336
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,040
 They invented roller skates in 1760.

337
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,400
 The guy who invented them, when he was debuting,

338
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
 they've almost killed himself by crashing into a giant mirror.

339
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,440
 So--

340
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,720
 Who's that other guy who's in the roller skates as well as me?

341
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,640
 He's a fine invention. How you come here?

342
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,680
 [APPLAUSE]

343
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
 Oh, that's the full-time whistle.

344
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,400
 Well done to both the competitors' times up.

345
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,320
 And it's now time for the answers to our QI visit England quiz.

346
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,280
 So Andy, what was your question and answer?

347
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,320
 The only town in England to feature punctuation,

348
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,720
 and which is named after a novel, is Westwood Ho, exclamation mark in Devon.

349
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,240
 Ah, yeah.

350
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,360
 They named it after the novel.

351
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,880
 And then the author, Charles Kingsley, got very annoyed that they had done so,

352
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,080
 because they hadn't actually asked permission.

353
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,920
 It was just to get tourists in.

354
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
 OK, thanks for that, Andy.

355
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,960
 James, what was your answer?

356
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,040
 My answer to the question, why did Mad Jack give everyone in Shrewsbury 10 pounds?

357
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,560
 This was in 1819.

358
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,520
 He wanted to become an MP.

359
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,560
 And so he bribed everyone in the town 10 pounds.

360
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,880
 And they all voted for him.

361
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,880
 And he became an MP.

362
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
 That's very clever.

363
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,680
 Jack Mitten.

364
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
 Not allowed, I don't think, in this day and age, simply.

365
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,840
 Frowned upon, certainly.

366
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,240
 Done, your question.

367
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,080
 Yes, the queen.

368
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,080
 The queen, we all know her as queen Elizabeth, the second.

369
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,960
 But Brian Blessed, what does he know her as?

370
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,120
 The answer is, he calls her knuckles.

371
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,880
 He calls her knuckles, because any time he meets her,

372
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,880
 she hits him on his hand with her knuckles.

373
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,960
 Well, like a fist pump.

374
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,680
 Yeah, no, no.

375
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,520
 He goes off on a lot of adventures, and she gets very worried about him.

376
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,160
 And so she says, don't go on those adventures, and she hits his hands.

377
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,200
 And so he's like, knuckles.

378
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,120
 And then she also gets him to say Gordon's alive.

379
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,560
 Apparently, she's a massive flash Gordon fan,

380
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,320
 according to Brian Blessed.

381
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,160
 OK, so there are all the answers.

382
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,840
 Of course, you didn't get to win any prizes,

383
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,920
 even if you knew all the answers.

384
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,720
 But you can win a prize if you go to visit england.com,

385
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,800
 where you'll have the chance to enter a ballot

386
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,440
 and win some just fantastic brilliant Marvelous QI goodies,

387
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,640
 including a sign book, if you're lucky.

388
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,720
 And so now, I think it's only left to decide who won that match.

389
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,320
 And I guess, totally arbitrarily, James is going to pick a winner.

390
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,560
 I am going to go for the guy who invented the roller skates.

391
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
 Yeah, I think we have to go for Belgium.

392
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,040
 All right, Belgium, congratulations.

393
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,560
 Algeria, hard luck.

394
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,960

395
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,480

 two countries against each other, and those countries will be--

407
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,360
 They will be Cameroon and Chile.

408
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,440
 Cameroon and Chile.

409
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,280
