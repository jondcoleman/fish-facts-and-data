00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of The No Such Things A Fish

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.360
 International Fact Ball brought to you by the QILs

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.920
 in association with visitingland.com.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.040
 My name is Anna Tishinsky and joining me today

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.640
 are Andy Murray, James Hocken and Dan Schreiber.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.960
 And today's match is Belgium versus Algeria.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.520
 So guys, anything interesting about Algeria?

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.560
 Algeria is the oldest known country

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.560
 where magic mushrooms were taken.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.840
 Ah, yeah, really?

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 Yep.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.960
 About 7 to 9,000 years ago, there is a mural

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.000
 which is thought to depict the species Silicaib Mary,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.360
 which is the magic mushroom.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.760
 It's also the first place that Orangina came from.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.440
 It's the soft drink Orangina is from Algeria.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.000
 It only became French after the country.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 It was kind of won in the war.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.480
 The war of independence.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.960
 What, so they, when they France gained Orangina?

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.720
 A lot of things that we think of French

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.120
 are actually Algerian, aren't they?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.600
 Really?

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.720
 Albert Camus, here, Algerian?

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.520
 Yes.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.960
 Was the goalkeeper for his Algerian university football team?

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 No, we're really sucking.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.520
 I'm not talking about football.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.400
 Yeah, football.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.240
 Yeah, sorry.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.320
 Tarzan of the Apes was filmed in Algeria.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.600
 It's a weird place to film Tarzan.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.840
 They have very little jungle.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.640
 They have, I think, almost 90% of Algeria

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.000
 is a Sahara desert, isn't it?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.520
 Yeah.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.400
 It is huge.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.400
 Inside Algeria, you could fit most of Western Europe,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.920
 including the whole of Germany, Spain, France,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.120
 the UK, Poland, Italy, and Portugal.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.040
 So it's pretty large.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.760
 That's pretty big.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.840
 But all their people, it's kind of like Australia.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.960
 They're packed into about 12% of the land mass.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.880
 Because all the rest of it is Sahara and desert.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600
 10% of the world's helium comes from Algeria.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.120
 Are we running out of helium?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.720
 Yes, yes, we are.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.000
 That's why people's voices are getting deeper and deeper.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.640
 There is more of a culture of women

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.720
 not having such a rough time in Algeria.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.120
 But at the moment, women in Algeria make up 70% of its lawyers

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.760
 and 60% of its judges and 60% of university students

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.520
 are female.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.640
 Yeah, I'm sorry, sorry.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.840
 Someone who lived in Algeria until about the 18th century,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.960
 they were known as Algerians.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.480
 Really?

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.720
 Yeah, it was quite a nice word.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.600
 Yeah, it sounds like a fruit.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.200
 Yeah, exactly.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.680
 And clementines come from Algeria.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.720
 They were first grown in the North-Indian Algeria

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.880
 by father Clement Rodier.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.960
 Oh, wow.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.680
 Well, speaking of food, a bunch of Algerians

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.840
 publicly ate lunch during Ramadan to demonstrate against people

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.960
 being persecuted for not observing Ramadan.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.240
 That's my kind of process.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.360
 I can get on board with.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.360
 Yeah.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.200
 Pretty brave process.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.240
 That was in August last year.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.360
 That was August last year, yeah.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.960
 OK.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.160
 This is in 1999.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.360
 149 Algerians died from scorpion bites.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.760
 Wow.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.800
 In 2007, in a marketplace in Algeria,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.160
 one man was trying to sell a donkey to another man,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.240
 and they were bartering over the price of the donkey.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.120
 And they bartered for so long that the donkey ate the huge pile

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.400
 of cash that one man had brought to pay for the donkey.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.240
 And they didn't notice until it all been consumed.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.520
 And the case had to be referred to the supreme court

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.880
 in the end, because no one else could

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.880
 decide who the donkey therefore belonged to.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.560
 Speaking of four-legged animals,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.040
 there's one of the oldest traditional practices

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.280
 is ram fighting.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.920
 People make rams fight each other.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.440
 I don't think people fight rams.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.240
 Oh, I thought it might as be where you ram into somebody.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.640
 Yeah.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.040
 St. Augustine, born in Algeria.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.360
 Yeah, he was born in hippo, wasn't he?

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.760
 Born in hippo is the bishop of hippo.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.240
 What's an Algerian city, hippo?

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.240
 Yes, meaning horse.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240
 What?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.040
 Yeah, hippo means horse.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.960
 So hippopotamus means river horse in Greek.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.480
 Yeah.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.680
 All hippos are actually horses.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.600
 Didn't know that.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.520
 Like a fancy dress party.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.320
 Oh, oh, this is great.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.800
 This is one horse in the front of the hippo,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.120
 and there's another one in the back of the hippo.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.040
 So there was an uprising in Algeria in 1856 of the Maribu people.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.920
 And that was in French Algeria, it was at the time.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.960
 And the Maribu people claimed they

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.400
 could perform what works of magic,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.640
 and that was making them quite powerful.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.400
 And the podium, the third-- French the podium,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.240
 the third, obviously, wanted to quell this uprising.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.560
 And so he sent the most famous magician of the era

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.720
 to go and prove to these Maribu people

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.320
 that their magician was more powerful than the Algerian

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.880
 magician, and they better chill out.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.600
 Who was that?

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.560
 And that magician was Huda, who obviously--

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.400
 Who did?

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.920
 Who did?

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.800
 Who Dini's, the man who Dini took his name after.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.080
 Indeed, yes.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.680
 And he turned up, and he performed all sorts of incredible tricks.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.440
 And apparently, he did intimidate the Algerians

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.480
 into submission.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.400
 Yeah, did they use electromagnetism on a big metal box

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.800
 so that nobody else could lift it because it was held down

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.520
 by an electromagnet, and then he surreptitiously turned off

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.480
 the magnet and lifted it himself.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.560
 I probably out of the magic circle now

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.520
 that I told you how he did that trick.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.360
 Yeah, so that was--

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.240
 OK, it was an electromagnet book.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.280
 You've already been excommunicated twice

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.360
 from the Roman Catholic Church.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.680
 Now you're out of the magic circle.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.200
 I know.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200
 You're going to have no more subs to pay by the end of the year.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.840
 You're going to be very cheeky, doesn't it, 15 feet?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.160
 And the largest meat-easing dinosaur known

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.520
 to have lived on Earth was found in Algeria.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.120
 That's the Cuchero Dontosaurus Saharicus.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.040
 It's a bit like a T-Rex only a little bit bigger.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040
 Small hands?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.680
 Big heart.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.360
 Dante, sorry.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.080
 So that was the whistle for half time.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.600
 So that's Algeria covered.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.680
 And now we're going to bring you a QI quiz brought to you

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.520
 by visitingland.com.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.320
 We've got three questions about England for you.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.640
 Let's kick off with Andy.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.600
 My question is, what is the only town in England

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.120
 named after a novel?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.640
 It's also got punctuation in the actual place

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.800
 named Chaffee and other clue.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.000
 50 Shades of Grey's in Essex.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.400
 It is not.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.160
 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.200
 That's got an apostrophe.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.720
 Yes, but it's only a book, not a town.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.760
 Stone is a town.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.760
 I don't even know what that is.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.880
 Anywho, no time for guessing.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.080
 On to the next one, no time for more guessing.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.080
 Question number two from James.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.360
 My question is, why did Mad Jack give everybody

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.840
 in Shrewsbury 10 pounds?

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.880
 It was a bloody nice guy.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.760
 Thanks for that.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.760
 And now to question number three from Dunn.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.880
 Yes, the Queen of England could be addressed

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.840
 in a number of ways.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.160
 But what does Brian Blessed like to call her?

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.280
 Brian Blessed being the Thessian actor

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.280
 with a booming voice for those who don't know him.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.920
 And also for those who don't know Dunn,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.440
 Brian Blessed being his main life obsession.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.240
 And for those people who don't know the Queen,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.120
 look at your back notes.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.520
 Visit visiting.com, I'm sure she's reference somewhere.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.240
 OK, thanks for that, guys.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.360
 And that's half time over onto the second half.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.240
 And we are going to find out some interesting stuff about Belgium.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.760
 French fries, French fries, one country-made Belgium.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.080
 Really, Belgium fries.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.840
 OK, well, they had a French fries revolution.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.600
 Is that just an occasion where they turned

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.400
 all the French fries around?

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.600
 Nice.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.720
 No.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720
 But it was.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.440
 The Belgium went the longest of any country

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.360
 without a government.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.600
 So young people started what they call the free-revolutie

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.960
 with the fries revolution, because that's

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.960
 a symbol of the country.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.480
 Yeah.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.720
 And there were lots of ideas that were demonstrations.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.720
 Protesters in Gent occupied one of the city's squares.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.760
 And then the country which had gone

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.480
 longest without a government before that was Iraq.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.760
 So they invited an Iraqi delegate to come and hand over a trophy

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.640
 as the longest running country without a functioning government.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.360
 541 days they went.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.840
 And they went without a government.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.640
 I think Belgium has the world's only carrot museum.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.120
 Oh, they have a lot of very weird museums.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.840
 In Brussels, there's a sewer museum.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.440
 There's a street lighting museum.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.640
 And there's also the wardrobe of the mannequin piss,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.680
 you know, that little statue.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.960
 They dress it up every year.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.440
 And he has more than 800 costumes, which you can go and visit

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.240
 in this museum.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.160
 There's also an underpants museum.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.200
 What's the earth?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.960
 Yeah.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.480
 It's a Belgian artist called John Bequay.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.800
 Are we sure his mom didn't just visit his flat one day walk

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.320
 any good?

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.440
 This is disgusting.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.440
 And he went, no, no, no, it's my museum.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.120
 No, mom.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.480
 And you didn't pay the admission fee.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.280
 Yeah.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.760
 The give shops are a bit weird, but--

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.920
 Speaking of give shops, Brussels International Airport

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.720
 is the world's biggest chocolate selling point.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.200
 The chocolate selling location.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.120
 So that's a mess talking about what it sells more than 800 tons

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.880
 of chocolate every year.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.120
 Oh, I feel like I've been there.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.600
 And I feel like they sell a lot of smurfs as well.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.440
 Smurfs were invented by a Belgian, right?

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.200
 Tintin as well, Belgian.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:22.720
 It's he.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.240
 That's cool.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.440
 I believe so.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.600
 Oh, he's based on a real-life war correspondent

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.960
 called Robert Sexay.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.960
 That's all I know about Tintin.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.880
 Amazing.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.480
 Also, duffle coats, a Belgian.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.240
 And the saxophone invented by not Robert Sexay,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.600
 but Adolf Sax.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.480
 Yes, and he has a museum in Brussels as well, which I've been to.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.280
 They have a lot of very small, specific--

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.280
 they're quite like celebrating quite weird things

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:48.800
 in their museums.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.320
 I like it.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.040
 Yeah, I went to the Sax museum and was very disappointed

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.360
 when I went through the dark.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.080
 There were a live sax show happen.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.360
 But the thing is, it was an amazingly controversial thing

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.160
 for him to invent.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.760
 So on one occasion at a show, before it was displayed

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.720
 as this new invention, they kicked one

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.160
 of his saxophones to death, so badly to death.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.840
 Yeah.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.160
 They kicked one of his saxophones.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.520
 So it was so badly bent out of shape that he couldn't show it.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.400
 And someone was killed on his doorstep,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.920
 and he thought it was one of his apprentices

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.400
 who'd been mistaken for him.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.480
 So it was an amazingly controversial thing to invent.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.240
 The saxophone.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.040
 Yeah, he spent years in the courts,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.440
 and he was tricked out of money and driven to bankruptcy.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.040
 Yeah.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.680
 Here's something controversial.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.120
 The cat and stoet was a medieval festival in Belgium,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.920
 in which cats were thrown from a bell-free tower.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.120
 Did you know that only 2% of Belgians

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.560
 know the words to their own national anthem?

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.640
 There is a very strong history of not knowing it.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.000
 For example, in 2007, a Belgian politician was asked

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.640
 to sing the national anthem, and he accidentally sang

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.480
 the French one.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.880
 I'm still at singing the Massey A's instead of Belgians.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.640
 And Rabankon.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.400
 They do celebrate weird things that you were

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400
 saying earlier, Andy.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.440
 Every year, on August 15th, Belgium

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.240
 has an international regatta of bathtubs.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.880
 25,000 people tend to turn up.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.360
 It's a 1-kilometer race down the river

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.360
 murs in the town of Dinal.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.480
 They're going since 1982.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.880
 And they just jump in bathtubs with various decorations

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.880
 on them, race down.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.160
 I like the sound of Belgium.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.160
 I'm really into this country.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.200
 Yeah, it sounds good.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.960
 They seem slightly nuts.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.760
 But still cool at the same time.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.880
 Great museums.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.000
 I love the Belgian town, the Belgian exclave of Baal Hurtog.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.600
 Oh, yeah, I've been there.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.080
 Why is that?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.080
 Have you?

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.440
 So to explain, it's a Belgian exclave.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.320
 It's in the Netherlands.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.640
 So it's within the Netherlands.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.440
 But it's an exclave of Belgium.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.760
 So it's 22 little pockets.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.920
 And there are borders between Belgium and the Netherlands,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.680
 all over the place, all over the city of town, aren't they?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.440
 And they're marked with white crosses.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.200
 Yeah, that's right.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.560
 There are white crosses on the floor,

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.800
 so you can hop over from one country to the other whenever you want.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.800
 And also, all of the houses have little flags on them.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.920
 Either Belgian flags or Netherlands flags.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.520
 So you know whether they're in Belgium or the Netherlands.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.560
 So what's an exclave?

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.280
 It's just--

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.480
 So an exclave is a piece of a country

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.640
 that's fully surrounded by another country.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.120
 Oh, OK.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.360
 There are a lot of houses that are built across the border,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.880
 so you decide what nationality your house is by where the front door is.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.840
 That's right, yeah.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.720
 Oh, wow.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.960
 That's such a confusing place.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.200
 It's a really cool place.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.720
 I recommend anyone goes there.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.720
 We're going to have to wrap on Belgium.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.760
 Anyone want to throw in some--

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.040
 They invented roller skates in 1760.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.400
 The guy who invented them, when he was debuting,

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.400
 they've almost killed himself by crashing into a giant mirror.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.440
 So--

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.720
 Who's that other guy who's in the roller skates as well as me?

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.640
 He's a fine invention. How you come here?

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.680
 [APPLAUSE]

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.680
 Oh, that's the full-time whistle.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.400
 Well done to both the competitors' times up.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.320
 And it's now time for the answers to our QI visit England quiz.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.280
 So Andy, what was your question and answer?

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.320
 The only town in England to feature punctuation,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.720
 and which is named after a novel, is Westwood Ho, exclamation mark in Devon.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.240
 Ah, yeah.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.360
 They named it after the novel.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.880
 And then the author, Charles Kingsley, got very annoyed that they had done so,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.080
 because they hadn't actually asked permission.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.920
 It was just to get tourists in.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.920
 OK, thanks for that, Andy.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.960
 James, what was your answer?

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:10.040
 My answer to the question, why did Mad Jack give everyone in Shrewsbury 10 pounds?

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.560
 This was in 1819.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.520
 He wanted to become an MP.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.560
 And so he bribed everyone in the town 10 pounds.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.880
 And they all voted for him.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.880
 And he became an MP.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.880
 That's very clever.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.680
 Jack Mitten.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.680
 Not allowed, I don't think, in this day and age, simply.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.840
 Frowned upon, certainly.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.240
 Done, your question.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.080
 Yes, the queen.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.080
 The queen, we all know her as queen Elizabeth, the second.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.960
 But Brian Blessed, what does he know her as?

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.120
 The answer is, he calls her knuckles.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.880
 He calls her knuckles, because any time he meets her,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.880
 she hits him on his hand with her knuckles.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.960
 Well, like a fist pump.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.680
 Yeah, no, no.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.520
 He goes off on a lot of adventures, and she gets very worried about him.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.160
 And so she says, don't go on those adventures, and she hits his hands.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.200
 And so he's like, knuckles.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.120
 And then she also gets him to say Gordon's alive.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.560
 Apparently, she's a massive flash Gordon fan,

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.320
 according to Brian Blessed.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.160
 OK, so there are all the answers.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.840
 Of course, you didn't get to win any prizes,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.920
 even if you knew all the answers.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.720
 But you can win a prize if you go to visit england.com,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.800
 where you'll have the chance to enter a ballot

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.440
 and win some just fantastic brilliant Marvelous QI goodies,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.640
 including a sign book, if you're lucky.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.720
 And so now, I think it's only left to decide who won that match.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.320
 And I guess, totally arbitrarily, James is going to pick a winner.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.560
 I am going to go for the guy who invented the roller skates.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.560
 Yeah, I think we have to go for Belgium.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.040
 All right, Belgium, congratulations.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.560
 Algeria, hard luck.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.960
 OK, if you want to get in touch with any of us

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.480
 to register any strong feelings you have about this podcast,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.240
 you can get Dan on--

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.280
 At Tribal Land.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.560
 You can get James on.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.480
 My Twitter is @Xshaped.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.800
 You can get Andy on--

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.320
 At Andrew Hunter M.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.160
 And you can't get me at all, because I don't have a Twitter feed.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.560
 But you can email else@QI.com, and I will respond there.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.600
 And thanks for listening, guys.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.840
 Join us tomorrow when we'll be pitting

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.160
 two countries against each other, and those countries will be--

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.360
 They will be Cameroon and Chile.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.440
