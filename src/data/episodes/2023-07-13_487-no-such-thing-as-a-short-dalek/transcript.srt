00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish where we are joined

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,080
 by our very good friend Jenny Colgan. Now Jenny Colgan is, well she's done a bit of

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,160
 stand up but she is mostly well known for being a writer, a writer of romantic comedy

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,240
 fiction and of science fiction. If you are a fan of Doctor Who then you may well know

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,440
 her. She's written all sorts of spin-offs and audiobooks and stuff for Doctor Who. We might

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,440
 get into that in the first fact today, spoiler alert, but what we'd like to let you know

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,560
 about most of all is that Jenny has a brand new book. It is called The Summer Skies and

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,480
 if it is anything like Jenny's other work it is going to be absolutely fantastic, just

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,320
 perfect for a summer holiday and you can get that wherever you buy your books. On top of

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,920
 that the usual stuff do join club fish if you want a bit of extra fish in your life and

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,240
 some ad free episodes and if you go to noticethingsafish.com/podfest then you will find that there are one

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,960
 or two really not many at all tickets left for our show at Kings Place in September. We

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,560
 are on the verge of booking an amazing guest for that. I promise you you will not want

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,520
 to miss it. If you can't get down to London then there are streaming tickets available.

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:30,320
 Okay really hope you enjoyed this week's show and all that's left to say is on with

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:42,840
 the next episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI

17
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,240
 offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,720
 Hunter Murray and Jenny Colgan and once again we have gathered around the microphones

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,160
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here

20
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:05,000
 we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Jenny. There is, on.to, a Dalek named

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,760
 after a Dickens character. I learned this fact for money, not actually for points really

22
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,900
 because one of my kids teachers is a great Dickens fan and he said to the kids if you

23
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,480
 bring me a Dickens fact that I haven't heard before there's something in it for you. So

24
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,140
 I can put it out to the world which was kind of fun and actually the most Dickens facts

25
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,840
 that everybody knows, one he's the first person ever to talk about dinosaurs in fiction.

26
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,920
 I did not know that. There is a reference to dinosaur on page one of Blake House and

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,000
 then the other thing that most people know is that Hans Christian Anderson came to Stamerton

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,960
 on holiday and was the worst guest ever and they both wrote about it in their diaries

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,640
 with Hans going oh I'm feeling so weary and Dickens going how do we get this guy out.

30
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,460
 So these, obviously the teacher knew these very famous facts but what he did not know

31
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,540
 is a friend of mine who's an actor plays a Dalek on.to and they tend to keep the same

32
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,380
 people because obviously it's quite skilled and you tend to be in the same Dalek casing

33
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,660
 because they're really small and it's not very pleasant to spend 10 hours in a really

34
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,180
 small space. So you have your own Dalek and the Dalek is named after you in the props

35
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,080
 covered and my friend is called Barnaby and he's named after Barnaby Rodge and so there

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,240
 is in the BBC Dalek Barnaby.

37
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,400
 Dalek Barnaby that's so good.

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,360
 Go ahead and dig in there sir I must exterminate you.

39
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,160
 Yeah that's amazing. So yeah so for anyone that doesn't know Doctor Who James I'm looking

40
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
 at you.

41
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
 Yeah I'm afraid I don't.

42
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
 You know what the Daleks are though?

43
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,520
 Yeah they're like little robots are they?

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
 They're a tall villain.

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
 Oh so are they?

46
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
 So are they?

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
 Yeah they're tall.

48
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,000
 They're not little when we say little they're about.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,820
 Yeah but if I had to describe a Dalek the first word I would say wasn't oh they're

50
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,820
 quite tall.

51
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,140
 The guy over there can you describe him?

52
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,140
 Yeah he's tall.

53
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,040
 No he's got a same punch coming out of his tall side.

54
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,980
 Can you tell me anything about the criminal who came over and tried to exterminate you?

55
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,280
 Well yeah first of all he was tall.

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,320
 I was simply addressing your first point and saying they're small.

57
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,820
 I was simply hitting that off as a busted myth straight away.

58
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,540
 Okay so there's like Jenny do it she knows Doctor Who.

59
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:23,880
 They're a paper pot they're tall and they have a kind of plunder at the front and they

60
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,360
 are in fact they look like they're the monsters but they're not they are kind of strange creatures

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
 inside.

62
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
 They used to be people.

63
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,000
 So they're like a tank for a month.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
 That is exactly what they're like.

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,240
 When you say pepper pot I read that when they were designed the person who decided how they

66
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,360
 would move used the pepper pot to kind of move around the table and say this is how

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
 they'll move.

68
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
 Is that true?

69
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
 I think it is.

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,020
 It was Ray Cusick who designed the look of the door.

71
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,480
 It's a really weird the story of how they were come up with because the creator was Terry

72
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,160
 Nation who was involved in working on the very early scripts and he just described them

73
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,880
 in the script but he didn't really describe them very much and then Terry Nation was...

74
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
 He said tall.

75
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,720
 He said just some cool aliens.

76
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,220
 And then Ray Cusick took the job to design them and he worked with a model maker called

77
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,040
 Bill Roberts and they actually they're the ones who built the look as far as I understand

78
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
 it.

79
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
 Is that fair?

80
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
 Yeah.

81
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
 Yeah.

82
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
 And Terry Nation though holds the as it were...

83
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
 But they belong to him.

84
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
 The copyright.

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
 They belong to him.

86
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,120
 Well he became hugely wealthy because he owned the copyright to Daleks and so...

87
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,640
 And to the point where when the new series came back all those years ago with Russell

88
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,520
 T. Davies the first one with Christopher Eccleston we didn't know if we were going to get the

89
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,160
 Daleks back because the Terry Nation estate said well we don't know if this is going to

90
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,660
 be... They had to consider that the Daleks would not return with Doctor Who.

91
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,340
 And what is the very first thing the Daleks do when they come back?

92
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
 I know this one.

93
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,220
 I actually know this one because that's one of the very little bits of Doctor Who I've

94
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,220
 seen.

95
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,220
 They go up some stairs.

96
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,220
 They fly up the stairs.

97
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,220
 Yeah.

98
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,100
 It was in such a lovely moment when kind of rose escapes up the stairs and the whole

99
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,100
 country's going...

100
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,100
 Aha!

101
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,100
 The one thing I know about Daleks and then the limited.

102
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
 Yeah.

103
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,660
 I'd love to know if your friend Barnaby if he's been in the same Dalek for all these

104
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
 years.

105
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,280
 Whether or not it's like when you go into a small biplane and you know the person's

106
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,920
 got a picture of their kids up on some dice, you know, is he inside?

107
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,140
 Have they got all these little mementos?

108
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,400
 It's a complete Dalek!

109
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,400
 This is not the only literary reference that made its way into Doctor Who.

110
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,840
 The very first companion of the very first series of Doctor Who was Ian Chesterton.

111
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,720
 And Ian Chesterton was named after GK Chesterton because the original scriptwriter for the

112
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,660
 show Coburn was a devout Catholic and a massive fan of Chesterton and so gave him that name.

113
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
 Yeah.

114
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
 So Chesterton made it in as well.

115
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,860
 And Dickens is the first historical figure that turns up in New Who.

116
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,860
 Oh really?

117
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
 Wow.

118
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,860
 So he's in the second episode I think.

119
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,860
 Of the original series?

120
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,860
 Of the new series.

121
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
 Of the new series.

122
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
 So which of course isn't new anymore.

123
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,860
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

124
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,860
 It's like really old.

125
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,860
 Right.

126
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,420
 As played, of course, by Simon Cowell who has played Dickens so often I get them very

127
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,500
 muddled up in my head.

128
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 Yeah.

129
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,500
 So the first companion was named after who?

130
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
 GK Chesterton.

131
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
 GK Chesterton.

132
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 Yeah.

133
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,420
 So I've got, I thought the first assistant was the Doctor's granddaughter.

134
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,820
 Are we confusing companion and assistant?

135
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,820
 Oh my God.

136
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,820
 I'm sorry.

137
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,820
 We're going to get letters.

138
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,820
 It's the one who does the inbox.

139
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,540
 I just feel like, I did a Pump Quiz recently and the Quiz Master, she said we had a Doctor

140
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,400
 Who quiz in here last week and I barely got out alive.

141
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,340
 Like, famously the quickest way to end a punch up in a Pump Quiz is to ask how many Doctor

142
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,840
 Who's there been?

143
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
 Oh.

144
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,140
 Luckily your inbox is bigger on the inside than ours.

145
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,180
 Yeah, that might be a technicality because the granddaughter is the granddaughter.

146
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,180
 Right, right, right.

147
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,180
 There she comes.

148
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,180
 The brief was really interesting for the casting.

149
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,040
 It was, she had to be a with it girl of 15 reaching the end of her secondary school career

150
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,920
 Eager for life, lower than middle class, avoid dialect, use neutral accent laced with the

151
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
 latest teenage slang.

152
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
 That was the gig.

153
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
 Hit cat.

154
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
 Yeah, exactly.

155
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,040
 And then she was made his granddaughter because it was, was it William Hartnell, the first

156
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
 one?

157
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
 It was.

158
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,880
 And it was to avoid any suggestion of, this is a bit weird, isn't it, this whole bloke

159
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,440
 traveling around with a 15 year old girl.

160
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
 What's going on?

161
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,520
 You know, they were really careful with that for so long.

162
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,280
 In fact, right up till I started writing for it and I started.

163
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
 Did you change it?

164
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,600
 But no, when I went to see them, they were really, because I write romantic comedy and

165
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,480
 they were really quite funny, like, you know, we can't have any kissing or anything like

166
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
 that.

167
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
 And I was like, fine.

168
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,240
 I promise you I'm a David T. I will not do any of that.

169
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,500
 Then the show completely changed and actually Matt Smith spends pretty much his whole time

170
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,360
 being naked or getting married to folk by mistake or, you know, they suddenly became a massive

171
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,360
 romantic overtones all the time.

172
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,920
 Did he get his heart broken?

173
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,080
 I just kind of slip in.

174
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
 Oh dear.

175
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,160
 I did read that there have been Doctor Who top trumps over the years.

176
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,080
 This is interesting because I do know about top trumps and Pac six has a lot of bad guys

177
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,840
 in, including Adolf Hitler.

178
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,320
 And if you put Pac six against Pac seven, you can fight Adolf Hitler against Queen Elizabeth

179
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,480
 the first.

180
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,440
 So I want you to guess who is the bravest out of Adolf Hitler or Queen Elizabeth the

181
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,080
 first according to top trumps.

182
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
 Elizabeth.

183
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
 Yeah.

184
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
 Agreed.

185
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
 Everyone.

186
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
 I'll say the minority.

187
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
 Sorry.

188
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
 Are you voting for Hitler?

189
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
 Just checking.

190
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:45,400
 I just wanted to say out loud that you think Hitler is braver, braver.

191
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
 Not better.

192
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
 I'll say Hitler.

193
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,840
 In fact, bravery was his lowest possible thing.

194
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,760
 He was good in lots of the things, but the bravery was the worst.

195
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,920
 Who do you think is the strongest out of Hitler or Queen Elizabeth the first?

196
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,440
 I got completely ambushed last time.

197
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,560
 The first. Stronger. She is the strongest and Hitler wins on brains and terror.

198
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
 Okay.

199
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
 Just a thing.

200
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
 Right.

201
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
 Victory for Hitler.

202
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
 Thank you, Doctor Who.

203
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,400
 He does spend his entire episode locked in the cupboard.

204
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
 Does he?

205
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,400
 So I could have got you to the bravery thing, but the brains one slightly defeats me.

206
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,920
 What was Hitler's episode, Doctor Who?

207
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
 It's called Let's Kill Hitler.

208
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,560
 Oh, wow.

209
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
 Really?

210
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
 Gosh.

211
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,920
 One of the first people involved in the BBC side of things, there was a guy called Sidney

212
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,000
 Newman who was the head of drama.

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,400
 He was a really interesting guy.

214
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,720
 So there was a play that was broadcast in his career called Underground, right?

215
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,920
 And it was about a group of nuclear holocaust survivors living in the London Underground.

216
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,000
 I think it was early '60s or late '50s, like it was quite, you know, it sounds very terrifying

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 and dramatic.

218
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,600
 But it was a live broadcast and one of the actors in it died of a heart attack halfway

219
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,680
 through the television screening offstage.

220
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,520
 So he wasn't on camera, but it was in between scenes basically.

221
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,600
 He was in costume and makeup and, you know, he died and the play had to improvise its

222
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,720
 way through and Newman was kind of in charge of it.

223
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,160
 He said, "Just treat it like a football match.

224
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
 Just play on.

225
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
 Adjust."

226
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
 Wow.

227
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
 Yeah.

228
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
 Oh, so it wasn't like there's been a murder.

229
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,560
 Like they didn't shift the whole thing to do.

230
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
 I don't know.

231
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
 Like really deathful care.

232
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,320
 Can I just say, if someone dies in the middle of a football match, they do stop the game.

233
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,840
 That's a very good point.

234
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,760
 That's a very good point.

235
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,480
 Well, that's the weird thing.

236
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,880
 The character was meant to die of a heart attack later in the play.

237
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,400
 The character, not the actor.

238
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

239
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,080
 So I guess they just had to shift it.

240
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
 Of course not the actor.

241
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,000
 What a gig to agree to.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 This will require you dying.

243
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,240
 It's going out on BBC One, so you've got to think of your career.

244
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,040
 Peter Capaldi, I think, auditioned for the Doctor Who and got the role, but he got it

245
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,080
 20 years later.

246
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,520
 So he auditioned in 1996 when they were casting for the, they made a film, didn't they then?

247
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
 And that was...

248
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
 Yes.

249
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
 Yeah, yeah.

250
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
 And lots of people auditioned.

251
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
 Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Rick Mail.

252
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
 Oh, wow.

253
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,280
 Rick would have been great, although you need to be kind of kind to be the Doctor.

254
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,360
 And I think he was a very kind man in real life, but on screen he was terrifying at all

255
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
 times.

256
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
 Yeah.

257
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,440
 Others auditioned, Brian Blassid?

258
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
 No.

259
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
 No?

260
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
 Do you know what?

261
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,960
 There's a certain, I think it's about English tolerance for Brian Blassid and I have not.

262
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
 Oh, that's wonderful.

263
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
 The gene.

264
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,440
 I can't, you know, I get it.

265
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
 Everybody loves him.

266
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,200
 It's one of those English things that I don't get.

267
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 Like freaking Tim Henman.

268
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,920
 Do you think Andy would make a good Doctor Who, I think he would.

269
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
 I think...

270
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
 Yes?

271
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
 Let me see your fingers.

272
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
 Hold it.

273
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
 Your fingers.

274
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
 Yeah?

275
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
 Okay.

276
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
 Sorry, what are you looking for there?

277
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
 They've all got really long fingers.

278
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
 Are they?

279
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
 Oh.

280
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
 Is that?

281
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
 A requirement.

282
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
 A requirement?

283
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
 Yeah.

284
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
 Maybe that's why Capaldi got the gig 20 years on.

285
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
 Yeah.

286
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
 He was older.

287
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
 Taller.

288
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
 Fingers longer fingers.

289
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,560
 Actually, the very nice thing is Shitty Who is the new Doctor Who is also Scottish.

290
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,440
 So we've had the most sensational run of it since we were up in 5th, yeah.

291
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,000
 One of the most famous things about Doctor Who is the fact that during the 1950s and

292
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,440
 60s, or even to the 70s, about 60 to 70% of all BBC video that had recordings of shows

293
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
 were deleted.

294
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,840
 And so we're missing, it was over 100 episodes of Doctor Who.

295
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,760
 It's slowly going a bit slow.

296
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,840
 I think it's under the 100 mark now, purely because there is a dedicated group of fans

297
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,400
 who are out there in the world trying to track down all of these missing episodes.

298
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,680
 And it's fascinating.

299
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,440
 Every few years we get a message that comes through from fans online saying, "A nut's

300
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
 been found."

301
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,680
 The BBC will say, "Nine found in Nigeria in the cupboard of a random local TV station."

302
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
 And they just find the reels?

303
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
 Do they?

304
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,160
 Yeah, they find the old, yeah.

305
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,640
 Because what they used to do is they used to send out all of these reels to different

306
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
 countries.

307
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,240
 But explicitly would say, "Once you've had it for this many months, there's an expiry

308
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
 date on it."

309
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
 Yeah.

310
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
 Burn them up.

311
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,400
 Yeah, I have at home, I have a vinyl record of a Goon show episode called Yeti, which

312
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,560
 says on it, "Smash this in three months time, here's the expiry date."

313
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
 Yeah.

314
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
 And someone just hadn't smashed it.

315
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,640
 Is that where the Mission Impossible films got this message will self-destruct in five

316
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
 seconds or whatever?

317
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
 Could be.

318
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
 Yeah, I don't know.

319
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
 Yeah, I don't know either.

320
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
 It might be.

321
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,520
 But yeah, so we still have like 97 episodes that are still missing, but they keep getting

322
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
 fanned.

323
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,160
 If you find one, is it worth like a million quid or something?

324
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
 That's interesting.

325
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
 Yeah, I don't know.

326
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
 Not really.

327
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
 No.

328
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,960
 It kind of belongs to the BBC still, and also it's such a kind of proper Indiana Jones

329
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
 sleuthathon.

330
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
 Yeah.

331
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
 You know, people have dedicated.

332
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,440
 It's for every amount of time to this thing.

333
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
 Wow.

334
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,840
 It would be seen as bad if you put it on eBay straight away and...

335
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,680
 Yes, it would be seen as bad, but also I think the kind of glory and honour of finding it.

336
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,760
 The missing ones, they've kind of animated them.

337
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,280
 Ah, do they have the scripts then?

338
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
 They've got scripts.

339
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
 Right.

340
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
 Okay, cool.

341
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,200
 When you think of Doctor Who, largely it's the villains of the old Doctor Who, the Daleks

342
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
 and so on.

343
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
 Slither Man.

344
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
 Cyber Man.

345
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
 Thank you.

346
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
 Well done, James.

347
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
 Slither Man.

348
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
 But then there's also James, the weeping...

349
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
 Angels.

350
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
 That's right.

351
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,040
 So Stephen Moffitt, who created that for the show, created a monster that was so iconic

352
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,400
 to the new fans of Doctor Who that when there was a poll done in 2012, it came on top as

353
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,680
 the best villain of Doctor Who, above the Daleks, which is very rare.

354
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,720
 It's the first time I think that's ever happened.

355
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,480
 So the weeping angels, for anyone that doesn't know, it's basically angels that are effectively

356
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,120
 weird aliens or something and if you turn your gaze away from them or you blink, they

357
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,320
 get closer to you and they get closer to you and get closer to you until they capture

358
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
 you.

359
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
 Like Grandmother's footsteps.

360
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
 Yeah, exactly.

361
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
 Yeah.

362
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
 What time is it, Mr. Wolf?

363
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
 Yeah.

364
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,920
 And if they capture you, they don't kill you, but they send you to another time on Earth

365
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,240
 and you're just stuck there and there's no way of getting back.

366
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,200
 So it's basically a death to some extent.

367
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,400
 Also if you're playing top trumps, then they have the same terror as Adolf Hitler.

368
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
 Wow.

369
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
 There we go.

370
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,360
 I've almost had a problem with the weeping angels as a monster.

371
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,680
 Because I think if we had them now, they'd just be a queue of people closing their eyes

372
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,360
 in front of them saying, "Could you send me back to when I could buy a house?"

373
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
 I've had about 1981.

374
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
 Manhattan is fine.

375
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
 Yeah, exactly.

376
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:16,040
 But so Stephen Mothwick was actually inspired by an original statue that he saw that looked

377
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,360
 so scary and he had this idea of what if that kept encroaching on me.

378
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,760
 So years later, he decided, having told his son about the story, to go back and show him

379
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,920
 the weeping angel that had inspired this and they went there to the exact spot and it was

380
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
 gone.

381
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:44,560
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

382
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
 Okay.

383
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,000
 My fact this week is when the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, George Bernard Shaw

384
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,480
 wrote the Times in disgust.

385
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,880
 He was upset that there was an unnecessary B at the end of the word bomb.

386
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,880
 Thank you, George, for your contribution on this horrific day.

387
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
 I know.

388
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,880
 It's like Churchill said it was going to save a million lives, Gandhi said it was a potential

389
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,400
 suicide of mankind, but George Bernard Shaw wrote, "I can scribble the word bomb barely

390
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:21,880
 legible 18 times in a minute and bomb without the B 24 times in a minute saving 25% by dropping

391
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:29,800
 this superfluous B." And he reckoned that it would save 131,400 seconds per year in

392
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,960
 the entire English speaking world.

393
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,640
 How soon after the bomb was dropped did he send this letter?

394
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
 It was a few weeks after.

395
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
 Oh, okay.

396
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,360
 So he waited for the initial...

397
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,720
 I think that was more the post.

398
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
 Right.

399
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
 God!

400
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,160
 I mean, yeah, talk about missing the point.

401
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
 Yeah, it was.

402
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,160
 Well, he was one of these people who really wanted to improve the language, so to speak,

403
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,560
 by making spelling simpler.

404
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
 Thank you.

405
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
 Moments, though, mate.

406
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
 What the hell?

407
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
 I know.

408
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,960
 Has anyone ever written B-O-M for bomb?

409
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,200
 Was he trying to call back to something or was he trying to solve the language?

410
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,080
 It feels like it's an Italian-ish word, bomb.

411
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,680
 I think it comes from the Latin bombus, meaning it's not a matipaiic, it's just like a nice

412
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 bomb.

413
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
 Yeah, yeah.

414
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
 And then it sort of works.

415
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,480
 But anyway, I thought we might talk about the Manhattan Project because Jenny, you are

416
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
 something of an expert.

417
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,720
 Is that fair to say on that?

418
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,120
 I would say it's not really fair to say because that is a hostage to fortune.

419
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,160
 However, I did mastermind and I picked it as my specialist subject.

420
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
 Wow.

421
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,520
 And I don't really get nervous very often.

422
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,840
 I have never been so nervous.

423
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,280
 And I wasn't nervous about the subject, which I thought I knew.

424
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,880
 And I wasn't nervous about being, I'd already lost Pointless and I'd already lost whatever

425
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,240
 that other chasey one is.

426
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,200
 So I wasn't nervous about that.

427
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
 I was really nervous.

428
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,360
 You know how every year there's one person that gets zero points and it goes on YouTube?

429
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,320
 And you know, and I just, that was just right in front of my eyes.

430
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,080
 In particular, I was like, oh, they're looking at me and they go, oh my God, there's a girl

431
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,200
 on, you know, she thought she'd pick this stupid topic.

432
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,360
 Oh, and the headline would have been 'Cog and Bombs' among a lot of you.

433
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,960
 And I would have written some of the newspapers going, how are you spelling the word 'bomb'?

434
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,200
 You could have saved this much, hadn't you?

435
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
 Who was your host?

436
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,120
 It was one of the tall white-haired pointy guys.

437
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
 Humphreys.

438
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
 Yes.

439
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,880
 Because everyone who watches Doctor Who has their doctor, don't they, who they grew up

440
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
 with.

441
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,480
 For me, it's a Magnus Magnus and it's my master mate.

442
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
 Well, you did eat, you know, you did a bit of chit chat.

443
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
 Yeah.

444
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
 And he said, you're right about cakes.

445
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
 And I was like, occasionally.

446
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
 And he said, why aren't you fat?

447
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
 And I was like, what kind of a question?

448
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
 Why are we going for this?

449
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
 What?

450
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
 Why are we going for this?

451
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
 Well, how?

452
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
 So I think, yeah.

453
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,480
 That's the to-date program training, kicking in, brutalising the guest before you ask the

454
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
 question.

455
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,320
 I can't help Andy, but to notice that Jenny's description of tall there to describe the

456
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
 host was very useful.

457
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
 Actually, actually, no, you're right, Dan.

458
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
 I don't think it was.

459
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
 Sorry, Jenny.

460
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,320
 You're one of the rubbish writers describing Humphreys.

461
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,880
 He's sitting down.

462
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
 Great point.

463
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,200
 So the Manhattan Project?

464
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
 Yeah.

465
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
 Yeah.

466
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
 Oppenheimer.

467
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
 And Oppenheimer.

468
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
 He was an interesting cook.

469
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
 He wasn't an Oppenheimer.

470
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
 He was.

471
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,400
 He's someone who was a bit of a troubling kid.

472
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,160
 He was running into stories where his dad kind of has to bail him out at various different

473
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,600
 times to sort of save the career that he's hoping to have.

474
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,800
 He at one point was at Cambridge University.

475
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,240
 He was studying there.

476
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,160
 And he was furious with one of his teachers, who was called Patrick Blackett.

477
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,000
 And Blackett would go on to win a Nobel Prize himself.

478
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,120
 And Blackett was forcing him to do things that weren't theoretical physics.

479
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,760
 He was taking them away from his interests.

480
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,080
 Not applied physics, fuck it.

481
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,280
 In a bit of fury, in a bit of rage, Oppenheimer.

482
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
 And this is the story.

483
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,040
 There's lots of different stories, but roughly this is it.

484
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,520
 He poisoned an apple and left it on Blackett's desk for him to eat.

485
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,360
 Like proper will kill you boys.

486
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
 Proper poison.

487
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
 Yeah.

488
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,560
 There's a lot of murky sort of territory to the story.

489
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,320
 What we do know is definitely the dad stepped in and said, "If we promise to send him to

490
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,280
 a psychiatrist, can we keep him going on and if he keeps his meetings, can he stay?"

491
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,680
 And they said, "Yeah, sure."

492
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,240
 And so that's the only reason that he...

493
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
 Lean in those days, wasn't it?

494
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
 I know.

495
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,280
 And they wouldn't like people who'd go to these posh schools, grow up, so they've got

496
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,960
 the rules done at Leighton.

497
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
 Yeah.

498
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
 It is crackers.

499
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,120
 Wasn't that the way that Alan Turing killed himself as well with the poisoned apple?

500
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
 It was, yeah.

501
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
 Supposedly that's the story.

502
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,800
 Cyanide into the side of an apple.

503
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,840
 A lot of poisoned apples around, yeah.

504
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,800
 No, Oppenheimer was very odd.

505
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,480
 So Oppenheimer is the person who, when they were setting up the Manhattan Project, they

506
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,680
 came to him and they said, "We want you to head this up."

507
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,720
 And the location, Los Alamos itself, was picked by Oppenheimer when he was on horseback going

508
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,960
 off around and he went, "This would be perfect."

509
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,960
 But even though he was given all of this high clearance and he was the head of this very

510
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,160
 secret operation, he was under constant surveillance because they also thought that he was a communist

511
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,840
 because he was very pro-communist.

512
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,400
 He was never card-carrying, but he'd said enough stuff that they thought, "This guy's

513
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,520
 going to be stealing our secrets and sending them out."

514
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
 Well, the guy that did...

515
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,640
 There was a guy called Fuchs who was there who ended up, and is possibly, depending on

516
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,160
 how you look at it, guilty of one of the worst crimes that has ever been done, who did go

517
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,360
 and sell the stuff to the Soviets or he took it to the Soviets.

518
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,800
 How would he compare against Hitler in the top trumps, please?

519
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,160
 That's an excellent question, James, when you want to get back, isn't it?

520
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
 Sorry.

521
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,360
 And nobody suspected him.

522
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,520
 Not only that, they all really liked him because he had a car and he used to give them a lift

523
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,200
 into town all the time because obviously they'd chit-chat and go, "Yeah, come on, I'll give

524
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,480
 you a little lift to the airport."

525
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,280
 And he caught all of them.

526
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,680
 Not a single one.

527
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
 Super nice guy.

528
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,360
 Would he say, "Oh, just throw your briefcase in the back of the car while we drive."

529
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
 Exactly.

530
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,680
 And there was someone in the back of the car, like under a blanket, who would then read through

531
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
 the stuff.

532
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
 Can someone go and pick up Enrico Fermi?

533
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
 I'll do it.

534
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
 Oh, my God.

535
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,800
 That was another dad rescue moment for Old Openheimer.

536
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,400
 He once got in a car crash because he tried to race a train and failed.

537
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,000
 What do you mean by racing a train?

538
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,680
 Are they going alongside each other?

539
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,160
 It feels like he was trying to outrun it and outgun it.

540
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,600
 As opposed to sometimes it would be like you're trying to cross the track to the goal.

541
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,880
 I think he was just racing.

542
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,960
 I think he was just trying to get ahead of it.

543
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,600
 And it left his girlfriend unconscious and in order to make up for this and turning into

544
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,980
 a big story, the father had to go over to the family of the young woman's house and

545
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,040
 gave a painting and an original Cezanne drawing as well.

546
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,040
 I do that, by the way, that racing after the train on the M1.

547
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,120
 You know, the last bit of the M1, the train goes alongside the road.

548
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,520
 But my car, it's an electric car, so if I go up of 70 miles an hour I lose all my battery

549
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,120
 so I tend to lose the race quite quickly.

550
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
 So funny.

551
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,760
 I really think that this film should probably be about his dad.

552
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
 Yeah.

553
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
 Old Openheimer film.

554
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
 Yeah, well it's a comedy if it's about a dad, isn't it?

555
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
 It's like, oh, Robert!

556
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,600
 It's like a Dennis the Menace movie then.

557
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,960
 Yeah, and there's a flat when he was growing up.

558
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,320
 There were three Van Gogh paintings and some Picasso's too and clearly some Cezanne's as

559
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
 well.

560
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,720
 They were very, very wealthy people when he was growing up.

561
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,480
 But his, Dan, you mentioned he was suspected of being a communist or of being suspect.

562
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,600
 He was approached by Soviet intelligence in 1943 and he said, "No, I'm not going to

563
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
 show you the secrets."

564
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,680
 But it still wrecked his career anyway because he didn't tell anyone.

565
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,760
 So he lost his clearance, his security clearance in 1954.

566
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,680
 Feels like his cat's out of the bag then.

567
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,600
 I mean, they've got the bomb.

568
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,240
 But it was overtized to communism, it was in the whole McCarthy witch trial period.

569
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,320
 But the U.S. Department of Energy did reverse their decision in 2022.

570
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,020
 Just 55 years after he died, they said, "You know what?

571
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,880
 You can have your security clearance back."

572
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
 Very helpful.

573
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,160
 I mean, it was a gesture, obviously.

574
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
 Maybe he's still alive.

575
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,480
 You don't know what these atomic bombs are going to do to your...

576
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
 Yeah.

577
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,520
 I would say that there was a movement on to stop people smoking on film because it wasn't

578
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
 very interesting.

579
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
 Oh, yeah.

580
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,720
 They just pooped down.

581
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,040
 And then I watched Casablanca because I'd never seen it.

582
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,600
 And everyone is chugging on fags 100% the time and it's disgusting.

583
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,240
 It was so disgusting.

584
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,600
 And Oppenheimer never, ever took a breath that didn't have a cigarette on it.

585
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,160
 So I'm feeling quite sorry for the actor because...

586
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,240
 Killian Murphy who's playing down the movie.

587
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
 Yeah, because he never...

588
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,840
 He was a chain smoker.

589
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,600
 He never took a breath without a cigarette.

590
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
 That's what he says.

591
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,320
 Part of the prep of trying to become Oppenheimer was basically cigarettes and cocktails with

592
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
 the...

593
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
 Yeah, cigarettes and martinis.

594
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
 Yeah.

595
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
 No, bro.

596
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,120
 I'm going to have to go method.

597
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
 Oh.

598
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
 Gosh.

599
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,920
 It's really weird because when I think about the atomic bomb and I think most people obviously

600
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,240
 where we see it as one of the worst moments in history and there's obviously the arguments

601
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,440
 that people make that it may have saved more lives like Churchill and so on.

602
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,640
 But to sort of actively celebrate it feels quite an odd thing to me.

603
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,920
 And if you do go to Los Alamos now, that is very much what they do.

604
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,800
 Like it's their tourism trade, isn't it?

605
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,360
 So there's a supermarket there with an atomic bar.

606
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,040
 You can get atomic salsa that you can buy and purchase.

607
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,000
 There's atomic bumper stickers.

608
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 There's a... you can buy clothing for babies where there's a mushroom cloud on it that

609
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,680
 says the words, "I've been dropping bombs since day one."

610
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
 Oh.

611
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,520
 You know, there's all these merch things and it feels a bit out of taste except I guess

612
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
 it's not to them, right?

613
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
 Well, I don't know.

614
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,040
 I mean, I grew up in a world where we went to a big room on Sunday and there was a guy

615
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
 with nails in his hand.

616
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
 That's true.

617
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
 I went to Hiroshima.

618
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
 Yeah.

619
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,400
 I've said this before, but if you go to Hiroshima, you can go where the bomb was dropped to the

620
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
 exact spot.

621
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
 Wow.

622
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,720
 And there's a sign on the wall and it says the first nuclear bomb was detonated something

623
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,240
 like 100 feet above this point.

624
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,640
 And then you sort of look upwards and you can imagine the exact spot where the bomb would

625
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,960
 have gone off and then detonated and killed all those people.

626
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
 Wow.

627
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
 It's really amazing.

628
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,080
 Do you know about Trinitite?

629
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
 Trinitite?

630
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,920
 I think it's Trinitite because it was the Trinity test.

631
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
 Oh, okay.

632
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,680
 So it's not got three nitrogen atoms.

633
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
 That's why it's called Trinitite.

634
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,680
 No, sorry.

635
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
 No, I just said it wrong.

636
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
 Yeah.

637
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
 Trinitite, I'm sure.

638
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
 And it was...

639
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
 Is it a type of stone?

640
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:10,480
 It's a type of glass made when the sand turned to glass when they tested the first bomb.

641
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,680
 And it's called, it's also called atom sight, it's light green glass.

642
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,920
 And it was just left there.

643
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,360
 Is it radioactive?

644
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,840
 I think it is not very anymore, but it's still a little radioactive.

645
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,640
 So most of it was bulldozed by the US Atomic Energy Commission and buried, you know, but

646
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,300
 some of it's still there because ants will bring it to the surface, these tiny beads

647
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,800
 of glass because some of it's under the soil and they're digging their tunnels and so it

648
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,600
 just gets pushed up.

649
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,000
 It's crazy and it's illegal to take it away now.

650
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,080
 But for a while it was just thought, oh, it's just sand, it's just sand turned to glass.

651
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,920
 And so there was a period in 1945 and 46 where it was marketed in jewellery.

652
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,880
 You could get Trinitite jewellery.

653
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,760
 There was a designer who made some earrings and a hairpin from it and there was an actress

654
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
 called Merle Oberon.

655
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,360
 She wore some of it to a fundraiser.

656
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,680
 Supposedly this is quite dark.

657
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,680
 To discredit Japanese claims about radiation injury.

658
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
 What?

659
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,560
 So, you know, well, I mean, an actress is wearing some of the sand fused glass, so it can't

660
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
 be that dangerous.

661
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
 But obviously...

662
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
 That's terrible.

663
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,280
 Supposedly, I don't...

664
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,840
 Just because you've mentioned this, I haven't gotten this written down, but using one of

665
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,240
 these bombs is one of the methods that they've been thinking about it to try and get deeper

666
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
 and deeper.

667
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
 Boring into the ground.

668
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,080
 It can get something like 18 miles really quickly just through an explosion.

669
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
 But because of the...

670
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
 What?

671
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,080
 I don't know, as I say, I sort of like...

672
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,640
 For instance, the Soviets were going to use nuclear bombs to open up waterways in the

673
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,080
 north of Russia, for instance.

674
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,840
 So that has been thought of in the past, used nuclear for...

675
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,000
 Oh, no one tell one of those stupid billionaires, they're just going to do it.

676
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,120
 And what would happen, though, is that the surrounding casing of the hole would have

677
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,200
 fused into this glass like substance as well.

678
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,120
 So it would be like a really amazing slide, like almost immediately.

679
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,920
 You've been spending too much time in soft places, has there?

680
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,080
 Not coming to your soft places.

681
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:19,080
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

682
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,480
 My fact this week is that the actor John Candy was born on Halloween.

683
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
 Pretty.

684
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,720
 Okay, it's time for fact number four, and his name's Candy.

685
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
 His name's Candy.

686
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,800
 And what do you get on Halloween?

687
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
 There you go.

688
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:37,000
 Was he called John Skeleton Candy?

689
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Terrifying.

690
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 I wish.

691
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,240
 Yeah, so John Candy, most of you should know him.

692
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
 The Candyman.

693
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
 Well, no.

694
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,240
 John Candyman.

695
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
 The man, John Candy.

696
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
 He was in Cool Runnings.

697
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
 He was in Cool Runnings.

698
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
 He was in Plain Trains and Automobiles.

699
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
 He was in Uncle Buck.

700
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:57,800
 He's one of the greatest comedy actors that Canada has ever produced.

701
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,000
 And I found this, by the way, in a really great book I'm reading at the moment called Wild

702
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,280
 and Crazy Guys, which is all about that period of when SNL and America exploded, so he had

703
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,340
 Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy and John Belushi and Chevy

704
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,340
 Chase and so on.

705
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,600
 And John Candy, obviously a big player in that area.

706
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,080
 And yeah, so it's just a little detail in that book, and I thought I'd love to talk

707
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
 about John Candy.

708
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
 Great.

709
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
 Well, we're not going to.

710
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,520
 Yep, let's move on to the types of Candy.

711
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,800
 Also born on Halloween, John Keats.

712
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
 Yes.

713
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,080
 So who in that episode, I think I might have mentioned, was possibly a grave robber, John

714
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,720
 Keats, because he was a medical student, and at that time they needed bodies to do their

715
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,800
 experiments on, and possibly he could have been one of the body stealers.

716
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,920
 Add Rock of the Beastie Boys.

717
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
 Oh, yay.

718
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
 Beastie Boys.

719
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
 Nice.

720
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
 Yeah.

721
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
 Yeah.

722
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:56,720
 Sydney Park, who's an actor from The Walking Dead, born on Halloween, and Kirk Noble Blutsworth,

723
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,520
 who was the first American census to death to be exonerated post-conviction, so was supposed

724
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,160
 to be executed and then turned out DNA testing meant that he hadn't done it.

725
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
 So he got off.

726
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,960
 And the Halloween link is that he's got blood, doesn't he?

727
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
 Death.

728
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
 Oh yeah, blood.

729
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
 Yeah.

730
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
 Get off.

731
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
 Come on, that was really stretching.

732
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
 Yeah.

733
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
 Yeah, I felt the stretch.

734
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
 That's an afternoon twerk.

735
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
 Yeah.

736
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,240
 But it's unusual, because fewer people are born on Halloween than on other days around

737
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
 the year.

738
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,760
 Hang on, or push through, or find a way.

739
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,800
 It's just really miserable in February, it seemed the obvious.

740
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

741
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
 It's January and I'm really miserable.

742
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
 Do I not have sex that way?

743
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
 Oh, so good news.

744
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,280
 I was like, Jenny doesn't know when Halloween is.

745
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,280
 Well, actually, in February, that is one of the most common days.

746
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,560
 Valentine's Day is a very common day for births, which is when my daughter was born actually

747
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:55,120
 on Valentine's Day, but there's a 3.6% increase on births in Valentine's Day.

748
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,000
 And a 5.3% decrease of spontaneous births on Halloween.

749
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,420
 Is that like the Christmas thing, where it's just that hospitals are a bit quieter and

750
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
 therefore...

751
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,420
 I think it's a bit of that, perhaps.

752
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,060
 The other thing is that Caesareans is a big difference.

753
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,060
 Right, yes.

754
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,560
 You wouldn't not book a Caesarean for Halloween, would you?

755
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
 Well, you might not.

756
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,200
 If you were given three dates to choose, you might decide not to go for Halloween.

757
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,200
 Really?

758
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
 Is that...

759
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
 They'd have the emergency ones, obviously, but of course, yeah.

760
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,200
 Oh, so don't forget that in some places, not necessarily here, but in some places,

761
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,760
 that's quite a big drinking night.

762
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:32,840
 So, you may not possibly want a bunch of student meds, so yeah, that's a thing.

763
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,840
 Wow.

764
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
 That's very cool.

765
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,840
 I love it.

766
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
 Yeah.

767
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
 Can we talk about candy?

768
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
 Yeah, okay.

769
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
 Yeah.

770
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
 Now, Dan, you've got a lot of stuff on junk.

771
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
 No, I just want to quickly just say, because he died very young.

772
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,720
 He was 43 when he died of a heart attack, and he was, you know, he was in Home Alone.

773
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
 He was in...

774
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,120
 There's so many seminal movies of the '90s that he was in.

775
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,200
 He was known as Sweet Tooth when he was a kid, so he did love candy as well as he was

776
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
 growing up.

777
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
 All kids loved candy.

778
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,200
 All kids loved candy, but he was called John Candy, and he was called Sweet Tooth.

779
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,400
 Are they all called Candy or Sweet Tooth?

780
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
 No.

781
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,320
 He wanted to be a sports star.

782
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,360
 That was his big thing, and so he had an injury, which meant that he couldn't do that.

783
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
 He played American football, right?

784
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,800
 Yeah, he played American football, so he had the physique, which was trained to be someone

785
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,160
 who was going to play that game.

786
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,480
 So, all the cast members of Saturday Night Live and all the other things he did always

787
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,080
 used to say that if you saw John Candy and you approached him, people like Dan Aykroyd

788
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,440
 say this, he would lift you up with one hand vertically and spin you around like a pizza

789
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
 with being prepared.

790
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
 What?

791
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
 Yeah.

792
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
 He used to...

793
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,280
 Every once said that if you saw John Candy, he would lift you up with one hand, hold you

794
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,400
 above his head, and spin you around.

795
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,280
 First of all, American footballers don't do that.

796
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
 No.

797
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
 True.

798
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,720
 But the point is, is that he had a physique whereby lots of other people say that one

799
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,040
 of their favorite things to do was to act like an NFL ball, and if John Candy came into

800
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
 the room...

801
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
 He'd throw it at him.

802
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
 300 yards.

803
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,040
 No, they would run at him, jump at him, tuck, and he would catch them as if they were an

804
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
 NFL ball.

805
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
 Come on.

806
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
 And these are grown adults.

807
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
 You know, Aykroyd's six foot three.

808
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,040
 He was an offensive lineman in American football, I read.

809
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
 Right.

810
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,760
 So, that means that he's basically a blocker.

811
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,520
 You give the ball to your quarterback who's trying to do something, and he's trying to

812
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,200
 stop everyone from coming towards him.

813
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
 So, he must have been big.

814
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
 He was.

815
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
 He was a...

816
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
 Yeah, he was tall.

817
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
 I mean, he was six foot three himself.

818
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,200
 He was a big guy, but he was also just, he was physically ready to catch humans.

819
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
 Yeah.

820
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,840
 I just don't think any of that stuff happened.

821
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
 He did?

822
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
 He did?

823
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
 Multiple people said it.

824
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
 Like, it's not like...

825
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
 It's a...

826
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
 Yeah, like a fan saying it.

827
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
 I do actually...

828
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,560
 To be fair, I was looking a little bit at John Candy.

829
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,000
 I did read that if, like, if you ran at him, he would put you on a big wooden pallet and

830
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,400
 he'd slide you into an oven.

831
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
 Horrible.

832
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
 It's just...

833
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
 Like, I think they're exaggerating the story.

834
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,120
 They're just, these are the stories, these are the stories they say.

835
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,120
 Maybe it was Gingerbread.

836
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,320
 Should we talk about Candy?

837
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,000
 Yeah, yeah, John Candy.

838
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Oh my God.

839
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 No, no, no, no.

840
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,680
 Well, I'll just say one really sweet thing is that when he died, again, he was very young.

841
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,920
 He had a heart attack while he was making a movie in New Mexico.

842
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,440
 Did he die from the atomic bomb?

843
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,080
 Oh, was he in that movie that Andy was talking about where people had a heart attack?

844
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

845
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
 Oh, yeah.

846
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
 Wow.

847
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
 He had a heart attack on everyone.

848
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,240
 But he had a funeral at Sunset Boulevard and then they went down to the cemetery and

849
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,520
 they took the 405 three-way and it was completely clear.

850
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,760
 They had no idea why it was completely clear and what it turned out was is that the highway

851
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:32,440
 patrol had stopped all road access to anything but this and it was their choice to do that

852
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,560
 and it was them tipping their hat to say, "We loved you and we miss you," and it's because

853
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,040
 in ten of his movies, and, you know, he didn't live that long so it's a short time he made

854
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
 these movies.

855
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,320
 He played a law enforcement officer in ten of these movies and so they felt like there

856
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,120
 was a friend that they'd lost, you know, one of them, yeah.

857
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
 Anyway, RIP John Candy.

858
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,320
 I know I'm a bit late in saying it but, yeah, condolences to the family.

859
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,480
 All right, do your candy now, your actual candy.

860
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,160
 Andy, give us some candy.

861
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,360
 I was just thinking, Jenny, you're from a great confectionary nation, Scotland.

862
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
 I am, yes.

863
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
 We have some tunics on the table.

864
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
 We have some tunics in front.

865
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
 It's very exciting.

866
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,040
 Very good at not diving in, I feel that.

867
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
 Yeah, yeah.

868
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
 I'm opening one now.

869
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
 Okay, correct.

870
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
 I might do it as well, yeah.

871
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,760
 Okay, when everyone's finished, okay, so get this.

872
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,960
 This is a sort of scientific thing about sugar.

873
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,840
 People who are from Northern Europe are some of the most sugar sensitive people in the

874
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,480
 world and there might be a proper, an evolutionary reason for this.

875
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
 What do you mean by sensitive?

876
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,600
 Do you mean as in it's bad for us or we react to it?

877
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,120
 No, as in it can detect it, can detect it more easily.

878
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,640
 So this is really interesting.

879
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,040
 There are particular variations in a sugar-sensing gene and people from Northern latitudes have

880
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,760
 that more than people who live in tropical areas and the theory is, one theory is, that

881
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,320
 it's not certain, obviously, but in higher latitudes, really sweet fruit and veg are

882
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,040
 a bit less common and they're necessary to survive.

883
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,560
 It's not like in tropical regions where you have really sugary sweet things and it's easy

884
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,720
 to find them and survive.

885
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,640
 So maybe if you move north, you will benefit from having that sensitivity.

886
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,960
 If carrots and parsnips are quite sweet, but if you can't detect that, then you might

887
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,040
 not realise and you might not grow those foods or you might not seek them out and you'll

888
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,480
 be less likely to survive.

889
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,920
 So Jenny, you're from further north and the rest of us are on this table, do you feel

890
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
 that that's true?

891
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,160
 I'm very wary of things that feel true, but that does actually kind of feel true and

892
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,760
 whilst it's kind of touching in a way, it's also horrendous that the number one operation

893
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,640
 performed in children in Scotland is tooth extraction.

894
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,640
 Wow.

895
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
 There is it.

896
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,600
 I read that you know how dogs are good at detecting things, we might come on to that

897
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
 later.

898
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
 Oh yeah.

899
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,120
 But everyone thinks that dogs have got amazing smell compared to humans.

900
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,640
 We say do, but it's for certain chemicals and for certain chemicals, humans are better

901
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,000
 and I think, for instance, if you were to put a bar of chocolate in the middle of a field

902
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,440
 and train the human to look for it and train the dog to look for it, the human might come

903
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,440
 out on top.

904
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
 Wow.

905
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,760
 So you're looking for sugar and looking for fats and stuff like that, yeah.

906
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
 That's so cool.

907
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
 I don't know if that's true.

908
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,160
 We might come on to that later.

909
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,760
 Do you know, I was looking for what's the most popular candy, I hate that word.

910
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
 Do you say sweets?

911
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
 Sweets.

912
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,280
 So my husband says lollies because he's from New Zealand and my children say bombo because

913
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
 they're from France.

914
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
 Right.

915
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,360
 Sorry, can I just stop and just, I think the way that you're eating this tonic's too

916
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
 big to me.

917
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
 Yeah.

918
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
 You do it upside down too.

919
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
 No, that's how I have it.

920
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,360
 It's basically what my only fan says.

921
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,560
 So Jenny has taken, if you know what a teacake is, it's marshmallow with a bit of biscuit

922
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,960
 on the bottom or cake covered in chocolate.

923
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,360
 Jenny has sort of separated the cake and the marshmallow and it's starting to-

924
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,680
 I'm now terribly self-conscious.

925
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:54,160
 You're like turning it into a naked burger where you just take the buns off and leave

926
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,160
 them on the side.

927
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,000
 Well, you know, just shoving it all in my go up doesn't work very well.

928
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 Jenny, I'll do the same thing.

929
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 There we go.

930
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 Do you?

931
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,640
 You've just been into it.

932
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
 No, I haven't.

933
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
 I've done it carefully.

934
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,640
 I know what I'm doing.

935
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
 I debase it.

936
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,200
 And by the way, I have this family here from Scotland as well.

937
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
 Exactly.

938
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
 You know, the old skills.

939
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
 They kick in.

940
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
 Genetic.

941
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,280
 I'm just speaking about tea stuff, Jenny.

942
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,600
 This is an interesting thing.

943
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,120
 Candy Floss was popularised by a dentist.

944
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
 Interesting.

945
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:27,440
 Actually, do you know when you were talking about John Candy, you know, nominal to determinism

946
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,320
 how tedious it is because it makes us all look like really boring humans.

947
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,000
 Literally made us our fortune on this podcast.

948
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,280
 We get a lot of correspondence about it.

949
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
 So please be careful.

950
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,880
 Like the inbox will just be recovering from the Doctor Who onslaught.

951
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,840
 Well, I was only going to say, and I think, I hope this is not too controversial because

952
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:50,000
 it is true, that dentists, first names are vastly over-represented by for women, Denise,

953
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,200
 and for men, Dennis.

954
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
 That's so good.

955
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
 That's so nice.

956
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,600
 It's just such a kind of, you're a big meat sack, takes the easiest route out of it that

957
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,760
 you can possibly think of, human.

958
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,640
 It was called Fairy Floss at the time.

959
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
 Yeah.

960
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,360
 I just wanted to say it was William J. Morrison teamed up with a Nashville confectioner in

961
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,600
 1897.

962
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,720
 And despite being president of the Tennessee State Dental Association, no small thing.

963
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
 Was he trying to drill up more business?

964
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
 Drill up.

965
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
 Very good, James.

966
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
 Nice.

967
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
 That's crazy.

968
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,520
 I've got to be the one to acknowledge how good it was.

969
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,720
 Who's ever really drilled up in that sense?

970
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
 Nobody.

971
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
 Oh, God.

972
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,520
 I don't know what came up and be that.

973
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
 Yeah.

974
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,160
 You didn't even give us time not to laugh.

975
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
 Drill up, dude.

976
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,360
 Do you know what Candy Floss is in Greek?

977
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,240
 Oh, no I don't, actually.

978
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,440
 Well, it translates as old woman's hair.

979
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,440
 Oh.

980
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,640
 Because it's wispy.

981
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
 Yes.

982
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,960
 And in Afrikaans, I love this, it's ghost breath.

983
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
 Lovely.

984
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
 Yeah.

985
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,840
 Do you know what the Mexican term for eye candy is, if you say a little bit about a candy?

986
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
 No.

987
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
 Eye taco.

988
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
 Stop it.

989
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
 It is.

990
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
 It's eye taco.

991
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,360
 That sounds like a new Apple product, isn't it?

992
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:12,280
 The revolutionary eye taco after just six hours of charging, you could enjoy the taco

993
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,840
 for ten minutes.

994
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,400
 I was reading about my favorite confectionery, which is popping candy, which I genuinely

995
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,200
 think is completely underused in the world, and I think you should really pretty much

996
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,960
 put it on everything.

997
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,360
 And it was invented by a guy who was trying to make an instant soft drink.

998
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,600
 This is amazing.

999
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,400
 So he's trying to make something like, let's say Coca-Cola.

1000
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,160
 And what his idea was, he wanted something like cordial.

1001
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,720
 You would have something and you would pour the water on it, and then when the water comes

1002
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,040
 in, it turns automatically into a fizzy drink.

1003
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,320
 And so he got some sugar and he heated it up really, really high, put it under a load

1004
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,280
 of pressure, added a load of gas into it, and then cooled it down.

1005
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,800
 And in theory, what a great idea.

1006
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,160
 As soon as you put the water in, the gas will get released and it will be really fizzy.

1007
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,360
 It didn't work.

1008
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,680
 That's so cool though.

1009
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,280
 But he started eating it and it gave him these sort of explosions in his mouth.

1010
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:15,520
 So his experiments went wrong and he went, I'll just stick it in my mouth.

1011
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,520
 Good science.

1012
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520
 That's so cool.

1013
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,360
 And then everyone, all of the other people in his office saw this was happening.

1014
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,360
 They used to have competitions see how much they could put in the mouth of this stuff.

1015
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,200
 They would get bigger and bigger rocks of it and see how much they could do.

1016
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,440
 But immediately, as soon as they went on sale, pop rocks, they called in America, there was

1017
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,760
 rumours that children's stomachs were exploding.

1018
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,760
 The first fatality was, yeah, it was all over the place.

1019
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,400
 And the pop rocks company had to take out full page advertisements in more than 40 publications

1020
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,440
 around the country to say, these will not make your child explode, honestly.

1021
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,520
 And the head of the company wrote 50,000 letters to school principals saying, can you

1022
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,880
 please stop banning these things?

1023
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,880
 Marketing genius.

1024
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
 Yeah.

1025
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
 That's amazing.

1026
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,520
 You almost certainly won't kill your kids.

1027
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
 Bring it.

1028
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1029
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,080
 Does anybody want to hear my worst Japanese Kit Kat flavor?

1030
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,080
 Oh, yeah.

1031
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,440
 You know, there's now over 300.

1032
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
 Yeah.

1033
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
 Okay, wow.

1034
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,000
 And I was looking down the list and there's some pretty bad ones in there, I think, European

1035
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 cheese.

1036
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 Oh.

1037
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 Wow.

1038
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 What is European cheese?

1039
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,640
 There's no such thing as European cheese.

1040
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,920
 I believe the Dutch would like a word with you.

1041
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,800
 Sorry, there are European cheeses, but there is not one archetypal European cheese.

1042
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
 There are hundreds.

1043
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,160
 But I guess in Japan, you might lump a sort of yellow pungent cheese as a European cheese,

1044
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
 right?

1045
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
 Yeah, because American cheese.

1046
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,160
 Like, dairy's not that big in Japan, right?

1047
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
 Yeah.

1048
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,160
 Or China.

1049
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,680
 Well, American cheese comes in single shrink-wrapped slice form.

1050
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,760
 Yes, but it's different types of cheese.

1051
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,440
 But that's, but what, no, no, sorry, no, no, no, I'm not having it.

1052
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
 Here's the thing.

1053
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,400
 This is something interesting, I think, and I might butcher this, but I'll try my best.

1054
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:05,480
 So when cheese first came to Japan, because it wasn't traditionally eaten over there,

1055
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,680
 they called it something like dairy tofu, something like that.

1056
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,360
 And when tofu first came to France, they called it soya cheese.

1057
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,360
 Brilliant.

1058
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
 I think that's right.

1059
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,560
 That's really good.

1060
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,680
 That's distracted me from my anger about the European cheese.

1061
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,680
 Thank you.

1062
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,700
 I was going to say, James always manages to find a fact to calm you down.

1063
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,700
 It's really dramatic.

1064
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,700
 Yeah.

1065
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,700
 Get two on top of it.

1066
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,700
 Yeah.

1067
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,720
 Have you guys ever had an aniseed ball?

1068
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,720
 Yeah.

1069
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,720
 No.

1070
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,720
 What's that?

1071
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,720
 What's that tiny bit in the middle?

1072
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,720
 Right.

1073
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,720
 Is that what you're going to tell us?

1074
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,720
 No.

1075
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,720
 That's an aniseed seed.

1076
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,720
 I think it is.

1077
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,720
 Yeah, yeah.

1078
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,720
 Can you describe it to me?

1079
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,720
 I don't know.

1080
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,960
 So it's a small, round, purple ball, very, very hard, and it's layer after layer of slightly

1081
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,960
 flavored licorice.

1082
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
 It's horrible.

1083
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
 Boiled.

1084
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,480
 Yeah, they're very unpopular with lots.

1085
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
 They're quite 1930s.

1086
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
 Not gobstoppers.

1087
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,120
 No, it's like a very small gobstopper.

1088
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,500
 But it's quite strong tasting and aniseed, right?

1089
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,500
 So, okay.

1090
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,500
 This is very cool.

1091
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,940
 They slightly helped to win the Second World War, aniseed balls.

1092
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,940
 Brilliant.

1093
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:12,080
 In 1939, the War Office, they wanted to build a limpid mind that you could stick to the

1094
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,340
 hull of the ship, swim away from, and it detonates later, right?

1095
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,300
 And the War Office, they contacted a science magazine editor called Stuart McCrae, and

1096
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,140
 he contacted someone he knew, an inventor called Cecil Clark, who was also a caravan

1097
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,140
 maker.

1098
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,140
 Detail.

1099
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,800
 They started working together, right?

1100
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,380
 They had the details of the mine, and they had the explosive, and they had the way to

1101
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,560
 attach it to the ship, so they were doing really well.

1102
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:38,540
 But what they needed was something to keep apart the hammer and the detonator, right?

1103
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,680
 So that when you're swimming up, when you're a frogman swimming up, you attach the mine,

1104
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,680
 and you prime it.

1105
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,680
 It doesn't go off immediately.

1106
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:50,520
 So you need something that slowly dissolves and separates the hammer and the detonator.

1107
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,200
 And Clark's kids were eating aniseed balls, and they tried them out, and they found they

1108
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,880
 dissolved in about half an hour in water.

1109
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,960
 But you didn't have to suck the grenade.

1110
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,960
 No.

1111
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,320
 Yeah, it's a mouth activated.

1112
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:09,520
 So Clark and McCrae, they bought every aniseed ball in Bedford, right?

1113
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,120
 Because they're for their experiments.

1114
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,840
 But the problem was they also needed something to keep the aniseed ball dry until the mine

1115
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,200
 was in place, right?

1116
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,080
 So they also went around buying all the condoms in Bedford.

1117
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:29,760
 Imagine getting to the supermarket checkout, you just got a trolley full of condoms and

1118
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,760
 aniseed balls.

1119
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,640
 Clark said we got a completely undeserved reputation as sexual athletes because we

1120
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,640
 were...

1121
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,640
 But they worked.

1122
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,320
 The aniseed balls worked in this mine, and the MAD commissioned them, the War Office

1123
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,600
 commissioned them, and they started buying aniseed balls directly from the manufacturer.

1124
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,600
 And I love this.

1125
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,840
 Clark also commissioned some miniature condoms from a rubber factory to cover the firing

1126
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,840
 mechanism.

1127
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:57,040
 Imagine if it's the pharmacist to begin with going, "Do you have any smaller condoms?"

1128
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,040
 I got smaller.

1129
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,960
 No, I got smaller than that.

1130
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:06,920
 I love how we've gone from like the biggest bomb the world has ever known.

1131
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:15,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

1132
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 My fact is that there are only three newt-detecting dogs on the planet.

1133
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 Brilliant.

1134
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 Yeah.

1135
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:30,320
 This is a woman called Nicola Jane Glover, she's a dog owner, and she's got a spaniel

1136
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,440
 called Freya, and another dog called Newtky.

1137
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,600
 And this was in an article in The Guardian recently, but it's actually been going on

1138
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,960
 for a few years, so I think at least in 2018 Freya was detecting newts.

1139
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,120
 And the reason you need to detect newts is that there's a species called the great crested

1140
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:51,200
 Newt which is protected, and if you're developing land you have to show that there are no newts

1141
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,640
 there, because they don't want to endanger them, and it's really hard to find them, because

1142
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,840
 they spend a lot of their time underground and in the water, because they're amphibious.

1143
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:04,240
 So Nicola Glover, she and her colleagues, they trained Freya, the spaniel, to detect

1144
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,480
 live newts, and Freya can do it really, really well now, 90% detection rate.

1145
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,360
 And it's a good method of saving the newt and saving a lot of time and fuss, and newt

1146
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,360
 detection work.

1147
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,200
 And the other thing about this story, although there's a third one, who's Rocky from Flintshire,

1148
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,880
 who was also trained separately in 2020, there was a correction in The Guardian article about

1149
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,880
 the dogs, which I think you saw, Jenny.

1150
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,880
 This article was amended.

1151
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,000
 An earlier version said that great crested Newts reached an adult overall length of 17

1152
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 metres.

1153
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,480
 I thought that's the one I read, and I thought, well, why do you need a dog?

1154
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,480
 It should have been 17 centimetres.

1155
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,800
 Yeah, I read an article from 2011 that said that they were starting to do this with the

1156
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,520
 crested Newts, but also desert tortoises, kiwis, cacopos, bats, cheetahs, I don't know why.

1157
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,480
 Brown tree snakes, seals, and bed bugs.

1158
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,900
 So dogs were being taught to look for all these things for various different reasons.

1159
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,480
 The cheetahs, I think they're looking for the scat for the poo.

1160
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,480
 Not actual.

1161
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,480
 Not actual.

1162
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,160
 Oh, one went past about five minutes ago.

1163
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,160
 Who's a dog person?

1164
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,160
 Who's a cat person?

1165
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,160
 I'm a dog.

1166
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,160
 You're a cat person?

1167
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,160
 Yeah.

1168
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,080
 It's not a bit embarrassing when someone goes, oh, my dog just discovered the ancient caves

1169
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,080
 at Lussel.

1170
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,240
 And you're like, yeah, my cat ate a curtain.

1171
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,120
 Yeah, my cat doesn't give a fuck.

1172
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,880
 Yeah, I mean, I would say I'm probably not really either, but I've had cats forced upon

1173
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,880
 me, so.

1174
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:43,280
 But I went following the story in terms of things dogs do unbelievable stuff all the

1175
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,280
 time.

1176
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,280
 Yeah.

1177
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,280
 You're a dog person, aren't you?

1178
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,280
 Yeah, but my dogs are crap.

1179
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,280
 They're absolutely rubbish.

1180
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,280
 You've got dogs.

1181
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,280
 I've got two dogs.

1182
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,280
 Each idiot.

1183
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,320
 Fight seals on a regular basis.

1184
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,320
 Fight seals.

1185
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,320
 Successfully.

1186
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
 There's a lot of seals where we live.

1187
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,320
 Wow.

1188
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,320
 That's so cool.

1189
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,320
 Yeah.

1190
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,800
 Well, it's not cool because the seals just go, see you later, and swim off, and then

1191
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,240
 you have to go and rescue your dog, who's the moron.

1192
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,240
 But maybe you've not given them the chance to work out if they're like semen sniffing

1193
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,240
 dogs or if they are.

1194
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,240
 Jesus.

1195
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
 That's on my list.

1196
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,240
 That's on my list.

1197
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,240
 Why would you, that's the first on your list to say.

1198
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,240
 That just was fast.

1199
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,240
 Give me back up a little.

1200
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,760
 Is that what you say to anyone who's walking a dog in the park?

1201
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,760
 You're like, have you ever given it a chance to be a semen sniffing dog?

1202
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,760
 I've got a pocket full of amethyst balls, I've got another pocket full of mini cundoms.

1203
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,760
 You've got a semen sniffing dog.

1204
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,760
 Let's talk.

1205
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,760
 Is that with an A?

1206
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,760
 Are you spelling that with an A?

1207
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,760
 No, I don't think that is, no.

1208
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,760
 No, no, no.

1209
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,760
 Jenny, you write romantic novels, don't you?

1210
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,760
 Have you ever had a semen sniffing dog?

1211
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,760
 It's raining months just here for the inspiration.

1212
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,760
 Hang on.

1213
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,760
 Tight, tight, tight.

1214
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,760
 She was a girl from the city with a semen sniffing dog and a heart of gold.

1215
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,760
 So, okay.

1216
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,760
 It's used for, you know, I mean, unfortunately it's used for terrible, terrible reasons.

1217
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,760
 Yeah, for crimes and so on.

1218
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,760
 But that's an important thing.

1219
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:14,760
 They need to sometimes have a dog detect whether or not someone might have recently have left

1220
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,760
 some semen out because it can find the traces on it.

1221
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:22,760
 And it can detect as little as 0.016 millilitres of seminal fluid.

1222
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,760
 So, they're very good at it.

1223
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:31,760
 So, what I'm saying is your dog might not have been given the chance to show that it could smell semen

1224
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,760
 or find whale poo because they do that as well.

1225
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,760
 They sit on boats and they can find whale.

1226
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,760
 I see clever dogs like Spaniels.

1227
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,760
 Spaniels are like real teacher pleasers.

1228
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,760
 Oh yeah, right.

1229
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,760
 Pairs and they're cool.

1230
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,760
 One of your ducks.

1231
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,760
 Kind of just terrifying half-cougar things that we found in the laba.

1232
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,760
 But I must.

1233
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,760
 No, they're terriers.

1234
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,760
 Oh, okay, okay.

1235
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,760
 So, but they're kind of, they're theoretically ratters.

1236
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
 But they're just a bit rubbish.

1237
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,760
 What does that fit in your...

1238
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,760
 I'd need to see a photo.

1239
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,760
 There's a game called Hound Pooch or Mutt.

1240
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,760
 Almost any dog fits into those categories.

1241
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,760
 Oh, Hounds, they're Hounds.

1242
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,760
 They're Hounds.

1243
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,760
 Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1244
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,760
 When Melvis sang "You Ain't Nothing but a Hound Dog", he was playing that game, wasn't he?

1245
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1246
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,760
 He'd already recorded a version called "You Ain't Nothing but a Pooch Dog".

1247
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,760
 I don't think it's rubbish.

1248
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,760
 There was an interesting story about a man I'd never heard of, really, really amazing.

1249
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,760
 He was a German diplomat.

1250
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,760
 He was sort of sided on the side of the Nazis at the time.

1251
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,760
 And he was an attaché for the Nazis.

1252
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,760
 He's called George Ferdinand Duckwitz.

1253
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,760
 Duckwitz.

1254
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,760
 Must have had a rough time at school.

1255
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,760
 Ferdinand Duckwitz is asking for a spoonerism, isn't he?

1256
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,760
 Yeah.

1257
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,760
 He's an amazing character.

1258
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,760
 He sits in the world of Oscar Schindler.

1259
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,760
 He was someone who helped to save a lot of refugees who were stuck in Denmark.

1260
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,760
 And supposedly 95% of their Jewish population was successfully taken out of the country

1261
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,760
 to a safe place in Sweden because of this guy.

1262
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,760
 And he risked his life to do it.

1263
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,760
 So he's an amazing character.

1264
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,760
 Oh, and you called him a fuckwit, James.

1265
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:10,760
 Oh, okay.

1266
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,760
 Sorry, Duckwitz, yeah, yeah.

1267
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,760
 I'm not going to trivialise his memory.

1268
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,760
 Not well done, James.

1269
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,760
 Okay, so where's the dog coming in here?

1270
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,760
 The dog comes in here because when they were taking them out on all the boats

1271
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,760
 and they were hiding them in the cargo,

1272
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,760
 a lot of dogs had been trained up in order to sniff out any humans that were on board.

1273
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,760
 So this is a problem that they had.

1274
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,760
 So what they did was they came up with an idea that they could deceive the sniffer dogs

1275
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,760
 by placing seamen in there.

1276
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,760
 You were giving me that look like it was heading there.

1277
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,760
 They created what was a mixture of dried rabbit blood and cocaine.

1278
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,760
 And they gave it to the fishermen.

1279
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,760
 They gave it to the fishermen.

1280
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,760
 Who would coat it in handkerchiefs.

1281
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,760
 And then they would hold the handkerchiefs and the dogs would race towards the handkerchief.

1282
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,760
 They would ignore any of the other smells that were on the boat.

1283
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,760
 And so as a result, they would have no other interest in what was going on here.

1284
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,760
 And that would become the main focus.

1285
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,760
 Why the cocaine?

1286
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,760
 I mean, rabbit blood, I guess, dogs.

1287
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,760
 Well, rabbit blood is to attract them and the cocaine is to not interest it.

1288
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,760
 When they're talking about themselves.

1289
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,760
 I can tell you about some rabbits.

1290
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,760
 I caught a lot of big rabbits.

1291
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,760
 A lot of great rabbits.

1292
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,760
 It supposedly temporarily would knock out their smell.

1293
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,760
 Wow.

1294
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,760
 God, that's so clever.

1295
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1296
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,760
 That's amazing.

1297
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,760
 Yeah, so he's a huge hero.

1298
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,760
 He saved 7,200 Jewish refugees.

1299
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,760
 Wow.

1300
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,760
 Can I say something about the great crested mute?

1301
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,760
 Oh, yeah.

1302
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,760
 Right.

1303
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,760
 So they have a very colourful belly.

1304
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,760
 Okay.

1305
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,760
 No one really knows why they've got a colourful belly.

1306
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,760
 If you're a mute and you're colourful, often it's because you want people to know you're toxic.

1307
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,760
 And it turns out they are toxic.

1308
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,760
 They're warts containing chemicals.

1309
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:05,760
 And there was a naturalist called Eleanor Ormerod who tested it by biting a live mute's tail.

1310
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,760
 Just the tail and the tails will grow back and stuff.

1311
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,760
 And then she recorded all of her symptoms.

1312
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,760
 So she was foaming at the mouth.

1313
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,760
 She had shivering fits.

1314
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,760
 And so she proved that they were toxic.

1315
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:23,760
 It's a lot of scientists putting stuff in their mouths.

1316
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,760
 So we found out that they are toxic.

1317
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,760
 But the weird thing is they're nutes.

1318
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,760
 So they walk around a lot with their belly pointing to the ground.

1319
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,760
 And so no predators can see their bellies anyway.

1320
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,760
 And so no one knows still to this day why they have a colourful belly.

1321
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,760
 That is so strange.

1322
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,760
 Are you sure it wouldn't?

1323
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,760
 Moles and stuff come up and eat them.

1324
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,760
 The moles?

1325
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,760
 Yeah.

1326
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,760
 They swim.

1327
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,760
 They swim.

1328
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,760
 They swim.

1329
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,760
 So maybe fish from the predators.

1330
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,760
 But you're right.

1331
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,760
 Normally you'd feel like birds would be descending on them.

1332
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,760
 Eleanor Ormerod anyway.

1333
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,760
 She's really famous.

1334
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,760
 She's an agricultural entomologist.

1335
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,760
 Because she was living in Victorian times.

1336
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,760
 So couldn't really be a professional scientist in those days if you're a woman.

1337
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,760
 But she found a kind of a role where she could use her skills

1338
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,760
 and apply them to agriculture.

1339
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,760
 So you know like if people's crops are dying she could say

1340
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,760
 well you should get rid of these nutes.

1341
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,760
 So you should get rid of these moles or whatever.

1342
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,760
 Stuff like that.

1343
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,760
 And she was so famous that Virginia Woolf wrote a story about her

1344
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,760
 called Miss Ormerod which is named after her.

1345
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,760
 Just a pretty cool person.

1346
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,760
 That's very cool.

1347
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,760
 Things women had to do to be scientists in those days.

1348
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,760
 I know, I know.

1349
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,760
 She's going to bite this mute.

1350
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,760
 We know it's poisonous.

1351
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,760
 But we don't know how poisonous.

1352
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,760
 So Eleanor if you could...

1353
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,760
 I'm going to mention one last thing before we wrap up.

1354
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,760
 I don't know if it's useful but just in case you're wondering

1355
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,760
 we've been talking a lot about dogs sniffing humans.

1356
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,760
 And I discovered that there's a job whereby you as a human can sniff a dog.

1357
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,760
 Are we looking for the dog or is that the idea?

1358
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,760
 No.

1359
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,760
 Is it a chocolate lab?

1360
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,760
 This is for people who work in factories that are making dog food.

1361
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,760
 Because one of the things that owners hate about dog food

1362
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,760
 is the breath that it can leave on their dog.

1363
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,760
 And they make a very concerted effort not to make food

1364
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,760
 where chemicals are altering the smell of the mouth of a dog

1365
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,760
 so that it's very pongy.

1366
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,760
 So one of the jobs that if you work in one of these factories

1367
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,760
 is to go up and sniff dogs mouths

1368
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,760
 who are experimenting with new tastes and new formulas and so on.

1369
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,760
 And then if a dog has ejaculated recently you can...

1370
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,760
 No, not that.

1371
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,760
 I just love how excited the dogs were to get their jobs.

1372
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,760
 I'm a taster at a dog food factory.

1373
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,760
 The other dogs let go.

1374
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,760
 Well that sounds awesome.

1375
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,760
 That sounds cool.

1376
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,760
 So they sniff you?

1377
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,760
 God, that's so...

1378
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,760
 That's not a lovely job, I think.

1379
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,760
 Can I ask another question?

1380
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,760
 You won't know the answer to this, but you might.

1381
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,760
 It's not just important, presumably, that their breath doesn't smell.

1382
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,760
 You don't want their farts to smell bad.

1383
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, really good point.

1384
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,760
 You don't want that on the other side.

1385
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,760
 So do you not have someone whose job is to smell all the dog farts?

1386
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,760
 I do.

1387
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,760
 It feels like you must.

1388
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,760
 You must, right?

1389
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,760
 It's probably...

1390
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,760
 You must.

1391
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,760
 I think he's right.

1392
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,760
 It's probably the unspoken astro.

1393
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,760
 That's what they tell you once you've got the gig.

1394
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,760
 That's by the way.

1395
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,760
 There's a second hatch over there.

1396
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,760
 That's what that one happened.

1397
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:35,760
 Okay, that's it.

1398
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,760
 That is all of our facts.

1399
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,760
 Thank you so much for listening.

1400
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,760

1408
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,760

 Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing, or our website, NoSuchThing, asafish.com.

 All of our previous episodes are up there.

1411
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,760
 And just a quick reminder, Jenny, your latest book is out now.

1412
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,760
 It is.

1413
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,760
 It's called The Summer Skies.

1414
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,760
 The Summer Skies.

1415
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,760
 And of course, all of Jenny's other books are available to buy as well.

1416
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,760
 And so do check them out and also check out her Doctor Who stuff as well.

1417
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,760
 There's numerous Jenny Colgan books that are out there and audio adventures.

1418
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,760
 Jenny M. Colgan is the--

1419
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,760
 Jenny T. Colgan.

1420
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,760
 Jenny T.

1421
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,760
 Is the pseudonym, if you want to look for those.

1422
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,760
 So yeah, also we are playing a live show for Fish on the 14th of September at Kings Place,

1423
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,760
 part of the London Podcast Festival.

1424
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,760
 And we're going to be live streaming it.

1425
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:40,760
 You're able to buy live stream tickets for that by going to NoSuchThingAsafish.com/podfest.

1426
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,760
 Check out tickets there.

1427
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,760
 And of course, check out Club Fish.

1428
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,760
 It's our secret members club where we do all sort of bonus extras, compilations.

1429
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,760
 Drop us a line, which Andy does, which is a show where we go through all the correspondence that you've sent in.

1430
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,760
 It's a really comfy place.

1431
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,760
 My doctor is probably--

1432
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,760
 But that's it.

1433
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,760
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

1434
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,760
 We'll see you then.

1435
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,760
 Goodbye.
