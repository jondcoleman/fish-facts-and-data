00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish where we are joined"
00:00:05,00:00:11,"by our very good friend Jenny Colgan. Now Jenny Colgan is, well she's done a bit of"
00:00:11,00:00:16,"stand up but she is mostly well known for being a writer, a writer of romantic comedy"
00:00:16,00:00:22,fiction and of science fiction. If you are a fan of Doctor Who then you may well know
00:00:22,00:00:27,her. She's written all sorts of spin-offs and audiobooks and stuff for Doctor Who. We might
00:00:27,00:00:31,"get into that in the first fact today, spoiler alert, but what we'd like to let you know"
00:00:31,00:00:36,about most of all is that Jenny has a brand new book. It is called The Summer Skies and
00:00:36,00:00:41,"if it is anything like Jenny's other work it is going to be absolutely fantastic, just"
00:00:41,00:00:47,perfect for a summer holiday and you can get that wherever you buy your books. On top of
00:00:47,00:00:51,that the usual stuff do join club fish if you want a bit of extra fish in your life and
00:00:51,00:00:59,some ad free episodes and if you go to noticethingsafish.com/podfest then you will find that there are one
00:00:59,00:01:05,or two really not many at all tickets left for our show at Kings Place in September. We
00:01:05,00:01:10,are on the verge of booking an amazing guest for that. I promise you you will not want
00:01:10,00:01:15,to miss it. If you can't get down to London then there are streaming tickets available.
00:01:15,00:01:30,Okay really hope you enjoyed this week's show and all that's left to say is on with
00:01:30,00:01:42,"the next episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI"
00:01:42,00:01:48,"offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew"
00:01:48,00:01:52,Hunter Murray and Jenny Colgan and once again we have gathered around the microphones
00:01:52,00:01:57,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here
00:01:57,00:02:05,"we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Jenny. There is, on.to, a Dalek named"
00:02:05,00:02:12,"after a Dickens character. I learned this fact for money, not actually for points really"
00:02:12,00:02:16,because one of my kids teachers is a great Dickens fan and he said to the kids if you
00:02:16,00:02:22,bring me a Dickens fact that I haven't heard before there's something in it for you. So
00:02:22,00:02:27,I can put it out to the world which was kind of fun and actually the most Dickens facts
00:02:27,00:02:32,"that everybody knows, one he's the first person ever to talk about dinosaurs in fiction."
00:02:32,00:02:37,I did not know that. There is a reference to dinosaur on page one of Blake House and
00:02:37,00:02:44,then the other thing that most people know is that Hans Christian Anderson came to Stamerton
00:02:44,00:02:48,on holiday and was the worst guest ever and they both wrote about it in their diaries
00:02:48,00:02:54,with Hans going oh I'm feeling so weary and Dickens going how do we get this guy out.
00:02:54,00:02:59,"So these, obviously the teacher knew these very famous facts but what he did not know"
00:02:59,00:03:04,is a friend of mine who's an actor plays a Dalek on.to and they tend to keep the same
00:03:04,00:03:10,people because obviously it's quite skilled and you tend to be in the same Dalek casing
00:03:10,00:03:14,because they're really small and it's not very pleasant to spend 10 hours in a really
00:03:14,00:03:20,small space. So you have your own Dalek and the Dalek is named after you in the props
00:03:20,00:03:25,covered and my friend is called Barnaby and he's named after Barnaby Rodge and so there
00:03:25,00:03:29,is in the BBC Dalek Barnaby.
00:03:29,00:03:31,Dalek Barnaby that's so good.
00:03:31,00:03:34,Go ahead and dig in there sir I must exterminate you.
00:03:34,00:03:39,Yeah that's amazing. So yeah so for anyone that doesn't know Doctor Who James I'm looking
00:03:39,00:03:40,at you.
00:03:40,00:03:41,Yeah I'm afraid I don't.
00:03:41,00:03:42,You know what the Daleks are though?
00:03:42,00:03:46,Yeah they're like little robots are they?
00:03:46,00:03:47,They're a tall villain.
00:03:47,00:03:48,Oh so are they?
00:03:48,00:03:49,So are they?
00:03:49,00:03:50,Yeah they're tall.
00:03:50,00:03:52,They're not little when we say little they're about.
00:03:52,00:03:54,Yeah but if I had to describe a Dalek the first word I would say wasn't oh they're
00:03:54,00:03:55,quite tall.
00:03:55,00:03:57,The guy over there can you describe him?
00:03:57,00:03:58,Yeah he's tall.
00:03:58,00:04:01,No he's got a same punch coming out of his tall side.
00:04:01,00:04:04,Can you tell me anything about the criminal who came over and tried to exterminate you?
00:04:04,00:04:07,Well yeah first of all he was tall.
00:04:07,00:04:10,I was simply addressing your first point and saying they're small.
00:04:10,00:04:13,I was simply hitting that off as a busted myth straight away.
00:04:13,00:04:16,Okay so there's like Jenny do it she knows Doctor Who.
00:04:16,00:04:23,They're a paper pot they're tall and they have a kind of plunder at the front and they
00:04:23,00:04:29,are in fact they look like they're the monsters but they're not they are kind of strange creatures
00:04:29,00:04:30,inside.
00:04:30,00:04:31,They used to be people.
00:04:31,00:04:33,So they're like a tank for a month.
00:04:33,00:04:34,That is exactly what they're like.
00:04:34,00:04:40,When you say pepper pot I read that when they were designed the person who decided how they
00:04:40,00:04:44,would move used the pepper pot to kind of move around the table and say this is how
00:04:44,00:04:45,they'll move.
00:04:45,00:04:46,Is that true?
00:04:46,00:04:47,I think it is.
00:04:47,00:04:50,It was Ray Cusick who designed the look of the door.
00:04:50,00:04:55,It's a really weird the story of how they were come up with because the creator was Terry
00:04:55,00:05:01,Nation who was involved in working on the very early scripts and he just described them
00:05:01,00:05:04,in the script but he didn't really describe them very much and then Terry Nation was...
00:05:04,00:05:05,He said tall.
00:05:05,00:05:09,He said just some cool aliens.
00:05:09,00:05:13,And then Ray Cusick took the job to design them and he worked with a model maker called
00:05:13,00:05:17,Bill Roberts and they actually they're the ones who built the look as far as I understand
00:05:17,00:05:18,it.
00:05:18,00:05:19,Is that fair?
00:05:19,00:05:20,Yeah.
00:05:20,00:05:21,Yeah.
00:05:21,00:05:22,And Terry Nation though holds the as it were...
00:05:22,00:05:23,But they belong to him.
00:05:23,00:05:24,The copyright.
00:05:24,00:05:25,They belong to him.
00:05:25,00:05:28,Well he became hugely wealthy because he owned the copyright to Daleks and so...
00:05:28,00:05:31,And to the point where when the new series came back all those years ago with Russell
00:05:31,00:05:35,T. Davies the first one with Christopher Eccleston we didn't know if we were going to get the
00:05:35,00:05:39,Daleks back because the Terry Nation estate said well we don't know if this is going to
00:05:39,00:05:43,be... They had to consider that the Daleks would not return with Doctor Who.
00:05:43,00:05:47,And what is the very first thing the Daleks do when they come back?
00:05:47,00:05:48,I know this one.
00:05:48,00:05:50,I actually know this one because that's one of the very little bits of Doctor Who I've
00:05:50,00:05:51,seen.
00:05:51,00:05:52,They go up some stairs.
00:05:52,00:05:53,They fly up the stairs.
00:05:53,00:05:54,Yeah.
00:05:54,00:05:58,It was in such a lovely moment when kind of rose escapes up the stairs and the whole
00:05:58,00:05:59,country's going...
00:05:59,00:06:00,Aha!
00:06:00,00:06:03,The one thing I know about Daleks and then the limited.
00:06:03,00:06:04,Yeah.
00:06:04,00:06:07,I'd love to know if your friend Barnaby if he's been in the same Dalek for all these
00:06:07,00:06:08,years.
00:06:08,00:06:13,Whether or not it's like when you go into a small biplane and you know the person's
00:06:13,00:06:17,"got a picture of their kids up on some dice, you know, is he inside?"
00:06:17,00:06:20,Have they got all these little mementos?
00:06:20,00:06:23,It's a complete Dalek!
00:06:23,00:06:27,This is not the only literary reference that made its way into Doctor Who.
00:06:27,00:06:32,The very first companion of the very first series of Doctor Who was Ian Chesterton.
00:06:32,00:06:36,And Ian Chesterton was named after GK Chesterton because the original scriptwriter for the
00:06:36,00:06:41,show Coburn was a devout Catholic and a massive fan of Chesterton and so gave him that name.
00:06:41,00:06:42,Yeah.
00:06:42,00:06:43,So Chesterton made it in as well.
00:06:43,00:06:47,And Dickens is the first historical figure that turns up in New Who.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Oh really?
00:06:48,00:06:49,Wow.
00:06:49,00:06:50,So he's in the second episode I think.
00:06:50,00:06:51,Of the original series?
00:06:51,00:06:52,Of the new series.
00:06:52,00:06:53,Of the new series.
00:06:53,00:06:54,So which of course isn't new anymore.
00:06:54,00:06:55,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:55,00:06:56,It's like really old.
00:06:56,00:06:57,Right.
00:06:57,00:07:01,"As played, of course, by Simon Cowell who has played Dickens so often I get them very"
00:07:01,00:07:03,muddled up in my head.
00:07:03,00:07:04,Yeah.
00:07:04,00:07:08,So the first companion was named after who?
00:07:08,00:07:09,GK Chesterton.
00:07:09,00:07:10,GK Chesterton.
00:07:10,00:07:11,Yeah.
00:07:11,00:07:14,"So I've got, I thought the first assistant was the Doctor's granddaughter."
00:07:14,00:07:16,Are we confusing companion and assistant?
00:07:16,00:07:17,Oh my God.
00:07:17,00:07:18,I'm sorry.
00:07:18,00:07:19,We're going to get letters.
00:07:19,00:07:20,It's the one who does the inbox.
00:07:20,00:07:25,"I just feel like, I did a Pump Quiz recently and the Quiz Master, she said we had a Doctor"
00:07:25,00:07:28,Who quiz in here last week and I barely got out alive.
00:07:28,00:07:34,"Like, famously the quickest way to end a punch up in a Pump Quiz is to ask how many Doctor"
00:07:34,00:07:35,Who's there been?
00:07:35,00:07:36,Oh.
00:07:36,00:07:41,Luckily your inbox is bigger on the inside than ours.
00:07:41,00:07:46,"Yeah, that might be a technicality because the granddaughter is the granddaughter."
00:07:46,00:07:47,"Right, right, right."
00:07:47,00:07:48,There she comes.
00:07:48,00:07:49,The brief was really interesting for the casting.
00:07:49,00:07:54,"It was, she had to be a with it girl of 15 reaching the end of her secondary school career"
00:07:54,00:07:58,"Eager for life, lower than middle class, avoid dialect, use neutral accent laced with the"
00:07:58,00:07:59,latest teenage slang.
00:07:59,00:08:00,That was the gig.
00:08:00,00:08:01,Hit cat.
00:08:01,00:08:02,"Yeah, exactly."
00:08:02,00:08:08,"And then she was made his granddaughter because it was, was it William Hartnell, the first"
00:08:08,00:08:09,one?
00:08:09,00:08:10,It was.
00:08:10,00:08:11,"And it was to avoid any suggestion of, this is a bit weird, isn't it, this whole bloke"
00:08:11,00:08:13,traveling around with a 15 year old girl.
00:08:13,00:08:14,What's going on?
00:08:14,00:08:16,"You know, they were really careful with that for so long."
00:08:16,00:08:19,"In fact, right up till I started writing for it and I started."
00:08:19,00:08:20,Did you change it?
00:08:20,00:08:24,"But no, when I went to see them, they were really, because I write romantic comedy and"
00:08:24,00:08:28,"they were really quite funny, like, you know, we can't have any kissing or anything like"
00:08:28,00:08:29,that.
00:08:29,00:08:30,"And I was like, fine."
00:08:30,00:08:33,I promise you I'm a David T. I will not do any of that.
00:08:33,00:08:38,Then the show completely changed and actually Matt Smith spends pretty much his whole time
00:08:38,00:08:44,"being naked or getting married to folk by mistake or, you know, they suddenly became a massive"
00:08:44,00:08:50,romantic overtones all the time.
00:08:50,00:08:55,Did he get his heart broken?
00:08:55,00:09:00,I just kind of slip in.
00:09:00,00:09:01,Oh dear.
00:09:01,00:09:05,I did read that there have been Doctor Who top trumps over the years.
00:09:05,00:09:11,This is interesting because I do know about top trumps and Pac six has a lot of bad guys
00:09:11,00:09:13,"in, including Adolf Hitler."
00:09:13,00:09:19,"And if you put Pac six against Pac seven, you can fight Adolf Hitler against Queen Elizabeth"
00:09:19,00:09:20,the first.
00:09:20,00:09:27,So I want you to guess who is the bravest out of Adolf Hitler or Queen Elizabeth the
00:09:27,00:09:31,first according to top trumps.
00:09:31,00:09:32,Elizabeth.
00:09:32,00:09:33,Yeah.
00:09:33,00:09:34,Agreed.
00:09:34,00:09:35,Everyone.
00:09:35,00:09:36,I'll say the minority.
00:09:36,00:09:37,Sorry.
00:09:37,00:09:38,Are you voting for Hitler?
00:09:38,00:09:39,Just checking.
00:09:39,00:09:45,"I just wanted to say out loud that you think Hitler is braver, braver."
00:09:45,00:09:46,Not better.
00:09:46,00:09:47,I'll say Hitler.
00:09:47,00:09:51,"In fact, bravery was his lowest possible thing."
00:09:51,00:09:55,"He was good in lots of the things, but the bravery was the worst."
00:09:55,00:10:00,Who do you think is the strongest out of Hitler or Queen Elizabeth the first?
00:10:00,00:10:03,I got completely ambushed last time.
00:10:03,00:10:10,The first. Stronger. She is the strongest and Hitler wins on brains and terror.
00:10:10,00:10:11,Okay.
00:10:11,00:10:12,Just a thing.
00:10:12,00:10:13,Right.
00:10:13,00:10:14,Victory for Hitler.
00:10:14,00:10:15,"Thank you, Doctor Who."
00:10:15,00:10:18,He does spend his entire episode locked in the cupboard.
00:10:18,00:10:19,Does he?
00:10:19,00:10:23,"So I could have got you to the bravery thing, but the brains one slightly defeats me."
00:10:23,00:10:24,"What was Hitler's episode, Doctor Who?"
00:10:24,00:10:26,It's called Let's Kill Hitler.
00:10:26,00:10:28,"Oh, wow."
00:10:28,00:10:29,Really?
00:10:29,00:10:30,Gosh.
00:10:30,00:10:34,"One of the first people involved in the BBC side of things, there was a guy called Sidney"
00:10:34,00:10:37,Newman who was the head of drama.
00:10:37,00:10:38,He was a really interesting guy.
00:10:38,00:10:42,"So there was a play that was broadcast in his career called Underground, right?"
00:10:42,00:10:46,And it was about a group of nuclear holocaust survivors living in the London Underground.
00:10:46,00:10:51,"I think it was early '60s or late '50s, like it was quite, you know, it sounds very terrifying"
00:10:51,00:10:52,and dramatic.
00:10:52,00:10:58,But it was a live broadcast and one of the actors in it died of a heart attack halfway
00:10:58,00:11:01,through the television screening offstage.
00:11:01,00:11:05,"So he wasn't on camera, but it was in between scenes basically."
00:11:05,00:11:09,"He was in costume and makeup and, you know, he died and the play had to improvise its"
00:11:09,00:11:12,way through and Newman was kind of in charge of it.
00:11:12,00:11:14,"He said, ""Just treat it like a football match."
00:11:14,00:11:15,Just play on.
00:11:15,00:11:16,"Adjust."""
00:11:16,00:11:17,Wow.
00:11:17,00:11:18,Yeah.
00:11:18,00:11:19,"Oh, so it wasn't like there's been a murder."
00:11:19,00:11:21,Like they didn't shift the whole thing to do.
00:11:21,00:11:22,I don't know.
00:11:22,00:11:23,Like really deathful care.
00:11:23,00:11:27,"Can I just say, if someone dies in the middle of a football match, they do stop the game."
00:11:27,00:11:28,That's a very good point.
00:11:28,00:11:30,That's a very good point.
00:11:30,00:11:32,"Well, that's the weird thing."
00:11:32,00:11:34,The character was meant to die of a heart attack later in the play.
00:11:34,00:11:36,"The character, not the actor."
00:11:36,00:11:37,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:37,00:11:39,So I guess they just had to shift it.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Of course not the actor.
00:11:40,00:11:43,What a gig to agree to.
00:11:43,00:11:45,This will require you dying.
00:11:45,00:11:48,"It's going out on BBC One, so you've got to think of your career."
00:11:48,00:11:52,"Peter Capaldi, I think, auditioned for the Doctor Who and got the role, but he got it"
00:11:52,00:11:54,20 years later.
00:11:54,00:11:58,"So he auditioned in 1996 when they were casting for the, they made a film, didn't they then?"
00:11:58,00:11:59,And that was...
00:11:59,00:12:00,Yes.
00:12:00,00:12:01,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:01,00:12:02,And lots of people auditioned.
00:12:02,00:12:03,"Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Rick Mail."
00:12:03,00:12:04,"Oh, wow."
00:12:04,00:12:09,"Rick would have been great, although you need to be kind of kind to be the Doctor."
00:12:09,00:12:14,"And I think he was a very kind man in real life, but on screen he was terrifying at all"
00:12:14,00:12:15,times.
00:12:15,00:12:16,Yeah.
00:12:16,00:12:18,"Others auditioned, Brian Blassid?"
00:12:18,00:12:19,No.
00:12:19,00:12:20,No?
00:12:20,00:12:21,Do you know what?
00:12:21,00:12:23,"There's a certain, I think it's about English tolerance for Brian Blassid and I have not."
00:12:23,00:12:24,"Oh, that's wonderful."
00:12:24,00:12:25,The gene.
00:12:25,00:12:28,"I can't, you know, I get it."
00:12:28,00:12:29,Everybody loves him.
00:12:29,00:12:31,It's one of those English things that I don't get.
00:12:31,00:12:32,Like freaking Tim Henman.
00:12:32,00:12:35,"Do you think Andy would make a good Doctor Who, I think he would."
00:12:35,00:12:36,I think...
00:12:36,00:12:37,Yes?
00:12:37,00:12:39,Let me see your fingers.
00:12:39,00:12:40,Hold it.
00:12:40,00:12:41,Your fingers.
00:12:41,00:12:42,Yeah?
00:12:42,00:12:43,Okay.
00:12:43,00:12:44,"Sorry, what are you looking for there?"
00:12:44,00:12:45,They've all got really long fingers.
00:12:45,00:12:46,Are they?
00:12:46,00:12:47,Oh.
00:12:47,00:12:48,Is that?
00:12:48,00:12:49,A requirement.
00:12:49,00:12:50,A requirement?
00:12:50,00:12:51,Yeah.
00:12:51,00:12:52,Maybe that's why Capaldi got the gig 20 years on.
00:12:52,00:12:53,Yeah.
00:12:53,00:12:54,He was older.
00:12:54,00:12:55,Taller.
00:12:55,00:12:56,Fingers longer fingers.
00:12:56,00:13:00,"Actually, the very nice thing is Shitty Who is the new Doctor Who is also Scottish."
00:13:00,00:13:05,"So we've had the most sensational run of it since we were up in 5th, yeah."
00:13:05,00:13:10,One of the most famous things about Doctor Who is the fact that during the 1950s and
00:13:10,00:13:16,"60s, or even to the 70s, about 60 to 70% of all BBC video that had recordings of shows"
00:13:16,00:13:17,were deleted.
00:13:17,00:13:21,"And so we're missing, it was over 100 episodes of Doctor Who."
00:13:21,00:13:23,It's slowly going a bit slow.
00:13:23,00:13:27,"I think it's under the 100 mark now, purely because there is a dedicated group of fans"
00:13:27,00:13:31,who are out there in the world trying to track down all of these missing episodes.
00:13:31,00:13:32,And it's fascinating.
00:13:32,00:13:37,"Every few years we get a message that comes through from fans online saying, ""A nut's"
00:13:37,00:13:38,"been found."""
00:13:38,00:13:44,"The BBC will say, ""Nine found in Nigeria in the cupboard of a random local TV station."""
00:13:44,00:13:45,And they just find the reels?
00:13:45,00:13:46,Do they?
00:13:46,00:13:48,"Yeah, they find the old, yeah."
00:13:48,00:13:51,Because what they used to do is they used to send out all of these reels to different
00:13:51,00:13:52,countries.
00:13:52,00:13:56,"But explicitly would say, ""Once you've had it for this many months, there's an expiry"
00:13:56,00:13:57,"date on it."""
00:13:57,00:13:58,Yeah.
00:13:58,00:13:59,Burn them up.
00:13:59,00:14:03,"Yeah, I have at home, I have a vinyl record of a Goon show episode called Yeti, which"
00:14:03,00:14:06,"says on it, ""Smash this in three months time, here's the expiry date."""
00:14:06,00:14:07,Yeah.
00:14:07,00:14:08,And someone just hadn't smashed it.
00:14:08,00:14:11,Is that where the Mission Impossible films got this message will self-destruct in five
00:14:11,00:14:12,seconds or whatever?
00:14:12,00:14:13,Could be.
00:14:13,00:14:14,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:14:14,00:14:15,"Yeah, I don't know either."
00:14:15,00:14:16,It might be.
00:14:16,00:14:20,"But yeah, so we still have like 97 episodes that are still missing, but they keep getting"
00:14:20,00:14:21,fanned.
00:14:21,00:14:24,"If you find one, is it worth like a million quid or something?"
00:14:24,00:14:25,That's interesting.
00:14:25,00:14:26,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:14:26,00:14:27,Not really.
00:14:27,00:14:28,No.
00:14:28,00:14:31,"It kind of belongs to the BBC still, and also it's such a kind of proper Indiana Jones"
00:14:31,00:14:32,sleuthathon.
00:14:32,00:14:33,Yeah.
00:14:33,00:14:34,"You know, people have dedicated."
00:14:34,00:14:36,It's for every amount of time to this thing.
00:14:36,00:14:37,Wow.
00:14:37,00:14:40,It would be seen as bad if you put it on eBay straight away and...
00:14:40,00:14:46,"Yes, it would be seen as bad, but also I think the kind of glory and honour of finding it."
00:14:46,00:14:48,"The missing ones, they've kind of animated them."
00:14:48,00:14:50,"Ah, do they have the scripts then?"
00:14:50,00:14:51,They've got scripts.
00:14:51,00:14:52,Right.
00:14:52,00:14:53,"Okay, cool."
00:14:53,00:14:58,"When you think of Doctor Who, largely it's the villains of the old Doctor Who, the Daleks"
00:14:58,00:14:59,and so on.
00:14:59,00:15:00,Slither Man.
00:15:00,00:15:01,Cyber Man.
00:15:01,00:15:02,Thank you.
00:15:02,00:15:03,"Well done, James."
00:15:03,00:15:04,Slither Man.
00:15:04,00:15:05,"But then there's also James, the weeping..."
00:15:05,00:15:06,Angels.
00:15:06,00:15:07,That's right.
00:15:07,00:15:11,"So Stephen Moffitt, who created that for the show, created a monster that was so iconic"
00:15:11,00:15:15,"to the new fans of Doctor Who that when there was a poll done in 2012, it came on top as"
00:15:15,00:15:19,"the best villain of Doctor Who, above the Daleks, which is very rare."
00:15:19,00:15:21,It's the first time I think that's ever happened.
00:15:21,00:15:25,"So the weeping angels, for anyone that doesn't know, it's basically angels that are effectively"
00:15:25,00:15:31,"weird aliens or something and if you turn your gaze away from them or you blink, they"
00:15:31,00:15:34,get closer to you and they get closer to you and get closer to you until they capture
00:15:34,00:15:35,you.
00:15:35,00:15:36,Like Grandmother's footsteps.
00:15:36,00:15:37,"Yeah, exactly."
00:15:37,00:15:38,Yeah.
00:15:38,00:15:39,"What time is it, Mr. Wolf?"
00:15:39,00:15:40,Yeah.
00:15:40,00:15:42,"And if they capture you, they don't kill you, but they send you to another time on Earth"
00:15:42,00:15:45,and you're just stuck there and there's no way of getting back.
00:15:45,00:15:47,So it's basically a death to some extent.
00:15:47,00:15:52,"Also if you're playing top trumps, then they have the same terror as Adolf Hitler."
00:15:52,00:15:53,Wow.
00:15:53,00:15:54,There we go.
00:15:54,00:15:58,I've almost had a problem with the weeping angels as a monster.
00:15:58,00:16:02,"Because I think if we had them now, they'd just be a queue of people closing their eyes"
00:16:02,00:16:05,"in front of them saying, ""Could you send me back to when I could buy a house?"""
00:16:05,00:16:06,I've had about 1981.
00:16:06,00:16:07,Manhattan is fine.
00:16:07,00:16:08,"Yeah, exactly."
00:16:08,00:16:16,But so Stephen Mothwick was actually inspired by an original statue that he saw that looked
00:16:16,00:16:19,so scary and he had this idea of what if that kept encroaching on me.
00:16:19,00:16:23,"So years later, he decided, having told his son about the story, to go back and show him"
00:16:23,00:16:27,the weeping angel that had inspired this and they went there to the exact spot and it was
00:16:27,00:16:28,gone.
00:16:28,00:16:44,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:16:44,00:16:45,Okay.
00:16:45,00:16:50,"My fact this week is when the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, George Bernard Shaw"
00:16:50,00:16:52,wrote the Times in disgust.
00:16:52,00:16:56,He was upset that there was an unnecessary B at the end of the word bomb.
00:16:56,00:17:01,"Thank you, George, for your contribution on this horrific day."
00:17:01,00:17:02,I know.
00:17:02,00:17:07,"It's like Churchill said it was going to save a million lives, Gandhi said it was a potential"
00:17:07,00:17:13,"suicide of mankind, but George Bernard Shaw wrote, ""I can scribble the word bomb barely"
00:17:13,00:17:21,legible 18 times in a minute and bomb without the B 24 times in a minute saving 25% by dropping
00:17:21,00:17:29,"this superfluous B."" And he reckoned that it would save 131,400 seconds per year in"
00:17:29,00:17:31,the entire English speaking world.
00:17:31,00:17:34,How soon after the bomb was dropped did he send this letter?
00:17:34,00:17:36,It was a few weeks after.
00:17:36,00:17:37,"Oh, okay."
00:17:37,00:17:38,So he waited for the initial...
00:17:38,00:17:39,I think that was more the post.
00:17:39,00:17:40,Right.
00:17:40,00:17:41,God!
00:17:41,00:17:44,"I mean, yeah, talk about missing the point."
00:17:44,00:17:45,"Yeah, it was."
00:17:45,00:17:49,"Well, he was one of these people who really wanted to improve the language, so to speak,"
00:17:49,00:17:51,by making spelling simpler.
00:17:51,00:17:52,Thank you.
00:17:52,00:17:53,"Moments, though, mate."
00:17:53,00:17:54,What the hell?
00:17:54,00:17:55,I know.
00:17:55,00:17:58,Has anyone ever written B-O-M for bomb?
00:17:58,00:18:02,Was he trying to call back to something or was he trying to solve the language?
00:18:02,00:18:04,"It feels like it's an Italian-ish word, bomb."
00:18:04,00:18:08,"I think it comes from the Latin bombus, meaning it's not a matipaiic, it's just like a nice"
00:18:08,00:18:09,bomb.
00:18:09,00:18:10,"Yeah, yeah."
00:18:10,00:18:11,And then it sort of works.
00:18:11,00:18:15,"But anyway, I thought we might talk about the Manhattan Project because Jenny, you are"
00:18:15,00:18:16,something of an expert.
00:18:16,00:18:17,Is that fair to say on that?
00:18:17,00:18:22,I would say it's not really fair to say because that is a hostage to fortune.
00:18:22,00:18:26,"However, I did mastermind and I picked it as my specialist subject."
00:18:26,00:18:27,Wow.
00:18:27,00:18:30,And I don't really get nervous very often.
00:18:30,00:18:32,I have never been so nervous.
00:18:32,00:18:36,"And I wasn't nervous about the subject, which I thought I knew."
00:18:36,00:18:41,"And I wasn't nervous about being, I'd already lost Pointless and I'd already lost whatever"
00:18:41,00:18:43,that other chasey one is.
00:18:43,00:18:45,So I wasn't nervous about that.
00:18:45,00:18:46,I was really nervous.
00:18:46,00:18:52,You know how every year there's one person that gets zero points and it goes on YouTube?
00:18:52,00:18:56,"And you know, and I just, that was just right in front of my eyes."
00:18:56,00:18:59,"In particular, I was like, oh, they're looking at me and they go, oh my God, there's a girl"
00:18:59,00:19:01,"on, you know, she thought she'd pick this stupid topic."
00:19:01,00:19:05,"Oh, and the headline would have been 'Cog and Bombs' among a lot of you."
00:19:05,00:19:09,"And I would have written some of the newspapers going, how are you spelling the word 'bomb'?"
00:19:09,00:19:12,"You could have saved this much, hadn't you?"
00:19:12,00:19:13,Who was your host?
00:19:13,00:19:16,It was one of the tall white-haired pointy guys.
00:19:16,00:19:17,Humphreys.
00:19:17,00:19:18,Yes.
00:19:18,00:19:21,"Because everyone who watches Doctor Who has their doctor, don't they, who they grew up"
00:19:21,00:19:22,with.
00:19:22,00:19:26,"For me, it's a Magnus Magnus and it's my master mate."
00:19:26,00:19:28,"Well, you did eat, you know, you did a bit of chit chat."
00:19:28,00:19:29,Yeah.
00:19:29,00:19:30,"And he said, you're right about cakes."
00:19:30,00:19:31,"And I was like, occasionally."
00:19:31,00:19:32,"And he said, why aren't you fat?"
00:19:32,00:19:33,"And I was like, what kind of a question?"
00:19:33,00:19:34,Why are we going for this?
00:19:34,00:19:35,What?
00:19:35,00:19:36,Why are we going for this?
00:19:36,00:19:37,"Well, how?"
00:19:37,00:19:38,"So I think, yeah."
00:19:38,00:19:42,"That's the to-date program training, kicking in, brutalising the guest before you ask the"
00:19:42,00:19:43,question.
00:19:43,00:19:47,"I can't help Andy, but to notice that Jenny's description of tall there to describe the"
00:19:47,00:19:48,host was very useful.
00:19:48,00:19:49,"Actually, actually, no, you're right, Dan."
00:19:49,00:19:50,I don't think it was.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"Sorry, Jenny."
00:19:51,00:19:55,You're one of the rubbish writers describing Humphreys.
00:19:55,00:19:58,He's sitting down.
00:19:58,00:19:59,Great point.
00:19:59,00:20:01,So the Manhattan Project?
00:20:01,00:20:02,Yeah.
00:20:02,00:20:03,Yeah.
00:20:03,00:20:04,Oppenheimer.
00:20:04,00:20:05,And Oppenheimer.
00:20:05,00:20:06,He was an interesting cook.
00:20:06,00:20:07,He wasn't an Oppenheimer.
00:20:07,00:20:08,He was.
00:20:08,00:20:10,He's someone who was a bit of a troubling kid.
00:20:10,00:20:14,He was running into stories where his dad kind of has to bail him out at various different
00:20:14,00:20:17,times to sort of save the career that he's hoping to have.
00:20:17,00:20:19,He at one point was at Cambridge University.
00:20:19,00:20:21,He was studying there.
00:20:21,00:20:25,"And he was furious with one of his teachers, who was called Patrick Blackett."
00:20:25,00:20:28,And Blackett would go on to win a Nobel Prize himself.
00:20:28,00:20:32,And Blackett was forcing him to do things that weren't theoretical physics.
00:20:32,00:20:34,He was taking them away from his interests.
00:20:34,00:20:38,"Not applied physics, fuck it."
00:20:38,00:20:40,"In a bit of fury, in a bit of rage, Oppenheimer."
00:20:40,00:20:41,And this is the story.
00:20:41,00:20:44,"There's lots of different stories, but roughly this is it."
00:20:44,00:20:48,He poisoned an apple and left it on Blackett's desk for him to eat.
00:20:48,00:20:50,Like proper will kill you boys.
00:20:50,00:20:51,Proper poison.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Yeah.
00:20:52,00:20:54,There's a lot of murky sort of territory to the story.
00:20:54,00:20:58,"What we do know is definitely the dad stepped in and said, ""If we promise to send him to"
00:20:58,00:21:02,"a psychiatrist, can we keep him going on and if he keeps his meetings, can he stay?"""
00:21:02,00:21:03,"And they said, ""Yeah, sure."""
00:21:03,00:21:05,And so that's the only reason that he...
00:21:05,00:21:06,"Lean in those days, wasn't it?"
00:21:06,00:21:07,I know.
00:21:07,00:21:11,"And they wouldn't like people who'd go to these posh schools, grow up, so they've got"
00:21:11,00:21:12,the rules done at Leighton.
00:21:12,00:21:13,Yeah.
00:21:13,00:21:14,It is crackers.
00:21:14,00:21:18,Wasn't that the way that Alan Turing killed himself as well with the poisoned apple?
00:21:18,00:21:19,"It was, yeah."
00:21:19,00:21:20,Supposedly that's the story.
00:21:20,00:21:21,Cyanide into the side of an apple.
00:21:21,00:21:23,"A lot of poisoned apples around, yeah."
00:21:23,00:21:25,"No, Oppenheimer was very odd."
00:21:25,00:21:29,"So Oppenheimer is the person who, when they were setting up the Manhattan Project, they"
00:21:29,00:21:33,"came to him and they said, ""We want you to head this up."""
00:21:33,00:21:38,"And the location, Los Alamos itself, was picked by Oppenheimer when he was on horseback going"
00:21:38,00:21:40,"off around and he went, ""This would be perfect."""
00:21:40,00:21:44,But even though he was given all of this high clearance and he was the head of this very
00:21:44,00:21:50,"secret operation, he was under constant surveillance because they also thought that he was a communist"
00:21:50,00:21:51,because he was very pro-communist.
00:21:51,00:21:55,"He was never card-carrying, but he'd said enough stuff that they thought, ""This guy's"
00:21:55,00:21:57,"going to be stealing our secrets and sending them out."""
00:21:57,00:21:58,"Well, the guy that did..."
00:21:58,00:22:03,"There was a guy called Fuchs who was there who ended up, and is possibly, depending on"
00:22:03,00:22:08,"how you look at it, guilty of one of the worst crimes that has ever been done, who did go"
00:22:08,00:22:11,and sell the stuff to the Soviets or he took it to the Soviets.
00:22:11,00:22:13,"How would he compare against Hitler in the top trumps, please?"
00:22:13,00:22:17,"That's an excellent question, James, when you want to get back, isn't it?"
00:22:17,00:22:18,Sorry.
00:22:18,00:22:19,And nobody suspected him.
00:22:19,00:22:23,"Not only that, they all really liked him because he had a car and he used to give them a lift"
00:22:23,00:22:27,"into town all the time because obviously they'd chit-chat and go, ""Yeah, come on, I'll give"
00:22:27,00:22:29,"you a little lift to the airport."""
00:22:29,00:22:31,And he caught all of them.
00:22:31,00:22:32,Not a single one.
00:22:32,00:22:33,Super nice guy.
00:22:33,00:22:38,"Would he say, ""Oh, just throw your briefcase in the back of the car while we drive."""
00:22:38,00:22:39,Exactly.
00:22:39,00:22:41,"And there was someone in the back of the car, like under a blanket, who would then read through"
00:22:41,00:22:42,the stuff.
00:22:42,00:22:43,Can someone go and pick up Enrico Fermi?
00:22:43,00:22:44,I'll do it.
00:22:44,00:22:45,"Oh, my God."
00:22:45,00:22:49,That was another dad rescue moment for Old Openheimer.
00:22:49,00:22:54,He once got in a car crash because he tried to race a train and failed.
00:22:54,00:22:57,What do you mean by racing a train?
00:22:57,00:22:58,Are they going alongside each other?
00:22:58,00:23:01,It feels like he was trying to outrun it and outgun it.
00:23:01,00:23:06,As opposed to sometimes it would be like you're trying to cross the track to the goal.
00:23:06,00:23:07,I think he was just racing.
00:23:07,00:23:09,I think he was just trying to get ahead of it.
00:23:09,00:23:13,And it left his girlfriend unconscious and in order to make up for this and turning into
00:23:13,00:23:17,"a big story, the father had to go over to the family of the young woman's house and"
00:23:17,00:23:22,gave a painting and an original Cezanne drawing as well.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"I do that, by the way, that racing after the train on the M1."
00:23:25,00:23:29,"You know, the last bit of the M1, the train goes alongside the road."
00:23:29,00:23:34,"But my car, it's an electric car, so if I go up of 70 miles an hour I lose all my battery"
00:23:34,00:23:38,so I tend to lose the race quite quickly.
00:23:38,00:23:39,So funny.
00:23:39,00:23:42,I really think that this film should probably be about his dad.
00:23:42,00:23:43,Yeah.
00:23:43,00:23:44,Old Openheimer film.
00:23:44,00:23:46,"Yeah, well it's a comedy if it's about a dad, isn't it?"
00:23:46,00:23:47,"It's like, oh, Robert!"
00:23:47,00:23:50,It's like a Dennis the Menace movie then.
00:23:50,00:23:52,"Yeah, and there's a flat when he was growing up."
00:23:52,00:23:57,There were three Van Gogh paintings and some Picasso's too and clearly some Cezanne's as
00:23:57,00:23:58,well.
00:23:58,00:24:00,"They were very, very wealthy people when he was growing up."
00:24:00,00:24:07,"But his, Dan, you mentioned he was suspected of being a communist or of being suspect."
00:24:07,00:24:13,"He was approached by Soviet intelligence in 1943 and he said, ""No, I'm not going to"
00:24:13,00:24:14,"show you the secrets."""
00:24:14,00:24:18,But it still wrecked his career anyway because he didn't tell anyone.
00:24:18,00:24:23,"So he lost his clearance, his security clearance in 1954."
00:24:23,00:24:25,Feels like his cat's out of the bag then.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"I mean, they've got the bomb."
00:24:27,00:24:32,"But it was overtized to communism, it was in the whole McCarthy witch trial period."
00:24:32,00:24:38,But the U.S. Department of Energy did reverse their decision in 2022.
00:24:38,00:24:41,"Just 55 years after he died, they said, ""You know what?"
00:24:41,00:24:42,"You can have your security clearance back."""
00:24:42,00:24:43,Very helpful.
00:24:43,00:24:46,"I mean, it was a gesture, obviously."
00:24:46,00:24:47,Maybe he's still alive.
00:24:47,00:24:49,You don't know what these atomic bombs are going to do to your...
00:24:49,00:24:50,Yeah.
00:24:50,00:24:54,I would say that there was a movement on to stop people smoking on film because it wasn't
00:24:54,00:24:55,very interesting.
00:24:55,00:24:56,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:56,00:24:57,They just pooped down.
00:24:57,00:25:00,And then I watched Casablanca because I'd never seen it.
00:25:00,00:25:03,And everyone is chugging on fags 100% the time and it's disgusting.
00:25:03,00:25:05,It was so disgusting.
00:25:05,00:25:09,"And Oppenheimer never, ever took a breath that didn't have a cigarette on it."
00:25:09,00:25:12,So I'm feeling quite sorry for the actor because...
00:25:12,00:25:14,Killian Murphy who's playing down the movie.
00:25:14,00:25:15,"Yeah, because he never..."
00:25:15,00:25:16,He was a chain smoker.
00:25:16,00:25:18,He never took a breath without a cigarette.
00:25:18,00:25:19,That's what he says.
00:25:19,00:25:24,Part of the prep of trying to become Oppenheimer was basically cigarettes and cocktails with
00:25:24,00:25:25,the...
00:25:25,00:25:26,"Yeah, cigarettes and martinis."
00:25:26,00:25:27,Yeah.
00:25:27,00:25:28,"No, bro."
00:25:28,00:25:30,I'm going to have to go method.
00:25:30,00:25:31,Oh.
00:25:31,00:25:32,Gosh.
00:25:32,00:25:36,It's really weird because when I think about the atomic bomb and I think most people obviously
00:25:36,00:25:41,where we see it as one of the worst moments in history and there's obviously the arguments
00:25:41,00:25:44,that people make that it may have saved more lives like Churchill and so on.
00:25:44,00:25:47,But to sort of actively celebrate it feels quite an odd thing to me.
00:25:47,00:25:50,"And if you do go to Los Alamos now, that is very much what they do."
00:25:50,00:25:52,"Like it's their tourism trade, isn't it?"
00:25:52,00:25:55,So there's a supermarket there with an atomic bar.
00:25:55,00:25:58,You can get atomic salsa that you can buy and purchase.
00:25:58,00:26:01,There's atomic bumper stickers.
00:26:01,00:26:05,There's a... you can buy clothing for babies where there's a mushroom cloud on it that
00:26:05,00:26:07,"says the words, ""I've been dropping bombs since day one."""
00:26:07,00:26:08,Oh.
00:26:08,00:26:12,"You know, there's all these merch things and it feels a bit out of taste except I guess"
00:26:12,00:26:13,"it's not to them, right?"
00:26:13,00:26:14,"Well, I don't know."
00:26:14,00:26:17,"I mean, I grew up in a world where we went to a big room on Sunday and there was a guy"
00:26:17,00:26:19,with nails in his hand.
00:26:19,00:26:20,That's true.
00:26:20,00:26:21,I went to Hiroshima.
00:26:21,00:26:22,Yeah.
00:26:22,00:26:26,"I've said this before, but if you go to Hiroshima, you can go where the bomb was dropped to the"
00:26:26,00:26:27,exact spot.
00:26:27,00:26:28,Wow.
00:26:28,00:26:33,And there's a sign on the wall and it says the first nuclear bomb was detonated something
00:26:33,00:26:36,like 100 feet above this point.
00:26:36,00:26:40,And then you sort of look upwards and you can imagine the exact spot where the bomb would
00:26:40,00:26:43,have gone off and then detonated and killed all those people.
00:26:43,00:26:44,Wow.
00:26:44,00:26:45,It's really amazing.
00:26:45,00:26:48,Do you know about Trinitite?
00:26:48,00:26:49,Trinitite?
00:26:49,00:26:51,I think it's Trinitite because it was the Trinity test.
00:26:51,00:26:52,"Oh, okay."
00:26:52,00:26:56,So it's not got three nitrogen atoms.
00:26:56,00:26:57,That's why it's called Trinitite.
00:26:57,00:26:58,"No, sorry."
00:26:58,00:26:59,"No, I just said it wrong."
00:26:59,00:27:00,Yeah.
00:27:00,00:27:01,"Trinitite, I'm sure."
00:27:01,00:27:02,And it was...
00:27:02,00:27:03,Is it a type of stone?
00:27:03,00:27:10,It's a type of glass made when the sand turned to glass when they tested the first bomb.
00:27:10,00:27:15,"And it's called, it's also called atom sight, it's light green glass."
00:27:15,00:27:16,And it was just left there.
00:27:16,00:27:18,Is it radioactive?
00:27:18,00:27:22,"I think it is not very anymore, but it's still a little radioactive."
00:27:22,00:27:28,"So most of it was bulldozed by the US Atomic Energy Commission and buried, you know, but"
00:27:28,00:27:32,"some of it's still there because ants will bring it to the surface, these tiny beads"
00:27:32,00:27:35,of glass because some of it's under the soil and they're digging their tunnels and so it
00:27:35,00:27:37,just gets pushed up.
00:27:37,00:27:41,It's crazy and it's illegal to take it away now.
00:27:41,00:27:46,"But for a while it was just thought, oh, it's just sand, it's just sand turned to glass."
00:27:46,00:27:50,And so there was a period in 1945 and 46 where it was marketed in jewellery.
00:27:50,00:27:54,You could get Trinitite jewellery.
00:27:54,00:27:58,There was a designer who made some earrings and a hairpin from it and there was an actress
00:27:58,00:27:59,called Merle Oberon.
00:27:59,00:28:02,She wore some of it to a fundraiser.
00:28:02,00:28:03,Supposedly this is quite dark.
00:28:03,00:28:06,To discredit Japanese claims about radiation injury.
00:28:06,00:28:07,What?
00:28:07,00:28:12,"So, you know, well, I mean, an actress is wearing some of the sand fused glass, so it can't"
00:28:12,00:28:13,be that dangerous.
00:28:13,00:28:14,But obviously...
00:28:14,00:28:15,That's terrible.
00:28:15,00:28:18,"Supposedly, I don't..."
00:28:18,00:28:20,"Just because you've mentioned this, I haven't gotten this written down, but using one of"
00:28:20,00:28:25,these bombs is one of the methods that they've been thinking about it to try and get deeper
00:28:25,00:28:26,and deeper.
00:28:26,00:28:27,Boring into the ground.
00:28:27,00:28:31,It can get something like 18 miles really quickly just through an explosion.
00:28:31,00:28:32,But because of the...
00:28:32,00:28:33,What?
00:28:33,00:28:36,"I don't know, as I say, I sort of like..."
00:28:36,00:28:40,"For instance, the Soviets were going to use nuclear bombs to open up waterways in the"
00:28:40,00:28:42,"north of Russia, for instance."
00:28:42,00:28:44,"So that has been thought of in the past, used nuclear for..."
00:28:44,00:28:49,"Oh, no one tell one of those stupid billionaires, they're just going to do it."
00:28:49,00:28:53,"And what would happen, though, is that the surrounding casing of the hole would have"
00:28:53,00:28:55,fused into this glass like substance as well.
00:28:55,00:29:00,"So it would be like a really amazing slide, like almost immediately."
00:29:00,00:29:03,"You've been spending too much time in soft places, has there?"
00:29:03,00:29:07,Not coming to your soft places.
00:29:07,00:29:19,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:29:19,00:29:23,My fact this week is that the actor John Candy was born on Halloween.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Pretty.
00:29:24,00:29:28,"Okay, it's time for fact number four, and his name's Candy."
00:29:28,00:29:29,His name's Candy.
00:29:29,00:29:30,And what do you get on Halloween?
00:29:30,00:29:31,There you go.
00:29:31,00:29:37,Was he called John Skeleton Candy?
00:29:37,00:29:38,Terrifying.
00:29:38,00:29:39,I wish.
00:29:39,00:29:42,"Yeah, so John Candy, most of you should know him."
00:29:42,00:29:43,The Candyman.
00:29:43,00:29:44,"Well, no."
00:29:44,00:29:45,John Candyman.
00:29:45,00:29:46,"The man, John Candy."
00:29:46,00:29:47,He was in Cool Runnings.
00:29:47,00:29:48,He was in Cool Runnings.
00:29:48,00:29:49,He was in Plain Trains and Automobiles.
00:29:49,00:29:50,He was in Uncle Buck.
00:29:50,00:29:57,He's one of the greatest comedy actors that Canada has ever produced.
00:29:57,00:30:01,"And I found this, by the way, in a really great book I'm reading at the moment called Wild"
00:30:01,00:30:06,"and Crazy Guys, which is all about that period of when SNL and America exploded, so he had"
00:30:06,00:30:10,Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy and John Belushi and Chevy
00:30:10,00:30:11,Chase and so on.
00:30:11,00:30:15,"And John Candy, obviously a big player in that area."
00:30:15,00:30:18,"And yeah, so it's just a little detail in that book, and I thought I'd love to talk"
00:30:18,00:30:19,about John Candy.
00:30:19,00:30:20,Great.
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Well, we're not going to."
00:30:21,00:30:23,"Yep, let's move on to the types of Candy."
00:30:23,00:30:25,"Also born on Halloween, John Keats."
00:30:25,00:30:26,Yes.
00:30:26,00:30:32,"So who in that episode, I think I might have mentioned, was possibly a grave robber, John"
00:30:32,00:30:37,"Keats, because he was a medical student, and at that time they needed bodies to do their"
00:30:37,00:30:42,"experiments on, and possibly he could have been one of the body stealers."
00:30:42,00:30:44,Add Rock of the Beastie Boys.
00:30:44,00:30:45,"Oh, yay."
00:30:45,00:30:46,Beastie Boys.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Nice.
00:30:47,00:30:48,Yeah.
00:30:48,00:30:49,Yeah.
00:30:49,00:30:56,"Sydney Park, who's an actor from The Walking Dead, born on Halloween, and Kirk Noble Blutsworth,"
00:30:56,00:31:02,"who was the first American census to death to be exonerated post-conviction, so was supposed"
00:31:02,00:31:07,to be executed and then turned out DNA testing meant that he hadn't done it.
00:31:07,00:31:08,So he got off.
00:31:08,00:31:09,"And the Halloween link is that he's got blood, doesn't he?"
00:31:09,00:31:10,Death.
00:31:10,00:31:11,"Oh yeah, blood."
00:31:11,00:31:12,Yeah.
00:31:12,00:31:13,Get off.
00:31:13,00:31:14,"Come on, that was really stretching."
00:31:14,00:31:15,Yeah.
00:31:15,00:31:16,"Yeah, I felt the stretch."
00:31:16,00:31:17,That's an afternoon twerk.
00:31:17,00:31:18,Yeah.
00:31:18,00:31:24,"But it's unusual, because fewer people are born on Halloween than on other days around"
00:31:24,00:31:25,the year.
00:31:25,00:31:27,"Hang on, or push through, or find a way."
00:31:27,00:31:30,"It's just really miserable in February, it seemed the obvious."
00:31:30,00:31:31,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:31:31,00:31:33,It's January and I'm really miserable.
00:31:33,00:31:35,Do I not have sex that way?
00:31:35,00:31:36,"Oh, so good news."
00:31:36,00:31:40,"I was like, Jenny doesn't know when Halloween is."
00:31:40,00:31:44,"Well, actually, in February, that is one of the most common days."
00:31:44,00:31:49,"Valentine's Day is a very common day for births, which is when my daughter was born actually"
00:31:49,00:31:55,"on Valentine's Day, but there's a 3.6% increase on births in Valentine's Day."
00:31:55,00:32:00,And a 5.3% decrease of spontaneous births on Halloween.
00:32:00,00:32:04,"Is that like the Christmas thing, where it's just that hospitals are a bit quieter and"
00:32:04,00:32:05,therefore...
00:32:05,00:32:06,"I think it's a bit of that, perhaps."
00:32:06,00:32:09,The other thing is that Caesareans is a big difference.
00:32:09,00:32:10,"Right, yes."
00:32:10,00:32:11,"You wouldn't not book a Caesarean for Halloween, would you?"
00:32:11,00:32:12,"Well, you might not."
00:32:12,00:32:16,"If you were given three dates to choose, you might decide not to go for Halloween."
00:32:16,00:32:17,Really?
00:32:17,00:32:18,Is that...
00:32:18,00:32:19,"They'd have the emergency ones, obviously, but of course, yeah."
00:32:19,00:32:22,"Oh, so don't forget that in some places, not necessarily here, but in some places,"
00:32:22,00:32:23,that's quite a big drinking night.
00:32:23,00:32:32,"So, you may not possibly want a bunch of student meds, so yeah, that's a thing."
00:32:32,00:32:33,Wow.
00:32:33,00:32:34,That's very cool.
00:32:34,00:32:35,I love it.
00:32:35,00:32:36,Yeah.
00:32:36,00:32:37,Can we talk about candy?
00:32:37,00:32:38,"Yeah, okay."
00:32:38,00:32:39,Yeah.
00:32:39,00:32:40,"Now, Dan, you've got a lot of stuff on junk."
00:32:40,00:32:41,"No, I just want to quickly just say, because he died very young."
00:32:41,00:32:46,"He was 43 when he died of a heart attack, and he was, you know, he was in Home Alone."
00:32:46,00:32:47,He was in...
00:32:47,00:32:51,There's so many seminal movies of the '90s that he was in.
00:32:51,00:32:55,"He was known as Sweet Tooth when he was a kid, so he did love candy as well as he was"
00:32:55,00:32:56,growing up.
00:32:56,00:32:57,All kids loved candy.
00:32:57,00:33:00,"All kids loved candy, but he was called John Candy, and he was called Sweet Tooth."
00:33:00,00:33:02,Are they all called Candy or Sweet Tooth?
00:33:02,00:33:03,No.
00:33:03,00:33:05,He wanted to be a sports star.
00:33:05,00:33:09,"That was his big thing, and so he had an injury, which meant that he couldn't do that."
00:33:09,00:33:10,"He played American football, right?"
00:33:10,00:33:14,"Yeah, he played American football, so he had the physique, which was trained to be someone"
00:33:14,00:33:16,who was going to play that game.
00:33:16,00:33:20,"So, all the cast members of Saturday Night Live and all the other things he did always"
00:33:20,00:33:25,"used to say that if you saw John Candy and you approached him, people like Dan Aykroyd"
00:33:25,00:33:29,"say this, he would lift you up with one hand vertically and spin you around like a pizza"
00:33:29,00:33:30,with being prepared.
00:33:30,00:33:31,What?
00:33:31,00:33:32,Yeah.
00:33:32,00:33:33,He used to...
00:33:33,00:33:35,"Every once said that if you saw John Candy, he would lift you up with one hand, hold you"
00:33:35,00:33:36,"above his head, and spin you around."
00:33:36,00:33:39,"First of all, American footballers don't do that."
00:33:39,00:33:40,No.
00:33:40,00:33:41,True.
00:33:41,00:33:45,"But the point is, is that he had a physique whereby lots of other people say that one"
00:33:45,00:33:50,"of their favorite things to do was to act like an NFL ball, and if John Candy came into"
00:33:50,00:33:51,the room...
00:33:51,00:33:52,He'd throw it at him.
00:33:52,00:33:53,300 yards.
00:33:53,00:33:57,"No, they would run at him, jump at him, tuck, and he would catch them as if they were an"
00:33:57,00:33:58,NFL ball.
00:33:58,00:33:59,Come on.
00:33:59,00:34:00,And these are grown adults.
00:34:00,00:34:01,"You know, Aykroyd's six foot three."
00:34:01,00:34:04,"He was an offensive lineman in American football, I read."
00:34:04,00:34:05,Right.
00:34:05,00:34:06,"So, that means that he's basically a blocker."
00:34:06,00:34:09,"You give the ball to your quarterback who's trying to do something, and he's trying to"
00:34:09,00:34:11,stop everyone from coming towards him.
00:34:11,00:34:12,"So, he must have been big."
00:34:12,00:34:13,He was.
00:34:13,00:34:14,He was a...
00:34:14,00:34:15,"Yeah, he was tall."
00:34:15,00:34:16,"I mean, he was six foot three himself."
00:34:16,00:34:21,"He was a big guy, but he was also just, he was physically ready to catch humans."
00:34:21,00:34:22,Yeah.
00:34:22,00:34:23,I just don't think any of that stuff happened.
00:34:23,00:34:24,He did?
00:34:24,00:34:25,He did?
00:34:25,00:34:26,Multiple people said it.
00:34:26,00:34:27,"Like, it's not like..."
00:34:27,00:34:28,It's a...
00:34:28,00:34:29,"Yeah, like a fan saying it."
00:34:29,00:34:30,I do actually...
00:34:30,00:34:32,"To be fair, I was looking a little bit at John Candy."
00:34:32,00:34:37,"I did read that if, like, if you ran at him, he would put you on a big wooden pallet and"
00:34:37,00:34:39,he'd slide you into an oven.
00:34:39,00:34:40,Horrible.
00:34:40,00:34:41,It's just...
00:34:41,00:34:43,"Like, I think they're exaggerating the story."
00:34:43,00:34:47,"They're just, these are the stories, these are the stories they say."
00:34:47,00:34:49,Maybe it was Gingerbread.
00:34:49,00:34:52,Should we talk about Candy?
00:34:52,00:34:54,"Yeah, yeah, John Candy."
00:34:54,00:34:55,Oh my God.
00:34:55,00:34:56,"No, no, no, no."
00:34:56,00:34:59,"Well, I'll just say one really sweet thing is that when he died, again, he was very young."
00:34:59,00:35:03,He had a heart attack while he was making a movie in New Mexico.
00:35:03,00:35:05,Did he die from the atomic bomb?
00:35:05,00:35:10,"Oh, was he in that movie that Andy was talking about where people had a heart attack?"
00:35:10,00:35:11,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:35:11,00:35:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:35:12,00:35:13,Wow.
00:35:13,00:35:14,He had a heart attack on everyone.
00:35:14,00:35:19,But he had a funeral at Sunset Boulevard and then they went down to the cemetery and
00:35:19,00:35:22,they took the 405 three-way and it was completely clear.
00:35:22,00:35:26,They had no idea why it was completely clear and what it turned out was is that the highway
00:35:26,00:35:32,patrol had stopped all road access to anything but this and it was their choice to do that
00:35:32,00:35:36,"and it was them tipping their hat to say, ""We loved you and we miss you,"" and it's because"
00:35:36,00:35:40,"in ten of his movies, and, you know, he didn't live that long so it's a short time he made"
00:35:40,00:35:41,these movies.
00:35:41,00:35:44,He played a law enforcement officer in ten of these movies and so they felt like there
00:35:44,00:35:48,"was a friend that they'd lost, you know, one of them, yeah."
00:35:48,00:35:49,"Anyway, RIP John Candy."
00:35:49,00:35:53,"I know I'm a bit late in saying it but, yeah, condolences to the family."
00:35:53,00:35:57,"All right, do your candy now, your actual candy."
00:35:57,00:35:59,"Andy, give us some candy."
00:35:59,00:36:03,"I was just thinking, Jenny, you're from a great confectionary nation, Scotland."
00:36:03,00:36:04,"I am, yes."
00:36:04,00:36:05,We have some tunics on the table.
00:36:05,00:36:06,We have some tunics in front.
00:36:06,00:36:07,It's very exciting.
00:36:07,00:36:10,"Very good at not diving in, I feel that."
00:36:10,00:36:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:36:11,00:36:12,I'm opening one now.
00:36:12,00:36:13,"Okay, correct."
00:36:13,00:36:14,"I might do it as well, yeah."
00:36:14,00:36:16,"Okay, when everyone's finished, okay, so get this."
00:36:16,00:36:19,This is a sort of scientific thing about sugar.
00:36:19,00:36:23,People who are from Northern Europe are some of the most sugar sensitive people in the
00:36:23,00:36:28,"world and there might be a proper, an evolutionary reason for this."
00:36:28,00:36:29,What do you mean by sensitive?
00:36:29,00:36:32,Do you mean as in it's bad for us or we react to it?
00:36:32,00:36:35,"No, as in it can detect it, can detect it more easily."
00:36:35,00:36:36,So this is really interesting.
00:36:36,00:36:42,There are particular variations in a sugar-sensing gene and people from Northern latitudes have
00:36:42,00:36:47,"that more than people who live in tropical areas and the theory is, one theory is, that"
00:36:47,00:36:52,"it's not certain, obviously, but in higher latitudes, really sweet fruit and veg are"
00:36:52,00:36:55,a bit less common and they're necessary to survive.
00:36:55,00:36:58,It's not like in tropical regions where you have really sugary sweet things and it's easy
00:36:58,00:37:00,to find them and survive.
00:37:00,00:37:05,"So maybe if you move north, you will benefit from having that sensitivity."
00:37:05,00:37:10,"If carrots and parsnips are quite sweet, but if you can't detect that, then you might"
00:37:10,00:37:14,not realise and you might not grow those foods or you might not seek them out and you'll
00:37:14,00:37:15,be less likely to survive.
00:37:15,00:37:18,"So Jenny, you're from further north and the rest of us are on this table, do you feel"
00:37:18,00:37:19,that that's true?
00:37:19,00:37:27,"I'm very wary of things that feel true, but that does actually kind of feel true and"
00:37:27,00:37:31,"whilst it's kind of touching in a way, it's also horrendous that the number one operation"
00:37:31,00:37:34,performed in children in Scotland is tooth extraction.
00:37:34,00:37:35,Wow.
00:37:35,00:37:36,There is it.
00:37:36,00:37:41,"I read that you know how dogs are good at detecting things, we might come on to that"
00:37:41,00:37:42,later.
00:37:42,00:37:43,Oh yeah.
00:37:43,00:37:47,But everyone thinks that dogs have got amazing smell compared to humans.
00:37:47,00:37:51,"We say do, but it's for certain chemicals and for certain chemicals, humans are better"
00:37:51,00:37:56,"and I think, for instance, if you were to put a bar of chocolate in the middle of a field"
00:37:56,00:38:00,"and train the human to look for it and train the dog to look for it, the human might come"
00:38:00,00:38:01,out on top.
00:38:01,00:38:02,Wow.
00:38:02,00:38:05,"So you're looking for sugar and looking for fats and stuff like that, yeah."
00:38:05,00:38:06,That's so cool.
00:38:06,00:38:07,I don't know if that's true.
00:38:07,00:38:09,We might come on to that later.
00:38:09,00:38:14,"Do you know, I was looking for what's the most popular candy, I hate that word."
00:38:14,00:38:15,Do you say sweets?
00:38:15,00:38:16,Sweets.
00:38:16,00:38:20,So my husband says lollies because he's from New Zealand and my children say bombo because
00:38:20,00:38:21,they're from France.
00:38:21,00:38:22,Right.
00:38:22,00:38:27,"Sorry, can I just stop and just, I think the way that you're eating this tonic's too"
00:38:27,00:38:28,big to me.
00:38:28,00:38:29,Yeah.
00:38:29,00:38:30,You do it upside down too.
00:38:30,00:38:31,"No, that's how I have it."
00:38:31,00:38:34,It's basically what my only fan says.
00:38:34,00:38:39,"So Jenny has taken, if you know what a teacake is, it's marshmallow with a bit of biscuit"
00:38:39,00:38:41,on the bottom or cake covered in chocolate.
00:38:41,00:38:47,Jenny has sort of separated the cake and the marshmallow and it's starting to-
00:38:47,00:38:48,I'm now terribly self-conscious.
00:38:48,00:38:54,You're like turning it into a naked burger where you just take the buns off and leave
00:38:54,00:38:55,them on the side.
00:38:55,00:38:58,"Well, you know, just shoving it all in my go up doesn't work very well."
00:38:58,00:38:59,"Jenny, I'll do the same thing."
00:38:59,00:39:00,There we go.
00:39:00,00:39:01,Do you?
00:39:01,00:39:02,You've just been into it.
00:39:02,00:39:03,"No, I haven't."
00:39:03,00:39:04,I've done it carefully.
00:39:04,00:39:05,I know what I'm doing.
00:39:05,00:39:06,I debase it.
00:39:06,00:39:09,"And by the way, I have this family here from Scotland as well."
00:39:09,00:39:10,Exactly.
00:39:10,00:39:11,"You know, the old skills."
00:39:11,00:39:12,They kick in.
00:39:12,00:39:13,Genetic.
00:39:13,00:39:15,"I'm just speaking about tea stuff, Jenny."
00:39:15,00:39:16,This is an interesting thing.
00:39:16,00:39:19,Candy Floss was popularised by a dentist.
00:39:19,00:39:20,Interesting.
00:39:20,00:39:27,"Actually, do you know when you were talking about John Candy, you know, nominal to determinism"
00:39:27,00:39:31,how tedious it is because it makes us all look like really boring humans.
00:39:31,00:39:34,Literally made us our fortune on this podcast.
00:39:34,00:39:35,We get a lot of correspondence about it.
00:39:35,00:39:36,So please be careful.
00:39:36,00:39:38,Like the inbox will just be recovering from the Doctor Who onslaught.
00:39:38,00:39:42,"Well, I was only going to say, and I think, I hope this is not too controversial because"
00:39:42,00:39:50,"it is true, that dentists, first names are vastly over-represented by for women, Denise,"
00:39:50,00:39:51,"and for men, Dennis."
00:39:51,00:39:52,That's so good.
00:39:52,00:39:53,That's so nice.
00:39:53,00:39:58,"It's just such a kind of, you're a big meat sack, takes the easiest route out of it that"
00:39:58,00:40:01,"you can possibly think of, human."
00:40:01,00:40:03,It was called Fairy Floss at the time.
00:40:03,00:40:04,Yeah.
00:40:04,00:40:08,I just wanted to say it was William J. Morrison teamed up with a Nashville confectioner in
00:40:08,00:40:09,1897.
00:40:09,00:40:14,"And despite being president of the Tennessee State Dental Association, no small thing."
00:40:14,00:40:16,Was he trying to drill up more business?
00:40:16,00:40:17,Drill up.
00:40:17,00:40:18,"Very good, James."
00:40:18,00:40:19,Nice.
00:40:19,00:40:20,That's crazy.
00:40:20,00:40:23,I've got to be the one to acknowledge how good it was.
00:40:23,00:40:26,Who's ever really drilled up in that sense?
00:40:26,00:40:27,Nobody.
00:40:27,00:40:28,"Oh, God."
00:40:28,00:40:31,I don't know what came up and be that.
00:40:31,00:40:32,Yeah.
00:40:32,00:40:34,You didn't even give us time not to laugh.
00:40:34,00:40:35,"Drill up, dude."
00:40:35,00:40:40,Do you know what Candy Floss is in Greek?
00:40:40,00:40:42,"Oh, no I don't, actually."
00:40:42,00:40:44,"Well, it translates as old woman's hair."
00:40:44,00:40:45,Oh.
00:40:45,00:40:46,Because it's wispy.
00:40:46,00:40:47,Yes.
00:40:47,00:40:51,"And in Afrikaans, I love this, it's ghost breath."
00:40:51,00:40:52,Lovely.
00:40:52,00:40:53,Yeah.
00:40:53,00:40:57,"Do you know what the Mexican term for eye candy is, if you say a little bit about a candy?"
00:40:57,00:40:58,No.
00:40:58,00:40:59,Eye taco.
00:40:59,00:41:00,Stop it.
00:41:00,00:41:01,It is.
00:41:01,00:41:02,It's eye taco.
00:41:02,00:41:07,"That sounds like a new Apple product, isn't it?"
00:41:07,00:41:12,"The revolutionary eye taco after just six hours of charging, you could enjoy the taco"
00:41:12,00:41:14,for ten minutes.
00:41:14,00:41:20,"I was reading about my favorite confectionery, which is popping candy, which I genuinely"
00:41:20,00:41:25,"think is completely underused in the world, and I think you should really pretty much"
00:41:25,00:41:26,put it on everything.
00:41:26,00:41:32,And it was invented by a guy who was trying to make an instant soft drink.
00:41:32,00:41:33,This is amazing.
00:41:33,00:41:36,"So he's trying to make something like, let's say Coca-Cola."
00:41:36,00:41:39,"And what his idea was, he wanted something like cordial."
00:41:39,00:41:42,"You would have something and you would pour the water on it, and then when the water comes"
00:41:42,00:41:46,"in, it turns automatically into a fizzy drink."
00:41:46,00:41:51,"And so he got some sugar and he heated it up really, really high, put it under a load"
00:41:51,00:41:55,"of pressure, added a load of gas into it, and then cooled it down."
00:41:55,00:41:56,"And in theory, what a great idea."
00:41:56,00:42:00,"As soon as you put the water in, the gas will get released and it will be really fizzy."
00:42:00,00:42:01,It didn't work.
00:42:01,00:42:02,That's so cool though.
00:42:02,00:42:07,But he started eating it and it gave him these sort of explosions in his mouth.
00:42:07,00:42:15,"So his experiments went wrong and he went, I'll just stick it in my mouth."
00:42:15,00:42:16,Good science.
00:42:16,00:42:17,That's so cool.
00:42:17,00:42:21,"And then everyone, all of the other people in his office saw this was happening."
00:42:21,00:42:25,They used to have competitions see how much they could put in the mouth of this stuff.
00:42:25,00:42:29,They would get bigger and bigger rocks of it and see how much they could do.
00:42:29,00:42:34,"But immediately, as soon as they went on sale, pop rocks, they called in America, there was"
00:42:34,00:42:37,rumours that children's stomachs were exploding.
00:42:37,00:42:42,"The first fatality was, yeah, it was all over the place."
00:42:42,00:42:48,And the pop rocks company had to take out full page advertisements in more than 40 publications
00:42:48,00:42:53,"around the country to say, these will not make your child explode, honestly."
00:42:53,00:42:58,"And the head of the company wrote 50,000 letters to school principals saying, can you"
00:42:58,00:43:00,please stop banning these things?
00:43:00,00:43:01,Marketing genius.
00:43:01,00:43:02,Yeah.
00:43:02,00:43:03,That's amazing.
00:43:03,00:43:06,You almost certainly won't kill your kids.
00:43:06,00:43:07,Bring it.
00:43:07,00:43:08,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:08,00:43:11,Does anybody want to hear my worst Japanese Kit Kat flavor?
00:43:11,00:43:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:43:12,00:43:13,"You know, there's now over 300."
00:43:13,00:43:14,Yeah.
00:43:14,00:43:15,"Okay, wow."
00:43:15,00:43:20,"And I was looking down the list and there's some pretty bad ones in there, I think, European"
00:43:20,00:43:21,cheese.
00:43:21,00:43:22,Oh.
00:43:22,00:43:23,Wow.
00:43:23,00:43:24,What is European cheese?
00:43:24,00:43:25,There's no such thing as European cheese.
00:43:25,00:43:28,I believe the Dutch would like a word with you.
00:43:28,00:43:33,"Sorry, there are European cheeses, but there is not one archetypal European cheese."
00:43:33,00:43:34,There are hundreds.
00:43:34,00:43:40,"But I guess in Japan, you might lump a sort of yellow pungent cheese as a European cheese,"
00:43:40,00:43:41,right?
00:43:41,00:43:42,"Yeah, because American cheese."
00:43:42,00:43:43,"Like, dairy's not that big in Japan, right?"
00:43:43,00:43:44,Yeah.
00:43:44,00:43:45,Or China.
00:43:45,00:43:47,"Well, American cheese comes in single shrink-wrapped slice form."
00:43:47,00:43:49,"Yes, but it's different types of cheese."
00:43:49,00:43:54,"But that's, but what, no, no, sorry, no, no, no, I'm not having it."
00:43:54,00:43:55,Here's the thing.
00:43:55,00:43:59,"This is something interesting, I think, and I might butcher this, but I'll try my best."
00:43:59,00:44:05,"So when cheese first came to Japan, because it wasn't traditionally eaten over there,"
00:44:05,00:44:11,"they called it something like dairy tofu, something like that."
00:44:11,00:44:16,"And when tofu first came to France, they called it soya cheese."
00:44:16,00:44:17,Brilliant.
00:44:17,00:44:18,I think that's right.
00:44:18,00:44:19,That's really good.
00:44:19,00:44:21,That's distracted me from my anger about the European cheese.
00:44:21,00:44:22,Thank you.
00:44:22,00:44:24,"I was going to say, James always manages to find a fact to calm you down."
00:44:24,00:44:25,It's really dramatic.
00:44:25,00:44:26,Yeah.
00:44:26,00:44:27,Get two on top of it.
00:44:27,00:44:28,Yeah.
00:44:28,00:44:33,Have you guys ever had an aniseed ball?
00:44:33,00:44:34,Yeah.
00:44:34,00:44:35,No.
00:44:35,00:44:36,What's that?
00:44:36,00:44:37,What's that tiny bit in the middle?
00:44:37,00:44:38,Right.
00:44:38,00:44:39,Is that what you're going to tell us?
00:44:39,00:44:40,No.
00:44:40,00:44:41,That's an aniseed seed.
00:44:41,00:44:42,I think it is.
00:44:42,00:44:43,"Yeah, yeah."
00:44:43,00:44:44,Can you describe it to me?
00:44:44,00:44:45,I don't know.
00:44:45,00:44:48,"So it's a small, round, purple ball, very, very hard, and it's layer after layer of slightly"
00:44:48,00:44:49,flavored licorice.
00:44:49,00:44:50,It's horrible.
00:44:50,00:44:51,Boiled.
00:44:51,00:44:53,"Yeah, they're very unpopular with lots."
00:44:53,00:44:54,They're quite 1930s.
00:44:54,00:44:55,Not gobstoppers.
00:44:55,00:44:58,"No, it's like a very small gobstopper."
00:44:58,00:45:00,"But it's quite strong tasting and aniseed, right?"
00:45:00,00:45:01,"So, okay."
00:45:01,00:45:02,This is very cool.
00:45:02,00:45:05,"They slightly helped to win the Second World War, aniseed balls."
00:45:05,00:45:06,Brilliant.
00:45:06,00:45:12,"In 1939, the War Office, they wanted to build a limpid mind that you could stick to the"
00:45:12,00:45:16,"hull of the ship, swim away from, and it detonates later, right?"
00:45:16,00:45:20,"And the War Office, they contacted a science magazine editor called Stuart McCrae, and"
00:45:20,00:45:24,"he contacted someone he knew, an inventor called Cecil Clark, who was also a caravan"
00:45:24,00:45:25,maker.
00:45:25,00:45:26,Detail.
00:45:26,00:45:27,"They started working together, right?"
00:45:27,00:45:31,"They had the details of the mine, and they had the explosive, and they had the way to"
00:45:31,00:45:33,"attach it to the ship, so they were doing really well."
00:45:33,00:45:38,"But what they needed was something to keep apart the hammer and the detonator, right?"
00:45:38,00:45:42,"So that when you're swimming up, when you're a frogman swimming up, you attach the mine,"
00:45:42,00:45:43,and you prime it.
00:45:43,00:45:44,It doesn't go off immediately.
00:45:44,00:45:50,So you need something that slowly dissolves and separates the hammer and the detonator.
00:45:50,00:45:54,"And Clark's kids were eating aniseed balls, and they tried them out, and they found they"
00:45:54,00:45:55,dissolved in about half an hour in water.
00:45:55,00:45:58,But you didn't have to suck the grenade.
00:45:58,00:45:59,No.
00:45:59,00:46:04,"Yeah, it's a mouth activated."
00:46:04,00:46:09,"So Clark and McCrae, they bought every aniseed ball in Bedford, right?"
00:46:09,00:46:12,Because they're for their experiments.
00:46:12,00:46:16,But the problem was they also needed something to keep the aniseed ball dry until the mine
00:46:16,00:46:18,"was in place, right?"
00:46:18,00:46:21,So they also went around buying all the condoms in Bedford.
00:46:21,00:46:29,"Imagine getting to the supermarket checkout, you just got a trolley full of condoms and"
00:46:29,00:46:30,aniseed balls.
00:46:30,00:46:34,Clark said we got a completely undeserved reputation as sexual athletes because we
00:46:34,00:46:35,were...
00:46:35,00:46:36,But they worked.
00:46:36,00:46:41,"The aniseed balls worked in this mine, and the MAD commissioned them, the War Office"
00:46:41,00:46:44,"commissioned them, and they started buying aniseed balls directly from the manufacturer."
00:46:44,00:46:45,And I love this.
00:46:45,00:46:49,Clark also commissioned some miniature condoms from a rubber factory to cover the firing
00:46:49,00:46:50,mechanism.
00:46:50,00:46:57,"Imagine if it's the pharmacist to begin with going, ""Do you have any smaller condoms?"""
00:46:57,00:46:58,I got smaller.
00:46:58,00:46:59,"No, I got smaller than that."
00:46:59,00:47:06,I love how we've gone from like the biggest bomb the world has ever known.
00:47:06,00:47:15,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:47:15,00:47:19,My fact is that there are only three newt-detecting dogs on the planet.
00:47:19,00:47:20,Brilliant.
00:47:20,00:47:21,Yeah.
00:47:21,00:47:30,"This is a woman called Nicola Jane Glover, she's a dog owner, and she's got a spaniel"
00:47:30,00:47:33,"called Freya, and another dog called Newtky."
00:47:33,00:47:37,"And this was in an article in The Guardian recently, but it's actually been going on"
00:47:37,00:47:42,"for a few years, so I think at least in 2018 Freya was detecting newts."
00:47:42,00:47:46,And the reason you need to detect newts is that there's a species called the great crested
00:47:46,00:47:51,"Newt which is protected, and if you're developing land you have to show that there are no newts"
00:47:51,00:47:55,"there, because they don't want to endanger them, and it's really hard to find them, because"
00:47:55,00:47:58,"they spend a lot of their time underground and in the water, because they're amphibious."
00:47:58,00:48:04,"So Nicola Glover, she and her colleagues, they trained Freya, the spaniel, to detect"
00:48:04,00:48:09,"live newts, and Freya can do it really, really well now, 90% detection rate."
00:48:09,00:48:15,"And it's a good method of saving the newt and saving a lot of time and fuss, and newt"
00:48:15,00:48:16,detection work.
00:48:16,00:48:21,"And the other thing about this story, although there's a third one, who's Rocky from Flintshire,"
00:48:21,00:48:25,"who was also trained separately in 2020, there was a correction in The Guardian article about"
00:48:25,00:48:28,"the dogs, which I think you saw, Jenny."
00:48:28,00:48:29,This article was amended.
00:48:29,00:48:34,An earlier version said that great crested Newts reached an adult overall length of 17
00:48:34,00:48:35,metres.
00:48:35,00:48:40,"I thought that's the one I read, and I thought, well, why do you need a dog?"
00:48:40,00:48:46,It should have been 17 centimetres.
00:48:46,00:48:52,"Yeah, I read an article from 2011 that said that they were starting to do this with the"
00:48:52,00:48:59,"crested Newts, but also desert tortoises, kiwis, cacopos, bats, cheetahs, I don't know why."
00:48:59,00:49:02,"Brown tree snakes, seals, and bed bugs."
00:49:02,00:49:06,So dogs were being taught to look for all these things for various different reasons.
00:49:06,00:49:09,"The cheetahs, I think they're looking for the scat for the poo."
00:49:09,00:49:10,Not actual.
00:49:10,00:49:11,Not actual.
00:49:11,00:49:14,"Oh, one went past about five minutes ago."
00:49:14,00:49:15,Who's a dog person?
00:49:15,00:49:16,Who's a cat person?
00:49:16,00:49:17,I'm a dog.
00:49:17,00:49:18,You're a cat person?
00:49:18,00:49:19,Yeah.
00:49:19,00:49:23,"It's not a bit embarrassing when someone goes, oh, my dog just discovered the ancient caves"
00:49:23,00:49:24,at Lussel.
00:49:24,00:49:26,"And you're like, yeah, my cat ate a curtain."
00:49:26,00:49:31,"Yeah, my cat doesn't give a fuck."
00:49:31,00:49:35,"Yeah, I mean, I would say I'm probably not really either, but I've had cats forced upon"
00:49:35,00:49:36,"me, so."
00:49:36,00:49:43,But I went following the story in terms of things dogs do unbelievable stuff all the
00:49:43,00:49:44,time.
00:49:44,00:49:45,Yeah.
00:49:45,00:49:46,"You're a dog person, aren't you?"
00:49:46,00:49:47,"Yeah, but my dogs are crap."
00:49:47,00:49:48,They're absolutely rubbish.
00:49:48,00:49:49,You've got dogs.
00:49:49,00:49:50,I've got two dogs.
00:49:50,00:49:51,Each idiot.
00:49:51,00:49:53,Fight seals on a regular basis.
00:49:53,00:49:54,Fight seals.
00:49:54,00:49:55,Successfully.
00:49:55,00:49:56,There's a lot of seals where we live.
00:49:56,00:49:57,Wow.
00:49:57,00:49:58,That's so cool.
00:49:58,00:49:59,Yeah.
00:49:59,00:50:01,"Well, it's not cool because the seals just go, see you later, and swim off, and then"
00:50:01,00:50:04,"you have to go and rescue your dog, who's the moron."
00:50:04,00:50:09,But maybe you've not given them the chance to work out if they're like semen sniffing
00:50:09,00:50:11,dogs or if they are.
00:50:11,00:50:12,Jesus.
00:50:12,00:50:13,That's on my list.
00:50:13,00:50:14,That's on my list.
00:50:14,00:50:18,"Why would you, that's the first on your list to say."
00:50:18,00:50:19,That just was fast.
00:50:19,00:50:20,Give me back up a little.
00:50:20,00:50:22,Is that what you say to anyone who's walking a dog in the park?
00:50:22,00:50:25,"You're like, have you ever given it a chance to be a semen sniffing dog?"
00:50:25,00:50:31,"I've got a pocket full of amethyst balls, I've got another pocket full of mini cundoms."
00:50:31,00:50:34,You've got a semen sniffing dog.
00:50:34,00:50:35,Let's talk.
00:50:35,00:50:37,Is that with an A?
00:50:37,00:50:39,Are you spelling that with an A?
00:50:39,00:50:41,"No, I don't think that is, no."
00:50:41,00:50:42,"No, no, no."
00:50:42,00:50:44,"Jenny, you write romantic novels, don't you?"
00:50:44,00:50:46,Have you ever had a semen sniffing dog?
00:50:46,00:50:49,It's raining months just here for the inspiration.
00:50:49,00:50:51,Hang on.
00:50:51,00:50:53,"Tight, tight, tight."
00:50:53,00:50:58,She was a girl from the city with a semen sniffing dog and a heart of gold.
00:50:58,00:50:59,"So, okay."
00:50:59,00:51:04,"It's used for, you know, I mean, unfortunately it's used for terrible, terrible reasons."
00:51:04,00:51:05,"Yeah, for crimes and so on."
00:51:05,00:51:07,But that's an important thing.
00:51:07,00:51:14,They need to sometimes have a dog detect whether or not someone might have recently have left
00:51:14,00:51:16,some semen out because it can find the traces on it.
00:51:16,00:51:22,And it can detect as little as 0.016 millilitres of seminal fluid.
00:51:22,00:51:24,"So, they're very good at it."
00:51:24,00:51:31,"So, what I'm saying is your dog might not have been given the chance to show that it could smell semen"
00:51:31,00:51:34,or find whale poo because they do that as well.
00:51:34,00:51:36,They sit on boats and they can find whale.
00:51:36,00:51:38,I see clever dogs like Spaniels.
00:51:38,00:51:40,Spaniels are like real teacher pleasers.
00:51:40,00:51:41,"Oh yeah, right."
00:51:41,00:51:42,Pairs and they're cool.
00:51:42,00:51:43,One of your ducks.
00:51:43,00:51:47,Kind of just terrifying half-cougar things that we found in the laba.
00:51:47,00:51:48,But I must.
00:51:48,00:51:50,"No, they're terriers."
00:51:50,00:51:51,"Oh, okay, okay."
00:51:51,00:51:55,"So, but they're kind of, they're theoretically ratters."
00:51:55,00:51:57,But they're just a bit rubbish.
00:51:57,00:51:59,What does that fit in your...
00:51:59,00:52:01,I'd need to see a photo.
00:52:01,00:52:03,There's a game called Hound Pooch or Mutt.
00:52:03,00:52:05,Almost any dog fits into those categories.
00:52:05,00:52:06,"Oh, Hounds, they're Hounds."
00:52:06,00:52:07,They're Hounds.
00:52:07,00:52:09,"Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:09,00:52:13,"When Melvis sang ""You Ain't Nothing but a Hound Dog"", he was playing that game, wasn't he?"
00:52:13,00:52:14,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:14,00:52:17,"He'd already recorded a version called ""You Ain't Nothing but a Pooch Dog""."
00:52:17,00:52:19,I don't think it's rubbish.
00:52:19,00:52:23,"There was an interesting story about a man I'd never heard of, really, really amazing."
00:52:23,00:52:25,He was a German diplomat.
00:52:25,00:52:28,He was sort of sided on the side of the Nazis at the time.
00:52:28,00:52:30,And he was an attaché for the Nazis.
00:52:30,00:52:33,He's called George Ferdinand Duckwitz.
00:52:33,00:52:34,Duckwitz.
00:52:34,00:52:36,Must have had a rough time at school.
00:52:36,00:52:40,"Ferdinand Duckwitz is asking for a spoonerism, isn't he?"
00:52:40,00:52:41,Yeah.
00:52:41,00:52:43,He's an amazing character.
00:52:43,00:52:45,He sits in the world of Oscar Schindler.
00:52:45,00:52:50,He was someone who helped to save a lot of refugees who were stuck in Denmark.
00:52:50,00:52:56,And supposedly 95% of their Jewish population was successfully taken out of the country
00:52:56,00:52:59,to a safe place in Sweden because of this guy.
00:52:59,00:53:01,And he risked his life to do it.
00:53:01,00:53:02,So he's an amazing character.
00:53:02,00:53:04,"Oh, and you called him a fuckwit, James."
00:53:04,00:53:10,"Oh, okay."
00:53:10,00:53:12,"Sorry, Duckwitz, yeah, yeah."
00:53:12,00:53:14,I'm not going to trivialise his memory.
00:53:15,00:53:17,"Not well done, James."
00:53:17,00:53:23,"Okay, so where's the dog coming in here?"
00:53:23,00:53:26,The dog comes in here because when they were taking them out on all the boats
00:53:26,00:53:28,"and they were hiding them in the cargo,"
00:53:28,00:53:31,a lot of dogs had been trained up in order to sniff out any humans that were on board.
00:53:31,00:53:33,So this is a problem that they had.
00:53:33,00:53:37,So what they did was they came up with an idea that they could deceive the sniffer dogs
00:53:37,00:53:39,by placing seamen in there.
00:53:39,00:53:42,You were giving me that look like it was heading there.
00:53:42,00:53:46,They created what was a mixture of dried rabbit blood and cocaine.
00:53:46,00:53:48,And they gave it to the fishermen.
00:53:48,00:53:50,They gave it to the fishermen.
00:53:50,00:53:52,Who would coat it in handkerchiefs.
00:53:52,00:53:56,And then they would hold the handkerchiefs and the dogs would race towards the handkerchief.
00:53:56,00:53:59,They would ignore any of the other smells that were on the boat.
00:53:59,00:54:04,"And so as a result, they would have no other interest in what was going on here."
00:54:04,00:54:06,And that would become the main focus.
00:54:06,00:54:07,Why the cocaine?
00:54:07,00:54:09,"I mean, rabbit blood, I guess, dogs."
00:54:09,00:54:14,"Well, rabbit blood is to attract them and the cocaine is to not interest it."
00:54:14,00:54:18,When they're talking about themselves.
00:54:18,00:54:20,I can tell you about some rabbits.
00:54:20,00:54:22,I caught a lot of big rabbits.
00:54:22,00:54:23,A lot of great rabbits.
00:54:23,00:54:27,It supposedly temporarily would knock out their smell.
00:54:27,00:54:28,Wow.
00:54:28,00:54:29,"God, that's so clever."
00:54:29,00:54:30,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:54:30,00:54:31,That's amazing.
00:54:31,00:54:32,"Yeah, so he's a huge hero."
00:54:32,00:54:35,"He saved 7,200 Jewish refugees."
00:54:35,00:54:36,Wow.
00:54:36,00:54:38,Can I say something about the great crested mute?
00:54:38,00:54:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:54:39,00:54:40,Right.
00:54:40,00:54:44,So they have a very colourful belly.
00:54:44,00:54:45,Okay.
00:54:45,00:54:48,No one really knows why they've got a colourful belly.
00:54:48,00:54:53,"If you're a mute and you're colourful, often it's because you want people to know you're toxic."
00:54:53,00:54:56,And it turns out they are toxic.
00:54:56,00:54:58,They're warts containing chemicals.
00:54:58,00:55:05,And there was a naturalist called Eleanor Ormerod who tested it by biting a live mute's tail.
00:55:05,00:55:09,Just the tail and the tails will grow back and stuff.
00:55:09,00:55:11,And then she recorded all of her symptoms.
00:55:11,00:55:13,So she was foaming at the mouth.
00:55:13,00:55:15,She had shivering fits.
00:55:15,00:55:18,And so she proved that they were toxic.
00:55:18,00:55:23,It's a lot of scientists putting stuff in their mouths.
00:55:23,00:55:25,So we found out that they are toxic.
00:55:25,00:55:27,But the weird thing is they're nutes.
00:55:27,00:55:32,So they walk around a lot with their belly pointing to the ground.
00:55:32,00:55:35,And so no predators can see their bellies anyway.
00:55:35,00:55:40,And so no one knows still to this day why they have a colourful belly.
00:55:40,00:55:42,That is so strange.
00:55:42,00:55:43,Are you sure it wouldn't?
00:55:43,00:55:45,Moles and stuff come up and eat them.
00:55:45,00:55:46,The moles?
00:55:46,00:55:47,Yeah.
00:55:47,00:55:48,They swim.
00:55:48,00:55:49,They swim.
00:55:49,00:55:50,They swim.
00:55:50,00:55:53,So maybe fish from the predators.
00:55:53,00:55:54,But you're right.
00:55:54,00:55:57,Normally you'd feel like birds would be descending on them.
00:55:57,00:55:58,Eleanor Ormerod anyway.
00:55:58,00:55:59,She's really famous.
00:55:59,00:56:01,She's an agricultural entomologist.
00:56:01,00:56:03,Because she was living in Victorian times.
00:56:03,00:56:07,So couldn't really be a professional scientist in those days if you're a woman.
00:56:07,00:56:11,But she found a kind of a role where she could use her skills
00:56:11,00:56:13,and apply them to agriculture.
00:56:13,00:56:16,So you know like if people's crops are dying she could say
00:56:16,00:56:18,well you should get rid of these nutes.
00:56:18,00:56:20,So you should get rid of these moles or whatever.
00:56:20,00:56:21,Stuff like that.
00:56:21,00:56:24,And she was so famous that Virginia Woolf wrote a story about her
00:56:24,00:56:26,called Miss Ormerod which is named after her.
00:56:26,00:56:29,Just a pretty cool person.
00:56:29,00:56:30,That's very cool.
00:56:30,00:56:34,Things women had to do to be scientists in those days.
00:56:34,00:56:35,"I know, I know."
00:56:35,00:56:37,She's going to bite this mute.
00:56:37,00:56:39,We know it's poisonous.
00:56:39,00:56:41,But we don't know how poisonous.
00:56:41,00:56:42,So Eleanor if you could...
00:56:42,00:56:45,I'm going to mention one last thing before we wrap up.
00:56:45,00:56:47,I don't know if it's useful but just in case you're wondering
00:56:47,00:56:49,we've been talking a lot about dogs sniffing humans.
00:56:49,00:56:53,And I discovered that there's a job whereby you as a human can sniff a dog.
00:56:53,00:56:58,Are we looking for the dog or is that the idea?
00:56:58,00:56:59,No.
00:56:59,00:57:02,Is it a chocolate lab?
00:57:02,00:57:07,This is for people who work in factories that are making dog food.
00:57:07,00:57:12,Because one of the things that owners hate about dog food
00:57:12,00:57:15,is the breath that it can leave on their dog.
00:57:15,00:57:18,And they make a very concerted effort not to make food
00:57:18,00:57:21,where chemicals are altering the smell of the mouth of a dog
00:57:21,00:57:22,so that it's very pongy.
00:57:22,00:57:25,So one of the jobs that if you work in one of these factories
00:57:25,00:57:28,is to go up and sniff dogs mouths
00:57:28,00:57:32,who are experimenting with new tastes and new formulas and so on.
00:57:32,00:57:36,And then if a dog has ejaculated recently you can...
00:57:36,00:57:37,"No, not that."
00:57:37,00:57:41,I just love how excited the dogs were to get their jobs.
00:57:41,00:57:44,I'm a taster at a dog food factory.
00:57:44,00:57:45,The other dogs let go.
00:57:45,00:57:46,Well that sounds awesome.
00:57:46,00:57:47,That sounds cool.
00:57:47,00:57:49,So they sniff you?
00:57:49,00:57:52,"God, that's so..."
00:57:52,00:57:54,"That's not a lovely job, I think."
00:57:54,00:57:55,Can I ask another question?
00:57:55,00:57:57,"You won't know the answer to this, but you might."
00:57:57,00:58:00,"It's not just important, presumably, that their breath doesn't smell."
00:58:00,00:58:03,You don't want their farts to smell bad.
00:58:03,00:58:05,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, really good point."
00:58:05,00:58:06,You don't want that on the other side.
00:58:06,00:58:09,So do you not have someone whose job is to smell all the dog farts?
00:58:09,00:58:10,I do.
00:58:10,00:58:11,It feels like you must.
00:58:11,00:58:12,"You must, right?"
00:58:12,00:58:13,It's probably...
00:58:13,00:58:14,You must.
00:58:14,00:58:15,I think he's right.
00:58:15,00:58:17,It's probably the unspoken astro.
00:58:17,00:58:19,That's what they tell you once you've got the gig.
00:58:19,00:58:21,That's by the way.
00:58:21,00:58:23,There's a second hatch over there.
00:58:23,00:58:25,That's what that one happened.
00:58:25,00:58:35,"Okay, that's it."
00:58:35,00:58:36,That is all of our facts.
00:58:36,00:58:37,Thank you so much for listening.
