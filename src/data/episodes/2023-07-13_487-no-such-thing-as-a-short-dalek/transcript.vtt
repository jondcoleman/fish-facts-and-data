00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish where we are joined

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.080
 by our very good friend Jenny Colgan. Now Jenny Colgan is, well she's done a bit of

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.160
 stand up but she is mostly well known for being a writer, a writer of romantic comedy

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.240
 fiction and of science fiction. If you are a fan of Doctor Who then you may well know

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.440
 her. She's written all sorts of spin-offs and audiobooks and stuff for Doctor Who. We might

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.440
 get into that in the first fact today, spoiler alert, but what we'd like to let you know

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.560
 about most of all is that Jenny has a brand new book. It is called The Summer Skies and

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.480
 if it is anything like Jenny's other work it is going to be absolutely fantastic, just

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.320
 perfect for a summer holiday and you can get that wherever you buy your books. On top of

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.920
 that the usual stuff do join club fish if you want a bit of extra fish in your life and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.240
 some ad free episodes and if you go to noticethingsafish.com/podfest then you will find that there are one

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.960
 or two really not many at all tickets left for our show at Kings Place in September. We

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.560
 are on the verge of booking an amazing guest for that. I promise you you will not want

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.520
 to miss it. If you can't get down to London then there are streaming tickets available.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:30.320
 Okay really hope you enjoyed this week's show and all that's left to say is on with

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:42.840
 the next episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.240
 offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.720
 Hunter Murray and Jenny Colgan and once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.160
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.000
 we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Jenny. There is, on.to, a Dalek named

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.760
 after a Dickens character. I learned this fact for money, not actually for points really

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.900
 because one of my kids teachers is a great Dickens fan and he said to the kids if you

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.480
 bring me a Dickens fact that I haven't heard before there's something in it for you. So

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.140
 I can put it out to the world which was kind of fun and actually the most Dickens facts

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.840
 that everybody knows, one he's the first person ever to talk about dinosaurs in fiction.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.920
 I did not know that. There is a reference to dinosaur on page one of Blake House and

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.000
 then the other thing that most people know is that Hans Christian Anderson came to Stamerton

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.960
 on holiday and was the worst guest ever and they both wrote about it in their diaries

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.640
 with Hans going oh I'm feeling so weary and Dickens going how do we get this guy out.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.460
 So these, obviously the teacher knew these very famous facts but what he did not know

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.540
 is a friend of mine who's an actor plays a Dalek on.to and they tend to keep the same

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.380
 people because obviously it's quite skilled and you tend to be in the same Dalek casing

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.660
 because they're really small and it's not very pleasant to spend 10 hours in a really

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.180
 small space. So you have your own Dalek and the Dalek is named after you in the props

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.080
 covered and my friend is called Barnaby and he's named after Barnaby Rodge and so there

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.240
 is in the BBC Dalek Barnaby.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.400
 Dalek Barnaby that's so good.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.360
 Go ahead and dig in there sir I must exterminate you.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.160
 Yeah that's amazing. So yeah so for anyone that doesn't know Doctor Who James I'm looking

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.160
 at you.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.160
 Yeah I'm afraid I don't.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.160
 You know what the Daleks are though?

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.520
 Yeah they're like little robots are they?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520
 They're a tall villain.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.520
 Oh so are they?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.520
 So are they?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.520
 Yeah they're tall.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.000
 They're not little when we say little they're about.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.820
 Yeah but if I had to describe a Dalek the first word I would say wasn't oh they're

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.820
 quite tall.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.140
 The guy over there can you describe him?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.140
 Yeah he's tall.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.040
 No he's got a same punch coming out of his tall side.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.980
 Can you tell me anything about the criminal who came over and tried to exterminate you?

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.280
 Well yeah first of all he was tall.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.320
 I was simply addressing your first point and saying they're small.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.820
 I was simply hitting that off as a busted myth straight away.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.540
 Okay so there's like Jenny do it she knows Doctor Who.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.880
 They're a paper pot they're tall and they have a kind of plunder at the front and they

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.360
 are in fact they look like they're the monsters but they're not they are kind of strange creatures

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.360
 inside.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.360
 They used to be people.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.000
 So they're like a tank for a month.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.800
 That is exactly what they're like.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.240
 When you say pepper pot I read that when they were designed the person who decided how they

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.360
 would move used the pepper pot to kind of move around the table and say this is how

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360
 they'll move.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.360
 Is that true?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360
 I think it is.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.020
 It was Ray Cusick who designed the look of the door.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.480
 It's a really weird the story of how they were come up with because the creator was Terry

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.160
 Nation who was involved in working on the very early scripts and he just described them

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.880
 in the script but he didn't really describe them very much and then Terry Nation was...

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.880
 He said tall.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.720
 He said just some cool aliens.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.220
 And then Ray Cusick took the job to design them and he worked with a model maker called

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.040
 Bill Roberts and they actually they're the ones who built the look as far as I understand

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.040
 it.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.040
 Is that fair?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.040
 Yeah.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.040
 Yeah.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.040
 And Terry Nation though holds the as it were...

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.040
 But they belong to him.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.040
 The copyright.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.040
 They belong to him.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.120
 Well he became hugely wealthy because he owned the copyright to Daleks and so...

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.640
 And to the point where when the new series came back all those years ago with Russell

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.520
 T. Davies the first one with Christopher Eccleston we didn't know if we were going to get the

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.160
 Daleks back because the Terry Nation estate said well we don't know if this is going to

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.660
 be... They had to consider that the Daleks would not return with Doctor Who.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.340
 And what is the very first thing the Daleks do when they come back?

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.340
 I know this one.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.220
 I actually know this one because that's one of the very little bits of Doctor Who I've

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.220
 seen.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.220
 They go up some stairs.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.220
 They fly up the stairs.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.220
 Yeah.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.100
 It was in such a lovely moment when kind of rose escapes up the stairs and the whole

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.100
 country's going...

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.100
 Aha!

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.100
 The one thing I know about Daleks and then the limited.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.100
 Yeah.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.660
 I'd love to know if your friend Barnaby if he's been in the same Dalek for all these

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.660
 years.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.280
 Whether or not it's like when you go into a small biplane and you know the person's

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.920
 got a picture of their kids up on some dice, you know, is he inside?

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.140
 Have they got all these little mementos?

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.400
 It's a complete Dalek!

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.400
 This is not the only literary reference that made its way into Doctor Who.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.840
 The very first companion of the very first series of Doctor Who was Ian Chesterton.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.720
 And Ian Chesterton was named after GK Chesterton because the original scriptwriter for the

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.660
 show Coburn was a devout Catholic and a massive fan of Chesterton and so gave him that name.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.660
 Yeah.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.660
 So Chesterton made it in as well.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.860
 And Dickens is the first historical figure that turns up in New Who.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.860
 Oh really?

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.860
 Wow.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.860
 So he's in the second episode I think.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.860
 Of the original series?

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.860
 Of the new series.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.860
 Of the new series.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.860
 So which of course isn't new anymore.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.860
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.860
 It's like really old.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.860
 Right.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.420
 As played, of course, by Simon Cowell who has played Dickens so often I get them very

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.500
 muddled up in my head.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.500
 Yeah.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.500
 So the first companion was named after who?

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.500
 GK Chesterton.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.500
 GK Chesterton.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.500
 Yeah.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.420
 So I've got, I thought the first assistant was the Doctor's granddaughter.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.820
 Are we confusing companion and assistant?

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.820
 Oh my God.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.820
 I'm sorry.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.820
 We're going to get letters.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.820
 It's the one who does the inbox.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.540
 I just feel like, I did a Pump Quiz recently and the Quiz Master, she said we had a Doctor

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.400
 Who quiz in here last week and I barely got out alive.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.340
 Like, famously the quickest way to end a punch up in a Pump Quiz is to ask how many Doctor

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.840
 Who's there been?

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.840
 Oh.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.140
 Luckily your inbox is bigger on the inside than ours.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:46.180
 Yeah, that might be a technicality because the granddaughter is the granddaughter.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.180
 Right, right, right.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.180
 There she comes.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.180
 The brief was really interesting for the casting.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.040
 It was, she had to be a with it girl of 15 reaching the end of her secondary school career

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.920
 Eager for life, lower than middle class, avoid dialect, use neutral accent laced with the

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.920
 latest teenage slang.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.920
 That was the gig.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.920
 Hit cat.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.920
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.040
 And then she was made his granddaughter because it was, was it William Hartnell, the first

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.040
 one?

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.040
 It was.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.880
 And it was to avoid any suggestion of, this is a bit weird, isn't it, this whole bloke

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.440
 traveling around with a 15 year old girl.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.440
 What's going on?

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.520
 You know, they were really careful with that for so long.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.280
 In fact, right up till I started writing for it and I started.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.280
 Did you change it?

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.600
 But no, when I went to see them, they were really, because I write romantic comedy and

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.480
 they were really quite funny, like, you know, we can't have any kissing or anything like

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.480
 that.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.480
 And I was like, fine.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.240
 I promise you I'm a David T. I will not do any of that.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:38.500
 Then the show completely changed and actually Matt Smith spends pretty much his whole time

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:44.360
 being naked or getting married to folk by mistake or, you know, they suddenly became a massive

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:50.360
 romantic overtones all the time.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.920
 Did he get his heart broken?

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.080
 I just kind of slip in.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.080
 Oh dear.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.160
 I did read that there have been Doctor Who top trumps over the years.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:11.080
 This is interesting because I do know about top trumps and Pac six has a lot of bad guys

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.840
 in, including Adolf Hitler.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.320
 And if you put Pac six against Pac seven, you can fight Adolf Hitler against Queen Elizabeth

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.480
 the first.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:27.440
 So I want you to guess who is the bravest out of Adolf Hitler or Queen Elizabeth the

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.080
 first according to top trumps.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.080
 Elizabeth.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.080
 Yeah.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.080
 Agreed.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.080
 Everyone.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.080
 I'll say the minority.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.080
 Sorry.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.080
 Are you voting for Hitler?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.080
 Just checking.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:45.400
 I just wanted to say out loud that you think Hitler is braver, braver.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.400
 Not better.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.400
 I'll say Hitler.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.840
 In fact, bravery was his lowest possible thing.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.760
 He was good in lots of the things, but the bravery was the worst.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.920
 Who do you think is the strongest out of Hitler or Queen Elizabeth the first?

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.440
 I got completely ambushed last time.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:10.560
 The first. Stronger. She is the strongest and Hitler wins on brains and terror.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.560
 Okay.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.560
 Just a thing.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.560
 Right.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.560
 Victory for Hitler.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.560
 Thank you, Doctor Who.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.400
 He does spend his entire episode locked in the cupboard.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.400
 Does he?

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.400
 So I could have got you to the bravery thing, but the brains one slightly defeats me.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.920
 What was Hitler's episode, Doctor Who?

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.920
 It's called Let's Kill Hitler.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.560
 Oh, wow.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.560
 Really?

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.560
 Gosh.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.920
 One of the first people involved in the BBC side of things, there was a guy called Sidney

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.000
 Newman who was the head of drama.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.400
 He was a really interesting guy.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.720
 So there was a play that was broadcast in his career called Underground, right?

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.920
 And it was about a group of nuclear holocaust survivors living in the London Underground.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.000
 I think it was early '60s or late '50s, like it was quite, you know, it sounds very terrifying

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 and dramatic.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.600
 But it was a live broadcast and one of the actors in it died of a heart attack halfway

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.680
 through the television screening offstage.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.520
 So he wasn't on camera, but it was in between scenes basically.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.600
 He was in costume and makeup and, you know, he died and the play had to improvise its

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.720
 way through and Newman was kind of in charge of it.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.160
 He said, "Just treat it like a football match.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.160
 Just play on.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160
 Adjust."

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160
 Wow.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160
 Yeah.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160
 Oh, so it wasn't like there's been a murder.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.560
 Like they didn't shift the whole thing to do.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.560
 I don't know.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.560
 Like really deathful care.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.320
 Can I just say, if someone dies in the middle of a football match, they do stop the game.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.840
 That's a very good point.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.760
 That's a very good point.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.480
 Well, that's the weird thing.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.880
 The character was meant to die of a heart attack later in the play.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.400
 The character, not the actor.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.080
 So I guess they just had to shift it.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080
 Of course not the actor.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.000
 What a gig to agree to.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 This will require you dying.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.240
 It's going out on BBC One, so you've got to think of your career.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.040
 Peter Capaldi, I think, auditioned for the Doctor Who and got the role, but he got it

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.080
 20 years later.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.520
 So he auditioned in 1996 when they were casting for the, they made a film, didn't they then?

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.520
 And that was...

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.520
 Yes.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.520
 And lots of people auditioned.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.520
 Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Rick Mail.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.520
 Oh, wow.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.280
 Rick would have been great, although you need to be kind of kind to be the Doctor.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.360
 And I think he was a very kind man in real life, but on screen he was terrifying at all

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.360
 times.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.360
 Yeah.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.440
 Others auditioned, Brian Blassid?

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.440
 No.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.440
 No?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440
 Do you know what?

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.960
 There's a certain, I think it's about English tolerance for Brian Blassid and I have not.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.960
 Oh, that's wonderful.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.960
 The gene.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.440
 I can't, you know, I get it.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.440
 Everybody loves him.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.200
 It's one of those English things that I don't get.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200
 Like freaking Tim Henman.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.920
 Do you think Andy would make a good Doctor Who, I think he would.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.920
 I think...

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.920
 Yes?

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.920
 Let me see your fingers.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.920
 Hold it.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.920
 Your fingers.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.920
 Yeah?

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.920
 Okay.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.920
 Sorry, what are you looking for there?

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.920
 They've all got really long fingers.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.920
 Are they?

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.920
 Oh.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.920
 Is that?

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.920
 A requirement.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920
 A requirement?

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.920
 Yeah.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.920
 Maybe that's why Capaldi got the gig 20 years on.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.920
 Yeah.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.920
 He was older.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.920
 Taller.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.920
 Fingers longer fingers.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.560
 Actually, the very nice thing is Shitty Who is the new Doctor Who is also Scottish.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.440
 So we've had the most sensational run of it since we were up in 5th, yeah.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.000
 One of the most famous things about Doctor Who is the fact that during the 1950s and

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.440
 60s, or even to the 70s, about 60 to 70% of all BBC video that had recordings of shows

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440
 were deleted.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.840
 And so we're missing, it was over 100 episodes of Doctor Who.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.760
 It's slowly going a bit slow.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.840
 I think it's under the 100 mark now, purely because there is a dedicated group of fans

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.400
 who are out there in the world trying to track down all of these missing episodes.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.680
 And it's fascinating.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.440
 Every few years we get a message that comes through from fans online saying, "A nut's

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440
 been found."

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.680
 The BBC will say, "Nine found in Nigeria in the cupboard of a random local TV station."

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.680
 And they just find the reels?

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.680
 Do they?

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.160
 Yeah, they find the old, yeah.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.640
 Because what they used to do is they used to send out all of these reels to different

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.640
 countries.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.240
 But explicitly would say, "Once you've had it for this many months, there's an expiry

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.240
 date on it."

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.240
 Yeah.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.240
 Burn them up.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.400
 Yeah, I have at home, I have a vinyl record of a Goon show episode called Yeti, which

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.560
 says on it, "Smash this in three months time, here's the expiry date."

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.560
 Yeah.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.560
 And someone just hadn't smashed it.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.640
 Is that where the Mission Impossible films got this message will self-destruct in five

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.640
 seconds or whatever?

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.640
 Could be.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.640
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.640
 Yeah, I don't know either.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.640
 It might be.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.520
 But yeah, so we still have like 97 episodes that are still missing, but they keep getting

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.520
 fanned.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.160
 If you find one, is it worth like a million quid or something?

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.160
 That's interesting.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.160
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.160
 Not really.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.160
 No.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.960
 It kind of belongs to the BBC still, and also it's such a kind of proper Indiana Jones

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.960
 sleuthathon.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960
 Yeah.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.960
 You know, people have dedicated.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.440
 It's for every amount of time to this thing.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.440
 Wow.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.840
 It would be seen as bad if you put it on eBay straight away and...

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:46.680
 Yes, it would be seen as bad, but also I think the kind of glory and honour of finding it.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.760
 The missing ones, they've kind of animated them.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.280
 Ah, do they have the scripts then?

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.280
 They've got scripts.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.280
 Right.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.280
 Okay, cool.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.200
 When you think of Doctor Who, largely it's the villains of the old Doctor Who, the Daleks

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.200
 and so on.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.200
 Slither Man.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.200
 Cyber Man.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200
 Thank you.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.200
 Well done, James.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.200
 Slither Man.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200
 But then there's also James, the weeping...

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200
 Angels.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.200
 That's right.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.040
 So Stephen Moffitt, who created that for the show, created a monster that was so iconic

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.400
 to the new fans of Doctor Who that when there was a poll done in 2012, it came on top as

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.680
 the best villain of Doctor Who, above the Daleks, which is very rare.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.720
 It's the first time I think that's ever happened.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.480
 So the weeping angels, for anyone that doesn't know, it's basically angels that are effectively

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:31.120
 weird aliens or something and if you turn your gaze away from them or you blink, they

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.320
 get closer to you and they get closer to you and get closer to you until they capture

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.320
 you.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.320
 Like Grandmother's footsteps.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320
 Yeah, exactly.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.320
 Yeah.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.320
 What time is it, Mr. Wolf?

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.320
 Yeah.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.920
 And if they capture you, they don't kill you, but they send you to another time on Earth

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.240
 and you're just stuck there and there's no way of getting back.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.200
 So it's basically a death to some extent.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.400
 Also if you're playing top trumps, then they have the same terror as Adolf Hitler.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.400
 Wow.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400
 There we go.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.360
 I've almost had a problem with the weeping angels as a monster.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.680
 Because I think if we had them now, they'd just be a queue of people closing their eyes

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.360
 in front of them saying, "Could you send me back to when I could buy a house?"

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.360
 I've had about 1981.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.360
 Manhattan is fine.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.360
 Yeah, exactly.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:16.040
 But so Stephen Mothwick was actually inspired by an original statue that he saw that looked

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.360
 so scary and he had this idea of what if that kept encroaching on me.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.760
 So years later, he decided, having told his son about the story, to go back and show him

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.920
 the weeping angel that had inspired this and they went there to the exact spot and it was

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.920
 gone.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:44.560
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.560
 Okay.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.000
 My fact this week is when the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, George Bernard Shaw

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.480
 wrote the Times in disgust.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.880
 He was upset that there was an unnecessary B at the end of the word bomb.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.880
 Thank you, George, for your contribution on this horrific day.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.880
 I know.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.880
 It's like Churchill said it was going to save a million lives, Gandhi said it was a potential

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:13.400
 suicide of mankind, but George Bernard Shaw wrote, "I can scribble the word bomb barely

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:21.880
 legible 18 times in a minute and bomb without the B 24 times in a minute saving 25% by dropping

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:29.800
 this superfluous B." And he reckoned that it would save 131,400 seconds per year in

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.960
 the entire English speaking world.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.640
 How soon after the bomb was dropped did he send this letter?

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.160
 It was a few weeks after.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.160
 Oh, okay.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.360
 So he waited for the initial...

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.720
 I think that was more the post.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.720
 Right.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.720
 God!

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.160
 I mean, yeah, talk about missing the point.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.160
 Yeah, it was.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.160
 Well, he was one of these people who really wanted to improve the language, so to speak,

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.560
 by making spelling simpler.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.560
 Thank you.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.560
 Moments, though, mate.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.560
 What the hell?

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.560
 I know.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.960
 Has anyone ever written B-O-M for bomb?

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.200
 Was he trying to call back to something or was he trying to solve the language?

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.080
 It feels like it's an Italian-ish word, bomb.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.680
 I think it comes from the Latin bombus, meaning it's not a matipaiic, it's just like a nice

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.680
 bomb.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.680
 And then it sort of works.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.480
 But anyway, I thought we might talk about the Manhattan Project because Jenny, you are

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.480
 something of an expert.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.720
 Is that fair to say on that?

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.120
 I would say it's not really fair to say because that is a hostage to fortune.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.160
 However, I did mastermind and I picked it as my specialist subject.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.160
 Wow.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.520
 And I don't really get nervous very often.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.840
 I have never been so nervous.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.280
 And I wasn't nervous about the subject, which I thought I knew.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:41.880
 And I wasn't nervous about being, I'd already lost Pointless and I'd already lost whatever

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.240
 that other chasey one is.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.200
 So I wasn't nervous about that.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200
 I was really nervous.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:52.360
 You know how every year there's one person that gets zero points and it goes on YouTube?

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.320
 And you know, and I just, that was just right in front of my eyes.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.080
 In particular, I was like, oh, they're looking at me and they go, oh my God, there's a girl

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.200
 on, you know, she thought she'd pick this stupid topic.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.360
 Oh, and the headline would have been 'Cog and Bombs' among a lot of you.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.960
 And I would have written some of the newspapers going, how are you spelling the word 'bomb'?

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.200
 You could have saved this much, hadn't you?

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.200
 Who was your host?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.120
 It was one of the tall white-haired pointy guys.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.120
 Humphreys.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.120
 Yes.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.880
 Because everyone who watches Doctor Who has their doctor, don't they, who they grew up

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.880
 with.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.480
 For me, it's a Magnus Magnus and it's my master mate.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.480
 Well, you did eat, you know, you did a bit of chit chat.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.480
 Yeah.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.480
 And he said, you're right about cakes.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.480
 And I was like, occasionally.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.480
 And he said, why aren't you fat?

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.480
 And I was like, what kind of a question?

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.480
 Why are we going for this?

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.480
 What?

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.480
 Why are we going for this?

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.480
 Well, how?

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.480
 So I think, yeah.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.480
 That's the to-date program training, kicking in, brutalising the guest before you ask the

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480
 question.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.320
 I can't help Andy, but to notice that Jenny's description of tall there to describe the

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.320
 host was very useful.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.320
 Actually, actually, no, you're right, Dan.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.320
 I don't think it was.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.320
 Sorry, Jenny.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.320
 You're one of the rubbish writers describing Humphreys.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.880
 He's sitting down.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.880
 Great point.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.200
 So the Manhattan Project?

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.200
 Yeah.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.200
 Yeah.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.200
 Oppenheimer.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.200
 And Oppenheimer.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.200
 He was an interesting cook.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.200
 He wasn't an Oppenheimer.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200
 He was.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.400
 He's someone who was a bit of a troubling kid.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.160
 He was running into stories where his dad kind of has to bail him out at various different

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.600
 times to sort of save the career that he's hoping to have.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.800
 He at one point was at Cambridge University.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.240
 He was studying there.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.160
 And he was furious with one of his teachers, who was called Patrick Blackett.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.000
 And Blackett would go on to win a Nobel Prize himself.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.120
 And Blackett was forcing him to do things that weren't theoretical physics.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.760
 He was taking them away from his interests.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.080
 Not applied physics, fuck it.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.280
 In a bit of fury, in a bit of rage, Oppenheimer.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.280
 And this is the story.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.040
 There's lots of different stories, but roughly this is it.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.520
 He poisoned an apple and left it on Blackett's desk for him to eat.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.360
 Like proper will kill you boys.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.360
 Proper poison.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360
 Yeah.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.560
 There's a lot of murky sort of territory to the story.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.320
 What we do know is definitely the dad stepped in and said, "If we promise to send him to

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.280
 a psychiatrist, can we keep him going on and if he keeps his meetings, can he stay?"

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.680
 And they said, "Yeah, sure."

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.240
 And so that's the only reason that he...

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.240
 Lean in those days, wasn't it?

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.240
 I know.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.280
 And they wouldn't like people who'd go to these posh schools, grow up, so they've got

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.960
 the rules done at Leighton.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.960
 Yeah.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.960
 It is crackers.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.120
 Wasn't that the way that Alan Turing killed himself as well with the poisoned apple?

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.120
 It was, yeah.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.120
 Supposedly that's the story.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.800
 Cyanide into the side of an apple.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.840
 A lot of poisoned apples around, yeah.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.800
 No, Oppenheimer was very odd.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.480
 So Oppenheimer is the person who, when they were setting up the Manhattan Project, they

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:33.680
 came to him and they said, "We want you to head this up."

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.720
 And the location, Los Alamos itself, was picked by Oppenheimer when he was on horseback going

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.960
 off around and he went, "This would be perfect."

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.960
 But even though he was given all of this high clearance and he was the head of this very

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.160
 secret operation, he was under constant surveillance because they also thought that he was a communist

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.840
 because he was very pro-communist.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.400
 He was never card-carrying, but he'd said enough stuff that they thought, "This guy's

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.520
 going to be stealing our secrets and sending them out."

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.520
 Well, the guy that did...

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.640
 There was a guy called Fuchs who was there who ended up, and is possibly, depending on

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.160
 how you look at it, guilty of one of the worst crimes that has ever been done, who did go

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.360
 and sell the stuff to the Soviets or he took it to the Soviets.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.800
 How would he compare against Hitler in the top trumps, please?

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.160
 That's an excellent question, James, when you want to get back, isn't it?

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.160
 Sorry.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.360
 And nobody suspected him.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.520
 Not only that, they all really liked him because he had a car and he used to give them a lift

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.200
 into town all the time because obviously they'd chit-chat and go, "Yeah, come on, I'll give

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.480
 you a little lift to the airport."

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.280
 And he caught all of them.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.680
 Not a single one.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.680
 Super nice guy.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.360
 Would he say, "Oh, just throw your briefcase in the back of the car while we drive."

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.360
 Exactly.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.680
 And there was someone in the back of the car, like under a blanket, who would then read through

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.680
 the stuff.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.680
 Can someone go and pick up Enrico Fermi?

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.680
 I'll do it.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.680
 Oh, my God.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.800
 That was another dad rescue moment for Old Openheimer.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.400
 He once got in a car crash because he tried to race a train and failed.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.000
 What do you mean by racing a train?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.680
 Are they going alongside each other?

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.160
 It feels like he was trying to outrun it and outgun it.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:06.600
 As opposed to sometimes it would be like you're trying to cross the track to the goal.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.880
 I think he was just racing.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.960
 I think he was just trying to get ahead of it.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.600
 And it left his girlfriend unconscious and in order to make up for this and turning into

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.980
 a big story, the father had to go over to the family of the young woman's house and

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.040
 gave a painting and an original Cezanne drawing as well.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.040
 I do that, by the way, that racing after the train on the M1.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.120
 You know, the last bit of the M1, the train goes alongside the road.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.520
 But my car, it's an electric car, so if I go up of 70 miles an hour I lose all my battery

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.120
 so I tend to lose the race quite quickly.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.120
 So funny.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.760
 I really think that this film should probably be about his dad.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.760
 Yeah.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.760
 Old Openheimer film.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.760
 Yeah, well it's a comedy if it's about a dad, isn't it?

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.760
 It's like, oh, Robert!

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.600
 It's like a Dennis the Menace movie then.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.960
 Yeah, and there's a flat when he was growing up.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.320
 There were three Van Gogh paintings and some Picasso's too and clearly some Cezanne's as

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.320
 well.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.720
 They were very, very wealthy people when he was growing up.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:07.480
 But his, Dan, you mentioned he was suspected of being a communist or of being suspect.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:13.600
 He was approached by Soviet intelligence in 1943 and he said, "No, I'm not going to

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.600
 show you the secrets."

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.680
 But it still wrecked his career anyway because he didn't tell anyone.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.760
 So he lost his clearance, his security clearance in 1954.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.680
 Feels like his cat's out of the bag then.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.600
 I mean, they've got the bomb.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.240
 But it was overtized to communism, it was in the whole McCarthy witch trial period.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:38.320
 But the U.S. Department of Energy did reverse their decision in 2022.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.020
 Just 55 years after he died, they said, "You know what?

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.880
 You can have your security clearance back."

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.880
 Very helpful.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.160
 I mean, it was a gesture, obviously.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160
 Maybe he's still alive.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.480
 You don't know what these atomic bombs are going to do to your...

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.480
 Yeah.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.520
 I would say that there was a movement on to stop people smoking on film because it wasn't

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.520
 very interesting.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.720
 They just pooped down.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.040
 And then I watched Casablanca because I'd never seen it.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.600
 And everyone is chugging on fags 100% the time and it's disgusting.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.240
 It was so disgusting.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.600
 And Oppenheimer never, ever took a breath that didn't have a cigarette on it.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.160
 So I'm feeling quite sorry for the actor because...

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.240
 Killian Murphy who's playing down the movie.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.240
 Yeah, because he never...

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.840
 He was a chain smoker.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.600
 He never took a breath without a cigarette.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.600
 That's what he says.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.320
 Part of the prep of trying to become Oppenheimer was basically cigarettes and cocktails with

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.320
 the...

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.320
 Yeah, cigarettes and martinis.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.320
 Yeah.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.320
 No, bro.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.120
 I'm going to have to go method.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.120
 Oh.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.120
 Gosh.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.920
 It's really weird because when I think about the atomic bomb and I think most people obviously

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.240
 where we see it as one of the worst moments in history and there's obviously the arguments

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.440
 that people make that it may have saved more lives like Churchill and so on.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.640
 But to sort of actively celebrate it feels quite an odd thing to me.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.920
 And if you do go to Los Alamos now, that is very much what they do.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.800
 Like it's their tourism trade, isn't it?

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.360
 So there's a supermarket there with an atomic bar.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.040
 You can get atomic salsa that you can buy and purchase.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.000
 There's atomic bumper stickers.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 There's a... you can buy clothing for babies where there's a mushroom cloud on it that

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.680
 says the words, "I've been dropping bombs since day one."

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.680
 Oh.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.520
 You know, there's all these merch things and it feels a bit out of taste except I guess

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.520
 it's not to them, right?

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.520
 Well, I don't know.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.040
 I mean, I grew up in a world where we went to a big room on Sunday and there was a guy

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.040
 with nails in his hand.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.040
 That's true.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.040
 I went to Hiroshima.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.040
 Yeah.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.400
 I've said this before, but if you go to Hiroshima, you can go where the bomb was dropped to the

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400
 exact spot.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.400
 Wow.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.720
 And there's a sign on the wall and it says the first nuclear bomb was detonated something

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.240
 like 100 feet above this point.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.640
 And then you sort of look upwards and you can imagine the exact spot where the bomb would

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.960
 have gone off and then detonated and killed all those people.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.960
 Wow.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.960
 It's really amazing.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.080
 Do you know about Trinitite?

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080
 Trinitite?

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.920
 I think it's Trinitite because it was the Trinity test.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.920
 Oh, okay.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.680
 So it's not got three nitrogen atoms.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.680
 That's why it's called Trinitite.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.680
 No, sorry.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.680
 No, I just said it wrong.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.680
 Yeah.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680
 Trinitite, I'm sure.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.680
 And it was...

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.680
 Is it a type of stone?

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:10.480
 It's a type of glass made when the sand turned to glass when they tested the first bomb.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.680
 And it's called, it's also called atom sight, it's light green glass.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.920
 And it was just left there.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.360
 Is it radioactive?

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.840
 I think it is not very anymore, but it's still a little radioactive.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:28.640
 So most of it was bulldozed by the US Atomic Energy Commission and buried, you know, but

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.300
 some of it's still there because ants will bring it to the surface, these tiny beads

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.800
 of glass because some of it's under the soil and they're digging their tunnels and so it

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.600
 just gets pushed up.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.000
 It's crazy and it's illegal to take it away now.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.080
 But for a while it was just thought, oh, it's just sand, it's just sand turned to glass.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.920
 And so there was a period in 1945 and 46 where it was marketed in jewellery.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.880
 You could get Trinitite jewellery.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.760
 There was a designer who made some earrings and a hairpin from it and there was an actress

00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.760
 called Merle Oberon.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.360
 She wore some of it to a fundraiser.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.680
 Supposedly this is quite dark.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.680
 To discredit Japanese claims about radiation injury.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.680
 What?

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.560
 So, you know, well, I mean, an actress is wearing some of the sand fused glass, so it can't

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.560
 be that dangerous.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.560
 But obviously...

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.560
 That's terrible.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.280
 Supposedly, I don't...

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.840
 Just because you've mentioned this, I haven't gotten this written down, but using one of

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.240
 these bombs is one of the methods that they've been thinking about it to try and get deeper

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.240
 and deeper.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240
 Boring into the ground.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.080
 It can get something like 18 miles really quickly just through an explosion.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080
 But because of the...

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.080
 What?

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.080
 I don't know, as I say, I sort of like...

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.640
 For instance, the Soviets were going to use nuclear bombs to open up waterways in the

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.080
 north of Russia, for instance.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.840
 So that has been thought of in the past, used nuclear for...

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.000
 Oh, no one tell one of those stupid billionaires, they're just going to do it.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.120
 And what would happen, though, is that the surrounding casing of the hole would have

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.200
 fused into this glass like substance as well.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.120
 So it would be like a really amazing slide, like almost immediately.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.920
 You've been spending too much time in soft places, has there?

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.080
 Not coming to your soft places.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:19.080
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:23.480
 My fact this week is that the actor John Candy was born on Halloween.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.480
 Pretty.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.720
 Okay, it's time for fact number four, and his name's Candy.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.720
 His name's Candy.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.800
 And what do you get on Halloween?

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800
 There you go.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:37.000
 Was he called John Skeleton Candy?

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Terrifying.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 I wish.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.240
 Yeah, so John Candy, most of you should know him.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.240
 The Candyman.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.240
 Well, no.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.240
 John Candyman.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.240
 The man, John Candy.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.240
 He was in Cool Runnings.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240
 He was in Cool Runnings.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.240
 He was in Plain Trains and Automobiles.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.240
 He was in Uncle Buck.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:57.800
 He's one of the greatest comedy actors that Canada has ever produced.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.000
 And I found this, by the way, in a really great book I'm reading at the moment called Wild

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.280
 and Crazy Guys, which is all about that period of when SNL and America exploded, so he had

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.340
 Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy and John Belushi and Chevy

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.340
 Chase and so on.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:15.600
 And John Candy, obviously a big player in that area.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.080
 And yeah, so it's just a little detail in that book, and I thought I'd love to talk

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.080
 about John Candy.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.080
 Great.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.080
 Well, we're not going to.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.520
 Yep, let's move on to the types of Candy.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.800
 Also born on Halloween, John Keats.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.800
 Yes.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:32.080
 So who in that episode, I think I might have mentioned, was possibly a grave robber, John

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.720
 Keats, because he was a medical student, and at that time they needed bodies to do their

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.800
 experiments on, and possibly he could have been one of the body stealers.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.920
 Add Rock of the Beastie Boys.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920
 Oh, yay.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920
 Beastie Boys.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920
 Nice.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.920
 Yeah.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.920
 Yeah.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:56.720
 Sydney Park, who's an actor from The Walking Dead, born on Halloween, and Kirk Noble Blutsworth,

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:02.520
 who was the first American census to death to be exonerated post-conviction, so was supposed

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.160
 to be executed and then turned out DNA testing meant that he hadn't done it.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.160
 So he got off.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.960
 And the Halloween link is that he's got blood, doesn't he?

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.960
 Death.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.960
 Oh yeah, blood.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.960
 Yeah.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.960
 Get off.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.960
 Come on, that was really stretching.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.960
 Yeah.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.960
 Yeah, I felt the stretch.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.960
 That's an afternoon twerk.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.960
 Yeah.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.240
 But it's unusual, because fewer people are born on Halloween than on other days around

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.240
 the year.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.760
 Hang on, or push through, or find a way.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.800
 It's just really miserable in February, it seemed the obvious.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.800
 It's January and I'm really miserable.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.800
 Do I not have sex that way?

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.800
 Oh, so good news.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.280
 I was like, Jenny doesn't know when Halloween is.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.280
 Well, actually, in February, that is one of the most common days.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.560
 Valentine's Day is a very common day for births, which is when my daughter was born actually

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:55.120
 on Valentine's Day, but there's a 3.6% increase on births in Valentine's Day.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:00.000
 And a 5.3% decrease of spontaneous births on Halloween.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.420
 Is that like the Christmas thing, where it's just that hospitals are a bit quieter and

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.420
 therefore...

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.420
 I think it's a bit of that, perhaps.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.060
 The other thing is that Caesareans is a big difference.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.060
 Right, yes.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.560
 You wouldn't not book a Caesarean for Halloween, would you?

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.560
 Well, you might not.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.200
 If you were given three dates to choose, you might decide not to go for Halloween.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.200
 Really?

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.200
 Is that...

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.200
 They'd have the emergency ones, obviously, but of course, yeah.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.200
 Oh, so don't forget that in some places, not necessarily here, but in some places,

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.760
 that's quite a big drinking night.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:32.840
 So, you may not possibly want a bunch of student meds, so yeah, that's a thing.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.840
 Wow.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.840
 That's very cool.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.840
 I love it.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.840
 Yeah.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.840
 Can we talk about candy?

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.840
 Yeah, okay.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.840
 Yeah.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.840
 Now, Dan, you've got a lot of stuff on junk.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.840
 No, I just want to quickly just say, because he died very young.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:46.720
 He was 43 when he died of a heart attack, and he was, you know, he was in Home Alone.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.720
 He was in...

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.120
 There's so many seminal movies of the '90s that he was in.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.200
 He was known as Sweet Tooth when he was a kid, so he did love candy as well as he was

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.200
 growing up.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.200
 All kids loved candy.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.200
 All kids loved candy, but he was called John Candy, and he was called Sweet Tooth.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.400
 Are they all called Candy or Sweet Tooth?

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.400
 No.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.320
 He wanted to be a sports star.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.360
 That was his big thing, and so he had an injury, which meant that he couldn't do that.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.360
 He played American football, right?

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.800
 Yeah, he played American football, so he had the physique, which was trained to be someone

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.160
 who was going to play that game.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.480
 So, all the cast members of Saturday Night Live and all the other things he did always

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.080
 used to say that if you saw John Candy and you approached him, people like Dan Aykroyd

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:29.440
 say this, he would lift you up with one hand vertically and spin you around like a pizza

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.440
 with being prepared.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.440
 What?

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.440
 Yeah.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.440
 He used to...

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.280
 Every once said that if you saw John Candy, he would lift you up with one hand, hold you

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.400
 above his head, and spin you around.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.280
 First of all, American footballers don't do that.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.280
 No.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.280
 True.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.720
 But the point is, is that he had a physique whereby lots of other people say that one

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.040
 of their favorite things to do was to act like an NFL ball, and if John Candy came into

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.040
 the room...

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.040
 He'd throw it at him.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.040
 300 yards.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.040
 No, they would run at him, jump at him, tuck, and he would catch them as if they were an

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.040
 NFL ball.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.040
 Come on.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040
 And these are grown adults.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.040
 You know, Aykroyd's six foot three.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.040
 He was an offensive lineman in American football, I read.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.040
 Right.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.760
 So, that means that he's basically a blocker.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.520
 You give the ball to your quarterback who's trying to do something, and he's trying to

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.200
 stop everyone from coming towards him.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.200
 So, he must have been big.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.200
 He was.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.200
 He was a...

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.200
 Yeah, he was tall.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.200
 I mean, he was six foot three himself.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.200
 He was a big guy, but he was also just, he was physically ready to catch humans.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.200
 Yeah.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.840
 I just don't think any of that stuff happened.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.840
 He did?

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.840
 He did?

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.840
 Multiple people said it.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.840
 Like, it's not like...

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.840
 It's a...

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.840
 Yeah, like a fan saying it.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.840
 I do actually...

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.560
 To be fair, I was looking a little bit at John Candy.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.000
 I did read that if, like, if you ran at him, he would put you on a big wooden pallet and

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.400
 he'd slide you into an oven.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.400
 Horrible.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.400
 It's just...

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.400
 Like, I think they're exaggerating the story.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.120
 They're just, these are the stories, these are the stories they say.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.120
 Maybe it was Gingerbread.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.320
 Should we talk about Candy?

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.000
 Yeah, yeah, John Candy.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 Oh my God.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 No, no, no, no.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.680
 Well, I'll just say one really sweet thing is that when he died, again, he was very young.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.920
 He had a heart attack while he was making a movie in New Mexico.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.440
 Did he die from the atomic bomb?

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.080
 Oh, was he in that movie that Andy was talking about where people had a heart attack?

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.080
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.080
 Wow.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.080
 He had a heart attack on everyone.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:19.240
 But he had a funeral at Sunset Boulevard and then they went down to the cemetery and

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.520
 they took the 405 three-way and it was completely clear.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.760
 They had no idea why it was completely clear and what it turned out was is that the highway

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:32.440
 patrol had stopped all road access to anything but this and it was their choice to do that

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.560
 and it was them tipping their hat to say, "We loved you and we miss you," and it's because

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.040
 in ten of his movies, and, you know, he didn't live that long so it's a short time he made

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.040
 these movies.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.320
 He played a law enforcement officer in ten of these movies and so they felt like there

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.120
 was a friend that they'd lost, you know, one of them, yeah.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.120
 Anyway, RIP John Candy.

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.320
 I know I'm a bit late in saying it but, yeah, condolences to the family.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.480
 All right, do your candy now, your actual candy.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.160
 Andy, give us some candy.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.360
 I was just thinking, Jenny, you're from a great confectionary nation, Scotland.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.360
 I am, yes.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.360
 We have some tunics on the table.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.360
 We have some tunics in front.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.360
 It's very exciting.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.040
 Very good at not diving in, I feel that.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.040
 I'm opening one now.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.040
 Okay, correct.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.040
 I might do it as well, yeah.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.760
 Okay, when everyone's finished, okay, so get this.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.960
 This is a sort of scientific thing about sugar.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.840
 People who are from Northern Europe are some of the most sugar sensitive people in the

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.480
 world and there might be a proper, an evolutionary reason for this.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.480
 What do you mean by sensitive?

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.600
 Do you mean as in it's bad for us or we react to it?

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.120
 No, as in it can detect it, can detect it more easily.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.640
 So this is really interesting.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:42.040
 There are particular variations in a sugar-sensing gene and people from Northern latitudes have

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:47.760
 that more than people who live in tropical areas and the theory is, one theory is, that

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.320
 it's not certain, obviously, but in higher latitudes, really sweet fruit and veg are

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.040
 a bit less common and they're necessary to survive.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.560
 It's not like in tropical regions where you have really sugary sweet things and it's easy

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.720
 to find them and survive.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.640
 So maybe if you move north, you will benefit from having that sensitivity.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.960
 If carrots and parsnips are quite sweet, but if you can't detect that, then you might

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.040
 not realise and you might not grow those foods or you might not seek them out and you'll

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.480
 be less likely to survive.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.920
 So Jenny, you're from further north and the rest of us are on this table, do you feel

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.920
 that that's true?

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:27.160
 I'm very wary of things that feel true, but that does actually kind of feel true and

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.760
 whilst it's kind of touching in a way, it's also horrendous that the number one operation

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.640
 performed in children in Scotland is tooth extraction.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.640
 Wow.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:36.640
 There is it.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:41.600
 I read that you know how dogs are good at detecting things, we might come on to that

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.600
 later.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.600
 Oh yeah.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.120
 But everyone thinks that dogs have got amazing smell compared to humans.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.640
 We say do, but it's for certain chemicals and for certain chemicals, humans are better

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:56.000
 and I think, for instance, if you were to put a bar of chocolate in the middle of a field

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.440
 and train the human to look for it and train the dog to look for it, the human might come

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.440
 out on top.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.440
 Wow.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.760
 So you're looking for sugar and looking for fats and stuff like that, yeah.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760
 That's so cool.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.760
 I don't know if that's true.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.160
 We might come on to that later.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:14.760
 Do you know, I was looking for what's the most popular candy, I hate that word.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.760
 Do you say sweets?

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.760
 Sweets.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.280
 So my husband says lollies because he's from New Zealand and my children say bombo because

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.280
 they're from France.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.280
 Right.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:27.360
 Sorry, can I just stop and just, I think the way that you're eating this tonic's too

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.360
 big to me.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.360
 Yeah.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.360
 You do it upside down too.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.360
 No, that's how I have it.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.360
 It's basically what my only fan says.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.560
 So Jenny has taken, if you know what a teacake is, it's marshmallow with a bit of biscuit

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.960
 on the bottom or cake covered in chocolate.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:47.360
 Jenny has sort of separated the cake and the marshmallow and it's starting to-

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.680
 I'm now terribly self-conscious.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:54.160
 You're like turning it into a naked burger where you just take the buns off and leave

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.160
 them on the side.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.000
 Well, you know, just shoving it all in my go up doesn't work very well.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Jenny, I'll do the same thing.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 There we go.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Do you?

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.640
 You've just been into it.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.640
 No, I haven't.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.640
 I've done it carefully.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.640
 I know what I'm doing.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.640
 I debase it.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.200
 And by the way, I have this family here from Scotland as well.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.200
 Exactly.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.200
 You know, the old skills.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.200
 They kick in.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.200
 Genetic.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.280
 I'm just speaking about tea stuff, Jenny.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.600
 This is an interesting thing.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.120
 Candy Floss was popularised by a dentist.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.120
 Interesting.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:27.440
 Actually, do you know when you were talking about John Candy, you know, nominal to determinism

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.320
 how tedious it is because it makes us all look like really boring humans.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.000
 Literally made us our fortune on this podcast.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.280
 We get a lot of correspondence about it.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.280
 So please be careful.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.880
 Like the inbox will just be recovering from the Doctor Who onslaught.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.840
 Well, I was only going to say, and I think, I hope this is not too controversial because

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:50.000
 it is true, that dentists, first names are vastly over-represented by for women, Denise,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.200
 and for men, Dennis.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.200
 That's so good.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.200
 That's so nice.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:58.600
 It's just such a kind of, you're a big meat sack, takes the easiest route out of it that

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.760
 you can possibly think of, human.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.640
 It was called Fairy Floss at the time.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.640
 Yeah.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.360
 I just wanted to say it was William J. Morrison teamed up with a Nashville confectioner in

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.600
 1897.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.720
 And despite being president of the Tennessee State Dental Association, no small thing.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.720
 Was he trying to drill up more business?

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.720
 Drill up.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.720
 Very good, James.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.720
 Nice.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.720
 That's crazy.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.520
 I've got to be the one to acknowledge how good it was.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.720
 Who's ever really drilled up in that sense?

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.720
 Nobody.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:28.720
 Oh, God.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.520
 I don't know what came up and be that.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.520
 Yeah.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.160
 You didn't even give us time not to laugh.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.160
 Drill up, dude.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:40.360
 Do you know what Candy Floss is in Greek?

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.240
 Oh, no I don't, actually.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.440
 Well, it translates as old woman's hair.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.440
 Oh.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.640
 Because it's wispy.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.640
 Yes.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.960
 And in Afrikaans, I love this, it's ghost breath.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.960
 Lovely.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.960
 Yeah.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.840
 Do you know what the Mexican term for eye candy is, if you say a little bit about a candy?

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.840
 No.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.840
 Eye taco.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840
 Stop it.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.840
 It is.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.840
 It's eye taco.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:07.360
 That sounds like a new Apple product, isn't it?

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.280
 The revolutionary eye taco after just six hours of charging, you could enjoy the taco

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.840
 for ten minutes.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:20.400
 I was reading about my favorite confectionery, which is popping candy, which I genuinely

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.200
 think is completely underused in the world, and I think you should really pretty much

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.960
 put it on everything.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:32.360
 And it was invented by a guy who was trying to make an instant soft drink.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.600
 This is amazing.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.400
 So he's trying to make something like, let's say Coca-Cola.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.160
 And what his idea was, he wanted something like cordial.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.720
 You would have something and you would pour the water on it, and then when the water comes

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.040
 in, it turns automatically into a fizzy drink.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:51.320
 And so he got some sugar and he heated it up really, really high, put it under a load

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.280
 of pressure, added a load of gas into it, and then cooled it down.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.800
 And in theory, what a great idea.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.160
 As soon as you put the water in, the gas will get released and it will be really fizzy.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.360
 It didn't work.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.680
 That's so cool though.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:07.280
 But he started eating it and it gave him these sort of explosions in his mouth.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:15.520
 So his experiments went wrong and he went, I'll just stick it in my mouth.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.520
 Good science.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.520
 That's so cool.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.360
 And then everyone, all of the other people in his office saw this was happening.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.360
 They used to have competitions see how much they could put in the mouth of this stuff.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.200
 They would get bigger and bigger rocks of it and see how much they could do.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:34.440
 But immediately, as soon as they went on sale, pop rocks, they called in America, there was

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.760
 rumours that children's stomachs were exploding.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.760
 The first fatality was, yeah, it was all over the place.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:48.400
 And the pop rocks company had to take out full page advertisements in more than 40 publications

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:53.440
 around the country to say, these will not make your child explode, honestly.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:58.520
 And the head of the company wrote 50,000 letters to school principals saying, can you

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.880
 please stop banning these things?

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.880
 Marketing genius.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.880
 Yeah.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.880
 That's amazing.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.520
 You almost certainly won't kill your kids.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.520
 Bring it.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.080
 Does anybody want to hear my worst Japanese Kit Kat flavor?

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.440
 You know, there's now over 300.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.440
 Yeah.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.440
 Okay, wow.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.000
 And I was looking down the list and there's some pretty bad ones in there, I think, European

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 cheese.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 Oh.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 Wow.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 What is European cheese?

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.640
 There's no such thing as European cheese.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.920
 I believe the Dutch would like a word with you.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:33.800
 Sorry, there are European cheeses, but there is not one archetypal European cheese.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.800
 There are hundreds.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.160
 But I guess in Japan, you might lump a sort of yellow pungent cheese as a European cheese,

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.160
 right?

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.160
 Yeah, because American cheese.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.160
 Like, dairy's not that big in Japan, right?

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.160
 Yeah.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.160
 Or China.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.680
 Well, American cheese comes in single shrink-wrapped slice form.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.760
 Yes, but it's different types of cheese.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.440
 But that's, but what, no, no, sorry, no, no, no, I'm not having it.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.440
 Here's the thing.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.400
 This is something interesting, I think, and I might butcher this, but I'll try my best.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:05.480
 So when cheese first came to Japan, because it wasn't traditionally eaten over there,

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:11.680
 they called it something like dairy tofu, something like that.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:16.360
 And when tofu first came to France, they called it soya cheese.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.360
 Brilliant.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.360
 I think that's right.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.560
 That's really good.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.680
 That's distracted me from my anger about the European cheese.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.680
 Thank you.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.700
 I was going to say, James always manages to find a fact to calm you down.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:25.700
 It's really dramatic.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:26.700
 Yeah.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.700
 Get two on top of it.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:28.700
 Yeah.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:33.720
 Have you guys ever had an aniseed ball?

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.720
 Yeah.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.720
 No.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:36.720
 What's that?

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.720
 What's that tiny bit in the middle?

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.720
 Right.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.720
 Is that what you're going to tell us?

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.720
 No.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.720
 That's an aniseed seed.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.720
 I think it is.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:44.720
 Can you describe it to me?

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.720
 I don't know.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.960
 So it's a small, round, purple ball, very, very hard, and it's layer after layer of slightly

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.960
 flavored licorice.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.960
 It's horrible.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.960
 Boiled.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.480
 Yeah, they're very unpopular with lots.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.480
 They're quite 1930s.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.480
 Not gobstoppers.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.120
 No, it's like a very small gobstopper.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.500
 But it's quite strong tasting and aniseed, right?

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.500
 So, okay.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.500
 This is very cool.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.940
 They slightly helped to win the Second World War, aniseed balls.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.940
 Brilliant.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:12.080
 In 1939, the War Office, they wanted to build a limpid mind that you could stick to the

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.340
 hull of the ship, swim away from, and it detonates later, right?

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.300
 And the War Office, they contacted a science magazine editor called Stuart McCrae, and

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.140
 he contacted someone he knew, an inventor called Cecil Clark, who was also a caravan

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.140
 maker.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.140
 Detail.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.800
 They started working together, right?

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.380
 They had the details of the mine, and they had the explosive, and they had the way to

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.560
 attach it to the ship, so they were doing really well.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:38.540
 But what they needed was something to keep apart the hammer and the detonator, right?

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.680
 So that when you're swimming up, when you're a frogman swimming up, you attach the mine,

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.680
 and you prime it.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.680
 It doesn't go off immediately.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:50.520
 So you need something that slowly dissolves and separates the hammer and the detonator.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.200
 And Clark's kids were eating aniseed balls, and they tried them out, and they found they

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.880
 dissolved in about half an hour in water.

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.960
 But you didn't have to suck the grenade.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.960
 No.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.320
 Yeah, it's a mouth activated.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:09.520
 So Clark and McCrae, they bought every aniseed ball in Bedford, right?

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.120
 Because they're for their experiments.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.840
 But the problem was they also needed something to keep the aniseed ball dry until the mine

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.200
 was in place, right?

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.080
 So they also went around buying all the condoms in Bedford.

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:29.760
 Imagine getting to the supermarket checkout, you just got a trolley full of condoms and

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.760
 aniseed balls.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.640
 Clark said we got a completely undeserved reputation as sexual athletes because we

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.640
 were...

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.640
 But they worked.

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:41.320
 The aniseed balls worked in this mine, and the MAD commissioned them, the War Office

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.600
 commissioned them, and they started buying aniseed balls directly from the manufacturer.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.600
 And I love this.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:49.840
 Clark also commissioned some miniature condoms from a rubber factory to cover the firing

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.840
 mechanism.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:57.040
 Imagine if it's the pharmacist to begin with going, "Do you have any smaller condoms?"

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.040
 I got smaller.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.960
 No, I got smaller than that.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:06.920
 I love how we've gone from like the biggest bomb the world has ever known.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:15.000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 My fact is that there are only three newt-detecting dogs on the planet.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 Brilliant.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 Yeah.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:30.320
 This is a woman called Nicola Jane Glover, she's a dog owner, and she's got a spaniel

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.440
 called Freya, and another dog called Newtky.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:37.600
 And this was in an article in The Guardian recently, but it's actually been going on

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:42.960
 for a few years, so I think at least in 2018 Freya was detecting newts.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.120
 And the reason you need to detect newts is that there's a species called the great crested

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:51.200
 Newt which is protected, and if you're developing land you have to show that there are no newts

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.640
 there, because they don't want to endanger them, and it's really hard to find them, because

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.840
 they spend a lot of their time underground and in the water, because they're amphibious.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:04.240
 So Nicola Glover, she and her colleagues, they trained Freya, the spaniel, to detect

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.480
 live newts, and Freya can do it really, really well now, 90% detection rate.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:15.360
 And it's a good method of saving the newt and saving a lot of time and fuss, and newt

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.360
 detection work.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.200
 And the other thing about this story, although there's a third one, who's Rocky from Flintshire,

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.880
 who was also trained separately in 2020, there was a correction in The Guardian article about

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.880
 the dogs, which I think you saw, Jenny.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.880
 This article was amended.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:34.000
 An earlier version said that great crested Newts reached an adult overall length of 17

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 metres.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.480
 I thought that's the one I read, and I thought, well, why do you need a dog?

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:46.480
 It should have been 17 centimetres.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:52.800
 Yeah, I read an article from 2011 that said that they were starting to do this with the

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:59.520
 crested Newts, but also desert tortoises, kiwis, cacopos, bats, cheetahs, I don't know why.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.480
 Brown tree snakes, seals, and bed bugs.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.900
 So dogs were being taught to look for all these things for various different reasons.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.480
 The cheetahs, I think they're looking for the scat for the poo.

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.480
 Not actual.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.480
 Not actual.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.160
 Oh, one went past about five minutes ago.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.160
 Who's a dog person?

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.160
 Who's a cat person?

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.160
 I'm a dog.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.160
 You're a cat person?

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.160
 Yeah.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:23.080
 It's not a bit embarrassing when someone goes, oh, my dog just discovered the ancient caves

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.080
 at Lussel.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.240
 And you're like, yeah, my cat ate a curtain.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:31.120
 Yeah, my cat doesn't give a fuck.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.880
 Yeah, I mean, I would say I'm probably not really either, but I've had cats forced upon

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.880
 me, so.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:43.280
 But I went following the story in terms of things dogs do unbelievable stuff all the

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.280
 time.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.280
 Yeah.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.280
 You're a dog person, aren't you?

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.280
 Yeah, but my dogs are crap.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.280
 They're absolutely rubbish.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.280
 You've got dogs.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.280
 I've got two dogs.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.280
 Each idiot.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.320
 Fight seals on a regular basis.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.320
 Fight seals.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.320
 Successfully.

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.320
 There's a lot of seals where we live.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.320
 Wow.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.320
 That's so cool.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.320
 Yeah.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.800
 Well, it's not cool because the seals just go, see you later, and swim off, and then

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.240
 you have to go and rescue your dog, who's the moron.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:09.240
 But maybe you've not given them the chance to work out if they're like semen sniffing

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.240
 dogs or if they are.

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.240
 Jesus.

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.240
 That's on my list.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.240
 That's on my list.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:18.240
 Why would you, that's the first on your list to say.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.240
 That just was fast.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.240
 Give me back up a little.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.760
 Is that what you say to anyone who's walking a dog in the park?

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.760
 You're like, have you ever given it a chance to be a semen sniffing dog?

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:31.760
 I've got a pocket full of amethyst balls, I've got another pocket full of mini cundoms.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.760
 You've got a semen sniffing dog.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.760
 Let's talk.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.760
 Is that with an A?

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.760
 Are you spelling that with an A?

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.760
 No, I don't think that is, no.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.760
 No, no, no.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.760
 Jenny, you write romantic novels, don't you?

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.760
 Have you ever had a semen sniffing dog?

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.760
 It's raining months just here for the inspiration.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.760
 Hang on.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.760
 Tight, tight, tight.

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:58.760
 She was a girl from the city with a semen sniffing dog and a heart of gold.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.760
 So, okay.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:04.760
 It's used for, you know, I mean, unfortunately it's used for terrible, terrible reasons.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.760
 Yeah, for crimes and so on.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.760
 But that's an important thing.

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:14.760
 They need to sometimes have a dog detect whether or not someone might have recently have left

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.760
 some semen out because it can find the traces on it.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:22.760
 And it can detect as little as 0.016 millilitres of seminal fluid.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.760
 So, they're very good at it.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:31.760
 So, what I'm saying is your dog might not have been given the chance to show that it could smell semen

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.760
 or find whale poo because they do that as well.

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.760
 They sit on boats and they can find whale.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.760
 I see clever dogs like Spaniels.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.760
 Spaniels are like real teacher pleasers.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.760
 Oh yeah, right.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.760
 Pairs and they're cool.

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.760
 One of your ducks.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:47.760
 Kind of just terrifying half-cougar things that we found in the laba.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.760
 But I must.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.760
 No, they're terriers.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:51.760
 Oh, okay, okay.

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.760
 So, but they're kind of, they're theoretically ratters.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.760
 But they're just a bit rubbish.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.760
 What does that fit in your...

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.760
 I'd need to see a photo.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.760
 There's a game called Hound Pooch or Mutt.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.760
 Almost any dog fits into those categories.

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:06.760
 Oh, Hounds, they're Hounds.

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.760
 They're Hounds.

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.760
 Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.760
 When Melvis sang "You Ain't Nothing but a Hound Dog", he was playing that game, wasn't he?

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.760
 He'd already recorded a version called "You Ain't Nothing but a Pooch Dog".

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.760
 I don't think it's rubbish.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:23.760
 There was an interesting story about a man I'd never heard of, really, really amazing.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.760
 He was a German diplomat.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.760
 He was sort of sided on the side of the Nazis at the time.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.760
 And he was an attaché for the Nazis.

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.760
 He's called George Ferdinand Duckwitz.

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.760
 Duckwitz.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.760
 Must have had a rough time at school.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:40.760
 Ferdinand Duckwitz is asking for a spoonerism, isn't he?

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:41.760
 Yeah.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.760
 He's an amazing character.

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.760
 He sits in the world of Oscar Schindler.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:50.760
 He was someone who helped to save a lot of refugees who were stuck in Denmark.

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:56.760
 And supposedly 95% of their Jewish population was successfully taken out of the country

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.760
 to a safe place in Sweden because of this guy.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.760
 And he risked his life to do it.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.760
 So he's an amazing character.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.760
 Oh, and you called him a fuckwit, James.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:10.760
 Oh, okay.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.760
 Sorry, Duckwitz, yeah, yeah.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.760
 I'm not going to trivialise his memory.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.760
 Not well done, James.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:23.760
 Okay, so where's the dog coming in here?

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.760
 The dog comes in here because when they were taking them out on all the boats

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.760
 and they were hiding them in the cargo,

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.760
 a lot of dogs had been trained up in order to sniff out any humans that were on board.

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.760
 So this is a problem that they had.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:37.760
 So what they did was they came up with an idea that they could deceive the sniffer dogs

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.760
 by placing seamen in there.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.760
 You were giving me that look like it was heading there.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.760
 They created what was a mixture of dried rabbit blood and cocaine.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.760
 And they gave it to the fishermen.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.760
 They gave it to the fishermen.

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.760
 Who would coat it in handkerchiefs.

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:56.760
 And then they would hold the handkerchiefs and the dogs would race towards the handkerchief.

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.760
 They would ignore any of the other smells that were on the boat.

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:04.760
 And so as a result, they would have no other interest in what was going on here.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.760
 And that would become the main focus.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:07.760
 Why the cocaine?

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.760
 I mean, rabbit blood, I guess, dogs.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:14.760
 Well, rabbit blood is to attract them and the cocaine is to not interest it.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.760
 When they're talking about themselves.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.760
 I can tell you about some rabbits.

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.760
 I caught a lot of big rabbits.

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.760
 A lot of great rabbits.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.760
 It supposedly temporarily would knock out their smell.

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:28.760
 Wow.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.760
 God, that's so clever.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:31.760
 That's amazing.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.760
 Yeah, so he's a huge hero.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.760
 He saved 7,200 Jewish refugees.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:36.760
 Wow.

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.760
 Can I say something about the great crested mute?

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:39.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.760
 Right.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.760
 So they have a very colourful belly.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.760
 Okay.

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.760
 No one really knows why they've got a colourful belly.

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:53.760
 If you're a mute and you're colourful, often it's because you want people to know you're toxic.

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.760
 And it turns out they are toxic.

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.760
 They're warts containing chemicals.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:05.760
 And there was a naturalist called Eleanor Ormerod who tested it by biting a live mute's tail.

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:09.760
 Just the tail and the tails will grow back and stuff.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.760
 And then she recorded all of her symptoms.

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.760
 So she was foaming at the mouth.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.760
 She had shivering fits.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.760
 And so she proved that they were toxic.

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:23.760
 It's a lot of scientists putting stuff in their mouths.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.760
 So we found out that they are toxic.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.760
 But the weird thing is they're nutes.

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:32.760
 So they walk around a lot with their belly pointing to the ground.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.760
 And so no predators can see their bellies anyway.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:40.760
 And so no one knows still to this day why they have a colourful belly.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.760
 That is so strange.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.760
 Are you sure it wouldn't?

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.760
 Moles and stuff come up and eat them.

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.760
 The moles?

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.760
 Yeah.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.760
 They swim.

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:49.760
 They swim.

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:50.760
 They swim.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:53.760
 So maybe fish from the predators.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.760
 But you're right.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.760
 Normally you'd feel like birds would be descending on them.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.760
 Eleanor Ormerod anyway.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.760
 She's really famous.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.760
 She's an agricultural entomologist.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.760
 Because she was living in Victorian times.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:07.760
 So couldn't really be a professional scientist in those days if you're a woman.

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.760
 But she found a kind of a role where she could use her skills

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.760
 and apply them to agriculture.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.760
 So you know like if people's crops are dying she could say

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.760
 well you should get rid of these nutes.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.760
 So you should get rid of these moles or whatever.

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.760
 Stuff like that.

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.760
 And she was so famous that Virginia Woolf wrote a story about her

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.760
 called Miss Ormerod which is named after her.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.760
 Just a pretty cool person.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.760
 That's very cool.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:34.760
 Things women had to do to be scientists in those days.

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:35.760
 I know, I know.

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.760
 She's going to bite this mute.

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.760
 We know it's poisonous.

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.760
 But we don't know how poisonous.

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.760
 So Eleanor if you could...

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.760
 I'm going to mention one last thing before we wrap up.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.760
 I don't know if it's useful but just in case you're wondering

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.760
 we've been talking a lot about dogs sniffing humans.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:53.760
 And I discovered that there's a job whereby you as a human can sniff a dog.

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.760
 Are we looking for the dog or is that the idea?

00:56:58.760 --> 00:56:59.760
 No.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.760
 Is it a chocolate lab?

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:07.760
 This is for people who work in factories that are making dog food.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:12.760
 Because one of the things that owners hate about dog food

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.760
 is the breath that it can leave on their dog.

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.760
 And they make a very concerted effort not to make food

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.760
 where chemicals are altering the smell of the mouth of a dog

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:22.760
 so that it's very pongy.

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.760
 So one of the jobs that if you work in one of these factories

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.760
 is to go up and sniff dogs mouths

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:32.760
 who are experimenting with new tastes and new formulas and so on.

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.760
 And then if a dog has ejaculated recently you can...

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.760
 No, not that.

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.760
 I just love how excited the dogs were to get their jobs.

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.760
 I'm a taster at a dog food factory.

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.760
 The other dogs let go.

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.760
 Well that sounds awesome.

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.760
 That sounds cool.

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.760
 So they sniff you?

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.760
 God, that's so...

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.760
 That's not a lovely job, I think.

00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:55.760
 Can I ask another question?

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.760
 You won't know the answer to this, but you might.

00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.760
 It's not just important, presumably, that their breath doesn't smell.

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.760
 You don't want their farts to smell bad.

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, really good point.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.760
 You don't want that on the other side.

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.760
 So do you not have someone whose job is to smell all the dog farts?

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.760
 I do.

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:11.760
 It feels like you must.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.760
 You must, right?

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.760
 It's probably...

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.760
 You must.

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760
 I think he's right.

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.760
 It's probably the unspoken astro.

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.760
 That's what they tell you once you've got the gig.

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.760
 That's by the way.

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.760
 There's a second hatch over there.

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.760
 That's what that one happened.

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:35.760
 Okay, that's it.

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:36.760
 That is all of our facts.

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.760
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:42.760
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.760
 we can all be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.760
 I'm on @Sribeland, James.

 @JamesHarken.

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.760

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:49.760
 @AndrewHunterM.

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.760
 And Jenny.

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.760
 @JennyKolgan.

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:52.760
 Yep.

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:57.760
 Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing, or our website, NoSuchThing, asafish.com.

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.760
 All of our previous episodes are up there.

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.760
 And just a quick reminder, Jenny, your latest book is out now.

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.760
 It is.

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.760
 It's called The Summer Skies.

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:07.760
 The Summer Skies.

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:10.760
 And of course, all of Jenny's other books are available to buy as well.

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.760
 And so do check them out and also check out her Doctor Who stuff as well.

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.760
 There's numerous Jenny Colgan books that are out there and audio adventures.

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.760
 Jenny M. Colgan is the--

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:21.760
 Jenny T. Colgan.

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:22.760
 Jenny T.

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:25.760
 Is the pseudonym, if you want to look for those.

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:30.760
 So yeah, also we are playing a live show for Fish on the 14th of September at Kings Place,

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:32.760
 part of the London Podcast Festival.

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.760
 And we're going to be live streaming it.

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:40.760
 You're able to buy live stream tickets for that by going to NoSuchThingAsafish.com/podfest.

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:41.760
 Check out tickets there.

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.760
 And of course, check out Club Fish.

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:47.760
 It's our secret members club where we do all sort of bonus extras, compilations.

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:52.760
 Drop us a line, which Andy does, which is a show where we go through all the correspondence that you've sent in.

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:53.760
 It's a really comfy place.

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:54.760
 My doctor is probably--

00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:57.760
 But that's it.

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.760
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.760
 We'll see you then.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.760
 Goodbye.
