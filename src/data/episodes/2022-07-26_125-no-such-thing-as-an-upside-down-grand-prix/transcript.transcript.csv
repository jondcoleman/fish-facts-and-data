00:00:11,00:00:16,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish, a Weekly Podcast"""
00:00:16,00:00:19,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:19,00:00:20,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:20,00:00:24,"I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andy Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:24,00:00:28,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:28,00:00:34,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy."
00:00:34,00:00:41,"My fact is that 18th century hairstyles included the Spaniels' ears, mad dog, and the drowned"
00:00:41,00:00:42,chicken.
00:00:42,00:00:45,These are all do's that you could get.
00:00:45,00:00:46,And do we know what they look like?
00:00:46,00:00:51,"I haven't been able to find what these ones look like, no, but there are so many insane"
00:00:51,00:00:52,styles.
00:00:52,00:00:53,I suppose we can imagine what a drowned chicken looks like.
00:00:53,00:00:54,Yeah.
00:00:54,00:00:57,And it's hard to imagine that that would be a desirable hairstyle with some kind of
00:00:57,00:00:58,punishment.
00:00:58,00:01:03,"Yeah, a dog as well, it's bad hair basically, but you're drooling."
00:01:03,00:01:04,Yeah.
00:01:04,00:01:08,The Spaniels' ears is that a hairstyle that you see loads in 18th century paintings where
00:01:08,00:01:11,women have their hair flex on top and then curled down the sides.
00:01:11,00:01:12,Oh.
00:01:12,00:01:13,I don't know what it looks like.
00:01:13,00:01:14,It looks like you've got a Spaniels' ears.
00:01:14,00:01:19,"There's also, there were two others around that time called, one was called ""The Chest"
00:01:19,00:01:23,"of Draws"", and the other one was called ""Sportsman in the Bush""."
00:01:23,00:01:24,Nice.
00:01:24,00:01:25,I don't know what that was.
00:01:25,00:01:26,What did that entail?
00:01:26,00:01:32,"It'd be so fun to, if time travel was ever cracked, go back, not look into what it was, and"
00:01:32,00:01:34,just ask for that sit down and see what you get.
00:01:34,00:01:36,That would be such a cool dare.
00:01:36,00:01:37,So exciting.
00:01:37,00:01:38,Yeah.
00:01:38,00:01:40,"The loads of really fancy styles, particularly in France."
00:01:40,00:01:46,And I did read a theory that the French Revolution was partly caused by Marie Antoinette's
00:01:46,00:01:47,crazy hair.
00:01:47,00:01:48,OK.
00:01:48,00:01:49,Really?
00:01:49,00:01:54,"Well, she had a royal hairdresser called Leonard O.T., and he made these incredibly fancy"
00:01:54,00:01:59,"hairdos for her, with a few other people, and the ladies of the court all followed suit."
00:01:59,00:02:04,And that led to some of the earliest attacks on Marie Antoinette in pamphlet form.
00:02:04,00:02:09,"So obviously, it wasn't the entire cause, but it was, like, a symptom, basically."
00:02:09,00:02:15,"I guess it represented her wealth compared to that one, actually, not wealth."
00:02:15,00:02:16,Yeah.
00:02:16,00:02:19,"The most famous is the coffeeer, Albele Poul, which is a French ship."
00:02:19,00:02:23,And it had just beaten an English ship very heavily in a battle.
00:02:23,00:02:25,And so she got the ship in her hair.
00:02:25,00:02:26,"Not the actual ship, though."
00:02:26,00:02:27,Yeah.
00:02:27,00:02:28,The full thing.
00:02:28,00:02:29,Very impressive.
00:02:29,00:02:34,"Did they shape her hair into the shape of a boat, or did they, like, construct it with plywood?"
00:02:34,00:02:39,"What you do is you get your hair, and then you put a load of cushions sort of on your scalp"
00:02:39,00:02:42,"and a metal frame, and then you can build up your hair around that."
00:02:42,00:02:43,OK.
00:02:43,00:02:45,And then you put in a load of other hair as well.
00:02:45,00:02:49,"And then you put in a model of a ship, and it had rigging, and it had little model sailors"
00:02:49,00:02:50,on it.
00:02:50,00:02:54,"And the version of this that you can see, which was Elton John's 50th birthday, he went"
00:02:54,00:02:56,as Marianne Twinnett with the ship in a wig.
00:02:56,00:02:57,Really?
00:02:57,00:02:58,"It's huge, ginormous."
00:02:58,00:02:59,Wow.
00:02:59,00:03:03,And the only reason I know that is I met a prop maker who made the Holy Grail for the Indiana
00:03:03,00:03:04,Jones movie.
00:03:04,00:03:06,He also made the ship for Elton John's wig.
00:03:06,00:03:07,Really?
00:03:07,00:03:08,Yeah.
00:03:08,00:03:13,"And it came with a little pipe that went down into his clothing that every time he pressed,"
00:03:13,00:03:15,little cannons had little bits of smoke.
00:03:15,00:03:16,Shoot out of it.
00:03:16,00:03:18,So it looked like he was shooting cannons.
00:03:18,00:03:23,"So the thing is, it's apparently it was huge to carry, so just to give an idea of how heavy"
00:03:23,00:03:24,those things must have been.
00:03:24,00:03:27,Elton John realised he couldn't get to the party in a car.
00:03:27,00:03:31,"He had to go in a removals van, so it's the only way he could get to the party."
00:03:31,00:03:32,What?
00:03:32,00:03:33,"Yeah, it was so heavy."
00:03:33,00:03:34,And the driver went that wrong way.
00:03:34,00:03:37,"So they were stuck in the van for over an hour and a half, and he got so frustrated with"
00:03:37,00:03:39,"it, he tried to cancel the party."
00:03:39,00:03:42,They did use to have to dismantle their hair cells when they got into carriages.
00:03:42,00:03:45,I think Marianne Twinnett used to have someone who would have to take off the top layer
00:03:45,00:03:47,of hair so she could fit into a carriage.
00:03:47,00:03:52,"But there's loads of accounts of all this stuff, and some of them I think are not true,"
00:03:52,00:03:55,"because some of them they only have mid-19th century sources, and it's all about the late"
00:03:55,00:03:56,18th century.
00:03:56,00:04:00,"So for example, this is a story that I think is not true, because the earlier source I've"
00:04:00,00:04:05,"found is 1862, but there was a guy called Bolard, who allegedly invented a thing called"
00:04:05,00:04:10,"the mechanical quaffir, which when you press the spring, it would lower by a foot."
00:04:10,00:04:14,"If you wanted to get into a carriage, then you press the spring again and it goes up"
00:04:14,00:04:20,"and it was if you were talking to a grandmother, and you know you wanted to be respectful and"
00:04:20,00:04:22,"not have a crazy head, you could just lower it a cookie."
00:04:22,00:04:27,I would be really useful if you went to a theme park and you had to be a certain height
00:04:27,00:04:30,to get on the ride.
00:04:30,00:04:31,I'm speaking of carrying hair around.
00:04:31,00:04:35,"Obviously, your wig was a massive commodity back in the 18th century."
00:04:35,00:04:40,"I was reading about hair theft, and there's amazing accounts of what happened in the 18th"
00:04:40,00:04:44,"century, where people would be walking along, and suddenly their hair would just disappear."
00:04:44,00:04:49,"Their wig would just disappear in a crowd, and what they reckon it was were guys, who"
00:04:49,00:04:54,"were sort of tall, burly men, who were carrying a butcher's tray over their shoulder that contained"
00:04:54,00:04:59,"a small child inside the butcher's tray, and the small child would peek out, quickly grab"
00:04:59,00:05:02,"the hair, the wig, head back into the butcher's tray."
00:05:02,00:05:06,"So by the time the person turned around, there was just a burly man with the thing on his"
00:05:06,00:05:07,shoulder.
00:05:07,00:05:08,"Well, that's because wigs were really expensive."
00:05:08,00:05:09,"Yeah, right."
00:05:09,00:05:10,Incredibly expensive.
00:05:10,00:05:14,"So it wasn't really expensive to get these hairstyles done as well, and so I hadn't quite"
00:05:14,00:05:17,"realised how long they would stay in place, unless you were Mary Antoinette, who I think"
00:05:17,00:05:21,"asked for a new hairstyle every day, you put it in place, and you kept it there for a"
00:05:21,00:05:22,few weeks.
00:05:22,00:05:25,"You basically kept it there for as long as it took to go really mouldy, because the stuff"
00:05:25,00:05:29,"that they used to keep it in were things like animal fats, weren't they?"
00:05:29,00:05:32,"So I think they would end up getting really mouldy and smelly, and you'd get a lot of"
00:05:32,00:05:35,"kind of creatures in your hair, who were attracted to the substances used."
00:05:35,00:05:38,"But people would have these hairstyles in for two or three weeks, and they'd just have"
00:05:38,00:05:41,to sleep with their heads propped up on lots of pillows.
00:05:41,00:05:45,Wow. I was reading just a little bit about other fashionable things to be wearing in your
00:05:45,00:05:46,hair.
00:05:46,00:05:49,"There were things like if you're a fun woman, you'd have lots of fake butterflies in your"
00:05:49,00:05:51,hair to show that you're a fun woman.
00:05:51,00:05:55,Apparently wives of officers wore entire squadrons perched on their head to show that they
00:05:55,00:05:56,were an officer.
00:05:56,00:05:57,"Oh, sorry."
00:05:57,00:05:58,"Yeah, so not real."
00:05:58,00:05:59,"In miniature, I believe."
00:05:59,00:06:04,I would like to see a woman with a squadron of soldiers in her hair getting into a fight
00:06:04,00:06:05,with a woman who had a ship in her hair.
00:06:05,00:06:09,I'd like to see little soldiers try and get onto the ship.
00:06:09,00:06:10,That would be my target.
00:06:10,00:06:12,But you can't have infantry versus the Navy.
00:06:12,00:06:16,"I mean, it's just you can just fight, can't you, you know, in the way that there were rules"
00:06:16,00:06:17,involved.
00:06:17,00:06:19,I guess that is true.
00:06:19,00:06:23,"But if you were a general and you say, okay, there's a ship over there, I'm going to"
00:06:23,00:06:26,send my infantry out.
00:06:26,00:06:31,This is the reason I wasn't allowed into the army.
00:06:31,00:06:39,Roman brides would have their hair cut into six sections or braided into six sections.
00:06:39,00:06:45,And each of the locks had to be separated with a spear that had been used to kill a gladiator.
00:06:45,00:06:50,"And for best results, you would still have the blood of the gladiator on the spear."
00:06:50,00:06:53,The best results leave in for two and a half minutes and ensure that a dead gladiator's
00:06:53,00:06:55,blood is on the tip of your spear.
00:06:55,00:06:56,That can't be in every wedding.
00:06:56,00:06:57,"No, it wasn't."
00:06:57,00:06:59,I think it was very high society weddings.
00:06:59,00:07:00,High society weddings.
00:07:00,00:07:01,"Yeah, exactly."
00:07:01,00:07:02,"Yeah, fair enough."
00:07:02,00:07:05,"And the Puritans, they like short hair, of course."
00:07:05,00:07:10,"There was one Puritan called William Prin and he said that people who had long curly hair,"
00:07:10,00:07:18,"like mine, were unlawful, effeminate, venglorious, evil, odious, emodest, indecent, lascivious,"
00:07:18,00:07:24,"wanton, disillute, horish, ungodly, horrid, strange, outlandish, impudent, pernicious, offensive,"
00:07:24,00:07:27,"ridiculous, foolish, childish, and unchristian."
00:07:27,00:07:31,That's a fair description of you.
00:07:31,00:07:34,I don't think you're horish.
00:07:34,00:07:37,Anything else stands.
00:07:37,00:07:38,So get this.
00:07:38,00:07:39,This is very cool.
00:07:39,00:07:43,"Before hair dryers, electrical hair dryers were invented."
00:07:43,00:07:48,"What you could have was a stoneware hairdryer and it was like a hot water bottle, but for your"
00:07:48,00:07:49,hair.
00:07:49,00:07:50,Right.
00:07:50,00:07:54,So you would fill it with boiling water and then you brush it through your hair and it
00:07:54,00:07:56,urgently dries it in a few minutes.
00:07:56,00:07:57,Pretty clever.
00:07:57,00:07:58,I guess it would.
00:07:58,00:07:59,Like ironing your hair.
00:07:59,00:08:00,Have you ever ironed your hair?
00:08:00,00:08:02,"No, but I imagine that would dry it quite fast."
00:08:02,00:08:06,"I am not joking, I used to iron my sister and her friend's hair."
00:08:06,00:08:10,"We'd get an iron out and it's very hard because you've got to go quite close to the scalp,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,but it's not quite a few scarves because you don't want it to kink when it goes off the
00:08:13,00:08:14,edge of the...
00:08:14,00:08:16,"That's best result, though, is to have a little bit of your own blood through through"
00:08:16,00:08:17,the hair.
00:08:17,00:08:18,That's what I said.
00:08:18,00:08:22,"Would you try that on me later, so I look a bit less horish."
00:08:22,00:08:26,"In the 19th century, a furniture used to be covered with Macassa protectors, so Macassa"
00:08:26,00:08:30,"was the popular hair oil that was so widespread that if you invited guest rounds, you knew that"
00:08:30,00:08:32,your furniture would end up covered in it.
00:08:32,00:08:33,And so it got us on trains.
00:08:33,00:08:34,By these specials.
00:08:34,00:08:35,"Yes, and in theaters."
00:08:35,00:08:37,"Yeah, anti-macassas are called."
00:08:37,00:08:38,Yeah.
00:08:38,00:08:41,"You know, the little lazy thing on a train seat, so you can have a plane ahead."
00:08:41,00:08:42,"Behind your head, yeah."
00:08:42,00:08:46,"That's because, obviously, when you get on a train, you want to put your Macassa on so"
00:08:46,00:08:48,that you look great when you get to the other end.
00:08:48,00:08:49,I didn't know either.
00:08:49,00:08:53,"Have you noticed that whenever you get on a train, there's never any Macassa on the chair?"
00:08:53,00:08:54,Yeah.
00:08:54,00:08:55,That's due to the anti-macassas.
00:08:55,00:08:57,"Well, that makes sense now."
00:08:57,00:08:58,"Everything's falling into place for you now, then."
00:08:58,00:09:04,The entire world has basically been built around the need to avoid getting Macassa everywhere.
00:09:04,00:09:08,My favourite hair in history was the hair of Chief White Eagle.
00:09:08,00:09:11,He had the world's strongest hair.
00:09:11,00:09:17,And he used to be dangled under an aeroplane by tying his hair to the bottom of an aeroplane.
00:09:17,00:09:18,No.
00:09:18,00:09:19,"Hang on, so it would take off."
00:09:19,00:09:22,At what point do we think he discovered that he could do that?
00:09:22,00:09:27,"Well, he also jumped from planes with his hair attached to parachutes."
00:09:27,00:09:29,That is so cool.
00:09:29,00:09:32,So he would let it open and his hair was the string?
00:09:32,00:09:33,"Yeah, yeah."
00:09:33,00:09:34,I think there were also...
00:09:34,00:09:35,"Oh, parachute?"
00:09:35,00:09:36,...prisonably.
00:09:36,00:09:40,"There were longer strings attached to his hair, but his hair was basically the thing attaching"
00:09:40,00:09:41,him to the parachute.
00:09:41,00:09:42,When was this guy active?
00:09:42,00:09:43,I'm not sure.
00:09:43,00:09:44,I'm not sure.
00:09:44,00:09:45,It was early...
00:09:45,00:09:47,It sounds like he was in a military capacity.
00:09:47,00:09:48,He was hanging from planes.
00:09:48,00:09:52,He was early 20th century.
00:09:52,00:09:54,What military application could that have?
00:09:54,00:09:55,"All right, Chaps."
00:09:55,00:09:56,We've got the mission.
00:09:56,00:10:00,"We need to take out the ship, but we've only got a plane to do it."
00:10:00,00:10:02,Can we not send in the infantry?
00:10:02,00:10:03,Freight not.
00:10:03,00:10:05,The hell-drown must-leak.
00:10:05,00:10:16,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:10:16,00:10:23,My fact this week is that the 1959 Formula One Championship was won on foot.
00:10:23,00:10:24,Wow.
00:10:24,00:10:25,Dark to finish?
00:10:25,00:10:26,No.
00:10:26,00:10:30,So there's a great Australian Formula One driver called Jack Brabham.
00:10:30,00:10:35,The story behind it is that he was making this final race that was going to win him the
00:10:35,00:10:36,championship.
00:10:36,00:10:37,He was on his final lap.
00:10:37,00:10:40,"Victory was inside, and suddenly he ran out of petrol."
00:10:40,00:10:43,"The car just came to a total halt, and that should have been the end of the race for"
00:10:43,00:10:44,him.
00:10:44,00:10:49,"Instead, he got out, and he pushed the car all the way to the finishing line."
00:10:49,00:10:52,"And he came in fourth place, but that was enough to win him the championship."
00:10:52,00:10:57,Jack Brabham is the only person to have won a Formula One race driving one of his own cars.
00:10:57,00:10:58,Yes.
00:10:58,00:11:01,"Because he later went into making cars and developing them and say, ""It's not just his"
00:11:01,00:11:02,run-around.
00:11:02,00:11:07,"They used to take a little Ford Focus that he had, yeah."""
00:11:07,00:11:12,"Yeah, he's kind of one of those characters, so he's an Australian, and he kind of describes"
00:11:12,00:11:17,when he came over to England in order to start racing for the Formula One.
00:11:17,00:11:21,"That they treated him as a kind of really backward character from Australian, so every"
00:11:21,00:11:24,"single championship that he won, everyone assumed that he was going to lose."
00:11:24,00:11:28,"So the third one, which he won in his own car, everyone thought he was past his peak, thought"
00:11:28,00:11:30,he was too old to do it anymore.
00:11:30,00:11:33,So he came out to the starting line to his car.
00:11:33,00:11:38,"He walked out with a fake long beard and a walking stick, and acted like an old man all"
00:11:38,00:11:39,the way to his car.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Or a gangster.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"And then when and when, that's great."
00:11:41,00:11:42,That's great.
00:11:42,00:11:43,What a cool guy.
00:11:43,00:11:44,Yeah.
00:11:44,00:11:49,"One of his cars was called the Brabham BT46, and it had a massive fan on the back of"
00:11:49,00:11:50,it.
00:11:50,00:11:55,"The fan would move the air so that it sucks the car down to the track, and it made it a"
00:11:55,00:11:57,lot more aerodynamic.
00:11:57,00:12:01,"And he used it for one race, which he won, but all of the other drivers complained about"
00:12:01,00:12:02,it.
00:12:02,00:12:05,"They said it wasn't fair that he had it, and they didn't."
00:12:05,00:12:08,And also that the fan kind of picked up stones off the track and shot them at the following
00:12:08,00:12:09,cars.
00:12:09,00:12:10,Yeah.
00:12:10,00:12:12,And then after the first race he agreed he would never use it again.
00:12:12,00:12:13,Wow.
00:12:13,00:12:14,Even though it wasn't technically against the rules.
00:12:14,00:12:15,Already.
00:12:15,00:12:16,I think it's cool.
00:12:16,00:12:17,So this is the thing.
00:12:17,00:12:21,Number one is the set of rules that all drivers have to stick to.
00:12:21,00:12:25,"And I found a friend of mine, my friend Max, Ferman, works at McLaren."
00:12:25,00:12:30,"And what he said, this is so cool, is that basically the whole aim is to create downward"
00:12:30,00:12:31,force on the car.
00:12:31,00:12:34,"So they're all built like the opposite of a plane's wing, which is designed to lift you"
00:12:34,00:12:35,up.
00:12:35,00:12:39,You have to get it as low as possible to make it as aerodynamic as possible.
00:12:39,00:12:43,"And above a certain speed, the cars are so good at creating the downward force that they"
00:12:43,00:12:47,could drive upside down along the ceiling of a tunnel.
00:12:47,00:12:48,That is crazy.
00:12:48,00:12:49,Why are they not doing that?
00:12:49,00:12:50,Yeah.
00:12:50,00:12:51,Why?
00:12:51,00:12:52,Just like why have we not seen that?
00:12:52,00:12:54,"We would be watching Formula One, many more of us."
00:12:54,00:12:55,Yeah.
00:12:55,00:12:56,That was an aspect of it.
00:12:56,00:12:59,And there's a new Mario Kart that does that kind of stuff.
00:12:59,00:13:00,It's awesome.
00:13:00,00:13:01,Yeah.
00:13:01,00:13:02,It's very exciting.
00:13:02,00:13:03,"What they're saying, the idea is already there."
00:13:03,00:13:04,I'm saying we've seen the future.
00:13:04,00:13:05,We've seen what it looks like.
00:13:05,00:13:06,It does work.
00:13:06,00:13:10,The transition from Mario Kart to Mario Kart ceiling works.
00:13:10,00:13:11,But why?
00:13:11,00:13:12,Yeah.
00:13:12,00:13:13,Why are we not doing it?
00:13:13,00:13:14,I don't know.
00:13:14,00:13:15,"Well, I guess it's probably not very safe."
00:13:15,00:13:20,"I know it does work, but then what happens if you hit a stone and you suddenly lose a bit"
00:13:20,00:13:21,of downforce?
00:13:21,00:13:23,It's true.
00:13:23,00:13:28,"The downward force and generally the pressure applied to Formula One drivers is very extreme,"
00:13:28,00:13:29,obviously.
00:13:29,00:13:34,"So the force, when it's at its maximum, is about five times their normal weight of force"
00:13:34,00:13:35,on their bodies.
00:13:35,00:13:40,And that means that the exercise that they have to do most frequently is on their neck.
00:13:40,00:13:44,"If you're a Formula One driver, the thing you focus on constantly is on neck exercises."
00:13:44,00:13:48,So they have all these ways of making sure that they are able to take this kind of pressure.
00:13:48,00:13:52,"I think there's a particular Formula One helmet that one of the trainers designed, which"
00:13:52,00:13:54,is surrounded by pulleys.
00:13:54,00:13:59,"And so the driver wears the helmet, and then his trainer pulls all the pulleys in various"
00:13:59,00:14:00,directions.
00:14:00,00:14:03,And the driver has to practice kind of counter-balancing that with the force of his neck.
00:14:03,00:14:08,They should just walk around with a massive ship on their heads.
00:14:08,00:14:12,"It is amazing though, I would assume that the training would be just getting a car"
00:14:12,00:14:14,and drive around the track.
00:14:14,00:14:15,That was not my assumption.
00:14:15,00:14:16,Yeah.
00:14:16,00:14:19,"But you read about the training that all these Formula One guys have to do, and it's a mixture"
00:14:19,00:14:22,"of skiing, it's a mixture of swimming."
00:14:22,00:14:26,"Well, you never know if your car runs out of petrol, and the slopes have..."
00:14:26,00:14:27,[laughter]
00:14:27,00:14:33,"The other thing I didn't know is that they change gear constantly about up to 4,000 times"
00:14:33,00:14:34,a race.
00:14:34,00:14:35,Really?
00:14:35,00:14:36,"Yeah, I just thought they sat there and put their foot down."
00:14:36,00:14:37,It's constantly changing gear.
00:14:37,00:14:40,It's once every 1.3 seconds in the Canadian Grand Prix.
00:14:40,00:14:41,No.
00:14:41,00:14:42,How knowing must that be?
00:14:42,00:14:46,The actual change of gear is 50 times faster than you can blink.
00:14:46,00:14:49,"Ah, that is better than your standard manual car gear chain now."
00:14:49,00:14:50,[laughter]
00:14:50,00:14:54,"Well, I've seen the wheel, the actual steering wheels these days."
00:14:54,00:14:55,"Yeah, it's like a console."
00:14:55,00:14:56,"It's like a console, yeah."
00:14:56,00:15:00,There's about 70 buttons on it that they end all knobs that they just turn and...
00:15:00,00:15:01,Do you know the best button?
00:15:01,00:15:02,No.
00:15:02,00:15:03,It's the button delivered.
00:15:03,00:15:04,The jack-to-seat.
00:15:04,00:15:05,It's not the jack-to-seat.
00:15:05,00:15:07,It's delivered drink to my mouth now.
00:15:07,00:15:08,You're kidding.
00:15:08,00:15:11,"They've all got a little tube going into their mouth, and they have a button, but if"
00:15:11,00:15:13,they press and it delivers them a drink.
00:15:13,00:15:16,"When you just said delivered drink to my mouth now, that sounded like Anna in a bar."
00:15:16,00:15:17,[laughter]
00:15:17,00:15:21,"Yeah, and where can I get one of these little console things?"
00:15:21,00:15:23,"I don't mean whiskeys in it, but..."
00:15:23,00:15:25,I think they can probably fill it with whatever they like.
00:15:25,00:15:26,Yeah.
00:15:26,00:15:27,"They probably don't fill it with whisky, though."
00:15:27,00:15:30,So one guy who probably would have liked this was a motor racing driver called Duncan
00:15:30,00:15:31,Hamilton.
00:15:31,00:15:38,"Okay, so in 1953, he was in the Le Mans 24-hour race, but in qualifying, he had the same"
00:15:38,00:15:42,number as another car and got disqualified for having the same number as another car.
00:15:42,00:15:43,How did that happen?
00:15:43,00:15:46,"Well, just an admin problem, I guess."
00:15:46,00:15:47,That's a real pain in the eye.
00:15:47,00:15:52,"Anyway, so they went out in the town in Le Mans and got absolutely shit-faced, and then"
00:15:52,00:15:55,"the organizers during this time thought, ""Actually, that is quite harsh."
00:15:55,00:15:56,"Let's let them back in."""
00:15:56,00:16:02,"So his buses went to the bar to try and find him, and he's kind of slumped over a bar"
00:16:02,00:16:04,"somewhere, and they're like, ""Come on, come on, we've got to do the race."""
00:16:04,00:16:07,"And he's like, ""Well, I'm not sure I'm okay for to do this."""
00:16:07,00:16:09,"And they're like, ""No, no, come on, come on, come on."""
00:16:09,00:16:15,"And so he took part, absolutely shit-faced driving the Le Mans 24-hour."
00:16:15,00:16:17,This is in 1953.
00:16:17,00:16:22,"And every pit stop, the crew started giving him coffee to try and sell him up, and then after"
00:16:22,00:16:26,"about a dozen of these pit stops, he said, ""No, stop giving me coffee because it's making"
00:16:26,00:16:27,"me shake."""
00:16:27,00:16:33,"And so instead, they started giving him more brandy."
00:16:33,00:16:36,"Stop him from shaking, and sure enough, he won the race."
00:16:36,00:16:37,Whoa!
00:16:37,00:16:38,That's incredible.
00:16:38,00:16:42,"Guys, we do not condone that, by the way, on this podcast, on the normal roads."
00:16:42,00:16:43,But wow.
00:16:43,00:16:44,Here's the thing.
00:16:44,00:16:45,"So that's the wheels, right?"
00:16:45,00:16:49,"Have you heard about their helmets, and how good they are, because they're unbelievably,"
00:16:49,00:16:54,because they have to experience severe impacts without buckling.
00:16:54,00:16:59,"So they have to withstand a flame, a huge torture flame, for 45 seconds, without it getting"
00:16:59,00:17:00,unbearably hot inside.
00:17:00,00:17:01,So they're testing that way.
00:17:01,00:17:02,Imagine the work experience.
00:17:02,00:17:06,"It's like, ""What am I doing today?"" ""Well, just put this helmet on."""
00:17:06,00:17:08,"""Oh, is it the fun drinking one?"""
00:17:08,00:17:10,I'm afraid not today.
00:17:10,00:17:14,I love Bernie Eccleston's ideas to improve Formula One.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"He always comes up with, like, I think they're just sound bites, but they're usually pretty"
00:17:17,00:17:18,funny.
00:17:18,00:17:19,"Like, really?"
00:17:19,00:17:23,So one of them was that he said that they should have fake rainstorms halfway through each
00:17:23,00:17:24,race.
00:17:24,00:17:26,"He's like, ""Why rely on the weather?"
00:17:26,00:17:31,"Why don't we just, for 20 minutes, put sprinklers on all the tracks, so there's a fake"
00:17:31,00:17:32,"rainstorm?"""
00:17:32,00:17:33,What to make it fair?
00:17:33,00:17:38,"It adds a bit of unpredictability to it, because in Formula One, often, I think it's just"
00:17:38,00:17:40,people driving around struggling to overtake each other.
00:17:40,00:17:45,"He's suggesting, making it unpredictable, by ensuring that the same thing happens in every"
00:17:45,00:17:46,race.
00:17:46,00:17:48,"Yes, but you never know when it's going to happen."
00:17:48,00:17:49,"Oh, cool."
00:17:49,00:17:52,"And maybe you would give the teams, like, 10 minutes head start."
00:17:52,00:17:55,"It's like, it's going to rain in 10 minutes, and everyone's like, ""Oh, no!"""
00:17:55,00:17:56,Again.
00:17:56,00:17:59,Did he say anything about maybe there being a section in every race where the floor
00:17:59,00:18:03,suddenly disappears and you need to ride the roof in order to get it?
00:18:03,00:18:06,Now I'm going to show her if he's listening.
00:18:06,00:18:09,"Do you know they have to test wet tires, obviously, the wet tires."
00:18:09,00:18:11,"Oh, the tires are so cool."
00:18:11,00:18:14,They can clear 60 litres of water away from the tires in one second.
00:18:14,00:18:15,Wow.
00:18:15,00:18:17,That's how fast they're going and how much water they come in contact with.
00:18:17,00:18:18,It's not amazing.
00:18:18,00:18:19,Yeah.
00:18:19,00:18:20,"And the full of nitrogen, aren't they?"
00:18:20,00:18:21,Rather than normal air.
00:18:21,00:18:22,Are they?
00:18:22,00:18:23,I think so.
00:18:23,00:18:28,"Because if you put normal air in, then you're more likely to get water vapor, and the"
00:18:28,00:18:32,"water vapor, when the tire heats up, can kind of do unpredictable things."
00:18:32,00:18:35,"But if you have nitrogen, very inert, it'll be absolutely fine."
00:18:35,00:18:38,"So that's something they have in common with crisp packets, which are also full of nitrogen."
00:18:38,00:18:42,"Instead of air, because air will make the crisps go off, because the oxygen will react"
00:18:42,00:18:43,with a crisp.
00:18:43,00:18:44,Nitrogen isn't in gas.
00:18:44,00:18:45,"Oh, wow."
00:18:45,00:18:46,Doesn't affect the rest.
00:18:46,00:18:47,So crisps and formula one tires.
00:18:47,00:18:51,"So, Bernie, another tip for a possible challenge in the race, you have to have at"
00:18:51,00:18:55,least one tire made of a crisp packet.
00:18:55,00:19:06,"And then the driver can just press a button on his wheel, which says deliver crisps to my mouse."
00:19:06,00:19:09,"OK, it's time for fact number three."
00:19:09,00:19:10,And that's James.
00:19:10,00:19:16,"OK, my fact this week is that the earliest known mention of the balalaika is of someone"
00:19:16,00:19:20,being arrested for playing one.
00:19:20,00:19:22,When was this?
00:19:22,00:19:23,OK.
00:19:23,00:19:24,This was in 1688.
00:19:24,00:19:26,"Oh, wow, is that old?"
00:19:26,00:19:30,"Oh, yeah, probably older, but this is the first mention of them."
00:19:30,00:19:36,"And this was two peasants who were called Safkaf Firdorov and Ivashko Dimitriyev, who ran"
00:19:36,00:19:42,up to a gate and antagonised the guard while singing and playing the balalaika and then
00:19:42,00:19:43,got arrested.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"Oh, really?"
00:19:44,00:19:45,Wow.
00:19:45,00:19:53,"Imagine if those two guys could know that more than 300 years after this event, people"
00:19:53,00:19:58,in the future will be talking about it and making fun of them.
00:19:58,00:20:05,The next mention was in 1700 and there were two coachmen who were chased by the servant
00:20:05,00:20:08,of the magistrate and beaten with their own balalaika.
00:20:08,00:20:09,"Oh, wow."
00:20:09,00:20:12,Are they very solid or would they smash?
00:20:12,00:20:14,"They've got corners, haven't they?"
00:20:14,00:20:15,"Yeah, they're triangular."
00:20:15,00:20:16,Right.
00:20:16,00:20:20,"So a balalaika is a stringed musical instrument, a bit like a guitar from Russia, which has got"
00:20:20,00:20:25,triangular bass and the triangular bass is supposed to give it a slightly different timbre
00:20:25,00:20:28,and a slightly different sound to normal instruments.
00:20:28,00:20:32,So why does everyone hate people who are using balalaikers in the early days?
00:20:32,00:20:35,"Well, I think it was a protest instrument."
00:20:35,00:20:39,"In the olden days in Russia, they didn't like people playing music in general."
00:20:39,00:20:44,The Russian Orthodox Church really basically said you shouldn't be playing any instruments.
00:20:44,00:20:49,"And so what they would do is if they caught you playing a balalaika, they'd basically steal"
00:20:49,00:20:53,it off you and then crush it and just burn it or whatever.
00:20:53,00:20:56,And then people would just remake them because actually they were really easy to make.
00:20:56,00:21:01,And that's one theory why you have these triangular basses because a triangular guitar is easier
00:21:01,00:21:03,to make than a round one.
00:21:03,00:21:06,And so that's one theory as to why balalaikers are triangular.
00:21:06,00:21:10,"The same as with derrily cheese, it's just easier to make the cheese."
00:21:10,00:21:13,"Also, hated by the Russian Orthodox Church."
00:21:13,00:21:17,You know that a June 23rd is international balalaika day.
00:21:17,00:21:23,"Yeah, I did read that, but then I'd never heard of it being an international citizen."
00:21:23,00:21:25,And I asked two Russians and neither of those have heard of it either.
00:21:25,00:21:30,"Well, the sentence that was right after saying that it's international balalaika day,"
00:21:30,00:21:32,also said no one cares.
00:21:32,00:21:34,It's just a day that no one cares about.
00:21:34,00:21:35,No one celebrates.
00:21:35,00:21:39,"It's an international day of like about 20 things that no one cares about, isn't it?"
00:21:39,00:21:40,"It's true, yeah."
00:21:40,00:21:43,"Just on the fact that there were rebellion instruments,"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"I, through this fact, learned about this group of people that I'd never heard of"
00:21:46,00:21:50,"before, but who sound really interesting, called skomaroks."
00:21:50,00:21:54,"And they were the people who were most associated with playing the balalaika, I think, traditionally"
00:21:54,00:21:55,in Russia.
00:21:55,00:21:59,"And so this is one of the reasons the government didn't like the instrument, because skomaroks"
00:21:59,00:22:06,"were these gestures, actors, singers, and their whole modus operandi was really going around"
00:22:06,00:22:07,and satirizing the church and state.
00:22:07,00:22:08,And they sound great.
00:22:08,00:22:13,"And they seem to go on for a couple of hundred years, just going from town to town performing"
00:22:13,00:22:15,and taking the piss out of the government and the church.
00:22:15,00:22:20,And often exposing themselves at festivals was the reason they were not liked.
00:22:20,00:22:25,"Because they were just, I think the word might come from the same route as skaramush,"
00:22:25,00:22:29,which was the character in Commedia del Arte.
00:22:29,00:22:32,And they were basically just going from that queen song as well.
00:22:32,00:22:33,Yeah.
00:22:33,00:22:34,"No, yeah, yeah."
00:22:34,00:22:35,Is he literally that?
00:22:35,00:22:37,"That's where they got the word from, yeah."
00:22:37,00:22:43,"And these were basically just peasants would have parties like this, and they did it all"
00:22:43,00:22:46,"over Europe, not just in Russia, not just in Italy, but everywhere."
00:22:46,00:22:51,"It's sort of odd that they all had the same instrument, because if I was a skomarok, I'd"
00:22:51,00:22:57,"turn up with something different, like a piano or a violin, but then I'd reveal, actually,"
00:22:57,00:22:59,I'm still there to make fun of you.
00:22:59,00:23:03,"I think it's an odd piano, of course, yet to be invented."
00:23:03,00:23:08,"Well, what's the thing before, wasn't it hard for a predecessor to the piano forte?"
00:23:08,00:23:09,It was called the forte piano.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:10,00:23:11,Was it?
00:23:11,00:23:12,Yeah.
00:23:12,00:23:13,The piano?
00:23:13,00:23:18,"You had to play it upside down in a tunnel while you were going a 150 miles an hour, yeah."
00:23:18,00:23:23,"So piano is short for piano forte, which means quiet loud, and what they were looking for"
00:23:23,00:23:28,was a percussion instrument which could make quiet noises and loud noises at the same time
00:23:28,00:23:32,"like a guitar could, because all the other ones like harpsichord and an organ, you can really"
00:23:32,00:23:36,only kind of play loud front organ and quiet for a harpsichord.
00:23:36,00:23:37,Yeah.
00:23:37,00:23:38,Very boring.
00:23:38,00:23:39,Very boring music.
00:23:39,00:23:43,"I was just thinking just like the formula one thing, if we think of that technology, wouldn't"
00:23:43,00:23:46,"it be cool if there was just an extra key on the piano for the pianist could play, and"
00:23:46,00:23:50,it delivers a bit of drink to them as they're playing on the shutters?
00:23:50,00:23:53,"I mean, this is an old joke, but I genuinely heard you just say, wouldn't it be cool if there"
00:23:53,00:23:55,was an extra key on a piano that a pianist could play?
00:23:55,00:23:56,I do hear that.
00:23:56,00:23:57,I heard that.
00:23:57,00:24:00,"If you're playing at both ends of the piano, really low notes and really high notes, but"
00:24:00,00:24:04,you need to play at middle notes.
00:24:04,00:24:09,And Mozart sometimes play with his knees.
00:24:09,00:24:10,Did he?
00:24:10,00:24:14,I could have sworn there was one very early kind of piano which had pedals that were knee operated.
00:24:14,00:24:15,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:15,00:24:17,And I think Mozart played one of them.
00:24:17,00:24:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:18,00:24:19,"Yeah, okay."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"And just on Balalaikas, there seems to be a rumour in a lot of Russian media that Balalaikas"
00:24:22,00:24:26,"have been banned in the US, which is a totally unfounded rumour, and not sure where it came"
00:24:26,00:24:29,"from, but there's so a lot of Russian people complained that the US has completely banned"
00:24:29,00:24:31,"Balalaikas, which is not the case."
00:24:31,00:24:37,"I think it's not an extremely common fallacy, but I think it comes up on news articles every"
00:24:37,00:24:38,now and then.
00:24:38,00:24:42,"Every international Balalaikaday, I certainly protest about the fact that I did read a debunk"
00:24:42,00:24:44,"of it which pointed out, no, they're not banned."
00:24:44,00:24:45,They've never been banned.
00:24:45,00:24:49,It's just that there's no market for Balalaikas in the USA.
00:24:49,00:24:55,"Do you know instruments are banned on television in Iran, which I didn't know at all."
00:24:55,00:24:58,So you can't show musical instruments on state TV.
00:24:58,00:25:01,"And there have been a couple of occasions, I think, where TV channels have accidentally"
00:25:01,00:25:03,contravened this rule.
00:25:03,00:25:09,"So there was one where someone started singing on Iranian TV, and then they began to play"
00:25:09,00:25:10,the piano.
00:25:10,00:25:12,"But as soon as they started playing the piano, they had to cut off the program."
00:25:12,00:25:16,He was playing it with his penis.
00:25:16,00:25:20,"If you have an orchestra show, then only the singer can be in front of a curtain, and then"
00:25:20,00:25:22,the rest of the orchestra and all the players are behind the curtain.
00:25:22,00:25:28,"It's really interesting because it's thought to be, well, some sheer clerics think that it's"
00:25:28,00:25:32,an act that's forbidden by Islamic law to show musical instruments in public.
00:25:32,00:25:33,Right.
00:25:33,00:25:37,Another weird instrument that was invented by a Russian is the Theraman.
00:25:37,00:25:40,"So the way you play it is it has antennae which sends the vibrations of your hands, so you"
00:25:40,00:25:42,don't touch the instrument while playing it.
00:25:42,00:25:44,"You can be at a sort of a decent distance away, can't you?"
00:25:44,00:25:47,"And your right hand controls the pitch, so your right hand is controlling the notes that"
00:25:47,00:25:50,"you play, and your left hand controls the volume."
00:25:50,00:25:52,"And it's rigged up to know this, this instrument."
00:25:52,00:25:56,"And it sounds really lovely, it sounds kind of like a very high pitch violin, almost like"
00:25:56,00:25:57,a human voice.
00:25:57,00:26:01,"Like a lot of instruments, it sounds lovely if you know how to play it."
00:26:01,00:26:02,Yes.
00:26:02,00:26:03,Yeah.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"I imagine if I just started waving at one, it would be the worst thing you'd ever heard"
00:26:05,00:26:06,of me.
00:26:06,00:26:07,I'd be bound immediately.
00:26:07,00:26:08,Have you built barely play some?
00:26:08,00:26:09,Yes.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Have you seen the Badgerman?
00:26:10,00:26:12,It's a Theraman crossed with a stuffed Badger.
00:26:12,00:26:13,Okay.
00:26:13,00:26:14,Sure.
00:26:14,00:26:16,It's not in mass production.
00:26:16,00:26:18,I think they may only be one of these things.
00:26:18,00:26:25,Why did you see it?
00:26:25,00:26:29,He invented a load of really cool stuff.
00:26:29,00:26:34,"He invented a technique called interlace, which improves the quality of a TV signal, which"
00:26:34,00:26:36,is still used in TVs today.
00:26:36,00:26:37,Wow.
00:26:37,00:26:39,It stops it from flickering.
00:26:39,00:26:42,He also invented a thing called the thing.
00:26:42,00:26:50,"And it was a seal, an American seal, not an animal seal, but a seal of the United States."
00:26:50,00:26:53,And there was an eavesdropping device inside it.
00:26:53,00:26:59,And it hung for seven years in plain view on the US ambassador's Moscow office.
00:26:59,00:27:02,And they managed to listen into everything that was said for seven years until he was
00:27:02,00:27:06,"accidentally discovered by some British guy, I think."
00:27:06,00:27:08,But this technology that he used in it was amazing.
00:27:08,00:27:12,It's called RFID Radio Frequency Identification.
00:27:12,00:27:19,And it's the kind of stuff you use in oyster cards or contactless or say you have a key card
00:27:19,00:27:21,to get into a hotel room.
00:27:21,00:27:23,It's that technology which he invented.
00:27:23,00:27:24,Oh wow.
00:27:24,00:27:25,He was originally used for spying.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"He eventually vanished, didn't he?"
00:27:27,00:27:30,I think he got taken away by the Soviets one night in 1938.
00:27:30,00:27:31,Really?
00:27:31,00:27:32,It's over time.
00:27:32,00:27:47,Do you know how he brought one of the instruments along James?
00:27:47,00:27:52,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Chaczynski."
00:27:52,00:27:59,My fact this week is that lemurs and loruses like their liquor are strong as possible.
00:27:59,00:28:01,And this is from a new study that's just been done.
00:28:01,00:28:06,And it was a study that was done on the slow lorus and the ii lemur.
00:28:06,00:28:11,And they found that if you give them a range of alcoholic drinks that differ in their alcohol
00:28:11,00:28:14,"content, they always go for the strongest one."
00:28:14,00:28:18,"And in fact, they'll have twice as much of the strong alcohol as the rest."
00:28:18,00:28:21,"Do you feel an affinity to these animals, Anna?"
00:28:21,00:28:22,I always did.
00:28:22,00:28:25,"You know, the slow loruses are so adorable and people often say the same about me."
00:28:25,00:28:29,So I couldn't guess they.
00:28:29,00:28:31,It's about 5% is the highest.
00:28:31,00:28:33,It's like getting stellar instead of carwing.
00:28:33,00:28:34,Precisely.
00:28:34,00:28:35,Yeah.
00:28:35,00:28:36,There's just the more alcohol the better.
00:28:36,00:28:37,Yeah.
00:28:37,00:28:40,And we don't know why because you would have thought you would have put you in a disadvantage
00:28:40,00:28:45,"because once you get drunk, then your motor responses are damaged and your concentration"
00:28:45,00:28:47,isn't as good and you would have thought you're easy prey.
00:28:47,00:28:50,"But on the other hand, then you get calories from alcohol."
00:28:50,00:28:55,So it seems like they've developed evolved a tolerance for alcohol over the years.
00:28:55,00:28:57,"Yeah, they don't get that drunk, do they?"
00:28:57,00:28:59,"They certainly didn't in this experiment, no."
00:28:59,00:29:04,"It's interesting how many animals like alcohol, which I haven't even insects, so I was reading"
00:29:04,00:29:10,a report about entomologists often use beer as bait for moths and butterflies when they
00:29:10,00:29:11,want to catch them for something.
00:29:11,00:29:13,"Yeah, so flies love alcohol as well."
00:29:13,00:29:14,Yes.
00:29:14,00:29:15,So it's just on insect.
00:29:15,00:29:19,Fruit flies go nuts for it and they actively get regularly drinking till they're drunk and
00:29:19,00:29:23,they'll be wobbling around and they won't be able to fly properly.
00:29:23,00:29:29,I did read an article about them that said that males who have not mated are more likely
00:29:29,00:29:32,to get drunk than the males who have mated in flies.
00:29:32,00:29:33,Yes.
00:29:33,00:29:34,Certainly true in my experience.
00:29:34,00:29:37,"If males who have been rejected, they drown their sorrows."
00:29:37,00:29:38,"Yeah, all right."
00:29:38,00:29:40,That's not going on about it.
00:29:40,00:29:44,"And also, fruit flies that get drunk, but they massively lower their standards."
00:29:44,00:29:46,"So when they're mating, they'll suddenly mate with anything."
00:29:46,00:29:49,"So as soon as the fruit fly gets a bit pissed, it starts trying to mate with fruit flies"
00:29:49,00:29:50,of its own sex.
00:29:50,00:29:55,Let's move on from this point on their face.
00:29:55,00:29:59,So the slow loris is just about the only venomous mammal.
00:29:59,00:30:05,"As in, it bites you and it transfers venom to you, as opposed to poisonous where if you eat"
00:30:05,00:30:06,"it, you get poisoned."
00:30:06,00:30:07,Yeah.
00:30:07,00:30:11,"So it's really odd though, because it keeps its venom in an elbow patch."
00:30:11,00:30:12,Yeah.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"And to poison you, it has to lick the inside of its elbow where it's got these glands and"
00:30:15,00:30:20,it's accretes the poison from there and then it's got the venom in its mouth and then it's
00:30:20,00:30:25,"swills at round in its mouth with its own saliva and that activates the venom, making it"
00:30:25,00:30:26,really dangerous.
00:30:26,00:30:29,"It's only, they've only killed one person documented in medical literature."
00:30:29,00:30:31,"And that was somebody who went into anaphylaxis, wasn't it?"
00:30:31,00:30:32,"Yeah, exactly."
00:30:32,00:30:36,And there are all these videos of them online being tickled and it's supposedly really adorable.
00:30:36,00:30:40,What they're actually doing is lifting up their arms to try and get to their venom glands.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"So what I was going to say, if you're going to put a venom gland anywhere, don't put"
00:30:43,00:30:47,"it on your elbow, which is famously the bit that's hardest to lick in the whole body."
00:30:47,00:30:48,I know.
00:30:48,00:30:49,It's a really good point.
00:30:49,00:30:52,It's a funny joke from God.
00:30:52,00:30:54,The slow loris is expense.
00:30:54,00:30:58,"Do you know the gentle lemus, one of the most aggressive lemus there is?"
00:30:58,00:30:59,No.
00:30:59,00:31:00,Really?
00:31:00,00:31:01,She's weird.
00:31:01,00:31:07,"It's just based on a weird etymological thing where it was, it looked a little bit like a"
00:31:07,00:31:11,mama set whose name was haparley and haparley means gentle and so it was called the gentle
00:31:11,00:31:12,lemus.
00:31:12,00:31:13,It's actually a complete bastard.
00:31:13,00:31:14,Wow.
00:31:14,00:31:15,In captivity they're really vicious.
00:31:15,00:31:16,That's really funny.
00:31:16,00:31:17,What do they do?
00:31:17,00:31:18,Like what levels of viciousness?
00:31:18,00:31:19,You can't.
00:31:19,00:31:21,You don't get near your car.
00:31:21,00:31:22,They'll care.
00:31:22,00:31:24,Just be rude online.
00:31:24,00:31:25,It's not like that.
00:31:25,00:31:26,Yeah.
00:31:26,00:31:27,Trolling.
00:31:27,00:31:28,Yeah.
00:31:28,00:31:29,Okay.
00:31:29,00:31:30,That's it.
00:31:30,00:31:31,That's all of our facts.
