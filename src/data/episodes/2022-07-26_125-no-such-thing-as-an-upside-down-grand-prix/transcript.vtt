00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.260
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish, a Weekly Podcast"

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.460
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.260
 I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andy Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.220
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.540
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.200
 My fact is that 18th century hairstyles included the Spaniels' ears, mad dog, and the drowned

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 chicken.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.540
 These are all do's that you could get.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.880
 And do we know what they look like?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.260
 I haven't been able to find what these ones look like, no, but there are so many insane

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.260
 styles.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.980
 I suppose we can imagine what a drowned chicken looks like.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.980
 Yeah.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.980
 And it's hard to imagine that that would be a desirable hairstyle with some kind of

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 punishment.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.420
 Yeah, a dog as well, it's bad hair basically, but you're drooling.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.420
 Yeah.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.820
 The Spaniels' ears is that a hairstyle that you see loads in 18th century paintings where

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.900
 women have their hair flex on top and then curled down the sides.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.900
 Oh.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.900
 I don't know what it looks like.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 It looks like you've got a Spaniels' ears.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.140
 There's also, there were two others around that time called, one was called "The Chest

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.180
 of Draws", and the other one was called "Sportsman in the Bush".

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 Nice.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.180
 I don't know what that was.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.180
 What did that entail?

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.300
 It'd be so fun to, if time travel was ever cracked, go back, not look into what it was, and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.660
 just ask for that sit down and see what you get.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.140
 That would be such a cool dare.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 So exciting.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.140
 Yeah.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.620
 The loads of really fancy styles, particularly in France.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.380
 And I did read a theory that the French Revolution was partly caused by Marie Antoinette's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.380
 crazy hair.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.380
 OK.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.380
 Really?

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.780
 Well, she had a royal hairdresser called Leonard O.T., and he made these incredibly fancy

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.580
 hairdos for her, with a few other people, and the ladies of the court all followed suit.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.620
 And that led to some of the earliest attacks on Marie Antoinette in pamphlet form.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.900
 So obviously, it wasn't the entire cause, but it was, like, a symptom, basically.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.060
 I guess it represented her wealth compared to that one, actually, not wealth.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.060
 Yeah.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.980
 The most famous is the coffeeer, Albele Poul, which is a French ship.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.180
 And it had just beaten an English ship very heavily in a battle.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.180
 And so she got the ship in her hair.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.180
 Not the actual ship, though.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.180
 Yeah.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.180
 The full thing.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.180
 Very impressive.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.300
 Did they shape her hair into the shape of a boat, or did they, like, construct it with plywood?

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.660
 What you do is you get your hair, and then you put a load of cushions sort of on your scalp

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.500
 and a metal frame, and then you can build up your hair around that.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.500
 OK.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.220
 And then you put in a load of other hair as well.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.140
 And then you put in a model of a ship, and it had rigging, and it had little model sailors

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.140
 on it.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.180
 And the version of this that you can see, which was Elton John's 50th birthday, he went

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.660
 as Marianne Twinnett with the ship in a wig.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.660
 Really?

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.660
 It's huge, ginormous.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.660
 Wow.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.140
 And the only reason I know that is I met a prop maker who made the Holy Grail for the Indiana

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.140
 Jones movie.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.460
 He also made the ship for Elton John's wig.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.460
 Really?

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.460
 Yeah.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.140
 And it came with a little pipe that went down into his clothing that every time he pressed,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.860
 little cannons had little bits of smoke.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.860
 Shoot out of it.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.180
 So it looked like he was shooting cannons.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.540
 So the thing is, it's apparently it was huge to carry, so just to give an idea of how heavy

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.540
 those things must have been.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.540
 Elton John realised he couldn't get to the party in a car.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.580
 He had to go in a removals van, so it's the only way he could get to the party.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.580
 What?

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.580
 Yeah, it was so heavy.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.580
 And the driver went that wrong way.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.620
 So they were stuck in the van for over an hour and a half, and he got so frustrated with

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.260
 it, he tried to cancel the party.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.780
 They did use to have to dismantle their hair cells when they got into carriages.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.700
 I think Marianne Twinnett used to have someone who would have to take off the top layer

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.620
 of hair so she could fit into a carriage.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.500
 But there's loads of accounts of all this stuff, and some of them I think are not true,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.980
 because some of them they only have mid-19th century sources, and it's all about the late

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.980
 18th century.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.300
 So for example, this is a story that I think is not true, because the earlier source I've

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.820
 found is 1862, but there was a guy called Bolard, who allegedly invented a thing called

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.820
 the mechanical quaffir, which when you press the spring, it would lower by a foot.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.820
 If you wanted to get into a carriage, then you press the spring again and it goes up

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.540
 and it was if you were talking to a grandmother, and you know you wanted to be respectful and

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.940
 not have a crazy head, you could just lower it a cookie.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.180
 I would be really useful if you went to a theme park and you had to be a certain height

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.020
 to get on the ride.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.860
 I'm speaking of carrying hair around.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.860
 Obviously, your wig was a massive commodity back in the 18th century.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.020
 I was reading about hair theft, and there's amazing accounts of what happened in the 18th

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.780
 century, where people would be walking along, and suddenly their hair would just disappear.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.420
 Their wig would just disappear in a crowd, and what they reckon it was were guys, who

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.140
 were sort of tall, burly men, who were carrying a butcher's tray over their shoulder that contained

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.700
 a small child inside the butcher's tray, and the small child would peek out, quickly grab

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.940
 the hair, the wig, head back into the butcher's tray.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.220
 So by the time the person turned around, there was just a burly man with the thing on his

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.220
 shoulder.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.620
 Well, that's because wigs were really expensive.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.620
 Yeah, right.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.620
 Incredibly expensive.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.260
 So it wasn't really expensive to get these hairstyles done as well, and so I hadn't quite

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.860
 realised how long they would stay in place, unless you were Mary Antoinette, who I think

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.300
 asked for a new hairstyle every day, you put it in place, and you kept it there for a

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.300
 few weeks.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.860
 You basically kept it there for as long as it took to go really mouldy, because the stuff

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.500
 that they used to keep it in were things like animal fats, weren't they?

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.340
 So I think they would end up getting really mouldy and smelly, and you'd get a lot of

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.460
 kind of creatures in your hair, who were attracted to the substances used.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.620
 But people would have these hairstyles in for two or three weeks, and they'd just have

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.020
 to sleep with their heads propped up on lots of pillows.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.140
 Wow. I was reading just a little bit about other fashionable things to be wearing in your

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.140
 hair.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.260
 There were things like if you're a fun woman, you'd have lots of fake butterflies in your

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.180
 hair to show that you're a fun woman.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.900
 Apparently wives of officers wore entire squadrons perched on their head to show that they

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.900
 were an officer.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.900
 Oh, sorry.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.900
 Yeah, so not real.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.900
 In miniature, I believe.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.300
 I would like to see a woman with a squadron of soldiers in her hair getting into a fight

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.900
 with a woman who had a ship in her hair.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.260
 I'd like to see little soldiers try and get onto the ship.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.260
 That would be my target.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.380
 But you can't have infantry versus the Navy.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.620
 I mean, it's just you can just fight, can't you, you know, in the way that there were rules

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.620
 involved.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.380
 I guess that is true.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.260
 But if you were a general and you say, okay, there's a ship over there, I'm going to

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.820
 send my infantry out.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.740
 This is the reason I wasn't allowed into the army.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:39.300
 Roman brides would have their hair cut into six sections or braided into six sections.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:45.260
 And each of the locks had to be separated with a spear that had been used to kill a gladiator.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.380
 And for best results, you would still have the blood of the gladiator on the spear.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.300
 The best results leave in for two and a half minutes and ensure that a dead gladiator's

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.780
 blood is on the tip of your spear.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.780
 That can't be in every wedding.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.780
 No, it wasn't.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.180
 I think it was very high society weddings.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.180
 High society weddings.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.180
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.180
 Yeah, fair enough.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.100
 And the Puritans, they like short hair, of course.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:10.940
 There was one Puritan called William Prin and he said that people who had long curly hair,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:18.340
 like mine, were unlawful, effeminate, venglorious, evil, odious, emodest, indecent, lascivious,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:24.620
 wanton, disillute, horish, ungodly, horrid, strange, outlandish, impudent, pernicious, offensive,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.580
 ridiculous, foolish, childish, and unchristian.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.180
 That's a fair description of you.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.820
 I don't think you're horish.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.660
 Anything else stands.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.660
 So get this.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.820
 This is very cool.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.740
 Before hair dryers, electrical hair dryers were invented.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.100
 What you could have was a stoneware hairdryer and it was like a hot water bottle, but for your

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.100
 hair.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.100
 Right.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.500
 So you would fill it with boiling water and then you brush it through your hair and it

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.780
 urgently dries it in a few minutes.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.780
 Pretty clever.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.780
 I guess it would.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.780
 Like ironing your hair.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.780
 Have you ever ironed your hair?

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.380
 No, but I imagine that would dry it quite fast.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.820
 I am not joking, I used to iron my sister and her friend's hair.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.100
 We'd get an iron out and it's very hard because you've got to go quite close to the scalp,

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.180
 but it's not quite a few scarves because you don't want it to kink when it goes off the

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.180
 edge of the...

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.660
 That's best result, though, is to have a little bit of your own blood through through

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.660
 the hair.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.660
 That's what I said.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.820
 Would you try that on me later, so I look a bit less horish.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.500
 In the 19th century, a furniture used to be covered with Macassa protectors, so Macassa

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.860
 was the popular hair oil that was so widespread that if you invited guest rounds, you knew that

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.780
 your furniture would end up covered in it.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.780
 And so it got us on trains.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.780
 By these specials.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.780
 Yes, and in theaters.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.260
 Yeah, anti-macassas are called.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.260
 Yeah.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.860
 You know, the little lazy thing on a train seat, so you can have a plane ahead.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:42.860
 Behind your head, yeah.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.900
 That's because, obviously, when you get on a train, you want to put your Macassa on so

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.740
 that you look great when you get to the other end.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.740
 I didn't know either.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.340
 Have you noticed that whenever you get on a train, there's never any Macassa on the chair?

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.340
 Yeah.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.340
 That's due to the anti-macassas.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.140
 Well, that makes sense now.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.140
 Everything's falling into place for you now, then.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:04.700
 The entire world has basically been built around the need to avoid getting Macassa everywhere.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.660
 My favourite hair in history was the hair of Chief White Eagle.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.380
 He had the world's strongest hair.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:17.060
 And he used to be dangled under an aeroplane by tying his hair to the bottom of an aeroplane.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.060
 No.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.060
 Hang on, so it would take off.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.740
 At what point do we think he discovered that he could do that?

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.420
 Well, he also jumped from planes with his hair attached to parachutes.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.460
 That is so cool.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.660
 So he would let it open and his hair was the string?

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.660
 Yeah, yeah.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.660
 I think there were also...

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.660
 Oh, parachute?

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.660
 ...prisonably.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.180
 There were longer strings attached to his hair, but his hair was basically the thing attaching

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.180
 him to the parachute.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.180
 When was this guy active?

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.180
 I'm not sure.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.180
 I'm not sure.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.180
 It was early...

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.900
 It sounds like he was in a military capacity.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.900
 He was hanging from planes.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.100
 He was early 20th century.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.940
 What military application could that have?

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.940
 All right, Chaps.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.940
 We've got the mission.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.780
 We need to take out the ship, but we've only got a plane to do it.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.300
 Can we not send in the infantry?

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.300
 Freight not.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.900
 The hell-drown must-leak.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:16.860
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:23.020
 My fact this week is that the 1959 Formula One Championship was won on foot.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.020
 Wow.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.020
 Dark to finish?

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.020
 No.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.860
 So there's a great Australian Formula One driver called Jack Brabham.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.100
 The story behind it is that he was making this final race that was going to win him the

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.100
 championship.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.100
 He was on his final lap.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.140
 Victory was inside, and suddenly he ran out of petrol.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.540
 The car just came to a total halt, and that should have been the end of the race for

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.540
 him.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.580
 Instead, he got out, and he pushed the car all the way to the finishing line.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.500
 And he came in fourth place, but that was enough to win him the championship.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.580
 Jack Brabham is the only person to have won a Formula One race driving one of his own cars.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.580
 Yes.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.660
 Because he later went into making cars and developing them and say, "It's not just his

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.660
 run-around.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.140
 They used to take a little Ford Focus that he had, yeah."

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:12.180
 Yeah, he's kind of one of those characters, so he's an Australian, and he kind of describes

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.100
 when he came over to England in order to start racing for the Formula One.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.100
 That they treated him as a kind of really backward character from Australian, so every

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.500
 single championship that he won, everyone assumed that he was going to lose.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.900
 So the third one, which he won in his own car, everyone thought he was past his peak, thought

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.740
 he was too old to do it anymore.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.540
 So he came out to the starting line to his car.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:38.180
 He walked out with a fake long beard and a walking stick, and acted like an old man all

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.180
 the way to his car.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.180
 Or a gangster.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.940
 And then when and when, that's great.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.940
 That's great.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.940
 What a cool guy.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:44.940
 Yeah.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.380
 One of his cars was called the Brabham BT46, and it had a massive fan on the back of

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.380
 it.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.220
 The fan would move the air so that it sucks the car down to the track, and it made it a

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.420
 lot more aerodynamic.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.860
 And he used it for one race, which he won, but all of the other drivers complained about

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.860
 it.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.020
 They said it wasn't fair that he had it, and they didn't.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.860
 And also that the fan kind of picked up stones off the track and shot them at the following

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.860
 cars.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.860
 Yeah.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.860
 And then after the first race he agreed he would never use it again.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.860
 Wow.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.860
 Even though it wasn't technically against the rules.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.860
 Already.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.860
 I think it's cool.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:17.860
 So this is the thing.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.340
 Number one is the set of rules that all drivers have to stick to.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.700
 And I found a friend of mine, my friend Max, Ferman, works at McLaren.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.340
 And what he said, this is so cool, is that basically the whole aim is to create downward

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.620
 force on the car.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.580
 So they're all built like the opposite of a plane's wing, which is designed to lift you

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.580
 up.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.420
 You have to get it as low as possible to make it as aerodynamic as possible.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.740
 And above a certain speed, the cars are so good at creating the downward force that they

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.380
 could drive upside down along the ceiling of a tunnel.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.380
 That is crazy.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.660
 Why are they not doing that?

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.660
 Yeah.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.660
 Why?

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.860
 Just like why have we not seen that?

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.860
 We would be watching Formula One, many more of us.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.860
 Yeah.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.860
 That was an aspect of it.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.580
 And there's a new Mario Kart that does that kind of stuff.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.580
 It's awesome.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.580
 Yeah.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.580
 It's very exciting.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.580
 What they're saying, the idea is already there.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.580
 I'm saying we've seen the future.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.580
 We've seen what it looks like.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.580
 It does work.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.140
 The transition from Mario Kart to Mario Kart ceiling works.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.140
 But why?

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.140
 Yeah.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.140
 Why are we not doing it?

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.140
 I don't know.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.140
 Well, I guess it's probably not very safe.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:20.300
 I know it does work, but then what happens if you hit a stone and you suddenly lose a bit

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.300
 of downforce?

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.300
 It's true.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.260
 The downward force and generally the pressure applied to Formula One drivers is very extreme,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.260
 obviously.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.220
 So the force, when it's at its maximum, is about five times their normal weight of force

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.460
 on their bodies.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:40.820
 And that means that the exercise that they have to do most frequently is on their neck.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.460
 If you're a Formula One driver, the thing you focus on constantly is on neck exercises.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.460
 So they have all these ways of making sure that they are able to take this kind of pressure.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.220
 I think there's a particular Formula One helmet that one of the trainers designed, which

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.140
 is surrounded by pulleys.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:59.140
 And so the driver wears the helmet, and then his trainer pulls all the pulleys in various

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.140
 directions.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.380
 And the driver has to practice kind of counter-balancing that with the force of his neck.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:08.100
 They should just walk around with a massive ship on their heads.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.700
 It is amazing though, I would assume that the training would be just getting a car

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.700
 and drive around the track.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.700
 That was not my assumption.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.700
 Yeah.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.900
 But you read about the training that all these Formula One guys have to do, and it's a mixture

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.140
 of skiing, it's a mixture of swimming.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.140
 Well, you never know if your car runs out of petrol, and the slopes have...

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.140
 [laughter]

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:33.060
 The other thing I didn't know is that they change gear constantly about up to 4,000 times

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.060
 a race.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.060
 Really?

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.060
 Yeah, I just thought they sat there and put their foot down.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.060
 It's constantly changing gear.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.380
 It's once every 1.3 seconds in the Canadian Grand Prix.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.380
 No.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.380
 How knowing must that be?

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.620
 The actual change of gear is 50 times faster than you can blink.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.980
 Ah, that is better than your standard manual car gear chain now.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.980
 [laughter]

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.580
 Well, I've seen the wheel, the actual steering wheels these days.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.580
 Yeah, it's like a console.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.580
 It's like a console, yeah.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.620
 There's about 70 buttons on it that they end all knobs that they just turn and...

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.620
 Do you know the best button?

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.620
 No.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.620
 It's the button delivered.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.620
 The jack-to-seat.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.620
 It's not the jack-to-seat.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.460
 It's delivered drink to my mouth now.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.460
 You're kidding.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.460
 They've all got a little tube going into their mouth, and they have a button, but if

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.140
 they press and it delivers them a drink.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.820
 When you just said delivered drink to my mouth now, that sounded like Anna in a bar.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.820
 [laughter]

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.660
 Yeah, and where can I get one of these little console things?

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.500
 I don't mean whiskeys in it, but...

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.420
 I think they can probably fill it with whatever they like.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.420
 Yeah.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.420
 They probably don't fill it with whisky, though.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.920
 So one guy who probably would have liked this was a motor racing driver called Duncan

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.920
 Hamilton.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:38.160
 Okay, so in 1953, he was in the Le Mans 24-hour race, but in qualifying, he had the same

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.880
 number as another car and got disqualified for having the same number as another car.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880
 How did that happen?

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.280
 Well, just an admin problem, I guess.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.480
 That's a real pain in the eye.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.400
 Anyway, so they went out in the town in Le Mans and got absolutely shit-faced, and then

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.640
 the organizers during this time thought, "Actually, that is quite harsh.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.960
 Let's let them back in."

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.320
 So his buses went to the bar to try and find him, and he's kind of slumped over a bar

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.840
 somewhere, and they're like, "Come on, come on, we've got to do the race."

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.880
 And he's like, "Well, I'm not sure I'm okay for to do this."

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.760
 And they're like, "No, no, come on, come on, come on."

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:15.480
 And so he took part, absolutely shit-faced driving the Le Mans 24-hour.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.640
 This is in 1953.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.600
 And every pit stop, the crew started giving him coffee to try and sell him up, and then after

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.520
 about a dozen of these pit stops, he said, "No, stop giving me coffee because it's making

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.520
 me shake."

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:33.040
 And so instead, they started giving him more brandy.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.040
 Stop him from shaking, and sure enough, he won the race.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.640
 Whoa!

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.640
 That's incredible.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.920
 Guys, we do not condone that, by the way, on this podcast, on the normal roads.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.920
 But wow.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.920
 Here's the thing.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.920
 So that's the wheels, right?

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.640
 Have you heard about their helmets, and how good they are, because they're unbelievably,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:54.360
 because they have to experience severe impacts without buckling.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.940
 So they have to withstand a flame, a huge torture flame, for 45 seconds, without it getting

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:00.940
 unbearably hot inside.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.940
 So they're testing that way.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:02.940
 Imagine the work experience.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.740
 It's like, "What am I doing today?" "Well, just put this helmet on."

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.780
 "Oh, is it the fun drinking one?"

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.540
 I'm afraid not today.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.220
 I love Bernie Eccleston's ideas to improve Formula One.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.340
 He always comes up with, like, I think they're just sound bites, but they're usually pretty

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.340
 funny.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.340
 Like, really?

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.860
 So one of them was that he said that they should have fake rainstorms halfway through each

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:24.860
 race.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.700
 He's like, "Why rely on the weather?

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.940
 Why don't we just, for 20 minutes, put sprinklers on all the tracks, so there's a fake

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.940
 rainstorm?"

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:33.940
 What to make it fair?

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.380
 It adds a bit of unpredictability to it, because in Formula One, often, I think it's just

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.980
 people driving around struggling to overtake each other.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.180
 He's suggesting, making it unpredictable, by ensuring that the same thing happens in every

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.180
 race.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.980
 Yes, but you never know when it's going to happen.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:49.980
 Oh, cool.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.180
 And maybe you would give the teams, like, 10 minutes head start.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.820
 It's like, it's going to rain in 10 minutes, and everyone's like, "Oh, no!"

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.820
 Again.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.340
 Did he say anything about maybe there being a section in every race where the floor

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.180
 suddenly disappears and you need to ride the roof in order to get it?

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.180
 Now I'm going to show her if he's listening.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.900
 Do you know they have to test wet tires, obviously, the wet tires.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.060
 Oh, the tires are so cool.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.940
 They can clear 60 litres of water away from the tires in one second.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.940
 Wow.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.940
 That's how fast they're going and how much water they come in contact with.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.940
 It's not amazing.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.940
 Yeah.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:20.940
 And the full of nitrogen, aren't they?

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:21.940
 Rather than normal air.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.940
 Are they?

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:23.940
 I think so.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.580
 Because if you put normal air in, then you're more likely to get water vapor, and the

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.300
 water vapor, when the tire heats up, can kind of do unpredictable things.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.180
 But if you have nitrogen, very inert, it'll be absolutely fine.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.940
 So that's something they have in common with crisp packets, which are also full of nitrogen.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.700
 Instead of air, because air will make the crisps go off, because the oxygen will react

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.700
 with a crisp.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.700
 Nitrogen isn't in gas.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.700
 Oh, wow.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.700
 Doesn't affect the rest.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.700
 So crisps and formula one tires.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.620
 So, Bernie, another tip for a possible challenge in the race, you have to have at

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.420
 least one tire made of a crisp packet.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:06.300
 And then the driver can just press a button on his wheel, which says deliver crisps to my mouse.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.540
 OK, it's time for fact number three.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.780
 And that's James.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:16.740
 OK, my fact this week is that the earliest known mention of the balalaika is of someone

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.740
 being arrested for playing one.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.060
 When was this?

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.060
 OK.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.060
 This was in 1688.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.740
 Oh, wow, is that old?

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.460
 Oh, yeah, probably older, but this is the first mention of them.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:36.860
 And this was two peasants who were called Safkaf Firdorov and Ivashko Dimitriyev, who ran

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:42.740
 up to a gate and antagonised the guard while singing and playing the balalaika and then

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.740
 got arrested.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.740
 Oh, really?

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.740
 Wow.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:53.500
 Imagine if those two guys could know that more than 300 years after this event, people

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:58.940
 in the future will be talking about it and making fun of them.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:05.220
 The next mention was in 1700 and there were two coachmen who were chased by the servant

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.260
 of the magistrate and beaten with their own balalaika.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.260
 Oh, wow.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.260
 Are they very solid or would they smash?

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.260
 They've got corners, haven't they?

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.260
 Yeah, they're triangular.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.260
 Right.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.560
 So a balalaika is a stringed musical instrument, a bit like a guitar from Russia, which has got

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.720
 triangular bass and the triangular bass is supposed to give it a slightly different timbre

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.120
 and a slightly different sound to normal instruments.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.560
 So why does everyone hate people who are using balalaikers in the early days?

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.400
 Well, I think it was a protest instrument.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.280
 In the olden days in Russia, they didn't like people playing music in general.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.200
 The Russian Orthodox Church really basically said you shouldn't be playing any instruments.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.240
 And so what they would do is if they caught you playing a balalaika, they'd basically steal

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.280
 it off you and then crush it and just burn it or whatever.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.680
 And then people would just remake them because actually they were really easy to make.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.040
 And that's one theory why you have these triangular basses because a triangular guitar is easier

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.080
 to make than a round one.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.600
 And so that's one theory as to why balalaikers are triangular.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.680
 The same as with derrily cheese, it's just easier to make the cheese.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.920
 Also, hated by the Russian Orthodox Church.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.000
 You know that a June 23rd is international balalaika day.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.120
 Yeah, I did read that, but then I'd never heard of it being an international citizen.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.720
 And I asked two Russians and neither of those have heard of it either.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.400
 Well, the sentence that was right after saying that it's international balalaika day,

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.440
 also said no one cares.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.520
 It's just a day that no one cares about.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.520
 No one celebrates.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.160
 It's an international day of like about 20 things that no one cares about, isn't it?

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.600
 It's true, yeah.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.680
 Just on the fact that there were rebellion instruments,

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.920
 I, through this fact, learned about this group of people that I'd never heard of

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.960
 before, but who sound really interesting, called skomaroks.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.600
 And they were the people who were most associated with playing the balalaika, I think, traditionally

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.880
 in Russia.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.560
 And so this is one of the reasons the government didn't like the instrument, because skomaroks

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:06.040
 were these gestures, actors, singers, and their whole modus operandi was really going around

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.920
 and satirizing the church and state.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.920
 And they sound great.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.200
 And they seem to go on for a couple of hundred years, just going from town to town performing

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.240
 and taking the piss out of the government and the church.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:20.920
 And often exposing themselves at festivals was the reason they were not liked.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.800
 Because they were just, I think the word might come from the same route as skaramush,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.480
 which was the character in Commedia del Arte.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.400
 And they were basically just going from that queen song as well.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.400
 Yeah.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.400
 No, yeah, yeah.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.400
 Is he literally that?

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.520
 That's where they got the word from, yeah.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:43.160
 And these were basically just peasants would have parties like this, and they did it all

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.920
 over Europe, not just in Russia, not just in Italy, but everywhere.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.200
 It's sort of odd that they all had the same instrument, because if I was a skomarok, I'd

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:57.640
 turn up with something different, like a piano or a violin, but then I'd reveal, actually,

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.040
 I'm still there to make fun of you.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.000
 I think it's an odd piano, of course, yet to be invented.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.080
 Well, what's the thing before, wasn't it hard for a predecessor to the piano forte?

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.640
 It was called the forte piano.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.640
 Was it?

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.640
 Yeah.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.640
 The piano?

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.760
 You had to play it upside down in a tunnel while you were going a 150 miles an hour, yeah.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.640
 So piano is short for piano forte, which means quiet loud, and what they were looking for

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.680
 was a percussion instrument which could make quiet noises and loud noises at the same time

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.880
 like a guitar could, because all the other ones like harpsichord and an organ, you can really

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.560
 only kind of play loud front organ and quiet for a harpsichord.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.560
 Yeah.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.560
 Very boring.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.560
 Very boring music.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.400
 I was just thinking just like the formula one thing, if we think of that technology, wouldn't

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.640
 it be cool if there was just an extra key on the piano for the pianist could play, and

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.400
 it delivers a bit of drink to them as they're playing on the shutters?

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.640
 I mean, this is an old joke, but I genuinely heard you just say, wouldn't it be cool if there

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.680
 was an extra key on a piano that a pianist could play?

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.680
 I do hear that.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.680
 I heard that.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.520
 If you're playing at both ends of the piano, really low notes and really high notes, but

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.840
 you need to play at middle notes.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.920
 And Mozart sometimes play with his knees.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.920
 Did he?

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.120
 I could have sworn there was one very early kind of piano which had pedals that were knee operated.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.120
 And I think Mozart played one of them.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.120
 Yeah, okay.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.000
 And just on Balalaikas, there seems to be a rumour in a lot of Russian media that Balalaikas

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.240
 have been banned in the US, which is a totally unfounded rumour, and not sure where it came

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.560
 from, but there's so a lot of Russian people complained that the US has completely banned

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.560
 Balalaikas, which is not the case.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:37.120
 I think it's not an extremely common fallacy, but I think it comes up on news articles every

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.120
 now and then.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.440
 Every international Balalaikaday, I certainly protest about the fact that I did read a debunk

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.920
 of it which pointed out, no, they're not banned.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.920
 They've never been banned.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.240
 It's just that there's no market for Balalaikas in the USA.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:55.160
 Do you know instruments are banned on television in Iran, which I didn't know at all.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.400
 So you can't show musical instruments on state TV.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.560
 And there have been a couple of occasions, I think, where TV channels have accidentally

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.680
 contravened this rule.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:09.280
 So there was one where someone started singing on Iranian TV, and then they began to play

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.280
 the piano.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.240
 But as soon as they started playing the piano, they had to cut off the program.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.640
 He was playing it with his penis.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.480
 If you have an orchestra show, then only the singer can be in front of a curtain, and then

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.960
 the rest of the orchestra and all the players are behind the curtain.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:28.200
 It's really interesting because it's thought to be, well, some sheer clerics think that it's

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.200
 an act that's forbidden by Islamic law to show musical instruments in public.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200
 Right.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.280
 Another weird instrument that was invented by a Russian is the Theraman.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.440
 So the way you play it is it has antennae which sends the vibrations of your hands, so you

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.120
 don't touch the instrument while playing it.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.600
 You can be at a sort of a decent distance away, can't you?

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.360
 And your right hand controls the pitch, so your right hand is controlling the notes that

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.320
 you play, and your left hand controls the volume.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.600
 And it's rigged up to know this, this instrument.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.960
 And it sounds really lovely, it sounds kind of like a very high pitch violin, almost like

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.960
 a human voice.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.160
 Like a lot of instruments, it sounds lovely if you know how to play it.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.160
 Yes.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.160
 Yeah.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.200
 I imagine if I just started waving at one, it would be the worst thing you'd ever heard

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.200
 of me.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200
 I'd be bound immediately.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200
 Have you built barely play some?

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200
 Yes.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200
 Have you seen the Badgerman?

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.040
 It's a Theraman crossed with a stuffed Badger.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040
 Okay.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.040
 Sure.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.040
 It's not in mass production.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.040
 I think they may only be one of these things.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:25.080
 Why did you see it?

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.320
 He invented a load of really cool stuff.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:34.480
 He invented a technique called interlace, which improves the quality of a TV signal, which

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.240
 is still used in TVs today.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.240
 Wow.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.040
 It stops it from flickering.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.320
 He also invented a thing called the thing.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:50.160
 And it was a seal, an American seal, not an animal seal, but a seal of the United States.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.680
 And there was an eavesdropping device inside it.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:59.240
 And it hung for seven years in plain view on the US ambassador's Moscow office.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.920
 And they managed to listen into everything that was said for seven years until he was

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.600
 accidentally discovered by some British guy, I think.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.960
 But this technology that he used in it was amazing.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.640
 It's called RFID Radio Frequency Identification.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:19.640
 And it's the kind of stuff you use in oyster cards or contactless or say you have a key card

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.240
 to get into a hotel room.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.040
 It's that technology which he invented.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.040
 Oh wow.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.760
 He was originally used for spying.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.360
 He eventually vanished, didn't he?

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.680
 I think he got taken away by the Soviets one night in 1938.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.680
 Really?

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.680
 It's over time.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:47.320
 Do you know how he brought one of the instruments along James?

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:52.360
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Chaczynski.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:59.000
 My fact this week is that lemurs and loruses like their liquor are strong as possible.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.720
 And this is from a new study that's just been done.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.640
 And it was a study that was done on the slow lorus and the ii lemur.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.520
 And they found that if you give them a range of alcoholic drinks that differ in their alcohol

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.320
 content, they always go for the strongest one.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.480
 And in fact, they'll have twice as much of the strong alcohol as the rest.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.120
 Do you feel an affinity to these animals, Anna?

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.120
 I always did.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.720
 You know, the slow loruses are so adorable and people often say the same about me.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.000
 So I couldn't guess they.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.760
 It's about 5% is the highest.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.800
 It's like getting stellar instead of carwing.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800
 Precisely.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800
 Yeah.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.800
 There's just the more alcohol the better.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.800
 Yeah.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.240
 And we don't know why because you would have thought you would have put you in a disadvantage

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:45.600
 because once you get drunk, then your motor responses are damaged and your concentration

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.360
 isn't as good and you would have thought you're easy prey.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.240
 But on the other hand, then you get calories from alcohol.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.240
 So it seems like they've developed evolved a tolerance for alcohol over the years.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.160
 Yeah, they don't get that drunk, do they?

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.280
 They certainly didn't in this experiment, no.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.320
 It's interesting how many animals like alcohol, which I haven't even insects, so I was reading

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:10.240
 a report about entomologists often use beer as bait for moths and butterflies when they

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.760
 want to catch them for something.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.640
 Yeah, so flies love alcohol as well.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.640
 Yes.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.640
 So it's just on insect.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.960
 Fruit flies go nuts for it and they actively get regularly drinking till they're drunk and

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.120
 they'll be wobbling around and they won't be able to fly properly.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:29.440
 I did read an article about them that said that males who have not mated are more likely

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.200
 to get drunk than the males who have mated in flies.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.200
 Yes.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.200
 Certainly true in my experience.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.080
 If males who have been rejected, they drown their sorrows.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.080
 Yeah, all right.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.640
 That's not going on about it.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.680
 And also, fruit flies that get drunk, but they massively lower their standards.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.640
 So when they're mating, they'll suddenly mate with anything.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.560
 So as soon as the fruit fly gets a bit pissed, it starts trying to mate with fruit flies

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.560
 of its own sex.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.000
 Let's move on from this point on their face.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.920
 So the slow loris is just about the only venomous mammal.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:05.960
 As in, it bites you and it transfers venom to you, as opposed to poisonous where if you eat

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.960
 it, you get poisoned.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.960
 Yeah.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.160
 So it's really odd though, because it keeps its venom in an elbow patch.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.160
 Yeah.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.680
 And to poison you, it has to lick the inside of its elbow where it's got these glands and

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.440
 it's accretes the poison from there and then it's got the venom in its mouth and then it's

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.280
 swills at round in its mouth with its own saliva and that activates the venom, making it

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.280
 really dangerous.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.680
 It's only, they've only killed one person documented in medical literature.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.880
 And that was somebody who went into anaphylaxis, wasn't it?

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.560
 And there are all these videos of them online being tickled and it's supposedly really adorable.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.760
 What they're actually doing is lifting up their arms to try and get to their venom glands.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.840
 So what I was going to say, if you're going to put a venom gland anywhere, don't put

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.520
 it on your elbow, which is famously the bit that's hardest to lick in the whole body.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.520
 I know.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.520
 It's a really good point.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.760
 It's a funny joke from God.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.240
 The slow loris is expense.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.720
 Do you know the gentle lemus, one of the most aggressive lemus there is?

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.720
 No.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.720
 Really?

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.720
 She's weird.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:07.440
 It's just based on a weird etymological thing where it was, it looked a little bit like a

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:11.840
 mama set whose name was haparley and haparley means gentle and so it was called the gentle

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.840
 lemus.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.840
 It's actually a complete bastard.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.840
 Wow.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.840
 In captivity they're really vicious.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.840
 That's really funny.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.840
 What do they do?

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.840
 Like what levels of viciousness?

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.840
 You can't.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.840
 You don't get near your car.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.840
 They'll care.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.840
 Just be rude online.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840
 It's not like that.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840
 Yeah.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.840
 Trolling.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.840
 Yeah.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.840
 Okay.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.840
 That's it.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.840
 That's all of our facts.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.840
