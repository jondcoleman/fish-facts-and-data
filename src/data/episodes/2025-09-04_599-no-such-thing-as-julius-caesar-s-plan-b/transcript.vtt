WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 Hi everybody, Dan and Andy here, and we have an announcement of our exciting guest today,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.400
 and then we have an apology to make, and then we have another exciting announcement.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.560
 It's an excitement sandwich.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.560
 That's true.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.840
 So joining us on the podcast today is one of our heroes, someone that we've been reading

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.480
 the books of for many years now, and who excitingly has just entered the world of podcasting herself,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.120
 and that is the historian Mary Beard.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.400
 Yes, Mary is one of Britain's best known classes.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.480
 She's brilliant.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.280
 She knows everything there is to know about the ancient world, and excitingly, her new

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.400
 podcast, all about classics, has just launched.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.280
 It's called Instant Classics.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.720
 It's very funny and interesting.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.840
 Episode one is Which Roman Emperor is Donald Trump?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.800
 So if you like the sound of Mary's stuff and you'd like to learn a bit more about the

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.200
 ancient world, check out Instant Classics.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200
 That's right.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.120
 She co-hosts it with a brilliant author called Charlotte Higgins.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 It's a very funny show.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.200
 They're going to be doing a book club based on the Odyssey, so do check it out, available

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.520
 wherever you get your podcasts.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.600
 Another thing that we need to say is sorry, Andy.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.080
 We've had some correspondents from Zak Rosolinski who says, "In the intro to your most recent

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.440
 episode, you said astronauts on the ISS could not attend your forthcoming remote live show

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.400
 at the London Podcast Festival because they do not have Wi-Fi."

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.840
 This is not true.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.160
 He says, "The ISS does have Wi-Fi, although it is more used for navigation and whatnot

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.080
 than downloading podcasts."

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.160
 But astronauts do have an approved list of downloadable materials, so all we need to

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.000
 do is get on to the International Space Station list of approved materials, and then they

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.480
 too will be able to attend on the 5th and 6th of September.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.440
 For a week afterwards, guys, you can buy your tickets a bit late and still stream the London

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.960
 Podcast Festival, no such thing as official live shows.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 They're going to be great.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 That's right.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.920
 We've got Jamie Morton and my dad wrote a porno joining us on the 5th of September,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.360
 and then Richard Osman joining us on the 6th.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.960
 It's going to be awesome, but if you can't make it to those live shows, guess what?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.840
 We are announcing another live show.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.080
 Our cup runneth over, your cup runneth over.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.120
 The cups are all too full.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.720
 Come to Cheltenham on the 16th of October.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.000
 We are playing the Cheltenham Literature Festival, and we have a special guest for that show,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.300
 too, who's the brilliant Rachel Parris.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.880
 So it's going to be amazing.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.600
 Details of all of this stuff, Cheltenham and the London Podcast, are on nosuchthingasafish.com/live.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600
 Say it with me, Dan.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:32.480
 No such thing as a fish.com/live.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.480
 That's right.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.960
 Everyone's invited to Cheltenham, except astronauts.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.040
 We will not be letting any astronauts in, but everyone else, come along.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:59.480
 Okay, on with the podcast, on with the show.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.160
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.800
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Mary Beard.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.120
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.000
 from the last seven days, and in no particular order.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.680
 Here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is Mary.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.560
 Right, my fact is the answer to this question.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:37.440
 Who was, or is, the highest earning sportsperson of all time measured in prize money?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.040
 Oh, thank God.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.920
 I don't know if you know this, Mary, but I'm a massive golf fan.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.920
 The listeners will know that I love going on about golf, and it's Tiger Woods.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.920
 Well, dream on.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:55.160
 Dream on, because actually it's a man called Gaius Apuleus Diocles.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.800
 Is he also a golfer?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.680
 Golf hadn't been invented when Diocles was around.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:10.480
 No, he is a Roman champion charioteer, and his tombstone, let's assume it's reliable,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.520
 tells us that over his career he earned, and I'm going to give you in Roman money first,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:24.600
 and then I'll tell you how much it is, he earned more than 35 million cestuses.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.920
 Now it's always kind of difficult saying, so how much is that in, you know, in today's

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:38.200
 money then, well, let me say that that much 35 million cestuses will be enough to feed

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.040
 the whole population of the city of Rome, that's a million of them, in basic supplies

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.640
 for one year.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.640
 OK.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.200
 Right, so we're dealing with billions of pounds.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.680
 How many people can Tiger Woods feed, James?

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.960
 Myself and all his mistresses.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960
 What would that be?

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.400
 Is that, that's more than any sports star you're saying?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:10.560
 I'm saying that it's more than any sports star today, or any other that we have any

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.240
 historical record about.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.520
 Right, so this was on, he had this on his tombstone, can you just get my dates and tell

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.000
 them I was the highest paid sports star?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.880
 That is, well, my inference is that he doesn't actually say I'm the highest paid sports star

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.800
 in Rome, and by the way, I'm going to be the highest paid sports star ever, you know.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.520
 He just lays it out with number of victories, amount of cash won, what team he was playing

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.880
 for because he's in the transfer market in the Charity of Teams, and the total amount

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.880
 of prize money.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.320
 I love it being on a tombstone though, as in it is the equivalent of googling someone

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.120
 today, because if you google any name, you will get net worth.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.720
 On your tombstone, Andy, would you like Charter Award?

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.720
 I don't mind to boast.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.720
 I don't mind to boast.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.200
 That didn't worry Diaklis.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.560
 Diaklis was very happy to boast, so don't be too modest.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.240
 I guess one of the question is, if it's on a tombstone, does that mean it's a more reliable

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.000
 source, would you say?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 We do wonder where the info actually came from, because it's absolutely fantastically

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 detailed.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.760
 He was like, he had 870 victories when he started from the starting gates and never

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.600
 gave up first place.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:29.600
 He had 620 victories when he came from behind and made a last minute dash, and this is the

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.680
 amount of money he earned for each of them.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.800
 Now, one possibility is that Diaklis was a real nerd, and every evening he went home

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:49.320
 and wrote down 95,000 sestases having come from behind with a last minute dash, and

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.360
 he kept it in his little notebook.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.560
 It's more likely that there's a kind of wisdoms cricketer almanac.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.000
 I was just going to say now, like sports fans right now love statistics, don't they?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.720
 So what's on the tombstone is what they've got from the stats.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.720
 Amazing.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.240
 That's so interesting, but he clearly didn't catch on right.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.920
 He probably thought this is going to be huge.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.720
 Every tombstone is going to be stat packed from now on.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.720
 That's right.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.920
 Well, there are a few of us, but never quite this, I mean it looks really boring, because

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.920
 all it is, is the stats.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.720
 It's like, you know, football stats or cricket stats.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.400
 I can literally sit there and read it all day.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.400
 Golfing stats.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.040
 So I think, you know, we ought to rob Tiger Woods his nose in it really.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.040
 Oh yeah, definitely.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:46.440
 I didn't realise that chariot racing, I knew chariot racing happened in Rome, but I assumed

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:52.760
 that Rome used chariots in a military sense, and it sounds like there's not really any

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.480
 evidence they did because chariots were an older thing, and that in Rome they were for

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480
 racing.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.280
 Yeah, there's a bit of military PR with chariots, you know, just to frighten the enemy.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:11.720
 But essentially you get these fantastic resources pulling the chariots, and it's a phenomenally

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.720
 dangerous.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.880
 Boral Diocles, he died in his forties, he's lucky to stay alive that long, because you've

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:24.040
 got this really long track, more than half a kilometre, with terribly tight ends.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.760
 So you have to go up and down, you have to go round seven times, and the ends are where

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.120
 you crash, because you can't turn around the corner.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.360
 And they were called shipwrecks, now fragia, that's a chariot that kind of crashes at the

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.360
 corners.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:50.760
 And the fans were absolutely obsessive loonies, and there are accounts of the fans really

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.840
 looking after the racehorses, really looking out for them, and one of the things they used

00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.920
 to do is they used to sniff their shit, because they were really anxious that they were being

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.480
 fed the right stuff.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.400
 Because if you want to have a racehorse pulling the chariot really quick, then you've got

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.720
 to make sure that it's being given the right diet.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.280
 I would try and check at the other end of the process, I would try and check the feet.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.240
 You would have thought that was the easiest, but they knew that you wanted to know what

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.240
 came out.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.200
 I couldn't believe I was reading about Nero, so Emperor Nero, he's on a tour of Greece,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.920
 he is so into chariot racing that he decides to enter the Olympics in 67 AD, when there

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:37.120
 is no Olympics, it's not meant to be on there here, you've got a much better chance of winning

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.800
 in a non-olympic year, no, because he moves it, he moves it, but imagine I'm not naming

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.920
 any particular president of the United States, but imagine the president of the United States

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:54.760
 arrives in some country and wants to participate, but it's not actually been quite timed, well

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.440
 they just move it, don't they, that's what you do.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:03.040
 The next World Cup football is in America, isn't it, I can imagine Trump turning out.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.160
 But that story is extraordinary, because back then the Olympics were tied into religious

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.120
 connotations, they had it in a specific year, the religious rights, so all of that's out

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.000
 the window, he joins, you have four horses to your chariot in the Olympics, he shows

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.680
 up with ten horses and then cuts a corner, flips over, loses the race and still wins

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.680
 it.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:30.600
 Just like Mr Trump and Gulls, absolutely the same, one thing you know is you don't want

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.600
 to beat the emperor.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.160
 Yeah, but there was some underhand tactics that went on, I read, I don't know if this

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.080
 is true, that the white team and the red team, we don't really know much about them in literature,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.360
 but one place that we do see them a lot is in curse tablets, because a lot of the cheating

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.600
 was cursing your opponents, is that right?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.840
 But it was against the rules to curse people.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.840
 Really?

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.840
 Who was going to enforce it then?

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.240
 Yeah, the gods, maybe.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.660
 How do you, you can't check the poo coming out of the cursor to see if they've done it,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.120
 right, like that, you can do that silently.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:14.120
 And it was, the Circus Maximus was clearly, unlike the Colosseum, which was rigidly sex-segregated,

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:20.080
 men only, until you got to the really bad seats at the top when the women could sit.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.000
 For most of the time, the men and women sat together in the Circus Maximus and it's absolutely

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.800
 clear that it was a prime flirt location, a pick-up joint, right?

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.760
 Do you want to come with me and smell some hot shit?

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.760
 Do you want to come with me?

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.480
 It's a little more subtle than that, actually, do you mind terribly if I pass you by to get

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.480
 to my seat?

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.480
 Oh, did I rub your knee?

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.480
 I'm just terribly sorry.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.480
 Well, they have the October horse ritual, which is quite interesting.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.480
 Oh, very learned.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.480
 Yeah.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.160
 That is the first time anyone said that to you.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
 You are not editing that out of the show.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.160
 That's stated.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160
 That's quite...

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.160
 That's your ringtone.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.160
 That's mine.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.800
 You googled Roman horse and have found the October horse ritual.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.000
 Okay, do a back-up on it, that was good now.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 Sorry, I'd be...

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.200
 No, it's a very interesting idea that it was part of a ritual that you sacrifice a horse

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.640
 to the gods and there would be a race, a chariot race, where two people would race against

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.640
 each other.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:27.480
 Whoever won, the right-hand horse of the two horses would have its head taken off and then...

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.480
 The winner?

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.880
 Yes, because it was for the gods.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.540
 So you were sacrificing your best horse, right?

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.960
 And then a fight would happen between two people to see who could keep the head and then that

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.480
 would be displayed outside of a house.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.520
 But that must be a slightly distressing moment when you know you need your horse for another

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.560
 race and you win that one.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.640
 No, it was worth it because of the prestige of...

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:59.280
 What about Sinisca, the Spartan female chariot winner?

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.640
 Yes.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.200
 So what I read is that she won the Olympic golds but maybe she wasn't on the chariots.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200
 Yeah.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.480
 I mean, there is a problem about...

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:15.520
 Not in Rome, I can tell you, in Rome, Darkleys was on the chariot and a winner.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:23.760
 In Greece, in traditional Greece before Nero, it's not clear whether it's the chariot owner

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.040
 who is the winner or the charioteer.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:33.600
 So sometimes when people say, "Oh, so-and-so female won the chariot race," that is because

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.720
 she owned the chariot.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.280
 This is like the Queen winning the Grand National.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.280
 The Queen winning the Grand National.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.280
 She's not...

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.280
 She wasn't going over Beechersburg.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.280
 She was never on the horse, no.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.000
 So she's just patting it when it finishes.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.760
 Yeah, that's an important job, actually.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.440
 But maybe this woman might have trained the horses, is that right?

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.440
 That might have done.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.440
 We just don't know.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.440
 But you don't know.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.440
 You don't know.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.440
 So then finally, Darkleys, he retires.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.440
 Does he?

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.200
 He's a billion, billion, billionaire.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200
 What does he do?

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.000
 Does he take over the country or...?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 God only...

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.280
 Well, we have no clue.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.280
 Just disappears.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:13.120
 What he does, where he lived, he probably starts life as a slave in modern Portugal.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:19.480
 Actually, that's where we think he comes from, but makes it big in Rome.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:26.160
 If he's got 35 million cestuses, then he can afford a palace.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.920
 But we don't have no clue where he lived.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.400
 Perhaps he just lived very modestly and gave his winnings to the people.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.160
 But if he did, he didn't tell us on his tombstone.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
 You'd put that up there.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.880
 I think I might say, "And he gave it all away."

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.960
 I didn't know he was from Portugal, because that must hurt for Cristiano Ronaldo, who's

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.960
 currently there.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.480
 I was going to say, "Eat your heart out, Ronaldo."

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.120
 Not even the richest sportsman from Portugal.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.400
 Do we know why he was so good?

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.400
 What made him so...

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.400
 Look.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.400
 I'd say look.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400
 But...

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.400
 It didn't flip over.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.400
 That's not to be largely...

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.680
 I know that's the result, I'm asking why.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.680
 One stage back.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.280
 Yeah, but I think of Stephen Bradbury, the Australian figure skater, oh, speed skater,

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.000
 who won the Olympic gold, because in the semifinals, everyone in front of him fell over, and then

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 he won.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.520
 And then in the finals, exactly the same thing happened.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.440
 What if Diakles was just terrible, and he just kept coming up the back and everyone

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.440
 was shipwrecked?

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.440
 He just kept going.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.320
 He just didn't give up.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.320
 Yeah.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.000
 But I think he probably had a good fan base, though.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Yeah, it sounds good.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.520
 They were cheering him on.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.520
 We should move on, guys.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.800
 Can I put one missed to bed before we go on?

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.800
 Okay, yeah.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.960
 This is something we get sent all the time in the fishing box, and thank you very much

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.080
 to everyone who's sent it in, but it's not true, and it's about chariots, and it's about

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.080
 Roman horses.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.080
 Uh-huh.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:50.400
 It's that the size of the space shuttle rocket boosters was directly based on the size of

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.400
 Roman horses.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.800
 Like the Apollo missions, you mean?

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.800
 Yeah.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.800
 Okay.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800
 Yeah.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.080
 So there's this thing that gets sent in all the time, and it's that the standard railway

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.440
 gauge on British railways and American ones is four for eight and a half inches, and that

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:09.040
 is because the railway gauge was based on trams, and those were based on wagons, and wagons

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.680
 were based on wheel ruts on old roads, roads that were built by the Romans that were based

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.240
 on the size of two Roman horses walking next to each other because of chariots.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.240
 Great fact.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.240
 No.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.240
 No.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.240
 It's time to move on.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.240
 It's all Roman horses.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.240
 Cobblers.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240
 It's just not true.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240
 It's cobblers.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.240
 It's cobblers.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.240
 It's cobblers.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.240
 No, you've done the research.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.240
 Why is it cobblers?

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.840
 I just know it's cobblers.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.880
 Well, it's like saying that actually all clothes are based on ancient clothes because

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.760
 they're roughly the same size.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.960
 It happens to be the case that if you're building a road, you don't build it so it's

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.120
 200 feet wide.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:49.640
 It's either indirectly true in a trivial way, or it's not really true, but there's no evidence

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:54.160
 of that specific size being used in between the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and there

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.160
 you go.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.680
 Well, stop sending it into our team.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.680
 Thank you.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.080
 He comes into work very upset everybody.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:10.640
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.380
 My fact this week is that because the Confederate General Stonewall Jackson believed that one

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.600
 of his arms was much larger than the other, he used to walk around with it held in the

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.800
 air just so that he could redistribute all of the blood it was hogging.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.280
 So this is written about quite a few times.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.120
 I'm holding my hand up for some reason, as I was telling that fact.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.120
 You can put it down now.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.120
 Yes, down.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.360
 Yes, thank you.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.360
 Stonewall Jackson, he was called Thomas Jonathan Stonewall Jackson, 1824 to 1863.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:45.040
 He was a Confederate General, military officer, and he was seen as one of the most gifted

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.560
 tactical officers of that period.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.760
 Even people like Lincoln, who obviously did not like him, said, "Well, that guy was good."

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.680
 You know, they all sort of acknowledged it, but he was also a bit of an eccentric, a hypochondriac,

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.960
 and one of the things was he believed he had one incredibly long arm and that it was basically

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.400
 sucking up all the blood that he needed for the rest of his body.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.040
 Have we seen any pictures of him?

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.120
 Like obviously not photos, but are there like other photos?

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120
 There are photos of him.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.120
 1860s?

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.120
 Yeah.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.120
 And he with really long arms?

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.320
 No, they sort of cut it off at the sort of neckline so you don't really get to see it,

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.320
 from what I've seen.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.320
 What's he hiding?

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.320
 Big arm.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.320
 A big arm.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.320
 Couldn't he just measure it?

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.320
 It seems he's holding them out.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.240
 He could just come up and, it's not a rocky science, is it?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.080
 He felt that it was larger as well.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.960
 Just generally he felt like maybe there was less muscle and more blood.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.960
 Yeah, exactly.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.000
 Once you've got it into your head, there's no...

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.920
 You know that thing where you put your arms out and then you put one of them over the

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.240
 back of your neck and then it's shorter again, shorter than the other.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.240
 Oh, wow.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.240
 No, I didn't know that actually.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.280
 Well, maybe he did that one day at school and then he just got it in the sack.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.000
 Well, apparently he did do it at school, but not school as a student, as a professor.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.600
 Students used to say it was pretty weird seeing the professor sitting there with his hand up

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.800
 like he had a question and it turns out that's what he was doing and he would ride into war

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.800
 with his hand in the air.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.360
 In fact, he got shot through the hand when his hand was up in the air like a target and

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.440
 almost had his hand amputated, but it healed.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.960
 That was the Battle of Bull Run, wasn't it?

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.960
 Yeah.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.960
 Because he was in loads of battles during the Civil War.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.960
 Yeah.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.960
 But he then had a hand-related...

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.360
 I mean, his death was hand injury-related, but I can't find which hand it was.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.360
 Exactly.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.360
 I don't know.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.640
 Or at least from a cursory reading of a lot of sources.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.640
 They don't say if it was the big arm that got shot.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.560
 Because he was friendly-fired.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.560
 Yeah.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.560
 This was in 1860, certainly 1860 something, wasn't it?

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.560
 '63.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.560
 Yeah.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.560
 Thank you.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.560
 So this was 1863.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:44.640
 He was shot because he was out doing a bit of reconnaissance and some of his own troops,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.120
 some Confederate troops, saw an approaching party open fire.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.160
 He then had to have his arm amputated, and that was given a full Christian burial, because

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:59.640
 it was about to be thrown on the pile of limbs outside the surgical tent.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.440
 But the military chaplain thinks, "Look, this is a heroic arm, this is a general's arm.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.240
 We should keep it and bury it."

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.680
 And he died several days later.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.880
 We think he had pneumonia.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.880
 You know, certainly...

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880
 Well, he just had his arm cut.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880
 Yeah, certainly arm run.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.880
 I think it was the sniffle that killed him.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.880
 It was all...

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.880
 He had pneumonia.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.960
 It was him being shot related, absolutely, absolutely.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.320
 And they said to his wife, "Would you like us to get the arm back?"

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.520
 And she said, "No, it's had a Christian burial, so it should stay where it is."

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.880
 Because that was one of his other defining characteristics, was he was extremely religious.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.600
 Apparently, he would pray before having a glass of water, or before opening an envelope,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.600
 or before writing a...

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.840
 I mean, prayer was his constant.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.920
 And anyway, so he's never been reunited with his arm.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.280
 And it's there to this day with a tombstone above it.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.040
 And he's got the writing on it that says...

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.040
 What does it say?

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.640
 It says he earned more than any other confederate general.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.560
 It just says arm of Stonewall Jackson.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.520
 And that's been moved around a couple of times, so it might be directly above his arm now.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.520
 It might not.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.520
 But the arm was moved a bit.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.520
 Interesting.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.520
 Yeah.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.160
 Didn't he draw attention to himself, Rother?

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.480
 I mean, if you're kind of going into battle and you're the lead general, if you've got

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.480
 your hand up...

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.480
 Yeah, I mean, they literally shot through it.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.480
 Yes.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.480
 But isn't that a good thing?

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.480
 Because...

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.480
 Completely stupid.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.480
 You don't want to be shot in your head.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.480
 No, it's better.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.480
 Okay.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.480
 All right.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.760
 In fact, what you would probably do is put a hat on it to see if you're really tall.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.760
 And a little suit.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.760
 It got around.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:23.760
 Okay.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.760
 You are.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.040
 I think if you've got a reputation as an eccentric already...

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.040
 Just go for it.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.040
 Go for it.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.040
 Yeah.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.760
 Actually, speaking of clothing, he was well known amongst his other generals for not wearing

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.760
 flamboyant clothing.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.760
 Okay.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.960
 Right, because in the war, like, the officers had to pay for their own clothes.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960
 You didn't get a uniform.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.120
 And you had to kind of wear things that are about similar to the other guys, like a similar

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.120
 colour and stuff.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.280
 But the richer people in there, and often the officers were rich, they would just buy

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.880
 the most flamboyant thing they could get away with.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.880
 But he didn't do that.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.520
 And people thought it was a bit sus, really.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.520
 Well, he was...

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.520
 I think it was very poor, wasn't he?

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.520
 As a young man.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520
 Yeah.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.920
 He grew up extremely poor and scrabbled his way up through...

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.040
 So, how did he become a general?

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040
 I think talent.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.040
 I think he was very...

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.040
 A shio talent.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.040
 Yeah.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.040
 And a...

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040
 And a Fonyon.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.040
 He was a...

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.040
 Who wants to be a general?

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040
 Yeah.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.040
 I can see you over there.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.040
 Yeah.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.040
 He was...

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.600
 I mean, apparently, he was, you know, the politics of the Civil War aside.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.360
 He was a brilliant tactician, you know.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.880
 And I think after he died, not long after that came the Battle of Gettysburg, which obviously

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.160
 he missed, having just died.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:33.000
 And that is one of the, certainly, the huge military turning points of the wars, the Battle

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 of Gettysburg.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.560
 And his absence from it was cited by a couple of other generals at the time.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.560
 Yeah.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.640
 So, it could have changed.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.680
 How did you become a general in, like, the Roman army or the Greek army?

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.680
 Very rich.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.680
 Was it rich?

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.680
 Yes.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.320
 I mean, there's kind of two strands.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.240
 One is the career soldier.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240
 Right.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.240
 And you can go up the ladder, a career soldier, you know, a squadron, and then you become

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:01.320
 a centurion, and you might kind of go up to the sort of what we'd call the commissioned

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.320
 ranks.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.320
 Right.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.440
 But the guys who were leading it, they'd bypassed all that.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.440
 Right.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.160
 And God knows if they're any good or not.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.160
 Yeah.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.960
 Or, you know, I kind of, you know, you guys have been talking about, you know, all this

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:22.520
 brilliant tactician stuff, you sort of wonder what it is to be a brilliantly tact, tactical

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.520
 general.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.880
 I mean, I've spent a long time looking at Julius Caesar's campaigns.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:32.920
 Because, you know, Caesar is always, you know, in America, you know, he's on the syllabus

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:39.160
 at military academies, you know, how you, you know, because of his brilliance as a general,

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.040
 you know, like Old Stonewall.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.160
 But I started looking, he only had one tactic, which is he went round the back.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.160
 Right.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.160
 Right.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.680
 You get face-to-face with the army, the opposing army, and what you do is you then pen him

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.680
 in from the back.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.840
 That's what he does all the time.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.480
 You must have felt like such an idiot when you're going, "He won't do it this time."

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480
 He won't do it this time.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.920
 He wants us to think he's going to do it, but he's not.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:07.520
 And in fact, it seemed to me, and I've got terrible kind of attacks on social media for

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:12.240
 saying this, because there's an awful lot of people very, very invested in Roman military

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240
 tactics.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.240
 I think it's all like that.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.960
 It's all kind of, pen them in from the back.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.960
 And just-

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:23.480
 Was he also helped by being in charge of the Roman army as well, which was presumably the

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.840
 biggest and best at the time?

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.040
 In his rise to power, you sure?

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.040
 Yeah.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.080
 I think they're only the biggest and the best because there's more of them.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.080
 Yeah.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.160
 I mean, you can't defeat the Romans in a war.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.320
 You can defeat them in a battle.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.840
 They lose battles all over the place, and hope is at some things.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.400
 I mean, they're a laughing stock when it comes to navies, but they've always got more men.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.400
 Yeah.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.400
 So they can't lose a war.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.400
 They can lose a battle.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.400
 Interesting.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.480
 So is there not kind of tactical brilliance?

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.640
 Well, you know, when this goes out, I shall no doubt get more of these, you know, offensive

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.720
 war, you fucking moron, you don't understand Marybier, doesn't it?

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.320
 It doesn't give any crudence to the brilliance.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.320
 How many legions do you have Marybier?

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320
 That's right.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:13.400
 But if you ask me, it's the one-trick bonus, really.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.400
 Wow.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:20.200
 So Caesar, just to go back to chariots, he described, in his, not his diaries, his account-

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.200
 His commentaries.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.160
 His commentaries on the British invasion.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.520
 It's one of the only references we have contemporary to British tribes using military

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.520
 chariots.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.360
 And they were a bit, they'd gone out of fashion in rhyme for centuries by then, but we were

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.840
 still using them.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.720
 And they were like an uber across the battlefield.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.720
 Yeah.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:45.000
 And one really important myth to bust is they didn't have scythes coming out of the wheels.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Oh, okay.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 No, no, no.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 If you go to look at Boudicca on Thames Embankment, her statue, she's got a great set of scythes

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.440
 about, but I am told by my archaeological friends that this is a myth.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.440
 Okay.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.440
 Absolutely gusset.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.440
 Sorry.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.440
 I'm a bit gusset about that.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.440
 That's my, that's my chariot myth busted.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.440
 There we go.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.360
 And I've been sending that in to other podcasts for ages.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.160
 Jumping back to the modern just very quickly, so he did, he was responsible for winning

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.160
 a lot of battles.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.160
 Houston, well, Jackson.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.160
 Civil Jackson.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.160
 Modern day.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.680
 Oh, well, more, certainly more modern than the Tiber Caesar.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:26.720
 But he, one of the places that he won was Frederick's Burg in Virginia, and he beat

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:32.200
 the federal general who was Ambrose E. Burnside, friend of the podcast.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.200
 We've spoken about him before.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.700
 Inventor of sideburns.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.640
 Inventor of sideburns.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.040
 At some point Burnside, people went, it's, I love it, and I love the name, but not quite

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.360
 and they, they changed it round.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.360
 But yeah.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.360
 Two.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.360
 Because he does, he had a real set, didn't he?

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360
 Yeah.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360
 But I think I linked up to his moustache.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.720
 They weren't really sideburns.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720
 It's interesting.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.200
 He was an innovator of the four, but he hadn't perfected it.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.200
 You know what?

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.400
 On this subject, I was reading about hypochondria, and modern day hypochondria was invented kind

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:03.160
 of or defined by an American neurologist called George Beard, who didn't have a beard.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.160
 And no relation.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160
 No relation.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.160
 No relation.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.080
 Oh, what about Frank Beard, who's easy top?

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.480
 Sorry, you must get that all the time, but.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.400
 I have no relations.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.800
 On the tactical side of things, and sort of, like, does the skill exist or not, or did

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.120
 Jackson have a gift for it?

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:27.160
 Because he was a military instructor at Virginia Military Institute for a while.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.480
 And his students did not like him at all.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.200
 And the reason they didn't like him was that he was an unbelievably dull lecturer.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:39.240
 So he would, he would compose a lecture, he would recite it from memory.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.760
 He wouldn't deviate at all.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.880
 And if anyone asked him a question, he would simply spool back in his head to the bit of

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.400
 his pre-remembered lecture that he thought answered the question and just recite that

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.400
 again verbatim.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.400
 Yeah.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.400
 While subtly just reaching out his massive long arms, slapping them across the bed.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.940
 What did he do with the arm at this point?

00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:00.060
 In 1856, a group of his own alumni tried to have him sacked for poor teaching.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.060
 And they must have felt.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.060
 In 1856.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.440
 I know, they must have felt so stupid just five years later when he is the pride of the

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.440
 Confederate army.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.640
 You know, one of the greatest blah, blah, blah.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.040
 There were a lot of rumours that were about him.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.000
 I think this is one of the things where people would say stuff about him, and then if they

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.800
 were, if other sources were asked, they would say, "No, he never did that.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.800
 We never saw that."

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.080
 One of the things was that he was constantly chewing on lemons, eating lemons, just absolutely

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.080
 love lemons.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.240
 And that was written in a biography.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.560
 And then everyone who read that went, "I never saw him with a lemon.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.800
 I have no idea where that comes from."

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800
 I know where it comes from.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.800
 Yeah.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.040
 It's based on a single account of him eating a lemon on the 27th of June, 1862.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.040
 That's bad.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.280
 But three separate people saw him eat it, and they all wrote it up in their memoirs.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.720
 And so you've now got three sources saying, "Oh, he loved a lemon.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.720
 Did old Stonewall."

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.340
 That's like when I went to my ex's family for the first time, and they offered me dessert.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.880
 And I didn't really want any.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.880
 And they had some strawberries.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.040
 And I'm like, "Oh, I love strawberries."

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.240
 So I had a couple of strawberries in every dessert I've ever got.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.440
 Every present, like a T-shirt with strawberries on it, strips of strawberry fields.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.440
 Is it true that he didn't eat pepper because he thought it weakened his legs?

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.360
 Well, that was another thing that was said about him.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.360
 Yeah.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.360
 And he passed.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.360
 What do you think?

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.360
 Don't know.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.360
 I mean...

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.040
 Is it true that he wouldn't let his back touch the back of a chair because it jumbled

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.280
 his organs up?

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:20.700
 This man is sounding more and more completely barking, the more you talk about him.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:27.300
 I have not done my research like you clearly have on Stonewall Jackson, but frankly, I'm

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.300
 quite glad I haven't.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.660
 But he believed a lot of stuff.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.660
 And he has become...

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.140
 He was a definite hypochondriac.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.140
 Definitely.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.700
 And because he was tactically skilled, he's become an emblem of the kind of lost cause

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.700
 of the Civil War and people saying, "Oh, we could have won it, and we were in the right

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.700
 actually in all this."

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.740
 And I said he was a champion sleeper as well.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:49.560
 He could sleep so brilliantly that he could even, as he was eating a meal, fall asleep

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.960
 with the food in his mouth just straight away because he could just get into it that easy.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.800
 And that's tough with 11 because they're quite tart as well, aren't they?

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.600
 I read about an hypochondriac, I don't know if you know about this person, Mary, called

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.600
 Aristides.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.600
 Oh, Elias Aristides.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600
 Aristides.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.600
 Sorry, I'm not as learned as it is now.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.600
 Can't all be.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.080
 A great friend of mine.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:18.380
 That's book after book after book on his hypochondriac symptoms.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.060
 This is in the second century, at 80.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.660
 This is an ancient hypochondriac.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.660
 He's an old friend.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.660
 Yeah.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:24.660
 An old friend.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.660
 An old friend.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.220
 He just goes on and on and on.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:32.660
 But loads of posh Romans were terribly hypochondriac.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:36.860
 Marcus Aurelius, famous Stoic emperor.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:44.840
 When he is a kid, a teenager, he's always right into his cheetah about his symptoms.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:51.200
 You'll see how I get letter after letter between these two guys saying, I do hope your tummy's

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:57.080
 feeling a bit better this morning because my neck, I thought it was getting better in

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.080
 the night.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.600
 But now I wake up, I appear to have a jabbing pain going through the shoulder blade.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:11.160
 Later, Marcus Aurelius, he employs a doctor who is very keen on getting the proper sort

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:17.740
 of, um, pesteries, anal pesteries, he particularly likes, I think he's put up your bum.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.740
 Suppositories.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.740
 Okay.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:20.740
 Yeah.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.740
 Suppositories.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.740
 Pesteries is a different.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.740
 Oh God, am I giving it?

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.740
 Different hot words.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.940
 I uploaded in some ways, Marianne.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.940
 Suppositories.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.940
 Oh shit.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:29.940
 I would see you in boots, Mary.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.940
 Where are the anal pesteries?

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.940
 Oh shit.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.060
 Where are the anal pesteries?

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.260
 I think they'd know what I meant.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:41.840
 I don't think, I don't have any trouble getting, anyway, there's all Marcus Aurelius, you know.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.840
 Marcus Aurelius is all about-

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.840
 I want just suppository.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.680
 I thought he was all about disregarding the pain and discomfort of the world.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.280
 I mean, I've read the, what is it, the meditations and then they're not.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280
 Meditation.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.280
 Yeah.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.280
 Well, don't believe all you read in them.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.280
 Don't believe all you read in the meditation.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.440
 It gives you only one side of how he might like to be seen.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.060
 Cause I have quite a bad shoulder and I put it down to like looking at my phone on my

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.700
 screen all the time, but that can't be true for him.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.900
 He'd have had a tablet.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:06.900
 Very good.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.900
 Thank you.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.900
 Can I talk, just talk about Aristides.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.900
 Aristides.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:14.900
 Aristides again.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.700
 So he was basically an orator and he got nasal congestion, a sore throat, and then couldn't

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.900
 really do his oratory anymore.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:27.580
 And so he went to see the priests and they told him to lie down and allow asclepius, the

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.120
 god of medicine to appear in his dreams.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:34.400
 And then whatever happened in his dreams, he had to do them to make him feel better.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:39.800
 So one of them was like smear mud on his body and run around the temple three times.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.160
 The suppository trick as well.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.880
 The suppository trick, I'm sure, yeah, an enema of honey and to swallow a goose liver

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.880
 sausage.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.040
 Oh, that's a bad dream, isn't it?

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.440
 And there are books and books and books of this rubbish.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:33:04.700
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.940
 My fact is in 1845, there was an exhibition in London where for a shilling, you could

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:14.060
 pull a lever on a giant machine which would produce a brand new line of poetry for you

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.060
 in Latin.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.060
 Wow.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.060
 Yeah.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.060
 Popular.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.060
 So popular.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.060
 I think it was popular actually.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:25.360
 I think the inventor supposedly retired on the proceeds of this amazing machine.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:33.080
 And it is, I have to add, making a line of Latin poetry is really complicated.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.080
 Oh, right.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:39.400
 Because it's not just like, you know, what you can get out of chat GBT if you say, write

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.000
 me a poem on the spring, you know, and it comes out.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:52.340
 Because Latin poetry is done to a very, very fixed format of meter.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:57.140
 So you have to have the right stress and rhythm through the line.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.140
 So it's damn difficult.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.580
 I mean, I can't write a word of Latin verse.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:08.020
 So this machine did better than I can, I can sort of see how it's done, but I can't write

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.020
 a word.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.020
 But that's stunning.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.940
 That makes it all the more impressive because apparently there were 26 million permutations

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.760
 of line that you could get of this machine.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.800
 So it's six, it's six feet Latin hexameter.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.000
 So six different feet in the line.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 What's a feet?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.840
 A foot is like an individual unit.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:31.040
 So pentameter is a, is Iambic pentameter is the sort of famous Shakespearean meter,

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.880
 which is da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.880
 So it's like a beat, is it?

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.880
 Yeah.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.120
 But a foot will have different numbers of syllables, different numbers of syllables,

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.440
 and it's not actually by stress like others is.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.580
 It's by the length of the syllable.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:50.580
 So it's long, short, short, kind of, ah, ah, ah.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.300
 So it's really difficult.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:58.540
 I mean, it's what in the 19th century, they kind of crucify little boys on doing, you

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:05.700
 know, to write Latin hexameters with the absolute echelons of posh education, but also a complete

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:06.700
 nightmare.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.700
 Interesting.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.940
 So this machine, bloody amazing.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.940
 Wow.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:11.940
 It's stunning.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.880
 It's a work called John Clark, and he was an inventor, obviously.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.880
 And he's, I think it's took him about 13 years, sources vary, but it took a long, obviously,

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.880
 long time.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.880
 And do you know how it worked?

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:27.440
 Um, it had six cylinders, and when you pull the lever, it was exactly like a fruit machine,

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.120
 except instead of some boring old cherries, you got a beautiful line of Latin verse,

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.440
 and he had arranged it so that it was adjective noun adverb.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.440
 So it would make sense.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.440
 It actually meant something.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.440
 It actually meant something.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.560
 It actually, each line is not, yeah, it's not word salad.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.560
 It does.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.660
 It might be an eccentric meaning.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.220
 You might not be able to get a huge amount of sense, like, you know, it's not profound.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.140
 Like a lot of Latin poetry.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.140
 Right.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.100
 Um, and he was just a really interesting guy.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.020
 So he was born in 1785, died in 1853.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.780
 The machine still exists today, which is very exciting.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:57.780
 I thought you might have been to see it.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.820
 I have never been to see it, but I've read about it even before I saw that you were going

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.820
 to talk about it.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.820
 Oh, great.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.220
 Um, it's down in Somerset now, and it's in a collection of items that used to be the

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:14.040
 Clark's shoe museum because John Clark, yeah, of Clark's, no, his relatives were the shoe

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.040
 empire people.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:20.760
 While he was working in feet in poetry, they were working to put feet in shoes.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.760
 Yeah.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.760
 Amazing.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.940
 And, um, yeah, they, they held it for a while and, and it's still, it still exists.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:30.480
 I think it was going to be juiced up and renovated a bit recently, but it apparently played God

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.360
 Save the Queen while it was working.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.100
 This collection, who own it, the Alfred Gillette Trust, they, they own in their collection

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:42.180
 this machine, 25,000 shoes and a significant collection of Somerset ichthyosaur fossils.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.180
 Wow.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.660
 I mean, what a collection.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.660
 Whereabouts is it?

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.860
 And Somerset, you know, it's, I think it's literally there yesterday.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.940
 It's a village called street.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.940
 I think.

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.940
 Oh, I know that.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.940
 Yeah.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.940
 It's not far from Glastonbury.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:55.940
 That's right.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:56.940
 That's where it is.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:57.940
 Yeah.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.940
 Can I ask about the machine just jumping back to the Latin machine?

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:03.440
 So it would give you this line of poetry, but it wouldn't print it on, say, a little ticket,

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.440
 right?

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.440
 So you would just see it on the screen as it were.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.440
 I don't know.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.440
 You could take a photo of it with your phone.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.440
 You could take a photo of it.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:14.920
 So my question is, is how good was everyone's Latin back then and did someone permanently

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.140
 stand translating your line of poetry for you?

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:25.120
 I think we imagine that they were all terribly Latinate back then, but actually there'd be

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:30.700
 no period of British history after the Romans left when more than a, you know, relatively

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:37.100
 small section of the elite, unknown Latin, they've known a lot about classical culture,

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:43.220
 but a Latin, more particularly Greek, but even Latin education was still largely for

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.660
 boys and largely for the rich ones.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:53.380
 So I mean, there were some, you know, clever auto-died acts who taught themselves Latin,

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:59.160
 but who this machine was for, why would anybody who didn't know how difficult it was to compose

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.480
 Latin poetry be remotely impressed?

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.480
 Yeah.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:10.600
 And some people have thought that it was actually a kind of pistachio, rather expensive, very

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.080
 long-term pistachio.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.080
 13 years of my life.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.360
 13 years of my life on a joke, right?

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.880
 This is going to be great.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:23.780
 I mean, I don't think this is correct, but some people have argued that the 1840s, this

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:29.020
 is when these, you know, these little boys, private schools were spending hour after hour

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:33.540
 after hour learning how to compose this Latin poetry.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.500
 And what this bloke is saying, what Mr. Clark is saying, he's like, "I can get a machine

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.500
 to do it."

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.500
 Yeah, I see.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.700
 It's actually undercutting some of that.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.620
 But then that's still true, like now, like my school, we had one Latin teacher for the

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:48.500
 entire school of a thousand kids, right?

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.360
 Well, that's a lot more than many have.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.360
 Yeah, exactly.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.800
 And it's like, there was a report in 2021 that said that staff in the British Civil

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:01.040
 Service are routinely telling jokes in Latin to exclude lower-class colleagues.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:06.600
 So, okay, it is quite an elitist thing still, isn't it, learning Latin or Greek?

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.000
 And is that a problem?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.360
 And should we be teaching everyone it, or shouldn't we be teaching anyone it?

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:16.520
 I think that you should be giving everyone the opportunity to learn it.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.220
 And Latin's always in crisis.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.260
 I mean, in the early 20th century, they were saying Latin was about to die, right?

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:26.780
 Well, you know, it's taken a very long time to do so, if that was the case.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:32.700
 But I was talking quite recently to a teacher at an ordinary state comprehensive school where

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.300
 she had reintroduced some Latin for the kids.

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.760
 And she said, "Well, it was great about it.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.760
 It was two things.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.260
 First of all, you didn't have to speak it."

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.260
 Right?

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:47.200
 And it wasn't that it helped you necessarily with other languages or whatever though it

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.200
 might.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.760
 It was that you didn't have to spend all your time learning how to ask for a pizza in it

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.760
 or whatever.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.080
 So, you were just looking at the language.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:00.760
 She also said, "It's not like when you start introducing French or German, whatever you

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:07.880
 suddenly discover, that misprivileged here is going on for a week, weekend at half-term,

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.580
 to get her French better at mum and dad's French chateau."

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.820
 No one's going off to the Vatican for the week.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.540
 No one is going off to the Vatican for the week.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.260
 And she said it was really levelling, actually.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.260
 That's a really good point.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:22.900
 Because anybody could be good at it and nobody had that kind of built-in advantage.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.900
 You know what?

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:27.060
 Everyone in my school was equally good at it because there would be like a quiz at the

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:33.980
 end of each lesson and there'd be ten questions and then you'd have to shout out your score

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:39.180
 and everyone got six out of ten because the Latin word for six is sex.

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:43.440
 And so, literally, we all deliberately got six out of ten so we just went round the class

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.040
 and never went, "Sex, sex, sex."

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:53.440
 You know, what's great about Latin, though, is that everybody remembers their Latin lessons

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.520
 and their Latin teacher and people tend not to remember their geography teacher, you know?

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:05.540
 But Latin, it has, you know, it really, really kind of gets to you.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.260
 And you remember how you took the piss out of the teacher or whatever, but you'd never

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.260
 forget it.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:11.300
 I don't know until I was 18.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.300
 Did you?

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.300
 Yeah.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.300
 And so, how is it?

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.300
 My Latin.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.300
 You're still doing it onto your lingo, aren't you?

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.300
 That's right.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.300
 Yeah.

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:23.480
 That's only so I can tease my civil service colleagues, though, you know?

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.480
 It was great.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.160
 We had to do it at lunchtimes, like instead of playing football, you can either play football

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.160
 or do Latin.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.400
 And you chose, did you choose Latin?

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.400
 It was chosen for me.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.400
 I see.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.400
 I see.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.400
 And do you regret it?

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.400
 No, I loved it.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.400
 I really loved it.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.400
 Yeah, it was mega fun.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.000
 We never did it, but I was in Hong Kong, so I don't think it was an option.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 It's useful in weird ways.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.960
 I do think it's useful for other languages, as in it's genuinely you sort of see how things

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.960
 fit together.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.720
 But the thing I can't get is this time where it was so common, like law was all in Latin,

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:55.040
 so people in ordinary people in courtrooms couldn't really understand what was going

00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:00.480
 on because courtroom business was all conducted in Latin until 1362.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480
 Lots of church services.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480
 Lots of church.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:08.160
 Look at the whole Catholic church, it existed on Latin until relatively recently.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.240
 Grammar schools were founded to teach Latin to members of the clergy because it was important

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.240
 to have good Latin.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.800
 In primary school, we would have to sing Latin hymns.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.800
 Would you?

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.800
 Wow.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.760
 I think it was one of the journalists who got the scoop that the Pope was stepping down

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.720
 because he delivered it in Latin and she was the only one there who could understand it.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.720
 Yes.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.720
 Yes.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.120
 There's also such good stuff written in it.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:38.160
 You're actually there with what someone wrote 2000 years ago, and it's still bloody amazing.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.680
 It transports you, I guess, right?

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.680
 It is.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.680
 It's about time travel.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.680
 Yeah.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:49.160
 Virgil's Aeneid, right? His first century BC poem on the foundation of Rome.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.400
 What I'm going to say is it's a bit of an exaggeration, or at least I couldn't prove

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:58.640
 it, but I'm pretty certain it's true, that there hasn't been a day since 19 BC when Virgil

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.080
 popped his clogs, when someone in the world hasn't been reading the Aeneid.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:09.320
 It's been read and recited and studied without a gap for 2000 years.

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.880
 I think it's just great.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.880
 Okay.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.880
 Sold.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.240
 As long as you don't make it, just posh boys only.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.240
 Yeah.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.400
 You never did Latin.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.960
 One person who didn't agree with you was a guy called William Barnes, who was a linguist

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.960
 who taught himself Greek and Latin because he didn't want any Greek or Latin words in

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.760
 the English language.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:37.400
 And so he started coining new words to do away with the Latin.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:43.320
 So like for instance, instead of the word grammar, he called it speechcraft.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.840
 Instead of ornithology, he called it bird law.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.120
 I quite like bird law.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.120
 Bird law is quite good.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.120
 Yeah.

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.120
 These are all quite good.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.440
 Instead of flexible, he wanted people to say Benson.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:56.400
 And he was like basically saying that people should speak English as in that Anglo-Saxon

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:01.920
 language, not as a Greek slash, which I think even he thought it was just a bit of fun,

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.920
 to be honest.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:03.920
 When was he around?

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.920
 He was around the 19th century.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.280
 About the same time as your Latin machine.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.280
 Yeah.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.280
 Oh yeah.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.280
 Yeah.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:17.400
 But there's only one thing that's still in the OED, which the definition says W Barnes

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.920
 term for.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.680
 And that word is push whaling.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.200
 So W-A-I-L-I-N-G push whaling.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.200
 Push whaling.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.200
 You know what that is?

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.200
 Push whaling.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.200
 Force crying.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.200
 So faking emotion.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.200
 Faking emotion now.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.200
 That sounds like labour.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.200
 Giving birth.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.200
 Good guess.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.200
 You're pushing and you're whaling?

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.200
 No.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.200
 I'm pretty much close.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:45.520
 But it was, the definition in the OED is W Barnes term for a pram, pram plate.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.320
 And that's still in the OED today?

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.320
 That's amazing.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.320
 Push whaling.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.760
 As preparation for today, I'd listen to a bit of Cuomodo Diccita, which is the Latin

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.760
 podcast.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:45:00.520
 And it's a few, it's really fun, like it's a few very nerdy people who've well versed

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.760
 in it and made a study of it.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.280
 And they do it at a kind of slow, slow enough speed that you can just about sort of cling

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.280
 on to it.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.280
 And it's, it's fun.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.280
 It's really interesting because you never hear it spoken normally.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.280
 Well, thank God.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:16.800
 I mean, I think there used to be a set of, you know, slightly eccentric people in Finland

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:22.440
 who did the news in Latin, you know, each week, I think it was, and you think, what's

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.440
 the point?

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.880
 You know, what is the point?

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:25.880
 Oh, it was fun.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.880
 Cuomodo Diccita is fun.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.880
 It's fun.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.880
 It's good.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:29.880
 But I want to read things like the Romans wrote.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.600
 I don't want to sit listening to the news, read by some bloody fins in Latin.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:39.000
 Is your podcast about the modern day button Latin, Andy, the one you're talking about?

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.560
 Yeah, they start with how, what have you been up to?

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:46.120
 This is not difficult, like, because there isn't a Latin word for, you know, telephone,

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.120
 for instance.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.120
 Yes, I think they do.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.120
 They haven't defined a lot of work around here.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.120
 Yeah.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.120
 They haven't started living like Romans to make it more effective.

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.120
 Yeah, yeah.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.520
 The effort reward ratio does not seem to make too much sense.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:01.160
 Is your Latin good enough that if you went to Vatican City, you could use their ATM

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.160
 machines?

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.160
 Oh.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.160
 They give you a Latin option?

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.800
 I think you can use ATM machines in most language.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.320
 You don't need to be able to speak a language.

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.160
 Yeah, I'll jab until numbers come up, and then I'll select immediate.

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.160
 And then what you do is you look at all the numbers and you don't understand the current

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.160
 scene.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.040
 You choose the second smallest number, and you go for that, because that's probably about

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.040
 10 quid.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.040
 Because that's probably doable.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.040
 And you pull the big handle.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.040
 Yeah.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.040
 And then a line of poetry comes up.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:35.440
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:41.680
 OK, my fact this week is that the biographer of 7th century French king, Dagoburt I, didn't

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:48.680
 include a list of his lovers because they said it would make the book too long to read.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.680
 Same.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.680
 Same.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.680
 I'm waiting.

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.680
 I'm waiting.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.680
 I'm staring at Andy.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.680
 Waiting.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.680
 There's not a gravestone big enough.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.680
 Oh, dear.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:04.680
 Just a bed post, your tombstone, full of notches.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.680
 Oh, my God.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.680
 Sorry.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.680
 No.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.680
 That is very funny.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.120
 Is that the biographer trying to praise Dagoburt by saying how marvellous he was about it?

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.120
 No, not really.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.120
 I don't think so.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.240
 I don't think it was very positive thing.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.320
 So I read this in BBC History Magazine.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.320
 It was part...

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.320
 Well, it must be true.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.320
 And I have subsequently checked it.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.560
 God, I love you, Mary.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.360
 We're going to get letters from geography teachers.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.520
 We're going to get letters from BBC History.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.880
 If you are going to send a letter in about this episode, if it's not in Latin, we're

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.000
 not going to read it.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.880
 So it's part of the Q&A section where they answer questions that someone might ask about

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.880
 history.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.920
 And the question was, how responsible was King Dagoburt I for the decline of the Merovingians?

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:49.040
 Which I think is a question we're always asking ourselves, aren't we?

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.040
 Absolutely.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.280
 And it turns out these Merovingians, they were a group that came up with this.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.400
 They came after the Romans, right, Mary?

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.160
 So maybe you don't like them so much, because...

00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.920
 I know nothing about them.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:03.160
 I was delighted that you were going to take us into the Merovingians.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:07.000
 Because, you know, I've always been busting to know a bit more about them.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.240
 Well, they were very big around the 5th century AD.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:13.920
 They ruled in what's now France, Germany, Belgium.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.880
 And Dagoburt came along.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.800
 And he was a bit of a black sheep.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.440
 And he was dog by scandal.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.520
 He moved the court to Paris because he was a bit of a playboy.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.880
 And there was lots of fun happening in Paris.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.760
 He lived in loads of luxury, tried to get as much gold as possible.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:33.120
 And he'd previously married his stepsister to cement the monarchy, as was quite common

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.120
 in those days.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.120
 Dagoburt.

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.120
 But he divorced her as soon as his father died.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.080
 Because his father was the one who was kind of organising it all.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.520
 He got in charge, divorced his wife, and then just went through loads and loads of affairs.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:50.280
 And basically all this debauchery was the beginning of the end for the Merovingians.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.040
 So it's a moral tale, really.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.040
 It really is.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.040
 Yeah.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.040
 It seems like that, doesn't it?

00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:03.520
 And the biographer links his sort of personal lust with his lust for ecclesiastical lands.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:08.200
 You know, it always starts with first, and eventually you're on the ecclesiastical lands.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.920
 That's what you lust after eventually.

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:16.360
 This all comes, I should say, from the Chronicle of Fredegar, which was the 7th century Frankish

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.920
 Chronicle written about the Merovingian kings.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.920
 Because we all know that anyway.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.920
 Yeah.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.680
 I have never come across the Merovingians before.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.120
 It's kind of a word you hear, like the guy in the Matrix?

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.120
 Yeah.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.120
 The guy in the Matrix.

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.120
 But they were the ruling family, weren't they, of the Frankish kingdom.

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.640
 And they were the ones who came before like Charlemagne and...

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.640
 Yeah.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.640
 We've heard of them.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:42.480
 The Romans are fine, the Carolingians are fine, but it's the Merovingians which...

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:46.600
 The Merovingians, when you look them up, there's one thing that comes up on a lot of pages

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.480
 and it separates them from the Romans and the Carolingians, which is long hair was seen

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.300
 as power in their society.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:50:02.600
 Roulous had long hair and there's a professor called James Palmer who said that basically

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:06.000
 if there was someone who was an heir to the throne that they thought it's not going to

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.080
 be quite good enough, they would shave their head, pop them into a monastery like a monk.

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.200
 But have them on standby because they haven't gone bold, they can grow back right.

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.920
 And if the person then, who's been put in power, was seen as bad, they can knock that

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.200
 person out and bring back the monk.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.640
 Can I say, if you're like the next in line for the Merovingians and you start going bold,

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.640
 is that you done?

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.640
 Well, yeah.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.520
 There's no hair transplants in those days.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.520
 No, exactly.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.520
 It's...

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.520
 There's wigs though.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.520
 Ah.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.520
 Okay.

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.520
 There we go.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.040
 But it was a tool of state power that one of the queens was called Clotild and she was

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:42.640
 6th century queen, widow of King Clovis and Clovis, by the way, is where we get Louis

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.640
 from.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:47.840
 Clovis, knock off the sea, you got Lovis, that's why so many French kings are called

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.840
 Louis.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.840
 Is it?

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.840
 It was all from Clovis, yeah.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:56.160
 Anyway, her grandsons were meant to be crowned, they were slated next up, all of this.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:01.080
 And then some plotters in the family abducted them and dispatched a henchman to Queen Clotild

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.320
 saying, "We've got a pair of scissors here and a sword here.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.280
 Which do you want for your grandsons?"

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:11.760
 And the idea was either we can execute them as royals or we can cut their hair, which

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.520
 means their life won't be worth living, they'll be living as non-royals.

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.280
 And she said, "Sword please, sword please for my grandsons."

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.280
 Wow.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.800
 I'd rather that than a haircut, which means a non-royal life.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.800
 Big decision.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.800
 Yeah, that's hard.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.760
 And the Carolingians, when they came in, had to separate themselves from the whole long

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.240
 hair thing, so they went for the mustache.

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.240
 Yeah.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.240
 That was their big thing.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.240
 Yeah.

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.240
 Charlemagne, picture his long mustache.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.240
 Lovely.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.240
 Yeah.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.400
 I couldn't tell you what Charlemagne looked like, I must say.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.840
 What's weird is, I'm not actually sure I've seen a picture of him, I just have conjured

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.840
 that in my head.

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:45.320
 Here's one thing I found about Dagoburt, which I'd never heard before.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:50.840
 He was the first French king to be crowned on a folding chair, like a fishing chair.

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:56.040
 And I was reading about these folding chairs, and apparently it was one of the best things

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.280
 you could have for quite a lot, like in ancient Rome.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.280
 Interesting.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:04.160
 What I mean, it's like an X-shape legs and then almost like a cloth belt, but it was

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.520
 actually made of sort of like a director's chair.

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.520
 But without a back.

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.520
 But without a back.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.520
 Yeah.

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.200
 And they were made of wood, and they were huge in ancient Egypt.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.080
 There's one in the British Museum, Tutankhamun was buried with two of them, and now it's

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.960
 mostly people watching golf.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.120
 The kings of our age.

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:27.480
 The Emperor Augustus took one to the opening of a rather posh theatre, and he fell off

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.720
 his very bad, bad size, he fell off his folding chair.

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.160
 I bet no one laughed at that.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:36.000
 Well only, it was a bit of a risk to tell off it.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
 Wow.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.840
 That's a quite famous ruler of this period, Dagobot the Second.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:42.840
 Oh yeah.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.840
 Don't get me started on that.

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:45.840
 Oh boy.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:46.840
 Here we go again.

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.400
 Down's on his hobby horse.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.880
 Well, you never know how history is going to replace you and your story into new light,

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:57.200
 and that's what happened with Dagobot the Second, because he disappeared and no one quite

00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.600
 knows was he murdered, what was the end of his story.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:06.640
 Cut to many, many years later, this hoax is set up, this thing called the Priory of Scion,

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:12.200
 where the idea is that they are looking after the bloodline of the Merovingians, and then

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:17.160
 that gets picked up by the writers of a book, which is all about the bloodline of Christ,

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.840
 and brought into that.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:22.080
 So the Merovingians are the descendants of Christ, is the slave.

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.400
 Exactly, the Da Vinci code is largely…

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.760
 Do you want to retract your very learned comment from earlier, Mary?

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.440
 No, it's not my theory, and I made sure this fact was last at the show, so if Mary walked

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.480
 out we'd have enough in the tank.

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.240
 Do you want to know the truth about the Merovingians, Dan?

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.120
 This is the truth.

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:42.480
 This was a claim made at the time, not by the kings themselves, but I think by people around

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:48.720
 them, that they were descended from a sea monster, not from a god, but a specific…

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.720
 Have you heard of a…

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.720
 I think your cab's here, Mary.

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.720
 Have you heard of a quina tour?

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.880
 Like a quina tour, but not.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.880
 Exactly.

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:59.080
 But with quins, so with five horns.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:02.240
 The quina tour is the most ridiculous looking animal you'll ever see.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.080
 It's a half-bull, half-fish, but it's got five horns up front.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:11.080
 It's because the word Merovech, where we get Merovingian, it means sea-bull, so…

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.080
 Oh, of course.

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.080
 I've forgotten.

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.080
 I've forgotten.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.600
 So the quina tour, supposedly, is the answer.

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.040
 Is his head like one of those, you know those ring-toss things that kids have?

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.040
 Exactly like that.

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.040
 Does it look like that?

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.040
 Exactly like that.

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.040
 Yeah, and they're different colours for different prizes.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.800
 This was so embarrassing when he was trying to give a good talk and just a hoop would

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.800
 land on his…

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:31.480
 Guys, come on, five minutes, put a big speech there.

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.280
 So this fact was about biographers and stuff.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:38.880
 And I want to know, what I read is that it was quite dangerous to be a biographer in

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:44.200
 ancient times, because you basically had to… you had to say really nice things about the

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:49.480
 person you're biographising, but you couldn't go over the top because it would seem like

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.680
 you were being too obsequious.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.960
 But then on the other hand, if you said anything bad, you could basically be put to death.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.960
 Right.

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.360
 So there was an obvious answer to this.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.560
 You wait till they're dead before you write the biography.

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.560
 Okay.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.080
 So your publishers are going to be on your mirrors, mirrors really looking forward to

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.080
 seeing a proof.

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.080
 Exactly.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:11.160
 And you're half the advance, yeah, it's not.

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:15.760
 I'm sorry, the last chapter's taken me a bit longer than I thought it was going to

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.280
 run working on it.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.280
 Interesting.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:23.680
 You just, you know, one thing you never want to do is to talk about the emperor while he's

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.680
 alive.

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.680
 Yeah.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:29.560
 The other thing about the biographers is how much of it was true, right?

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:34.720
 See, probably very little, particularly if you're dealing with the concupines of Dacabere,

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.720
 I suspect.

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:41.760
 But when I was a student, a long time ago, we were always taught now you've got to go

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.280
 through all these biographies and you've got to get your blue pencil out and you've

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:49.440
 got to, you've got to put a line through all the bits that can't possibly be true.

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:52.880
 So you do that and then you come to some bits and think, could it be true?

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:58.800
 Well, maybe it could be put a question mark and I spent years of my life doing that really.

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:02.820
 Because I, in the last few years, I've realised it's not the point.

00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:07.200
 The point is that people believe this stuff, you know.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.700
 It's taking you a bit into the kind of way we think about monarchs and celebs, et cetera.

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:18.840
 We tell these stories about their excesses, which are not true, but they certainly tell

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:24.720
 us about how we envisage, you know, it goes right down to the kind of innocent King Charles,

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:25.720
 doesn't it?

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:30.120
 You know, he has someone who puts toothpaste on his toothbrush for him.

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:35.080
 The story about King Charles is that he had like 12 different eggs made every morning

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.840
 of different hardness and he would choose which one to eat and stuff.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:45.640
 And you know, that goes right back to the ancient world because there's a story about

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:52.440
 the kitchens of Antony and Cleopatra and kind of next to Eyewitness visits the kitchens

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:56.200
 and there's eight boars roasting, right?

00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:03.600
 And the guy says to the cook, "God, you must be expecting a large party to dinner tonight."

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.000
 And the cook says, "No, it's just we don't quite know when they're going to sit down

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:13.080
 to eat, so we put them all on at different times so that one will be ready when they

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.080
 want it."

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.080
 And that's just like the boar's example.

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.080
 It's so funny.

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:17.080
 Cool?

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:22.320
 I have 12 microwaves in my house and I put one frozen lasagna in each.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:29.800
 But I was brought up with the idea that the Queen's corgis, the late Queen's corgis,

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.120
 ate out of silver dishes.

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:37.800
 And I once went to do some filming in Windsor Castle with a film crew and we had to go quite

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:41.440
 near the sort of more domestic apartments.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:49.000
 And as we passed the door to the pets area, we all looked at each other because lined

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.320
 up by the door were a load of very nasty plastic bowls.

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.320
 Wow.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:59.320
 They were for the staff, they were for the staff.

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:03.280
 Everybody said, "So it's not true, then."

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.280
 But the point where you're saying is the fact that we think that about the royal family

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:11.320
 tells us a lot more about life today than whether it's true or not.

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.320
 And that's what we want to believe as well.

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:18.320
 About how we imagine power, how we imagine wealth, what would we do if we had unlimited

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.320
 wealth?

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.560
 Well, my dog would eat out of silver bowls.

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:28.080
 I feel a bit sorry for Dagoburt the first though, you know, because if you're a monarch,

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:33.280
 one thing they always get you for is too much sex, isn't it?

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:38.200
 It's always, we couldn't possibly fit the names of all the concubines in.

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:42.960
 One of the definitions of a monarch is that they have more sex than everybody else.

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:48.960
 And that's partly about power, but then it gets used against them as they're absolutely

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:52.160
 lurid bastards who you can't trust.

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:57.360
 And in Rome, of course, the wives are having too much sex as well.

00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.520
 Is that the slander or the reputation?

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:03.560
 That's what's always been, that is always a reputation that, you know, the emperor

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:09.440
 Claudius' wife, Messalina, one story about her cannot possibly be true, but it's a real

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:15.160
 revelation is that she's supposed to have challenged the prostitutes of Rome to a competition

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:19.520
 of who could sleep with most men in one night.

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.600
 And she won, of course.

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:26.160
 She fell off halfway through, but the judges decided that she had won.

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:30.720
 And you think you can't win with your sex life if you're a ruler.

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:35.040
 When the truth is, they were all happy that once a year like the rest of us.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:39.640
 In a very boring way.

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:46.520
 Dagobah's reputation has recovered because now in France, there's a phrase, Le bon roi

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.480
 dagobah, the good King Dagobah.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:52.680
 And it's basically the ultra basic nursery rhyme that French children learn and are sung

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.680
 by their parents.

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.920
 Like Old King Cole is a merry old song.

00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.920
 It's exactly like that.

00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.760
 And it's all, there's a French revolutionary song, Le bon roi dagobah, because that was

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:05.000
 a way of making fun of kings and monarchy without actually making fun of King Louis

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
 XVI.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.240
 It was two years before the revolution, this song was written as a way of satirising the

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.480
 monarchy.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.480
 But now that's survived.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.480
 And it's one of the absolute root one lullabies in France.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.640
 But they don't tell them about his sex life, though.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.640
 That's a later verse.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.640
 It's normally skipped.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:32.720
 That's when he calls for his fiddle as three, that's what that's all about.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720
 OK, that's it.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.720
 That is all of our facts.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.080

 You'll also see links to live tickets, bits of merch, all that stuff.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.340
