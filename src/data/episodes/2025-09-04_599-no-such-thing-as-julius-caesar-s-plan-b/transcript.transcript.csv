00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everybody, Dan and Andy here, and we have an announcement of our exciting guest today,"
00:00:05,00:00:09,"and then we have an apology to make, and then we have another exciting announcement."
00:00:09,00:00:11,It's an excitement sandwich.
00:00:11,00:00:12,That's true.
00:00:12,00:00:16,"So joining us on the podcast today is one of our heroes, someone that we've been reading"
00:00:16,00:00:22,"the books of for many years now, and who excitingly has just entered the world of podcasting herself,"
00:00:22,00:00:25,and that is the historian Mary Beard.
00:00:25,00:00:28,"Yes, Mary is one of Britain's best known classes."
00:00:28,00:00:29,She's brilliant.
00:00:29,00:00:33,"She knows everything there is to know about the ancient world, and excitingly, her new"
00:00:33,00:00:35,"podcast, all about classics, has just launched."
00:00:35,00:00:38,It's called Instant Classics.
00:00:38,00:00:39,It's very funny and interesting.
00:00:39,00:00:41,Episode one is Which Roman Emperor is Donald Trump?
00:00:41,00:00:44,So if you like the sound of Mary's stuff and you'd like to learn a bit more about the
00:00:44,00:00:47,"ancient world, check out Instant Classics."
00:00:47,00:00:48,That's right.
00:00:48,00:00:51,She co-hosts it with a brilliant author called Charlotte Higgins.
00:00:51,00:00:52,It's a very funny show.
00:00:52,00:00:56,"They're going to be doing a book club based on the Odyssey, so do check it out, available"
00:00:56,00:00:58,wherever you get your podcasts.
00:00:58,00:01:02,"Another thing that we need to say is sorry, Andy."
00:01:02,00:01:07,"We've had some correspondents from Zak Rosolinski who says, ""In the intro to your most recent"
00:01:07,00:01:11,"episode, you said astronauts on the ISS could not attend your forthcoming remote live show"
00:01:11,00:01:15,"at the London Podcast Festival because they do not have Wi-Fi."""
00:01:15,00:01:16,This is not true.
00:01:16,00:01:21,"He says, ""The ISS does have Wi-Fi, although it is more used for navigation and whatnot"
00:01:21,00:01:23,"than downloading podcasts."""
00:01:23,00:01:27,"But astronauts do have an approved list of downloadable materials, so all we need to"
00:01:27,00:01:33,"do is get on to the International Space Station list of approved materials, and then they"
00:01:33,00:01:37,too will be able to attend on the 5th and 6th of September.
00:01:37,00:01:41,"For a week afterwards, guys, you can buy your tickets a bit late and still stream the London"
00:01:41,00:01:43,"Podcast Festival, no such thing as official live shows."
00:01:43,00:01:44,They're going to be great.
00:01:44,00:01:45,That's right.
00:01:45,00:01:48,"We've got Jamie Morton and my dad wrote a porno joining us on the 5th of September,"
00:01:48,00:01:52,and then Richard Osman joining us on the 6th.
00:01:52,00:01:56,"It's going to be awesome, but if you can't make it to those live shows, guess what?"
00:01:56,00:01:59,We are announcing another live show.
00:01:59,00:02:03,"Our cup runneth over, your cup runneth over."
00:02:03,00:02:05,The cups are all too full.
00:02:05,00:02:07,Come to Cheltenham on the 16th of October.
00:02:07,00:02:12,"We are playing the Cheltenham Literature Festival, and we have a special guest for that show,"
00:02:12,00:02:14,"too, who's the brilliant Rachel Parris."
00:02:14,00:02:15,So it's going to be amazing.
00:02:15,00:02:22,"Details of all of this stuff, Cheltenham and the London Podcast, are on nosuchthingasafish.com/live."
00:02:22,00:02:23,"Say it with me, Dan."
00:02:23,00:02:32,No such thing as a fish.com/live.
00:02:32,00:02:33,That's right.
00:02:33,00:02:36,"Everyone's invited to Cheltenham, except astronauts."
00:02:36,00:02:41,"We will not be letting any astronauts in, but everyone else, come along."
00:02:41,00:02:59,"Okay, on with the podcast, on with the show."
00:02:59,00:03:04,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:03:04,00:03:07,to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:03:07,00:03:08,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:03:08,00:03:12,"I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Mary Beard."
00:03:12,00:03:16,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts"
00:03:16,00:03:19,"from the last seven days, and in no particular order."
00:03:19,00:03:22,"Here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is Mary."
00:03:22,00:03:27,"Right, my fact is the answer to this question."
00:03:27,00:03:37,"Who was, or is, the highest earning sportsperson of all time measured in prize money?"
00:03:37,00:03:39,"Oh, thank God."
00:03:39,00:03:41,"I don't know if you know this, Mary, but I'm a massive golf fan."
00:03:41,00:03:45,"The listeners will know that I love going on about golf, and it's Tiger Woods."
00:03:45,00:03:46,"Well, dream on."
00:03:46,00:03:55,"Dream on, because actually it's a man called Gaius Apuleus Diocles."
00:03:55,00:03:57,Is he also a golfer?
00:03:57,00:04:00,Golf hadn't been invented when Diocles was around.
00:04:00,00:04:10,"No, he is a Roman champion charioteer, and his tombstone, let's assume it's reliable,"
00:04:10,00:04:15,"tells us that over his career he earned, and I'm going to give you in Roman money first,"
00:04:15,00:04:24,"and then I'll tell you how much it is, he earned more than 35 million cestuses."
00:04:24,00:04:28,"Now it's always kind of difficult saying, so how much is that in, you know, in today's"
00:04:28,00:04:38,"money then, well, let me say that that much 35 million cestuses will be enough to feed"
00:04:38,00:04:45,"the whole population of the city of Rome, that's a million of them, in basic supplies"
00:04:45,00:04:46,for one year.
00:04:46,00:04:47,OK.
00:04:47,00:04:51,"Right, so we're dealing with billions of pounds."
00:04:51,00:04:54,"How many people can Tiger Woods feed, James?"
00:04:54,00:04:58,Myself and all his mistresses.
00:04:58,00:04:59,What would that be?
00:04:59,00:05:02,"Is that, that's more than any sports star you're saying?"
00:05:02,00:05:10,"I'm saying that it's more than any sports star today, or any other that we have any"
00:05:10,00:05:12,historical record about.
00:05:12,00:05:16,"Right, so this was on, he had this on his tombstone, can you just get my dates and tell"
00:05:16,00:05:19,them I was the highest paid sports star?
00:05:19,00:05:25,"That is, well, my inference is that he doesn't actually say I'm the highest paid sports star"
00:05:25,00:05:30,"in Rome, and by the way, I'm going to be the highest paid sports star ever, you know."
00:05:30,00:05:37,"He just lays it out with number of victories, amount of cash won, what team he was playing"
00:05:37,00:05:43,"for because he's in the transfer market in the Charity of Teams, and the total amount"
00:05:43,00:05:44,of prize money.
00:05:44,00:05:48,"I love it being on a tombstone though, as in it is the equivalent of googling someone"
00:05:48,00:05:52,"today, because if you google any name, you will get net worth."
00:05:52,00:05:54,"On your tombstone, Andy, would you like Charter Award?"
00:05:54,00:05:55,I don't mind to boast.
00:05:55,00:05:56,I don't mind to boast.
00:05:56,00:05:58,That didn't worry Diaklis.
00:05:58,00:06:01,"Diaklis was very happy to boast, so don't be too modest."
00:06:01,00:06:06,"I guess one of the question is, if it's on a tombstone, does that mean it's a more reliable"
00:06:06,00:06:08,"source, would you say?"
00:06:08,00:06:13,"We do wonder where the info actually came from, because it's absolutely fantastically"
00:06:13,00:06:14,detailed.
00:06:14,00:06:20,"He was like, he had 870 victories when he started from the starting gates and never"
00:06:20,00:06:22,gave up first place.
00:06:22,00:06:29,"He had 620 victories when he came from behind and made a last minute dash, and this is the"
00:06:29,00:06:32,amount of money he earned for each of them.
00:06:32,00:06:39,"Now, one possibility is that Diaklis was a real nerd, and every evening he went home"
00:06:39,00:06:49,"and wrote down 95,000 sestases having come from behind with a last minute dash, and"
00:06:49,00:06:52,he kept it in his little notebook.
00:06:52,00:06:57,It's more likely that there's a kind of wisdoms cricketer almanac.
00:06:57,00:07:03,"I was just going to say now, like sports fans right now love statistics, don't they?"
00:07:03,00:07:06,So what's on the tombstone is what they've got from the stats.
00:07:06,00:07:07,Amazing.
00:07:07,00:07:10,"That's so interesting, but he clearly didn't catch on right."
00:07:10,00:07:12,He probably thought this is going to be huge.
00:07:12,00:07:15,Every tombstone is going to be stat packed from now on.
00:07:15,00:07:16,That's right.
00:07:16,00:07:22,"Well, there are a few of us, but never quite this, I mean it looks really boring, because"
00:07:22,00:07:24,"all it is, is the stats."
00:07:24,00:07:28,"It's like, you know, football stats or cricket stats."
00:07:28,00:07:32,I can literally sit there and read it all day.
00:07:32,00:07:33,Golfing stats.
00:07:33,00:07:38,"So I think, you know, we ought to rob Tiger Woods his nose in it really."
00:07:38,00:07:39,"Oh yeah, definitely."
00:07:39,00:07:46,"I didn't realise that chariot racing, I knew chariot racing happened in Rome, but I assumed"
00:07:46,00:07:52,"that Rome used chariots in a military sense, and it sounds like there's not really any"
00:07:52,00:07:56,"evidence they did because chariots were an older thing, and that in Rome they were for"
00:07:56,00:07:57,racing.
00:07:57,00:08:03,"Yeah, there's a bit of military PR with chariots, you know, just to frighten the enemy."
00:08:03,00:08:11,"But essentially you get these fantastic resources pulling the chariots, and it's a phenomenally"
00:08:11,00:08:12,dangerous.
00:08:12,00:08:17,"Boral Diocles, he died in his forties, he's lucky to stay alive that long, because you've"
00:08:17,00:08:24,"got this really long track, more than half a kilometre, with terribly tight ends."
00:08:24,00:08:29,"So you have to go up and down, you have to go round seven times, and the ends are where"
00:08:29,00:08:33,"you crash, because you can't turn around the corner."
00:08:33,00:08:38,"And they were called shipwrecks, now fragia, that's a chariot that kind of crashes at the"
00:08:38,00:08:40,corners.
00:08:40,00:08:50,"And the fans were absolutely obsessive loonies, and there are accounts of the fans really"
00:08:50,00:08:54,"looking after the racehorses, really looking out for them, and one of the things they used"
00:08:54,00:09:00,"to do is they used to sniff their shit, because they were really anxious that they were being"
00:09:00,00:09:02,fed the right stuff.
00:09:02,00:09:08,"Because if you want to have a racehorse pulling the chariot really quick, then you've got"
00:09:08,00:09:10,to make sure that it's being given the right diet.
00:09:10,00:09:15,"I would try and check at the other end of the process, I would try and check the feet."
00:09:15,00:09:20,"You would have thought that was the easiest, but they knew that you wanted to know what"
00:09:20,00:09:21,came out.
00:09:21,00:09:26,"I couldn't believe I was reading about Nero, so Emperor Nero, he's on a tour of Greece,"
00:09:26,00:09:31,"he is so into chariot racing that he decides to enter the Olympics in 67 AD, when there"
00:09:31,00:09:37,"is no Olympics, it's not meant to be on there here, you've got a much better chance of winning"
00:09:37,00:09:42,"in a non-olympic year, no, because he moves it, he moves it, but imagine I'm not naming"
00:09:42,00:09:47,"any particular president of the United States, but imagine the president of the United States"
00:09:47,00:09:54,"arrives in some country and wants to participate, but it's not actually been quite timed, well"
00:09:54,00:09:57,"they just move it, don't they, that's what you do."
00:09:57,00:10:03,"The next World Cup football is in America, isn't it, I can imagine Trump turning out."
00:10:03,00:10:08,"But that story is extraordinary, because back then the Olympics were tied into religious"
00:10:08,00:10:12,"connotations, they had it in a specific year, the religious rights, so all of that's out"
00:10:12,00:10:17,"the window, he joins, you have four horses to your chariot in the Olympics, he shows"
00:10:17,00:10:23,"up with ten horses and then cuts a corner, flips over, loses the race and still wins"
00:10:23,00:10:24,it.
00:10:24,00:10:30,"Just like Mr Trump and Gulls, absolutely the same, one thing you know is you don't want"
00:10:30,00:10:31,to beat the emperor.
00:10:31,00:10:36,"Yeah, but there was some underhand tactics that went on, I read, I don't know if this"
00:10:36,00:10:42,"is true, that the white team and the red team, we don't really know much about them in literature,"
00:10:42,00:10:47,"but one place that we do see them a lot is in curse tablets, because a lot of the cheating"
00:10:47,00:10:50,"was cursing your opponents, is that right?"
00:10:50,00:10:53,But it was against the rules to curse people.
00:10:53,00:10:54,Really?
00:10:54,00:10:55,Who was going to enforce it then?
00:10:55,00:10:57,"Yeah, the gods, maybe."
00:10:57,00:11:01,"How do you, you can't check the poo coming out of the cursor to see if they've done it,"
00:11:01,00:11:04,"right, like that, you can do that silently."
00:11:04,00:11:14,"And it was, the Circus Maximus was clearly, unlike the Colosseum, which was rigidly sex-segregated,"
00:11:14,00:11:20,"men only, until you got to the really bad seats at the top when the women could sit."
00:11:20,00:11:26,"For most of the time, the men and women sat together in the Circus Maximus and it's absolutely"
00:11:26,00:11:34,"clear that it was a prime flirt location, a pick-up joint, right?"
00:11:34,00:11:36,Do you want to come with me and smell some hot shit?
00:11:36,00:11:37,Do you want to come with me?
00:11:37,00:11:43,"It's a little more subtle than that, actually, do you mind terribly if I pass you by to get"
00:11:43,00:11:44,to my seat?
00:11:44,00:11:45,"Oh, did I rub your knee?"
00:11:45,00:11:47,I'm just terribly sorry.
00:11:47,00:11:50,"Well, they have the October horse ritual, which is quite interesting."
00:11:50,00:11:51,"Oh, very learned."
00:11:51,00:11:52,Yeah.
00:11:52,00:11:56,That is the first time anyone said that to you.
00:11:56,00:11:59,You are not editing that out of the show.
00:11:59,00:12:00,That's stated.
00:12:00,00:12:01,That's quite...
00:12:01,00:12:02,That's your ringtone.
00:12:02,00:12:03,That's mine.
00:12:03,00:12:06,You googled Roman horse and have found the October horse ritual.
00:12:06,00:12:11,"Okay, do a back-up on it, that was good now."
00:12:11,00:12:12,"Sorry, I'd be..."
00:12:12,00:12:17,"No, it's a very interesting idea that it was part of a ritual that you sacrifice a horse"
00:12:17,00:12:20,"to the gods and there would be a race, a chariot race, where two people would race against"
00:12:20,00:12:21,each other.
00:12:21,00:12:27,"Whoever won, the right-hand horse of the two horses would have its head taken off and then..."
00:12:27,00:12:28,The winner?
00:12:28,00:12:30,"Yes, because it was for the gods."
00:12:30,00:12:34,"So you were sacrificing your best horse, right?"
00:12:34,00:12:38,And then a fight would happen between two people to see who could keep the head and then that
00:12:38,00:12:41,would be displayed outside of a house.
00:12:41,00:12:46,But that must be a slightly distressing moment when you know you need your horse for another
00:12:46,00:12:48,race and you win that one.
00:12:48,00:12:53,"No, it was worth it because of the prestige of..."
00:12:53,00:12:59,"What about Sinisca, the Spartan female chariot winner?"
00:12:59,00:13:00,Yes.
00:13:00,00:13:05,So what I read is that she won the Olympic golds but maybe she wasn't on the chariots.
00:13:05,00:13:06,Yeah.
00:13:06,00:13:09,"I mean, there is a problem about..."
00:13:09,00:13:15,"Not in Rome, I can tell you, in Rome, Darkleys was on the chariot and a winner."
00:13:15,00:13:23,"In Greece, in traditional Greece before Nero, it's not clear whether it's the chariot owner"
00:13:23,00:13:27,who is the winner or the charioteer.
00:13:27,00:13:33,"So sometimes when people say, ""Oh, so-and-so female won the chariot race,"" that is because"
00:13:33,00:13:35,she owned the chariot.
00:13:35,00:13:37,This is like the Queen winning the Grand National.
00:13:37,00:13:38,The Queen winning the Grand National.
00:13:38,00:13:39,She's not...
00:13:39,00:13:40,She wasn't going over Beechersburg.
00:13:40,00:13:43,"She was never on the horse, no."
00:13:43,00:13:46,So she's just patting it when it finishes.
00:13:46,00:13:48,"Yeah, that's an important job, actually."
00:13:48,00:13:52,"But maybe this woman might have trained the horses, is that right?"
00:13:52,00:13:53,That might have done.
00:13:53,00:13:54,We just don't know.
00:13:54,00:13:55,But you don't know.
00:13:55,00:13:56,You don't know.
00:13:56,00:13:57,"So then finally, Darkleys, he retires."
00:13:57,00:13:58,Does he?
00:13:58,00:14:00,"He's a billion, billion, billionaire."
00:14:00,00:14:01,What does he do?
00:14:01,00:14:03,Does he take over the country or...?
00:14:03,00:14:04,God only...
00:14:04,00:14:05,"Well, we have no clue."
00:14:05,00:14:06,Just disappears.
00:14:06,00:14:13,"What he does, where he lived, he probably starts life as a slave in modern Portugal."
00:14:13,00:14:19,"Actually, that's where we think he comes from, but makes it big in Rome."
00:14:19,00:14:26,"If he's got 35 million cestuses, then he can afford a palace."
00:14:26,00:14:28,But we don't have no clue where he lived.
00:14:28,00:14:33,Perhaps he just lived very modestly and gave his winnings to the people.
00:14:33,00:14:36,"But if he did, he didn't tell us on his tombstone."
00:14:36,00:14:38,You'd put that up there.
00:14:38,00:14:41,"I think I might say, ""And he gave it all away."""
00:14:41,00:14:45,"I didn't know he was from Portugal, because that must hurt for Cristiano Ronaldo, who's"
00:14:45,00:14:46,currently there.
00:14:46,00:14:50,"I was going to say, ""Eat your heart out, Ronaldo."""
00:14:50,00:14:54,Not even the richest sportsman from Portugal.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Do we know why he was so good?
00:14:55,00:14:56,What made him so...
00:14:56,00:14:57,Look.
00:14:57,00:14:58,I'd say look.
00:14:58,00:14:59,But...
00:14:59,00:15:00,It didn't flip over.
00:15:00,00:15:01,That's not to be largely...
00:15:01,00:15:04,"I know that's the result, I'm asking why."
00:15:04,00:15:05,One stage back.
00:15:05,00:15:11,"Yeah, but I think of Stephen Bradbury, the Australian figure skater, oh, speed skater,"
00:15:11,00:15:16,"who won the Olympic gold, because in the semifinals, everyone in front of him fell over, and then"
00:15:16,00:15:17,he won.
00:15:17,00:15:18,"And then in the finals, exactly the same thing happened."
00:15:18,00:15:21,"What if Diakles was just terrible, and he just kept coming up the back and everyone"
00:15:21,00:15:22,was shipwrecked?
00:15:22,00:15:23,He just kept going.
00:15:23,00:15:25,He just didn't give up.
00:15:25,00:15:26,Yeah.
00:15:26,00:15:29,"But I think he probably had a good fan base, though."
00:15:29,00:15:30,"Yeah, it sounds good."
00:15:30,00:15:31,They were cheering him on.
00:15:31,00:15:32,"We should move on, guys."
00:15:32,00:15:34,Can I put one missed to bed before we go on?
00:15:34,00:15:35,"Okay, yeah."
00:15:35,00:15:37,"This is something we get sent all the time in the fishing box, and thank you very much"
00:15:37,00:15:41,"to everyone who's sent it in, but it's not true, and it's about chariots, and it's about"
00:15:41,00:15:42,Roman horses.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Uh-huh.
00:15:43,00:15:50,It's that the size of the space shuttle rocket boosters was directly based on the size of
00:15:50,00:15:51,Roman horses.
00:15:51,00:15:52,"Like the Apollo missions, you mean?"
00:15:52,00:15:53,Yeah.
00:15:53,00:15:54,Okay.
00:15:54,00:15:55,Yeah.
00:15:55,00:15:59,"So there's this thing that gets sent in all the time, and it's that the standard railway"
00:15:59,00:16:03,"gauge on British railways and American ones is four for eight and a half inches, and that"
00:16:03,00:16:09,"is because the railway gauge was based on trams, and those were based on wagons, and wagons"
00:16:09,00:16:14,"were based on wheel ruts on old roads, roads that were built by the Romans that were based"
00:16:14,00:16:19,on the size of two Roman horses walking next to each other because of chariots.
00:16:19,00:16:20,Great fact.
00:16:20,00:16:21,No.
00:16:21,00:16:22,No.
00:16:22,00:16:23,It's time to move on.
00:16:23,00:16:24,It's all Roman horses.
00:16:24,00:16:25,Cobblers.
00:16:25,00:16:26,It's just not true.
00:16:26,00:16:27,It's cobblers.
00:16:27,00:16:28,It's cobblers.
00:16:28,00:16:29,It's cobblers.
00:16:29,00:16:30,"No, you've done the research."
00:16:30,00:16:31,Why is it cobblers?
00:16:31,00:16:32,I just know it's cobblers.
00:16:32,00:16:37,"Well, it's like saying that actually all clothes are based on ancient clothes because"
00:16:37,00:16:39,they're roughly the same size.
00:16:39,00:16:42,"It happens to be the case that if you're building a road, you don't build it so it's"
00:16:42,00:16:44,200 feet wide.
00:16:44,00:16:49,"It's either indirectly true in a trivial way, or it's not really true, but there's no evidence"
00:16:49,00:16:54,"of that specific size being used in between the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and there"
00:16:54,00:16:55,you go.
00:16:55,00:16:56,"Well, stop sending it into our team."
00:16:56,00:16:57,Thank you.
00:16:57,00:17:01,He comes into work very upset everybody.
00:17:01,00:17:10,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:17:10,00:17:15,My fact this week is that because the Confederate General Stonewall Jackson believed that one
00:17:15,00:17:19,"of his arms was much larger than the other, he used to walk around with it held in the"
00:17:19,00:17:24,air just so that he could redistribute all of the blood it was hogging.
00:17:24,00:17:28,So this is written about quite a few times.
00:17:28,00:17:32,"I'm holding my hand up for some reason, as I was telling that fact."
00:17:32,00:17:33,You can put it down now.
00:17:33,00:17:34,"Yes, down."
00:17:34,00:17:35,"Yes, thank you."
00:17:35,00:17:40,"Stonewall Jackson, he was called Thomas Jonathan Stonewall Jackson, 1824 to 1863."
00:17:40,00:17:45,"He was a Confederate General, military officer, and he was seen as one of the most gifted"
00:17:45,00:17:47,tactical officers of that period.
00:17:47,00:17:52,"Even people like Lincoln, who obviously did not like him, said, ""Well, that guy was good."""
00:17:52,00:17:57,"You know, they all sort of acknowledged it, but he was also a bit of an eccentric, a hypochondriac,"
00:17:57,00:18:01,and one of the things was he believed he had one incredibly long arm and that it was basically
00:18:01,00:18:04,sucking up all the blood that he needed for the rest of his body.
00:18:04,00:18:06,Have we seen any pictures of him?
00:18:06,00:18:09,"Like obviously not photos, but are there like other photos?"
00:18:09,00:18:10,There are photos of him.
00:18:10,00:18:11,1860s?
00:18:11,00:18:12,Yeah.
00:18:12,00:18:13,And he with really long arms?
00:18:13,00:18:17,"No, they sort of cut it off at the sort of neckline so you don't really get to see it,"
00:18:17,00:18:18,from what I've seen.
00:18:18,00:18:19,What's he hiding?
00:18:19,00:18:20,Big arm.
00:18:20,00:18:21,A big arm.
00:18:21,00:18:22,Couldn't he just measure it?
00:18:22,00:18:24,It seems he's holding them out.
00:18:24,00:18:28,"He could just come up and, it's not a rocky science, is it?"
00:18:28,00:18:30,He felt that it was larger as well.
00:18:30,00:18:32,Just generally he felt like maybe there was less muscle and more blood.
00:18:32,00:18:33,"Yeah, exactly."
00:18:33,00:18:36,"Once you've got it into your head, there's no..."
00:18:36,00:18:39,You know that thing where you put your arms out and then you put one of them over the
00:18:39,00:18:43,"back of your neck and then it's shorter again, shorter than the other."
00:18:43,00:18:44,"Oh, wow."
00:18:44,00:18:45,"No, I didn't know that actually."
00:18:45,00:18:49,"Well, maybe he did that one day at school and then he just got it in the sack."
00:18:49,00:18:53,"Well, apparently he did do it at school, but not school as a student, as a professor."
00:18:53,00:18:56,Students used to say it was pretty weird seeing the professor sitting there with his hand up
00:18:56,00:19:01,like he had a question and it turns out that's what he was doing and he would ride into war
00:19:01,00:19:02,with his hand in the air.
00:19:02,00:19:07,"In fact, he got shot through the hand when his hand was up in the air like a target and"
00:19:07,00:19:09,"almost had his hand amputated, but it healed."
00:19:09,00:19:10,"That was the Battle of Bull Run, wasn't it?"
00:19:10,00:19:11,Yeah.
00:19:11,00:19:12,Because he was in loads of battles during the Civil War.
00:19:12,00:19:13,Yeah.
00:19:13,00:19:14,But he then had a hand-related...
00:19:14,00:19:19,"I mean, his death was hand injury-related, but I can't find which hand it was."
00:19:19,00:19:20,Exactly.
00:19:20,00:19:21,I don't know.
00:19:21,00:19:23,Or at least from a cursory reading of a lot of sources.
00:19:23,00:19:27,They don't say if it was the big arm that got shot.
00:19:27,00:19:29,Because he was friendly-fired.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Yeah.
00:19:30,00:19:34,"This was in 1860, certainly 1860 something, wasn't it?"
00:19:34,00:19:35,'63.
00:19:35,00:19:36,Yeah.
00:19:36,00:19:37,Thank you.
00:19:37,00:19:38,So this was 1863.
00:19:38,00:19:44,"He was shot because he was out doing a bit of reconnaissance and some of his own troops,"
00:19:44,00:19:48,"some Confederate troops, saw an approaching party open fire."
00:19:48,00:19:53,"He then had to have his arm amputated, and that was given a full Christian burial, because"
00:19:53,00:19:59,it was about to be thrown on the pile of limbs outside the surgical tent.
00:19:59,00:20:03,"But the military chaplain thinks, ""Look, this is a heroic arm, this is a general's arm."
00:20:03,00:20:05,"We should keep it and bury it."""
00:20:05,00:20:07,And he died several days later.
00:20:07,00:20:08,We think he had pneumonia.
00:20:08,00:20:09,"You know, certainly..."
00:20:09,00:20:10,"Well, he just had his arm cut."
00:20:10,00:20:11,"Yeah, certainly arm run."
00:20:11,00:20:14,I think it was the sniffle that killed him.
00:20:14,00:20:15,It was all...
00:20:15,00:20:16,He had pneumonia.
00:20:16,00:20:19,"It was him being shot related, absolutely, absolutely."
00:20:19,00:20:24,"And they said to his wife, ""Would you like us to get the arm back?"""
00:20:24,00:20:26,"And she said, ""No, it's had a Christian burial, so it should stay where it is."""
00:20:26,00:20:30,"Because that was one of his other defining characteristics, was he was extremely religious."
00:20:30,00:20:35,"Apparently, he would pray before having a glass of water, or before opening an envelope,"
00:20:35,00:20:36,or before writing a...
00:20:36,00:20:38,"I mean, prayer was his constant."
00:20:38,00:20:40,"And anyway, so he's never been reunited with his arm."
00:20:40,00:20:43,And it's there to this day with a tombstone above it.
00:20:43,00:20:46,And he's got the writing on it that says...
00:20:46,00:20:47,What does it say?
00:20:47,00:20:50,It says he earned more than any other confederate general.
00:20:50,00:20:53,It just says arm of Stonewall Jackson.
00:20:53,00:20:56,"And that's been moved around a couple of times, so it might be directly above his arm now."
00:20:56,00:20:57,It might not.
00:20:57,00:20:58,But the arm was moved a bit.
00:20:58,00:20:59,Interesting.
00:20:59,00:21:00,Yeah.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"Didn't he draw attention to himself, Rother?"
00:21:02,00:21:07,"I mean, if you're kind of going into battle and you're the lead general, if you've got"
00:21:07,00:21:08,your hand up...
00:21:08,00:21:10,"Yeah, I mean, they literally shot through it."
00:21:10,00:21:11,Yes.
00:21:11,00:21:12,But isn't that a good thing?
00:21:12,00:21:13,Because...
00:21:13,00:21:14,Completely stupid.
00:21:14,00:21:15,You don't want to be shot in your head.
00:21:15,00:21:16,"No, it's better."
00:21:16,00:21:17,Okay.
00:21:17,00:21:18,All right.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"In fact, what you would probably do is put a hat on it to see if you're really tall."
00:21:20,00:21:21,And a little suit.
00:21:21,00:21:22,It got around.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Okay.
00:21:23,00:21:24,You are.
00:21:24,00:21:27,I think if you've got a reputation as an eccentric already...
00:21:27,00:21:28,Just go for it.
00:21:28,00:21:29,Go for it.
00:21:29,00:21:30,Yeah.
00:21:30,00:21:34,"Actually, speaking of clothing, he was well known amongst his other generals for not wearing"
00:21:34,00:21:35,flamboyant clothing.
00:21:35,00:21:36,Okay.
00:21:36,00:21:40,"Right, because in the war, like, the officers had to pay for their own clothes."
00:21:40,00:21:41,You didn't get a uniform.
00:21:41,00:21:46,"And you had to kind of wear things that are about similar to the other guys, like a similar"
00:21:46,00:21:47,colour and stuff.
00:21:47,00:21:51,"But the richer people in there, and often the officers were rich, they would just buy"
00:21:51,00:21:53,the most flamboyant thing they could get away with.
00:21:53,00:21:54,But he didn't do that.
00:21:54,00:21:56,"And people thought it was a bit sus, really."
00:21:56,00:21:57,"Well, he was..."
00:21:57,00:21:58,"I think it was very poor, wasn't he?"
00:21:58,00:21:59,As a young man.
00:21:59,00:22:00,Yeah.
00:22:00,00:22:02,He grew up extremely poor and scrabbled his way up through...
00:22:02,00:22:05,"So, how did he become a general?"
00:22:05,00:22:06,I think talent.
00:22:06,00:22:07,I think he was very...
00:22:07,00:22:08,A shio talent.
00:22:08,00:22:09,Yeah.
00:22:09,00:22:10,And a...
00:22:10,00:22:11,And a Fonyon.
00:22:11,00:22:12,He was a...
00:22:12,00:22:13,Who wants to be a general?
00:22:13,00:22:14,Yeah.
00:22:14,00:22:15,I can see you over there.
00:22:15,00:22:16,Yeah.
00:22:16,00:22:17,He was...
00:22:17,00:22:19,"I mean, apparently, he was, you know, the politics of the Civil War aside."
00:22:19,00:22:21,"He was a brilliant tactician, you know."
00:22:21,00:22:25,"And I think after he died, not long after that came the Battle of Gettysburg, which obviously"
00:22:25,00:22:28,"he missed, having just died."
00:22:28,00:22:33,"And that is one of the, certainly, the huge military turning points of the wars, the Battle"
00:22:33,00:22:34,of Gettysburg.
00:22:34,00:22:37,And his absence from it was cited by a couple of other generals at the time.
00:22:37,00:22:38,Yeah.
00:22:38,00:22:39,"So, it could have changed."
00:22:39,00:22:43,"How did you become a general in, like, the Roman army or the Greek army?"
00:22:43,00:22:44,Very rich.
00:22:44,00:22:45,Was it rich?
00:22:45,00:22:46,Yes.
00:22:46,00:22:48,"I mean, there's kind of two strands."
00:22:48,00:22:50,One is the career soldier.
00:22:50,00:22:51,Right.
00:22:51,00:22:55,"And you can go up the ladder, a career soldier, you know, a squadron, and then you become"
00:22:55,00:23:01,"a centurion, and you might kind of go up to the sort of what we'd call the commissioned"
00:23:01,00:23:02,ranks.
00:23:02,00:23:03,Right.
00:23:03,00:23:06,"But the guys who were leading it, they'd bypassed all that."
00:23:06,00:23:07,Right.
00:23:07,00:23:09,And God knows if they're any good or not.
00:23:09,00:23:10,Yeah.
00:23:10,00:23:14,"Or, you know, I kind of, you know, you guys have been talking about, you know, all this"
00:23:14,00:23:22,"brilliant tactician stuff, you sort of wonder what it is to be a brilliantly tact, tactical"
00:23:22,00:23:23,general.
00:23:23,00:23:26,"I mean, I've spent a long time looking at Julius Caesar's campaigns."
00:23:26,00:23:32,"Because, you know, Caesar is always, you know, in America, you know, he's on the syllabus"
00:23:32,00:23:39,"at military academies, you know, how you, you know, because of his brilliance as a general,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,"you know, like Old Stonewall."
00:23:41,00:23:46,"But I started looking, he only had one tactic, which is he went round the back."
00:23:46,00:23:47,Right.
00:23:47,00:23:48,Right.
00:23:48,00:23:52,"You get face-to-face with the army, the opposing army, and what you do is you then pen him"
00:23:52,00:23:53,in from the back.
00:23:53,00:23:55,That's what he does all the time.
00:23:55,00:23:58,"You must have felt like such an idiot when you're going, ""He won't do it this time."""
00:23:58,00:23:59,He won't do it this time.
00:23:59,00:24:01,"He wants us to think he's going to do it, but he's not."
00:24:01,00:24:07,"And in fact, it seemed to me, and I've got terrible kind of attacks on social media for"
00:24:07,00:24:12,"saying this, because there's an awful lot of people very, very invested in Roman military"
00:24:12,00:24:13,tactics.
00:24:13,00:24:14,I think it's all like that.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"It's all kind of, pen them in from the back."
00:24:16,00:24:17,And just-
00:24:17,00:24:23,"Was he also helped by being in charge of the Roman army as well, which was presumably the"
00:24:23,00:24:24,biggest and best at the time?
00:24:24,00:24:27,"In his rise to power, you sure?"
00:24:27,00:24:28,Yeah.
00:24:28,00:24:31,I think they're only the biggest and the best because there's more of them.
00:24:31,00:24:32,Yeah.
00:24:32,00:24:36,"I mean, you can't defeat the Romans in a war."
00:24:36,00:24:37,You can defeat them in a battle.
00:24:37,00:24:40,"They lose battles all over the place, and hope is at some things."
00:24:40,00:24:46,"I mean, they're a laughing stock when it comes to navies, but they've always got more men."
00:24:46,00:24:47,Yeah.
00:24:47,00:24:48,So they can't lose a war.
00:24:48,00:24:49,They can lose a battle.
00:24:49,00:24:50,Interesting.
00:24:50,00:24:52,So is there not kind of tactical brilliance?
00:24:52,00:24:58,"Well, you know, when this goes out, I shall no doubt get more of these, you know, offensive"
00:24:58,00:25:02,"war, you fucking moron, you don't understand Marybier, doesn't it?"
00:25:02,00:25:05,It doesn't give any crudence to the brilliance.
00:25:05,00:25:07,How many legions do you have Marybier?
00:25:07,00:25:08,That's right.
00:25:08,00:25:13,"But if you ask me, it's the one-trick bonus, really."
00:25:13,00:25:14,Wow.
00:25:14,00:25:20,"So Caesar, just to go back to chariots, he described, in his, not his diaries, his account-"
00:25:20,00:25:21,His commentaries.
00:25:21,00:25:24,His commentaries on the British invasion.
00:25:24,00:25:28,It's one of the only references we have contemporary to British tribes using military
00:25:28,00:25:29,chariots.
00:25:29,00:25:33,"And they were a bit, they'd gone out of fashion in rhyme for centuries by then, but we were"
00:25:33,00:25:34,still using them.
00:25:34,00:25:37,And they were like an uber across the battlefield.
00:25:37,00:25:38,Yeah.
00:25:38,00:25:45,And one really important myth to bust is they didn't have scythes coming out of the wheels.
00:25:45,00:25:46,"Oh, okay."
00:25:46,00:25:47,"No, no, no."
00:25:47,00:25:54,"If you go to look at Boudicca on Thames Embankment, her statue, she's got a great set of scythes"
00:25:54,00:26:00,"about, but I am told by my archaeological friends that this is a myth."
00:26:00,00:26:01,Okay.
00:26:01,00:26:02,Absolutely gusset.
00:26:02,00:26:03,Sorry.
00:26:03,00:26:04,I'm a bit gusset about that.
00:26:04,00:26:05,"That's my, that's my chariot myth busted."
00:26:05,00:26:06,There we go.
00:26:06,00:26:09,And I've been sending that in to other podcasts for ages.
00:26:09,00:26:14,"Jumping back to the modern just very quickly, so he did, he was responsible for winning"
00:26:14,00:26:15,a lot of battles.
00:26:15,00:26:16,"Houston, well, Jackson."
00:26:16,00:26:17,Civil Jackson.
00:26:17,00:26:18,Modern day.
00:26:18,00:26:21,"Oh, well, more, certainly more modern than the Tiber Caesar."
00:26:21,00:26:26,"But he, one of the places that he won was Frederick's Burg in Virginia, and he beat"
00:26:26,00:26:32,"the federal general who was Ambrose E. Burnside, friend of the podcast."
00:26:32,00:26:33,We've spoken about him before.
00:26:33,00:26:34,Inventor of sideburns.
00:26:34,00:26:36,Inventor of sideburns.
00:26:36,00:26:41,"At some point Burnside, people went, it's, I love it, and I love the name, but not quite"
00:26:41,00:26:42,"and they, they changed it round."
00:26:42,00:26:43,But yeah.
00:26:43,00:26:44,Two.
00:26:44,00:26:45,"Because he does, he had a real set, didn't he?"
00:26:45,00:26:46,Yeah.
00:26:46,00:26:47,But I think I linked up to his moustache.
00:26:47,00:26:48,They weren't really sideburns.
00:26:48,00:26:49,It's interesting.
00:26:49,00:26:51,"He was an innovator of the four, but he hadn't perfected it."
00:26:51,00:26:52,You know what?
00:26:52,00:26:57,"On this subject, I was reading about hypochondria, and modern day hypochondria was invented kind"
00:26:57,00:27:03,"of or defined by an American neurologist called George Beard, who didn't have a beard."
00:27:03,00:27:04,And no relation.
00:27:04,00:27:05,No relation.
00:27:05,00:27:06,No relation.
00:27:06,00:27:09,"Oh, what about Frank Beard, who's easy top?"
00:27:09,00:27:11,"Sorry, you must get that all the time, but."
00:27:11,00:27:15,I have no relations.
00:27:15,00:27:19,"On the tactical side of things, and sort of, like, does the skill exist or not, or did"
00:27:19,00:27:22,Jackson have a gift for it?
00:27:22,00:27:27,Because he was a military instructor at Virginia Military Institute for a while.
00:27:27,00:27:30,And his students did not like him at all.
00:27:30,00:27:34,And the reason they didn't like him was that he was an unbelievably dull lecturer.
00:27:34,00:27:39,"So he would, he would compose a lecture, he would recite it from memory."
00:27:39,00:27:40,He wouldn't deviate at all.
00:27:40,00:27:44,"And if anyone asked him a question, he would simply spool back in his head to the bit of"
00:27:44,00:27:48,his pre-remembered lecture that he thought answered the question and just recite that
00:27:48,00:27:49,again verbatim.
00:27:49,00:27:50,Yeah.
00:27:50,00:27:53,"While subtly just reaching out his massive long arms, slapping them across the bed."
00:27:53,00:27:55,What did he do with the arm at this point?
00:27:55,00:28:00,"In 1856, a group of his own alumni tried to have him sacked for poor teaching."
00:28:00,00:28:01,And they must have felt.
00:28:01,00:28:02,In 1856.
00:28:02,00:28:05,"I know, they must have felt so stupid just five years later when he is the pride of the"
00:28:05,00:28:06,Confederate army.
00:28:06,00:28:08,"You know, one of the greatest blah, blah, blah."
00:28:08,00:28:10,There were a lot of rumours that were about him.
00:28:10,00:28:14,"I think this is one of the things where people would say stuff about him, and then if they"
00:28:14,00:28:16,"were, if other sources were asked, they would say, ""No, he never did that."
00:28:16,00:28:17,"We never saw that."""
00:28:17,00:28:21,"One of the things was that he was constantly chewing on lemons, eating lemons, just absolutely"
00:28:21,00:28:22,love lemons.
00:28:22,00:28:23,And that was written in a biography.
00:28:23,00:28:26,"And then everyone who read that went, ""I never saw him with a lemon."
00:28:26,00:28:28,"I have no idea where that comes from."""
00:28:28,00:28:29,I know where it comes from.
00:28:29,00:28:30,Yeah.
00:28:30,00:28:34,"It's based on a single account of him eating a lemon on the 27th of June, 1862."
00:28:34,00:28:35,That's bad.
00:28:35,00:28:38,"But three separate people saw him eat it, and they all wrote it up in their memoirs."
00:28:38,00:28:41,"And so you've now got three sources saying, ""Oh, he loved a lemon."
00:28:41,00:28:42,"Did old Stonewall."""
00:28:42,00:28:47,"That's like when I went to my ex's family for the first time, and they offered me dessert."
00:28:47,00:28:48,And I didn't really want any.
00:28:48,00:28:49,And they had some strawberries.
00:28:49,00:28:51,"And I'm like, ""Oh, I love strawberries."""
00:28:51,00:28:54,So I had a couple of strawberries in every dessert I've ever got.
00:28:54,00:28:59,"Every present, like a T-shirt with strawberries on it, strips of strawberry fields."
00:28:59,00:29:02,Is it true that he didn't eat pepper because he thought it weakened his legs?
00:29:02,00:29:04,"Well, that was another thing that was said about him."
00:29:04,00:29:05,Yeah.
00:29:05,00:29:06,And he passed.
00:29:06,00:29:07,What do you think?
00:29:07,00:29:08,Don't know.
00:29:08,00:29:09,I mean...
00:29:09,00:29:12,Is it true that he wouldn't let his back touch the back of a chair because it jumbled
00:29:12,00:29:14,his organs up?
00:29:14,00:29:20,"This man is sounding more and more completely barking, the more you talk about him."
00:29:20,00:29:27,"I have not done my research like you clearly have on Stonewall Jackson, but frankly, I'm"
00:29:27,00:29:28,quite glad I haven't.
00:29:28,00:29:29,But he believed a lot of stuff.
00:29:29,00:29:30,And he has become...
00:29:30,00:29:32,He was a definite hypochondriac.
00:29:32,00:29:33,Definitely.
00:29:33,00:29:37,"And because he was tactically skilled, he's become an emblem of the kind of lost cause"
00:29:37,00:29:41,"of the Civil War and people saying, ""Oh, we could have won it, and we were in the right"
00:29:41,00:29:42,"actually in all this."""
00:29:42,00:29:44,And I said he was a champion sleeper as well.
00:29:44,00:29:49,"He could sleep so brilliantly that he could even, as he was eating a meal, fall asleep"
00:29:49,00:29:52,with the food in his mouth just straight away because he could just get into it that easy.
00:29:52,00:29:57,"And that's tough with 11 because they're quite tart as well, aren't they?"
00:29:57,00:30:02,"I read about an hypochondriac, I don't know if you know about this person, Mary, called"
00:30:02,00:30:03,Aristides.
00:30:03,00:30:04,"Oh, Elias Aristides."
00:30:04,00:30:05,Aristides.
00:30:05,00:30:06,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:06,00:30:08,"Sorry, I'm not as learned as it is now."
00:30:08,00:30:09,Can't all be.
00:30:09,00:30:11,A great friend of mine.
00:30:11,00:30:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:12,00:30:18,That's book after book after book on his hypochondriac symptoms.
00:30:18,00:30:20,"This is in the second century, at 80."
00:30:20,00:30:21,This is an ancient hypochondriac.
00:30:21,00:30:22,He's an old friend.
00:30:22,00:30:23,Yeah.
00:30:23,00:30:24,An old friend.
00:30:24,00:30:25,An old friend.
00:30:25,00:30:28,He just goes on and on and on.
00:30:28,00:30:32,But loads of posh Romans were terribly hypochondriac.
00:30:32,00:30:36,"Marcus Aurelius, famous Stoic emperor."
00:30:36,00:30:44,"When he is a kid, a teenager, he's always right into his cheetah about his symptoms."
00:30:44,00:30:51,"You'll see how I get letter after letter between these two guys saying, I do hope your tummy's"
00:30:51,00:30:57,"feeling a bit better this morning because my neck, I thought it was getting better in"
00:30:57,00:30:58,the night.
00:30:58,00:31:03,"But now I wake up, I appear to have a jabbing pain going through the shoulder blade."
00:31:03,00:31:11,"Later, Marcus Aurelius, he employs a doctor who is very keen on getting the proper sort"
00:31:11,00:31:17,"of, um, pesteries, anal pesteries, he particularly likes, I think he's put up your bum."
00:31:17,00:31:18,Suppositories.
00:31:18,00:31:19,Okay.
00:31:19,00:31:20,Yeah.
00:31:20,00:31:21,Suppositories.
00:31:21,00:31:22,Pesteries is a different.
00:31:22,00:31:23,"Oh God, am I giving it?"
00:31:23,00:31:24,Different hot words.
00:31:24,00:31:26,"I uploaded in some ways, Marianne."
00:31:26,00:31:27,Suppositories.
00:31:27,00:31:28,Oh shit.
00:31:28,00:31:29,"I would see you in boots, Mary."
00:31:29,00:31:30,Where are the anal pesteries?
00:31:30,00:31:31,Oh shit.
00:31:31,00:31:34,Where are the anal pesteries?
00:31:34,00:31:36,I think they'd know what I meant.
00:31:36,00:31:41,"I don't think, I don't have any trouble getting, anyway, there's all Marcus Aurelius, you know."
00:31:41,00:31:42,Marcus Aurelius is all about-
00:31:42,00:31:43,I want just suppository.
00:31:43,00:31:47,I thought he was all about disregarding the pain and discomfort of the world.
00:31:47,00:31:51,"I mean, I've read the, what is it, the meditations and then they're not."
00:31:51,00:31:52,Meditation.
00:31:52,00:31:53,Yeah.
00:31:53,00:31:54,"Well, don't believe all you read in them."
00:31:54,00:31:55,Don't believe all you read in the meditation.
00:31:55,00:31:58,It gives you only one side of how he might like to be seen.
00:31:58,00:32:02,Cause I have quite a bad shoulder and I put it down to like looking at my phone on my
00:32:02,00:32:04,"screen all the time, but that can't be true for him."
00:32:04,00:32:05,He'd have had a tablet.
00:32:05,00:32:06,Very good.
00:32:06,00:32:07,Thank you.
00:32:07,00:32:12,"Can I talk, just talk about Aristides."
00:32:12,00:32:13,Aristides.
00:32:13,00:32:14,Aristides again.
00:32:14,00:32:19,"So he was basically an orator and he got nasal congestion, a sore throat, and then couldn't"
00:32:19,00:32:21,really do his oratory anymore.
00:32:21,00:32:27,"And so he went to see the priests and they told him to lie down and allow asclepius, the"
00:32:27,00:32:30,god of medicine to appear in his dreams.
00:32:30,00:32:34,"And then whatever happened in his dreams, he had to do them to make him feel better."
00:32:34,00:32:39,So one of them was like smear mud on his body and run around the temple three times.
00:32:39,00:32:41,The suppository trick as well.
00:32:41,00:32:45,"The suppository trick, I'm sure, yeah, an enema of honey and to swallow a goose liver"
00:32:45,00:32:46,sausage.
00:32:46,00:32:50,"Oh, that's a bad dream, isn't it?"
00:32:50,00:32:54,And there are books and books and books of this rubbish.
00:32:54,00:33:04,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:33:04,00:33:08,"My fact is in 1845, there was an exhibition in London where for a shilling, you could"
00:33:08,00:33:14,pull a lever on a giant machine which would produce a brand new line of poetry for you
00:33:14,00:33:15,in Latin.
00:33:15,00:33:16,Wow.
00:33:16,00:33:17,Yeah.
00:33:17,00:33:18,Popular.
00:33:18,00:33:19,So popular.
00:33:19,00:33:20,I think it was popular actually.
00:33:20,00:33:25,I think the inventor supposedly retired on the proceeds of this amazing machine.
00:33:25,00:33:33,"And it is, I have to add, making a line of Latin poetry is really complicated."
00:33:33,00:33:34,"Oh, right."
00:33:34,00:33:39,"Because it's not just like, you know, what you can get out of chat GBT if you say, write"
00:33:39,00:33:44,"me a poem on the spring, you know, and it comes out."
00:33:44,00:33:52,"Because Latin poetry is done to a very, very fixed format of meter."
00:33:52,00:33:57,So you have to have the right stress and rhythm through the line.
00:33:57,00:33:58,So it's damn difficult.
00:33:58,00:34:01,"I mean, I can't write a word of Latin verse."
00:34:01,00:34:08,"So this machine did better than I can, I can sort of see how it's done, but I can't write"
00:34:08,00:34:09,a word.
00:34:09,00:34:10,But that's stunning.
00:34:10,00:34:13,That makes it all the more impressive because apparently there were 26 million permutations
00:34:13,00:34:17,of line that you could get of this machine.
00:34:17,00:34:20,"So it's six, it's six feet Latin hexameter."
00:34:20,00:34:23,So six different feet in the line.
00:34:23,00:34:24,What's a feet?
00:34:24,00:34:25,A foot is like an individual unit.
00:34:25,00:34:31,"So pentameter is a, is Iambic pentameter is the sort of famous Shakespearean meter,"
00:34:31,00:34:32,"which is da, da, da, da, da, da, da."
00:34:32,00:34:33,"So it's like a beat, is it?"
00:34:33,00:34:34,Yeah.
00:34:34,00:34:38,"But a foot will have different numbers of syllables, different numbers of syllables,"
00:34:38,00:34:42,and it's not actually by stress like others is.
00:34:42,00:34:45,It's by the length of the syllable.
00:34:45,00:34:50,"So it's long, short, short, kind of, ah, ah, ah."
00:34:50,00:34:52,So it's really difficult.
00:34:52,00:34:58,"I mean, it's what in the 19th century, they kind of crucify little boys on doing, you"
00:34:58,00:35:05,"know, to write Latin hexameters with the absolute echelons of posh education, but also a complete"
00:35:05,00:35:06,nightmare.
00:35:06,00:35:07,Interesting.
00:35:07,00:35:09,"So this machine, bloody amazing."
00:35:09,00:35:10,Wow.
00:35:10,00:35:11,It's stunning.
00:35:11,00:35:14,"It's a work called John Clark, and he was an inventor, obviously."
00:35:14,00:35:18,"And he's, I think it's took him about 13 years, sources vary, but it took a long, obviously,"
00:35:18,00:35:19,long time.
00:35:19,00:35:20,And do you know how it worked?
00:35:20,00:35:27,"Um, it had six cylinders, and when you pull the lever, it was exactly like a fruit machine,"
00:35:27,00:35:32,"except instead of some boring old cherries, you got a beautiful line of Latin verse,"
00:35:32,00:35:35,and he had arranged it so that it was adjective noun adverb.
00:35:35,00:35:36,So it would make sense.
00:35:36,00:35:37,It actually meant something.
00:35:37,00:35:38,It actually meant something.
00:35:38,00:35:40,"It actually, each line is not, yeah, it's not word salad."
00:35:40,00:35:41,It does.
00:35:41,00:35:42,It might be an eccentric meaning.
00:35:42,00:35:46,"You might not be able to get a huge amount of sense, like, you know, it's not profound."
00:35:46,00:35:48,Like a lot of Latin poetry.
00:35:48,00:35:49,Right.
00:35:49,00:35:51,"Um, and he was just a really interesting guy."
00:35:51,00:35:55,"So he was born in 1785, died in 1853."
00:35:55,00:35:56,"The machine still exists today, which is very exciting."
00:35:56,00:35:57,I thought you might have been to see it.
00:35:57,00:36:01,"I have never been to see it, but I've read about it even before I saw that you were going"
00:36:01,00:36:02,to talk about it.
00:36:02,00:36:03,"Oh, great."
00:36:03,00:36:07,"Um, it's down in Somerset now, and it's in a collection of items that used to be the"
00:36:07,00:36:14,"Clark's shoe museum because John Clark, yeah, of Clark's, no, his relatives were the shoe"
00:36:14,00:36:15,empire people.
00:36:15,00:36:20,"While he was working in feet in poetry, they were working to put feet in shoes."
00:36:20,00:36:21,Yeah.
00:36:21,00:36:22,Amazing.
00:36:22,00:36:25,"And, um, yeah, they, they held it for a while and, and it's still, it still exists."
00:36:25,00:36:30,"I think it was going to be juiced up and renovated a bit recently, but it apparently played God"
00:36:30,00:36:32,Save the Queen while it was working.
00:36:32,00:36:37,"This collection, who own it, the Alfred Gillette Trust, they, they own in their collection"
00:36:37,00:36:42,"this machine, 25,000 shoes and a significant collection of Somerset ichthyosaur fossils."
00:36:42,00:36:43,Wow.
00:36:43,00:36:44,"I mean, what a collection."
00:36:44,00:36:45,Whereabouts is it?
00:36:45,00:36:48,"And Somerset, you know, it's, I think it's literally there yesterday."
00:36:48,00:36:50,It's a village called street.
00:36:50,00:36:51,I think.
00:36:51,00:36:52,"Oh, I know that."
00:36:52,00:36:53,Yeah.
00:36:53,00:36:54,It's not far from Glastonbury.
00:36:54,00:36:55,That's right.
00:36:55,00:36:56,That's where it is.
00:36:56,00:36:57,Yeah.
00:36:57,00:36:58,Can I ask about the machine just jumping back to the Latin machine?
00:36:58,00:37:03,"So it would give you this line of poetry, but it wouldn't print it on, say, a little ticket,"
00:37:03,00:37:04,right?
00:37:04,00:37:05,So you would just see it on the screen as it were.
00:37:05,00:37:06,I don't know.
00:37:06,00:37:07,You could take a photo of it with your phone.
00:37:07,00:37:08,You could take a photo of it.
00:37:08,00:37:14,"So my question is, is how good was everyone's Latin back then and did someone permanently"
00:37:14,00:37:18,stand translating your line of poetry for you?
00:37:18,00:37:25,"I think we imagine that they were all terribly Latinate back then, but actually there'd be"
00:37:25,00:37:30,"no period of British history after the Romans left when more than a, you know, relatively"
00:37:30,00:37:37,"small section of the elite, unknown Latin, they've known a lot about classical culture,"
00:37:37,00:37:43,"but a Latin, more particularly Greek, but even Latin education was still largely for"
00:37:43,00:37:46,boys and largely for the rich ones.
00:37:46,00:37:53,"So I mean, there were some, you know, clever auto-died acts who taught themselves Latin,"
00:37:53,00:37:59,"but who this machine was for, why would anybody who didn't know how difficult it was to compose"
00:37:59,00:38:01,Latin poetry be remotely impressed?
00:38:01,00:38:02,Yeah.
00:38:02,00:38:10,"And some people have thought that it was actually a kind of pistachio, rather expensive, very"
00:38:10,00:38:12,long-term pistachio.
00:38:12,00:38:13,13 years of my life.
00:38:13,00:38:15,"13 years of my life on a joke, right?"
00:38:15,00:38:18,This is going to be great.
00:38:18,00:38:23,"I mean, I don't think this is correct, but some people have argued that the 1840s, this"
00:38:23,00:38:29,"is when these, you know, these little boys, private schools were spending hour after hour"
00:38:29,00:38:33,after hour learning how to compose this Latin poetry.
00:38:33,00:38:37,"And what this bloke is saying, what Mr. Clark is saying, he's like, ""I can get a machine"
00:38:37,00:38:38,"to do it."""
00:38:38,00:38:39,"Yeah, I see."
00:38:39,00:38:41,It's actually undercutting some of that.
00:38:41,00:38:45,"But then that's still true, like now, like my school, we had one Latin teacher for the"
00:38:45,00:38:48,"entire school of a thousand kids, right?"
00:38:48,00:38:50,"Well, that's a lot more than many have."
00:38:50,00:38:51,"Yeah, exactly."
00:38:51,00:38:55,"And it's like, there was a report in 2021 that said that staff in the British Civil"
00:38:55,00:39:01,Service are routinely telling jokes in Latin to exclude lower-class colleagues.
00:39:01,00:39:06,"So, okay, it is quite an elitist thing still, isn't it, learning Latin or Greek?"
00:39:06,00:39:08,And is that a problem?
00:39:08,00:39:11,"And should we be teaching everyone it, or shouldn't we be teaching anyone it?"
00:39:11,00:39:16,I think that you should be giving everyone the opportunity to learn it.
00:39:16,00:39:18,And Latin's always in crisis.
00:39:18,00:39:22,"I mean, in the early 20th century, they were saying Latin was about to die, right?"
00:39:22,00:39:26,"Well, you know, it's taken a very long time to do so, if that was the case."
00:39:26,00:39:32,But I was talking quite recently to a teacher at an ordinary state comprehensive school where
00:39:32,00:39:35,she had reintroduced some Latin for the kids.
00:39:35,00:39:36,"And she said, ""Well, it was great about it."
00:39:36,00:39:37,It was two things.
00:39:37,00:39:39,"First of all, you didn't have to speak it."""
00:39:39,00:39:40,Right?
00:39:40,00:39:47,And it wasn't that it helped you necessarily with other languages or whatever though it
00:39:47,00:39:48,might.
00:39:48,00:39:51,It was that you didn't have to spend all your time learning how to ask for a pizza in it
00:39:51,00:39:52,or whatever.
00:39:52,00:39:55,"So, you were just looking at the language."
00:39:55,00:40:00,"She also said, ""It's not like when you start introducing French or German, whatever you"
00:40:00,00:40:07,"suddenly discover, that misprivileged here is going on for a week, weekend at half-term,"
00:40:07,00:40:11,"to get her French better at mum and dad's French chateau."""
00:40:11,00:40:13,No one's going off to the Vatican for the week.
00:40:13,00:40:15,No one is going off to the Vatican for the week.
00:40:15,00:40:17,"And she said it was really levelling, actually."
00:40:17,00:40:18,That's a really good point.
00:40:18,00:40:22,Because anybody could be good at it and nobody had that kind of built-in advantage.
00:40:22,00:40:23,You know what?
00:40:23,00:40:27,Everyone in my school was equally good at it because there would be like a quiz at the
00:40:27,00:40:33,end of each lesson and there'd be ten questions and then you'd have to shout out your score
00:40:33,00:40:39,and everyone got six out of ten because the Latin word for six is sex.
00:40:39,00:40:43,"And so, literally, we all deliberately got six out of ten so we just went round the class"
00:40:43,00:40:47,"and never went, ""Sex, sex, sex."""
00:40:47,00:40:53,"You know, what's great about Latin, though, is that everybody remembers their Latin lessons"
00:40:53,00:40:58,"and their Latin teacher and people tend not to remember their geography teacher, you know?"
00:40:58,00:41:05,"But Latin, it has, you know, it really, really kind of gets to you."
00:41:05,00:41:09,"And you remember how you took the piss out of the teacher or whatever, but you'd never"
00:41:09,00:41:10,forget it.
00:41:10,00:41:11,I don't know until I was 18.
00:41:11,00:41:12,Did you?
00:41:12,00:41:13,Yeah.
00:41:13,00:41:14,"And so, how is it?"
00:41:14,00:41:15,My Latin.
00:41:15,00:41:16,"You're still doing it onto your lingo, aren't you?"
00:41:16,00:41:17,That's right.
00:41:17,00:41:18,Yeah.
00:41:18,00:41:23,"That's only so I can tease my civil service colleagues, though, you know?"
00:41:23,00:41:24,It was great.
00:41:24,00:41:28,"We had to do it at lunchtimes, like instead of playing football, you can either play football"
00:41:28,00:41:29,or do Latin.
00:41:29,00:41:31,"And you chose, did you choose Latin?"
00:41:31,00:41:32,It was chosen for me.
00:41:32,00:41:33,I see.
00:41:33,00:41:34,I see.
00:41:34,00:41:35,And do you regret it?
00:41:35,00:41:36,"No, I loved it."
00:41:36,00:41:37,I really loved it.
00:41:37,00:41:38,"Yeah, it was mega fun."
00:41:38,00:41:42,"We never did it, but I was in Hong Kong, so I don't think it was an option."
00:41:42,00:41:43,It's useful in weird ways.
00:41:43,00:41:45,"I do think it's useful for other languages, as in it's genuinely you sort of see how things"
00:41:45,00:41:46,fit together.
00:41:46,00:41:51,"But the thing I can't get is this time where it was so common, like law was all in Latin,"
00:41:51,00:41:55,so people in ordinary people in courtrooms couldn't really understand what was going
00:41:55,00:42:00,on because courtroom business was all conducted in Latin until 1362.
00:42:00,00:42:01,Lots of church services.
00:42:01,00:42:02,Lots of church.
00:42:02,00:42:08,"Look at the whole Catholic church, it existed on Latin until relatively recently."
00:42:08,00:42:12,Grammar schools were founded to teach Latin to members of the clergy because it was important
00:42:12,00:42:13,to have good Latin.
00:42:13,00:42:15,"In primary school, we would have to sing Latin hymns."
00:42:15,00:42:16,Would you?
00:42:16,00:42:17,"Yeah, yeah."
00:42:17,00:42:18,Wow.
00:42:18,00:42:21,I think it was one of the journalists who got the scoop that the Pope was stepping down
00:42:21,00:42:26,because he delivered it in Latin and she was the only one there who could understand it.
00:42:26,00:42:27,Yes.
00:42:27,00:42:28,Yes.
00:42:28,00:42:32,There's also such good stuff written in it.
00:42:32,00:42:38,"You're actually there with what someone wrote 2000 years ago, and it's still bloody amazing."
00:42:38,00:42:39,"It transports you, I guess, right?"
00:42:39,00:42:40,It is.
00:42:40,00:42:41,It's about time travel.
00:42:41,00:42:42,Yeah.
00:42:42,00:42:49,"Virgil's Aeneid, right? His first century BC poem on the foundation of Rome."
00:42:49,00:42:52,"What I'm going to say is it's a bit of an exaggeration, or at least I couldn't prove"
00:42:52,00:42:58,"it, but I'm pretty certain it's true, that there hasn't been a day since 19 BC when Virgil"
00:42:58,00:43:03,"popped his clogs, when someone in the world hasn't been reading the Aeneid."
00:43:03,00:43:09,It's been read and recited and studied without a gap for 2000 years.
00:43:09,00:43:12,I think it's just great.
00:43:12,00:43:13,Okay.
00:43:13,00:43:14,Sold.
00:43:14,00:43:19,"As long as you don't make it, just posh boys only."
00:43:19,00:43:20,Yeah.
00:43:20,00:43:22,You never did Latin.
00:43:22,00:43:26,"One person who didn't agree with you was a guy called William Barnes, who was a linguist"
00:43:26,00:43:30,who taught himself Greek and Latin because he didn't want any Greek or Latin words in
00:43:30,00:43:32,the English language.
00:43:32,00:43:37,And so he started coining new words to do away with the Latin.
00:43:37,00:43:43,"So like for instance, instead of the word grammar, he called it speechcraft."
00:43:43,00:43:45,"Instead of ornithology, he called it bird law."
00:43:45,00:43:47,I quite like bird law.
00:43:47,00:43:48,Bird law is quite good.
00:43:48,00:43:49,Yeah.
00:43:49,00:43:50,These are all quite good.
00:43:50,00:43:52,"Instead of flexible, he wanted people to say Benson."
00:43:52,00:43:56,And he was like basically saying that people should speak English as in that Anglo-Saxon
00:43:56,00:44:01,"language, not as a Greek slash, which I think even he thought it was just a bit of fun,"
00:44:01,00:44:02,to be honest.
00:44:02,00:44:03,When was he around?
00:44:03,00:44:05,He was around the 19th century.
00:44:05,00:44:09,About the same time as your Latin machine.
00:44:09,00:44:10,Yeah.
00:44:10,00:44:11,Oh yeah.
00:44:11,00:44:12,Yeah.
00:44:12,00:44:17,"But there's only one thing that's still in the OED, which the definition says W Barnes"
00:44:17,00:44:18,term for.
00:44:18,00:44:21,And that word is push whaling.
00:44:21,00:44:24,So W-A-I-L-I-N-G push whaling.
00:44:24,00:44:25,Push whaling.
00:44:25,00:44:26,You know what that is?
00:44:26,00:44:27,Push whaling.
00:44:27,00:44:28,Force crying.
00:44:28,00:44:29,So faking emotion.
00:44:29,00:44:30,Faking emotion now.
00:44:30,00:44:31,That sounds like labour.
00:44:31,00:44:32,Giving birth.
00:44:32,00:44:33,Good guess.
00:44:33,00:44:34,You're pushing and you're whaling?
00:44:34,00:44:35,No.
00:44:35,00:44:36,I'm pretty much close.
00:44:36,00:44:45,"But it was, the definition in the OED is W Barnes term for a pram, pram plate."
00:44:45,00:44:47,And that's still in the OED today?
00:44:47,00:44:48,That's amazing.
00:44:48,00:44:49,Push whaling.
00:44:49,00:44:53,"As preparation for today, I'd listen to a bit of Cuomodo Diccita, which is the Latin"
00:44:53,00:44:54,podcast.
00:44:54,00:45:00,"And it's a few, it's really fun, like it's a few very nerdy people who've well versed"
00:45:00,00:45:01,in it and made a study of it.
00:45:01,00:45:06,"And they do it at a kind of slow, slow enough speed that you can just about sort of cling"
00:45:06,00:45:07,on to it.
00:45:07,00:45:08,"And it's, it's fun."
00:45:08,00:45:10,It's really interesting because you never hear it spoken normally.
00:45:10,00:45:11,"Well, thank God."
00:45:11,00:45:16,"I mean, I think there used to be a set of, you know, slightly eccentric people in Finland"
00:45:16,00:45:22,"who did the news in Latin, you know, each week, I think it was, and you think, what's"
00:45:22,00:45:23,the point?
00:45:23,00:45:24,"You know, what is the point?"
00:45:24,00:45:25,"Oh, it was fun."
00:45:25,00:45:26,Cuomodo Diccita is fun.
00:45:26,00:45:27,It's fun.
00:45:27,00:45:28,It's good.
00:45:28,00:45:29,But I want to read things like the Romans wrote.
00:45:29,00:45:34,"I don't want to sit listening to the news, read by some bloody fins in Latin."
00:45:34,00:45:39,"Is your podcast about the modern day button Latin, Andy, the one you're talking about?"
00:45:39,00:45:41,"Yeah, they start with how, what have you been up to?"
00:45:41,00:45:46,"This is not difficult, like, because there isn't a Latin word for, you know, telephone,"
00:45:46,00:45:47,for instance.
00:45:47,00:45:48,"Yes, I think they do."
00:45:48,00:45:49,They haven't defined a lot of work around here.
00:45:49,00:45:50,Yeah.
00:45:50,00:45:52,They haven't started living like Romans to make it more effective.
00:45:52,00:45:53,"Yeah, yeah."
00:45:53,00:45:56,The effort reward ratio does not seem to make too much sense.
00:45:56,00:46:01,"Is your Latin good enough that if you went to Vatican City, you could use their ATM"
00:46:01,00:46:02,machines?
00:46:02,00:46:03,Oh.
00:46:03,00:46:04,They give you a Latin option?
00:46:04,00:46:05,I think you can use ATM machines in most language.
00:46:05,00:46:07,You don't need to be able to speak a language.
00:46:07,00:46:11,"Yeah, I'll jab until numbers come up, and then I'll select immediate."
00:46:11,00:46:15,And then what you do is you look at all the numbers and you don't understand the current
00:46:15,00:46:16,scene.
00:46:16,00:46:20,"You choose the second smallest number, and you go for that, because that's probably about"
00:46:20,00:46:21,10 quid.
00:46:21,00:46:22,Because that's probably doable.
00:46:22,00:46:23,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:46:23,00:46:24,And you pull the big handle.
00:46:24,00:46:25,Yeah.
00:46:25,00:46:26,And then a line of poetry comes up.
00:46:26,00:46:35,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:46:35,00:46:41,"OK, my fact this week is that the biographer of 7th century French king, Dagoburt I, didn't"
00:46:41,00:46:48,include a list of his lovers because they said it would make the book too long to read.
00:46:48,00:46:49,Same.
00:46:49,00:46:50,Same.
00:46:50,00:46:51,I'm waiting.
00:46:51,00:46:52,I'm waiting.
00:46:52,00:46:53,I'm staring at Andy.
00:46:53,00:46:54,Waiting.
00:46:54,00:46:55,There's not a gravestone big enough.
00:46:55,00:46:56,"Oh, dear."
00:46:56,00:47:04,"Just a bed post, your tombstone, full of notches."
00:47:04,00:47:05,"Oh, my God."
00:47:05,00:47:06,Sorry.
00:47:06,00:47:07,No.
00:47:07,00:47:08,That is very funny.
00:47:08,00:47:13,Is that the biographer trying to praise Dagoburt by saying how marvellous he was about it?
00:47:13,00:47:14,"No, not really."
00:47:14,00:47:15,I don't think so.
00:47:15,00:47:16,I don't think it was very positive thing.
00:47:16,00:47:19,So I read this in BBC History Magazine.
00:47:19,00:47:20,It was part...
00:47:20,00:47:21,"Well, it must be true."
00:47:21,00:47:23,And I have subsequently checked it.
00:47:23,00:47:25,"God, I love you, Mary."
00:47:25,00:47:27,We're going to get letters from geography teachers.
00:47:27,00:47:30,We're going to get letters from BBC History.
00:47:30,00:47:33,"If you are going to send a letter in about this episode, if it's not in Latin, we're"
00:47:33,00:47:36,not going to read it.
00:47:36,00:47:39,So it's part of the Q&A section where they answer questions that someone might ask about
00:47:39,00:47:40,history.
00:47:40,00:47:44,"And the question was, how responsible was King Dagoburt I for the decline of the Merovingians?"
00:47:44,00:47:49,"Which I think is a question we're always asking ourselves, aren't we?"
00:47:49,00:47:50,Absolutely.
00:47:50,00:47:53,"And it turns out these Merovingians, they were a group that came up with this."
00:47:53,00:47:55,"They came after the Romans, right, Mary?"
00:47:55,00:47:58,"So maybe you don't like them so much, because..."
00:47:58,00:47:59,I know nothing about them.
00:47:59,00:48:03,I was delighted that you were going to take us into the Merovingians.
00:48:03,00:48:07,"Because, you know, I've always been busting to know a bit more about them."
00:48:07,00:48:10,"Well, they were very big around the 5th century AD."
00:48:10,00:48:13,"They ruled in what's now France, Germany, Belgium."
00:48:13,00:48:15,And Dagoburt came along.
00:48:15,00:48:17,And he was a bit of a black sheep.
00:48:17,00:48:19,And he was dog by scandal.
00:48:19,00:48:22,He moved the court to Paris because he was a bit of a playboy.
00:48:22,00:48:24,And there was lots of fun happening in Paris.
00:48:24,00:48:28,"He lived in loads of luxury, tried to get as much gold as possible."
00:48:28,00:48:33,"And he'd previously married his stepsister to cement the monarchy, as was quite common"
00:48:33,00:48:34,in those days.
00:48:34,00:48:35,Dagoburt.
00:48:35,00:48:38,But he divorced her as soon as his father died.
00:48:38,00:48:41,Because his father was the one who was kind of organising it all.
00:48:41,00:48:45,"He got in charge, divorced his wife, and then just went through loads and loads of affairs."
00:48:45,00:48:50,And basically all this debauchery was the beginning of the end for the Merovingians.
00:48:50,00:48:53,"So it's a moral tale, really."
00:48:53,00:48:54,It really is.
00:48:54,00:48:55,Yeah.
00:48:55,00:48:56,"It seems like that, doesn't it?"
00:48:56,00:49:03,And the biographer links his sort of personal lust with his lust for ecclesiastical lands.
00:49:03,00:49:08,"You know, it always starts with first, and eventually you're on the ecclesiastical lands."
00:49:08,00:49:10,That's what you lust after eventually.
00:49:10,00:49:16,"This all comes, I should say, from the Chronicle of Fredegar, which was the 7th century Frankish"
00:49:16,00:49:19,Chronicle written about the Merovingian kings.
00:49:19,00:49:20,Because we all know that anyway.
00:49:20,00:49:21,Yeah.
00:49:21,00:49:23,I have never come across the Merovingians before.
00:49:23,00:49:27,"It's kind of a word you hear, like the guy in the Matrix?"
00:49:27,00:49:28,Yeah.
00:49:28,00:49:29,The guy in the Matrix.
00:49:29,00:49:33,"But they were the ruling family, weren't they, of the Frankish kingdom."
00:49:33,00:49:35,And they were the ones who came before like Charlemagne and...
00:49:35,00:49:36,Yeah.
00:49:36,00:49:37,We've heard of them.
00:49:37,00:49:42,"The Romans are fine, the Carolingians are fine, but it's the Merovingians which..."
00:49:42,00:49:46,"The Merovingians, when you look them up, there's one thing that comes up on a lot of pages"
00:49:46,00:49:51,"and it separates them from the Romans and the Carolingians, which is long hair was seen"
00:49:51,00:49:53,as power in their society.
00:49:53,00:50:02,Roulous had long hair and there's a professor called James Palmer who said that basically
00:50:02,00:50:06,if there was someone who was an heir to the throne that they thought it's not going to
00:50:06,00:50:11,"be quite good enough, they would shave their head, pop them into a monastery like a monk."
00:50:11,00:50:14,"But have them on standby because they haven't gone bold, they can grow back right."
00:50:14,00:50:17,"And if the person then, who's been put in power, was seen as bad, they can knock that"
00:50:17,00:50:20,person out and bring back the monk.
00:50:20,00:50:24,"Can I say, if you're like the next in line for the Merovingians and you start going bold,"
00:50:24,00:50:25,is that you done?
00:50:25,00:50:26,"Well, yeah."
00:50:26,00:50:28,There's no hair transplants in those days.
00:50:28,00:50:29,"No, exactly."
00:50:29,00:50:30,It's...
00:50:30,00:50:31,There's wigs though.
00:50:31,00:50:32,Ah.
00:50:32,00:50:33,Okay.
00:50:33,00:50:34,There we go.
00:50:34,00:50:38,But it was a tool of state power that one of the queens was called Clotild and she was
00:50:38,00:50:42,"6th century queen, widow of King Clovis and Clovis, by the way, is where we get Louis"
00:50:42,00:50:43,from.
00:50:43,00:50:47,"Clovis, knock off the sea, you got Lovis, that's why so many French kings are called"
00:50:47,00:50:48,Louis.
00:50:48,00:50:49,Is it?
00:50:49,00:50:50,"It was all from Clovis, yeah."
00:50:50,00:50:56,"Anyway, her grandsons were meant to be crowned, they were slated next up, all of this."
00:50:56,00:51:01,And then some plotters in the family abducted them and dispatched a henchman to Queen Clotild
00:51:01,00:51:04,"saying, ""We've got a pair of scissors here and a sword here."
00:51:04,00:51:06,"Which do you want for your grandsons?"""
00:51:06,00:51:11,"And the idea was either we can execute them as royals or we can cut their hair, which"
00:51:11,00:51:14,"means their life won't be worth living, they'll be living as non-royals."
00:51:14,00:51:17,"And she said, ""Sword please, sword please for my grandsons."""
00:51:17,00:51:18,Wow.
00:51:18,00:51:20,"I'd rather that than a haircut, which means a non-royal life."
00:51:20,00:51:21,Big decision.
00:51:21,00:51:22,"Yeah, that's hard."
00:51:22,00:51:25,"And the Carolingians, when they came in, had to separate themselves from the whole long"
00:51:25,00:51:28,"hair thing, so they went for the mustache."
00:51:28,00:51:29,Yeah.
00:51:29,00:51:30,That was their big thing.
00:51:30,00:51:31,Yeah.
00:51:31,00:51:32,"Charlemagne, picture his long mustache."
00:51:32,00:51:33,Lovely.
00:51:33,00:51:34,Yeah.
00:51:34,00:51:36,"I couldn't tell you what Charlemagne looked like, I must say."
00:51:36,00:51:39,"What's weird is, I'm not actually sure I've seen a picture of him, I just have conjured"
00:51:39,00:51:40,that in my head.
00:51:40,00:51:45,"Here's one thing I found about Dagoburt, which I'd never heard before."
00:51:45,00:51:50,"He was the first French king to be crowned on a folding chair, like a fishing chair."
00:51:50,00:51:56,"And I was reading about these folding chairs, and apparently it was one of the best things"
00:51:56,00:51:59,"you could have for quite a lot, like in ancient Rome."
00:51:59,00:52:00,Interesting.
00:52:00,00:52:04,"What I mean, it's like an X-shape legs and then almost like a cloth belt, but it was"
00:52:04,00:52:06,actually made of sort of like a director's chair.
00:52:06,00:52:07,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:07,00:52:08,But without a back.
00:52:08,00:52:09,But without a back.
00:52:09,00:52:10,Yeah.
00:52:10,00:52:13,"And they were made of wood, and they were huge in ancient Egypt."
00:52:13,00:52:18,"There's one in the British Museum, Tutankhamun was buried with two of them, and now it's"
00:52:18,00:52:19,mostly people watching golf.
00:52:19,00:52:22,The kings of our age.
00:52:22,00:52:27,"The Emperor Augustus took one to the opening of a rather posh theatre, and he fell off"
00:52:27,00:52:30,"his very bad, bad size, he fell off his folding chair."
00:52:30,00:52:33,I bet no one laughed at that.
00:52:33,00:52:36,"Well only, it was a bit of a risk to tell off it."
00:52:36,00:52:37,Wow.
00:52:37,00:52:41,"That's a quite famous ruler of this period, Dagobot the Second."
00:52:41,00:52:42,Oh yeah.
00:52:42,00:52:44,Don't get me started on that.
00:52:44,00:52:45,Oh boy.
00:52:45,00:52:46,Here we go again.
00:52:46,00:52:48,Down's on his hobby horse.
00:52:48,00:52:52,"Well, you never know how history is going to replace you and your story into new light,"
00:52:52,00:52:57,"and that's what happened with Dagobot the Second, because he disappeared and no one quite"
00:52:57,00:53:00,"knows was he murdered, what was the end of his story."
00:53:00,00:53:06,"Cut to many, many years later, this hoax is set up, this thing called the Priory of Scion,"
00:53:06,00:53:12,"where the idea is that they are looking after the bloodline of the Merovingians, and then"
00:53:12,00:53:17,"that gets picked up by the writers of a book, which is all about the bloodline of Christ,"
00:53:17,00:53:18,and brought into that.
00:53:18,00:53:22,"So the Merovingians are the descendants of Christ, is the slave."
00:53:22,00:53:23,"Exactly, the Da Vinci code is largely…"
00:53:23,00:53:26,"Do you want to retract your very learned comment from earlier, Mary?"
00:53:26,00:53:31,"No, it's not my theory, and I made sure this fact was last at the show, so if Mary walked"
00:53:31,00:53:33,out we'd have enough in the tank.
00:53:33,00:53:36,"Do you want to know the truth about the Merovingians, Dan?"
00:53:36,00:53:38,This is the truth.
00:53:38,00:53:42,"This was a claim made at the time, not by the kings themselves, but I think by people around"
00:53:42,00:53:48,"them, that they were descended from a sea monster, not from a god, but a specific…"
00:53:48,00:53:49,Have you heard of a…
00:53:49,00:53:50,"I think your cab's here, Mary."
00:53:50,00:53:52,Have you heard of a quina tour?
00:53:52,00:53:54,"Like a quina tour, but not."
00:53:54,00:53:55,Exactly.
00:53:55,00:53:59,"But with quins, so with five horns."
00:53:59,00:54:02,The quina tour is the most ridiculous looking animal you'll ever see.
00:54:02,00:54:06,"It's a half-bull, half-fish, but it's got five horns up front."
00:54:06,00:54:11,"It's because the word Merovech, where we get Merovingian, it means sea-bull, so…"
00:54:11,00:54:12,"Oh, of course."
00:54:12,00:54:13,I've forgotten.
00:54:13,00:54:14,I've forgotten.
00:54:14,00:54:15,"So the quina tour, supposedly, is the answer."
00:54:15,00:54:19,"Is his head like one of those, you know those ring-toss things that kids have?"
00:54:19,00:54:20,Exactly like that.
00:54:20,00:54:21,Does it look like that?
00:54:21,00:54:22,Exactly like that.
00:54:22,00:54:23,"Yeah, and they're different colours for different prizes."
00:54:23,00:54:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:54:24,00:54:26,This was so embarrassing when he was trying to give a good talk and just a hoop would
00:54:26,00:54:27,land on his…
00:54:27,00:54:31,"Guys, come on, five minutes, put a big speech there."
00:54:31,00:54:34,So this fact was about biographers and stuff.
00:54:34,00:54:38,"And I want to know, what I read is that it was quite dangerous to be a biographer in"
00:54:38,00:54:44,"ancient times, because you basically had to… you had to say really nice things about the"
00:54:44,00:54:49,"person you're biographising, but you couldn't go over the top because it would seem like"
00:54:49,00:54:51,you were being too obsequious.
00:54:51,00:54:54,"But then on the other hand, if you said anything bad, you could basically be put to death."
00:54:54,00:54:55,Right.
00:54:55,00:54:57,So there was an obvious answer to this.
00:54:57,00:54:59,You wait till they're dead before you write the biography.
00:54:59,00:55:00,Okay.
00:55:00,00:55:05,"So your publishers are going to be on your mirrors, mirrors really looking forward to"
00:55:05,00:55:06,seeing a proof.
00:55:06,00:55:07,Exactly.
00:55:07,00:55:11,"And you're half the advance, yeah, it's not."
00:55:11,00:55:15,"I'm sorry, the last chapter's taken me a bit longer than I thought it was going to"
00:55:15,00:55:17,run working on it.
00:55:17,00:55:18,Interesting.
00:55:18,00:55:23,"You just, you know, one thing you never want to do is to talk about the emperor while he's"
00:55:23,00:55:24,alive.
00:55:24,00:55:25,Yeah.
00:55:25,00:55:29,"The other thing about the biographers is how much of it was true, right?"
00:55:29,00:55:34,"See, probably very little, particularly if you're dealing with the concupines of Dacabere,"
00:55:34,00:55:35,I suspect.
00:55:35,00:55:41,"But when I was a student, a long time ago, we were always taught now you've got to go"
00:55:41,00:55:45,through all these biographies and you've got to get your blue pencil out and you've
00:55:45,00:55:49,"got to, you've got to put a line through all the bits that can't possibly be true."
00:55:49,00:55:52,"So you do that and then you come to some bits and think, could it be true?"
00:55:52,00:55:58,"Well, maybe it could be put a question mark and I spent years of my life doing that really."
00:55:58,00:56:02,"Because I, in the last few years, I've realised it's not the point."
00:56:02,00:56:07,"The point is that people believe this stuff, you know."
00:56:07,00:56:12,"It's taking you a bit into the kind of way we think about monarchs and celebs, et cetera."
00:56:12,00:56:18,"We tell these stories about their excesses, which are not true, but they certainly tell"
00:56:18,00:56:24,"us about how we envisage, you know, it goes right down to the kind of innocent King Charles,"
00:56:24,00:56:25,doesn't it?
00:56:25,00:56:30,"You know, he has someone who puts toothpaste on his toothbrush for him."
00:56:30,00:56:35,The story about King Charles is that he had like 12 different eggs made every morning
00:56:35,00:56:38,of different hardness and he would choose which one to eat and stuff.
00:56:38,00:56:45,"And you know, that goes right back to the ancient world because there's a story about"
00:56:45,00:56:52,the kitchens of Antony and Cleopatra and kind of next to Eyewitness visits the kitchens
00:56:52,00:56:56,"and there's eight boars roasting, right?"
00:56:56,00:57:03,"And the guy says to the cook, ""God, you must be expecting a large party to dinner tonight."""
00:57:03,00:57:07,"And the cook says, ""No, it's just we don't quite know when they're going to sit down"
00:57:07,00:57:13,"to eat, so we put them all on at different times so that one will be ready when they"
00:57:13,00:57:14,"want it."""
00:57:14,00:57:15,And that's just like the boar's example.
00:57:15,00:57:16,It's so funny.
00:57:16,00:57:17,Cool?
00:57:17,00:57:22,I have 12 microwaves in my house and I put one frozen lasagna in each.
00:57:22,00:57:29,"But I was brought up with the idea that the Queen's corgis, the late Queen's corgis,"
00:57:29,00:57:32,ate out of silver dishes.
00:57:32,00:57:37,And I once went to do some filming in Windsor Castle with a film crew and we had to go quite
00:57:37,00:57:41,near the sort of more domestic apartments.
00:57:41,00:57:49,"And as we passed the door to the pets area, we all looked at each other because lined"
00:57:49,00:57:53,up by the door were a load of very nasty plastic bowls.
00:57:53,00:57:54,Wow.
00:57:54,00:57:59,"They were for the staff, they were for the staff."
00:57:59,00:58:03,"Everybody said, ""So it's not true, then."""
00:58:03,00:58:07,But the point where you're saying is the fact that we think that about the royal family
00:58:07,00:58:11,tells us a lot more about life today than whether it's true or not.
00:58:11,00:58:13,And that's what we want to believe as well.
00:58:13,00:58:18,"About how we imagine power, how we imagine wealth, what would we do if we had unlimited"
00:58:18,00:58:19,wealth?
00:58:19,00:58:22,"Well, my dog would eat out of silver bowls."
00:58:22,00:58:28,"I feel a bit sorry for Dagoburt the first though, you know, because if you're a monarch,"
00:58:28,00:58:33,"one thing they always get you for is too much sex, isn't it?"
00:58:33,00:58:38,"It's always, we couldn't possibly fit the names of all the concubines in."
00:58:38,00:58:42,One of the definitions of a monarch is that they have more sex than everybody else.
00:58:42,00:58:48,"And that's partly about power, but then it gets used against them as they're absolutely"
00:58:48,00:58:52,lurid bastards who you can't trust.
00:58:52,00:58:57,"And in Rome, of course, the wives are having too much sex as well."
00:58:57,00:58:59,Is that the slander or the reputation?
00:58:59,00:59:03,"That's what's always been, that is always a reputation that, you know, the emperor"
00:59:03,00:59:09,"Claudius' wife, Messalina, one story about her cannot possibly be true, but it's a real"
00:59:09,00:59:15,revelation is that she's supposed to have challenged the prostitutes of Rome to a competition
00:59:15,00:59:19,of who could sleep with most men in one night.
00:59:19,00:59:20,"And she won, of course."
00:59:20,00:59:26,"She fell off halfway through, but the judges decided that she had won."
00:59:26,00:59:30,And you think you can't win with your sex life if you're a ruler.
00:59:30,00:59:35,"When the truth is, they were all happy that once a year like the rest of us."
00:59:35,00:59:39,In a very boring way.
00:59:39,00:59:46,"Dagobah's reputation has recovered because now in France, there's a phrase, Le bon roi"
00:59:46,00:59:48,"dagobah, the good King Dagobah."
00:59:48,00:59:52,And it's basically the ultra basic nursery rhyme that French children learn and are sung
00:59:52,00:59:53,by their parents.
00:59:53,00:59:54,Like Old King Cole is a merry old song.
00:59:54,00:59:55,It's exactly like that.
00:59:55,01:00:00,"And it's all, there's a French revolutionary song, Le bon roi dagobah, because that was"
01:00:00,01:00:05,a way of making fun of kings and monarchy without actually making fun of King Louis
01:00:05,01:00:06,XVI.
01:00:06,01:00:10,"It was two years before the revolution, this song was written as a way of satirising the"
01:00:10,01:00:11,monarchy.
01:00:11,01:00:12,But now that's survived.
01:00:12,01:00:15,And it's one of the absolute root one lullabies in France.
01:00:15,01:00:18,"But they don't tell them about his sex life, though."
01:00:18,01:00:19,That's a later verse.
01:00:19,01:00:22,It's normally skipped.
01:00:22,01:00:32,"That's when he calls for his fiddle as three, that's what that's all about."
01:00:32,01:00:33,"OK, that's it."
01:00:33,01:00:34,That is all of our facts.
