00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
 Hi everybody, Dan and Andy here, and we have an announcement of our exciting guest today,

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,400
 and then we have an apology to make, and then we have another exciting announcement.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,560
 It's an excitement sandwich.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,560
 That's true.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,840
 So joining us on the podcast today is one of our heroes, someone that we've been reading

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,480
 the books of for many years now, and who excitingly has just entered the world of podcasting herself,

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,120
 and that is the historian Mary Beard.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,400
 Yes, Mary is one of Britain's best known classes.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,480
 She's brilliant.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,280
 She knows everything there is to know about the ancient world, and excitingly, her new

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,400
 podcast, all about classics, has just launched.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,280
 It's called Instant Classics.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,720
 It's very funny and interesting.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,840
 Episode one is Which Roman Emperor is Donald Trump?

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,800
 So if you like the sound of Mary's stuff and you'd like to learn a bit more about the

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
 ancient world, check out Instant Classics.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
 That's right.

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,120
 She co-hosts it with a brilliant author called Charlotte Higgins.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
 It's a very funny show.

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,200
 They're going to be doing a book club based on the Odyssey, so do check it out, available

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,520
 wherever you get your podcasts.

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,600
 Another thing that we need to say is sorry, Andy.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,080
 We've had some correspondents from Zak Rosolinski who says, "In the intro to your most recent

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,440
 episode, you said astronauts on the ISS could not attend your forthcoming remote live show

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,400
 at the London Podcast Festival because they do not have Wi-Fi."

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,840
 This is not true.

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,160
 He says, "The ISS does have Wi-Fi, although it is more used for navigation and whatnot

28
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,080
 than downloading podcasts."

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,160
 But astronauts do have an approved list of downloadable materials, so all we need to

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,000
 do is get on to the International Space Station list of approved materials, and then they

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,480
 too will be able to attend on the 5th and 6th of September.

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,440
 For a week afterwards, guys, you can buy your tickets a bit late and still stream the London

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,960
 Podcast Festival, no such thing as official live shows.

34
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
 They're going to be great.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
 That's right.

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,920
 We've got Jamie Morton and my dad wrote a porno joining us on the 5th of September,

37
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,360
 and then Richard Osman joining us on the 6th.

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,960
 It's going to be awesome, but if you can't make it to those live shows, guess what?

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,840
 We are announcing another live show.

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,080
 Our cup runneth over, your cup runneth over.

41
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,120
 The cups are all too full.

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,720
 Come to Cheltenham on the 16th of October.

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,000
 We are playing the Cheltenham Literature Festival, and we have a special guest for that show,

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,300
 too, who's the brilliant Rachel Parris.

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,880
 So it's going to be amazing.

46
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,600
 Details of all of this stuff, Cheltenham and the London Podcast, are on nosuchthingasafish.com/live.

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
 Say it with me, Dan.

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:32,480
 No such thing as a fish.com/live.

49
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
 That's right.

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,960
 Everyone's invited to Cheltenham, except astronauts.

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,040
 We will not be letting any astronauts in, but everyone else, come along.

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:59,480
 Okay, on with the podcast, on with the show.

53
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,160
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

55
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,800
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Mary Beard.

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,120
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,000
 from the last seven days, and in no particular order.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,680
 Here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is Mary.

60
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,560
 Right, my fact is the answer to this question.

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:37,440
 Who was, or is, the highest earning sportsperson of all time measured in prize money?

62
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
 Oh, thank God.

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,920
 I don't know if you know this, Mary, but I'm a massive golf fan.

64
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,920
 The listeners will know that I love going on about golf, and it's Tiger Woods.

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
 Well, dream on.

66
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:55,160
 Dream on, because actually it's a man called Gaius Apuleus Diocles.

67
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,800
 Is he also a golfer?

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,680
 Golf hadn't been invented when Diocles was around.

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:10,480
 No, he is a Roman champion charioteer, and his tombstone, let's assume it's reliable,

70
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,520
 tells us that over his career he earned, and I'm going to give you in Roman money first,

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:24,600
 and then I'll tell you how much it is, he earned more than 35 million cestuses.

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,920
 Now it's always kind of difficult saying, so how much is that in, you know, in today's

73
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:38,200
 money then, well, let me say that that much 35 million cestuses will be enough to feed

74
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:45,040
 the whole population of the city of Rome, that's a million of them, in basic supplies

75
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,640
 for one year.

76
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
 OK.

77
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,200
 Right, so we're dealing with billions of pounds.

78
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,680
 How many people can Tiger Woods feed, James?

79
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,960
 Myself and all his mistresses.

80
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
 What would that be?

81
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,400
 Is that, that's more than any sports star you're saying?

82
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,560
 I'm saying that it's more than any sports star today, or any other that we have any

83
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
 historical record about.

84
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,520
 Right, so this was on, he had this on his tombstone, can you just get my dates and tell

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,000
 them I was the highest paid sports star?

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,880
 That is, well, my inference is that he doesn't actually say I'm the highest paid sports star

87
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,800
 in Rome, and by the way, I'm going to be the highest paid sports star ever, you know.

88
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,520
 He just lays it out with number of victories, amount of cash won, what team he was playing

89
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,880
 for because he's in the transfer market in the Charity of Teams, and the total amount

90
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
 of prize money.

91
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,320
 I love it being on a tombstone though, as in it is the equivalent of googling someone

92
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,120
 today, because if you google any name, you will get net worth.

93
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,720
 On your tombstone, Andy, would you like Charter Award?

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
 I don't mind to boast.

95
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
 I don't mind to boast.

96
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,200
 That didn't worry Diaklis.

97
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,560
 Diaklis was very happy to boast, so don't be too modest.

98
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,240
 I guess one of the question is, if it's on a tombstone, does that mean it's a more reliable

99
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,000
 source, would you say?

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 We do wonder where the info actually came from, because it's absolutely fantastically

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 detailed.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,760
 He was like, he had 870 victories when he started from the starting gates and never

103
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,600
 gave up first place.

104
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:29,600
 He had 620 victories when he came from behind and made a last minute dash, and this is the

105
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,680
 amount of money he earned for each of them.

106
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,800
 Now, one possibility is that Diaklis was a real nerd, and every evening he went home

107
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:49,320
 and wrote down 95,000 sestases having come from behind with a last minute dash, and

108
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,360
 he kept it in his little notebook.

109
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,560
 It's more likely that there's a kind of wisdoms cricketer almanac.

110
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,000
 I was just going to say now, like sports fans right now love statistics, don't they?

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,720
 So what's on the tombstone is what they've got from the stats.

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 Amazing.

113
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,240
 That's so interesting, but he clearly didn't catch on right.

114
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,920
 He probably thought this is going to be huge.

115
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,720
 Every tombstone is going to be stat packed from now on.

116
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
 That's right.

117
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,920
 Well, there are a few of us, but never quite this, I mean it looks really boring, because

118
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
 all it is, is the stats.

119
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,720
 It's like, you know, football stats or cricket stats.

120
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
 I can literally sit there and read it all day.

121
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
 Golfing stats.

122
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,040
 So I think, you know, we ought to rob Tiger Woods his nose in it really.

123
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
 Oh yeah, definitely.

124
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:46,440
 I didn't realise that chariot racing, I knew chariot racing happened in Rome, but I assumed

125
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,760
 that Rome used chariots in a military sense, and it sounds like there's not really any

126
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,480
 evidence they did because chariots were an older thing, and that in Rome they were for

127
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
 racing.

128
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,280
 Yeah, there's a bit of military PR with chariots, you know, just to frighten the enemy.

129
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:11,720
 But essentially you get these fantastic resources pulling the chariots, and it's a phenomenally

130
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
 dangerous.

131
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,880
 Boral Diocles, he died in his forties, he's lucky to stay alive that long, because you've

132
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:24,040
 got this really long track, more than half a kilometre, with terribly tight ends.

133
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,760
 So you have to go up and down, you have to go round seven times, and the ends are where

134
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,120
 you crash, because you can't turn around the corner.

135
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,360
 And they were called shipwrecks, now fragia, that's a chariot that kind of crashes at the

136
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
 corners.

137
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:50,760
 And the fans were absolutely obsessive loonies, and there are accounts of the fans really

138
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,840
 looking after the racehorses, really looking out for them, and one of the things they used

139
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,920
 to do is they used to sniff their shit, because they were really anxious that they were being

140
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,480
 fed the right stuff.

141
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,400
 Because if you want to have a racehorse pulling the chariot really quick, then you've got

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,720
 to make sure that it's being given the right diet.

143
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,280
 I would try and check at the other end of the process, I would try and check the feet.

144
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,240
 You would have thought that was the easiest, but they knew that you wanted to know what

145
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
 came out.

146
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,200
 I couldn't believe I was reading about Nero, so Emperor Nero, he's on a tour of Greece,

147
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,920
 he is so into chariot racing that he decides to enter the Olympics in 67 AD, when there

148
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,120
 is no Olympics, it's not meant to be on there here, you've got a much better chance of winning

149
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,800
 in a non-olympic year, no, because he moves it, he moves it, but imagine I'm not naming

150
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,920
 any particular president of the United States, but imagine the president of the United States

151
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,760
 arrives in some country and wants to participate, but it's not actually been quite timed, well

152
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,440
 they just move it, don't they, that's what you do.

153
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,040
 The next World Cup football is in America, isn't it, I can imagine Trump turning out.

154
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,160
 But that story is extraordinary, because back then the Olympics were tied into religious

155
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,120
 connotations, they had it in a specific year, the religious rights, so all of that's out

156
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,000
 the window, he joins, you have four horses to your chariot in the Olympics, he shows

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,680
 up with ten horses and then cuts a corner, flips over, loses the race and still wins

158
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
 it.

159
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,600
 Just like Mr Trump and Gulls, absolutely the same, one thing you know is you don't want

160
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
 to beat the emperor.

161
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,160
 Yeah, but there was some underhand tactics that went on, I read, I don't know if this

162
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,080
 is true, that the white team and the red team, we don't really know much about them in literature,

163
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,360
 but one place that we do see them a lot is in curse tablets, because a lot of the cheating

164
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,600
 was cursing your opponents, is that right?

165
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,840
 But it was against the rules to curse people.

166
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
 Really?

167
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
 Who was going to enforce it then?

168
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,240
 Yeah, the gods, maybe.

169
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,660
 How do you, you can't check the poo coming out of the cursor to see if they've done it,

170
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,120
 right, like that, you can do that silently.

171
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:14,120
 And it was, the Circus Maximus was clearly, unlike the Colosseum, which was rigidly sex-segregated,

172
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:20,080
 men only, until you got to the really bad seats at the top when the women could sit.

173
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,000
 For most of the time, the men and women sat together in the Circus Maximus and it's absolutely

174
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,800
 clear that it was a prime flirt location, a pick-up joint, right?

175
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,760
 Do you want to come with me and smell some hot shit?

176
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
 Do you want to come with me?

177
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,480
 It's a little more subtle than that, actually, do you mind terribly if I pass you by to get

178
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
 to my seat?

179
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
 Oh, did I rub your knee?

180
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
 I'm just terribly sorry.

181
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,480
 Well, they have the October horse ritual, which is quite interesting.

182
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
 Oh, very learned.

183
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
 Yeah.

184
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,160
 That is the first time anyone said that to you.

185
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,160
 You are not editing that out of the show.

186
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
 That's stated.

187
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
 That's quite...

188
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
 That's your ringtone.

189
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
 That's mine.

190
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,800
 You googled Roman horse and have found the October horse ritual.

191
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,000
 Okay, do a back-up on it, that was good now.

192
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Sorry, I'd be...

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,200
 No, it's a very interesting idea that it was part of a ritual that you sacrifice a horse

194
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,640
 to the gods and there would be a race, a chariot race, where two people would race against

195
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
 each other.

196
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,480
 Whoever won, the right-hand horse of the two horses would have its head taken off and then...

197
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
 The winner?

198
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,880
 Yes, because it was for the gods.

199
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,540
 So you were sacrificing your best horse, right?

200
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,960
 And then a fight would happen between two people to see who could keep the head and then that

201
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,480
 would be displayed outside of a house.

202
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,520
 But that must be a slightly distressing moment when you know you need your horse for another

203
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,560
 race and you win that one.

204
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,640
 No, it was worth it because of the prestige of...

205
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,280
 What about Sinisca, the Spartan female chariot winner?

206
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,640
 Yes.

207
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,200
 So what I read is that she won the Olympic golds but maybe she wasn't on the chariots.

208
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
 Yeah.

209
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,480
 I mean, there is a problem about...

210
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,520
 Not in Rome, I can tell you, in Rome, Darkleys was on the chariot and a winner.

211
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:23,760
 In Greece, in traditional Greece before Nero, it's not clear whether it's the chariot owner

212
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,040
 who is the winner or the charioteer.

213
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,600
 So sometimes when people say, "Oh, so-and-so female won the chariot race," that is because

214
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,720
 she owned the chariot.

215
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,280
 This is like the Queen winning the Grand National.

216
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
 The Queen winning the Grand National.

217
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
 She's not...

218
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
 She wasn't going over Beechersburg.

219
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,280
 She was never on the horse, no.

220
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,000
 So she's just patting it when it finishes.

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,760
 Yeah, that's an important job, actually.

222
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,440
 But maybe this woman might have trained the horses, is that right?

223
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
 That might have done.

224
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
 We just don't know.

225
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
 But you don't know.

226
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
 You don't know.

227
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
 So then finally, Darkleys, he retires.

228
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
 Does he?

229
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,200
 He's a billion, billion, billionaire.

230
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
 What does he do?

231
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,000
 Does he take over the country or...?

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 God only...

233
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,280
 Well, we have no clue.

234
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
 Just disappears.

235
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:13,120
 What he does, where he lived, he probably starts life as a slave in modern Portugal.

236
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,480
 Actually, that's where we think he comes from, but makes it big in Rome.

237
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,160
 If he's got 35 million cestuses, then he can afford a palace.

238
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,920
 But we don't have no clue where he lived.

239
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,400
 Perhaps he just lived very modestly and gave his winnings to the people.

240
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,160
 But if he did, he didn't tell us on his tombstone.

241
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
 You'd put that up there.

242
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,880
 I think I might say, "And he gave it all away."

243
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,960
 I didn't know he was from Portugal, because that must hurt for Cristiano Ronaldo, who's

244
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
 currently there.

245
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,480
 I was going to say, "Eat your heart out, Ronaldo."

246
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,120
 Not even the richest sportsman from Portugal.

247
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,400
 Do we know why he was so good?

248
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
 What made him so...

249
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
 Look.

250
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
 I'd say look.

251
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
 But...

252
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
 It didn't flip over.

253
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
 That's not to be largely...

254
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,680
 I know that's the result, I'm asking why.

255
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
 One stage back.

256
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,280
 Yeah, but I think of Stephen Bradbury, the Australian figure skater, oh, speed skater,

257
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,000
 who won the Olympic gold, because in the semifinals, everyone in front of him fell over, and then

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 he won.

259
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,520
 And then in the finals, exactly the same thing happened.

260
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,440
 What if Diakles was just terrible, and he just kept coming up the back and everyone

261
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
 was shipwrecked?

262
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
 He just kept going.

263
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,320
 He just didn't give up.

264
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
 Yeah.

265
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,000
 But I think he probably had a good fan base, though.

266
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Yeah, it sounds good.

267
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,520
 They were cheering him on.

268
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
 We should move on, guys.

269
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,800
 Can I put one missed to bed before we go on?

270
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
 Okay, yeah.

271
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,960
 This is something we get sent all the time in the fishing box, and thank you very much

272
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,080
 to everyone who's sent it in, but it's not true, and it's about chariots, and it's about

273
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
 Roman horses.

274
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
 Uh-huh.

275
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:50,400
 It's that the size of the space shuttle rocket boosters was directly based on the size of

276
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
 Roman horses.

277
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,800
 Like the Apollo missions, you mean?

278
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
 Yeah.

279
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
 Okay.

280
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
 Yeah.

281
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,080
 So there's this thing that gets sent in all the time, and it's that the standard railway

282
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,440
 gauge on British railways and American ones is four for eight and a half inches, and that

283
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,040
 is because the railway gauge was based on trams, and those were based on wagons, and wagons

284
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,680
 were based on wheel ruts on old roads, roads that were built by the Romans that were based

285
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,240
 on the size of two Roman horses walking next to each other because of chariots.

286
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
 Great fact.

287
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
 No.

288
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
 No.

289
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
 It's time to move on.

290
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
 It's all Roman horses.

291
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
 Cobblers.

292
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
 It's just not true.

293
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
 It's cobblers.

294
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
 It's cobblers.

295
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
 It's cobblers.

296
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
 No, you've done the research.

297
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
 Why is it cobblers?

298
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,840
 I just know it's cobblers.

299
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,880
 Well, it's like saying that actually all clothes are based on ancient clothes because

300
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,760
 they're roughly the same size.

301
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,960
 It happens to be the case that if you're building a road, you don't build it so it's

302
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,120
 200 feet wide.

303
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,640
 It's either indirectly true in a trivial way, or it's not really true, but there's no evidence

304
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,160
 of that specific size being used in between the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and there

305
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
 you go.

306
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,680
 Well, stop sending it into our team.

307
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,680
 Thank you.

308
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,080
 He comes into work very upset everybody.

309
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:10,640
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

310
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,380
 My fact this week is that because the Confederate General Stonewall Jackson believed that one

311
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,600
 of his arms was much larger than the other, he used to walk around with it held in the

312
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,800
 air just so that he could redistribute all of the blood it was hogging.

313
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,280
 So this is written about quite a few times.

314
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,120
 I'm holding my hand up for some reason, as I was telling that fact.

315
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
 You can put it down now.

316
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
 Yes, down.

317
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,360
 Yes, thank you.

318
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,360
 Stonewall Jackson, he was called Thomas Jonathan Stonewall Jackson, 1824 to 1863.

319
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,040
 He was a Confederate General, military officer, and he was seen as one of the most gifted

320
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,560
 tactical officers of that period.

321
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,760
 Even people like Lincoln, who obviously did not like him, said, "Well, that guy was good."

322
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,680
 You know, they all sort of acknowledged it, but he was also a bit of an eccentric, a hypochondriac,

323
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,960
 and one of the things was he believed he had one incredibly long arm and that it was basically

324
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,400
 sucking up all the blood that he needed for the rest of his body.

325
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,040
 Have we seen any pictures of him?

326
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,120
 Like obviously not photos, but are there like other photos?

327
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
 There are photos of him.

328
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
 1860s?

329
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
 Yeah.

330
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
 And he with really long arms?

331
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,320
 No, they sort of cut it off at the sort of neckline so you don't really get to see it,

332
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
 from what I've seen.

333
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
 What's he hiding?

334
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
 Big arm.

335
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
 A big arm.

336
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
 Couldn't he just measure it?

337
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
 It seems he's holding them out.

338
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,240
 He could just come up and, it's not a rocky science, is it?

339
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
 He felt that it was larger as well.

340
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,960
 Just generally he felt like maybe there was less muscle and more blood.

341
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
 Yeah, exactly.

342
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,000
 Once you've got it into your head, there's no...

343
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,920
 You know that thing where you put your arms out and then you put one of them over the

344
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,240
 back of your neck and then it's shorter again, shorter than the other.

345
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
 Oh, wow.

346
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
 No, I didn't know that actually.

347
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,280
 Well, maybe he did that one day at school and then he just got it in the sack.

348
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,000
 Well, apparently he did do it at school, but not school as a student, as a professor.

349
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,600
 Students used to say it was pretty weird seeing the professor sitting there with his hand up

350
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,800
 like he had a question and it turns out that's what he was doing and he would ride into war

351
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
 with his hand in the air.

352
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,360
 In fact, he got shot through the hand when his hand was up in the air like a target and

353
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
 almost had his hand amputated, but it healed.

354
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,960
 That was the Battle of Bull Run, wasn't it?

355
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
 Yeah.

356
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
 Because he was in loads of battles during the Civil War.

357
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
 Yeah.

358
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
 But he then had a hand-related...

359
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,360
 I mean, his death was hand injury-related, but I can't find which hand it was.

360
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
 Exactly.

361
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
 I don't know.

362
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,640
 Or at least from a cursory reading of a lot of sources.

363
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,640
 They don't say if it was the big arm that got shot.

364
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,560
 Because he was friendly-fired.

365
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
 Yeah.

366
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,560
 This was in 1860, certainly 1860 something, wasn't it?

367
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
 '63.

368
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
 Yeah.

369
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
 Thank you.

370
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
 So this was 1863.

371
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,640
 He was shot because he was out doing a bit of reconnaissance and some of his own troops,

372
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,120
 some Confederate troops, saw an approaching party open fire.

373
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,160
 He then had to have his arm amputated, and that was given a full Christian burial, because

374
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:59,640
 it was about to be thrown on the pile of limbs outside the surgical tent.

375
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,440
 But the military chaplain thinks, "Look, this is a heroic arm, this is a general's arm.

376
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,240
 We should keep it and bury it."

377
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,680
 And he died several days later.

378
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,880
 We think he had pneumonia.

379
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
 You know, certainly...

380
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
 Well, he just had his arm cut.

381
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
 Yeah, certainly arm run.

382
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,880
 I think it was the sniffle that killed him.

383
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
 It was all...

384
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
 He had pneumonia.

385
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,960
 It was him being shot related, absolutely, absolutely.

386
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,320
 And they said to his wife, "Would you like us to get the arm back?"

387
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,520
 And she said, "No, it's had a Christian burial, so it should stay where it is."

388
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,880
 Because that was one of his other defining characteristics, was he was extremely religious.

389
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,600
 Apparently, he would pray before having a glass of water, or before opening an envelope,

390
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
 or before writing a...

391
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,840
 I mean, prayer was his constant.

392
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,920
 And anyway, so he's never been reunited with his arm.

393
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,280
 And it's there to this day with a tombstone above it.

394
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,040
 And he's got the writing on it that says...

395
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
 What does it say?

396
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,640
 It says he earned more than any other confederate general.

397
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,560
 It just says arm of Stonewall Jackson.

398
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,520
 And that's been moved around a couple of times, so it might be directly above his arm now.

399
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
 It might not.

400
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
 But the arm was moved a bit.

401
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
 Interesting.

402
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
 Yeah.

403
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,160
 Didn't he draw attention to himself, Rother?

404
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,480
 I mean, if you're kind of going into battle and you're the lead general, if you've got

405
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
 your hand up...

406
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
 Yeah, I mean, they literally shot through it.

407
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
 Yes.

408
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
 But isn't that a good thing?

409
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
 Because...

410
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
 Completely stupid.

411
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
 You don't want to be shot in your head.

412
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
 No, it's better.

413
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
 Okay.

414
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
 All right.

415
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,760
 In fact, what you would probably do is put a hat on it to see if you're really tall.

416
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
 And a little suit.

417
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
 It got around.

418
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
 Okay.

419
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
 You are.

420
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,040
 I think if you've got a reputation as an eccentric already...

421
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
 Just go for it.

422
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 Go for it.

423
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
 Yeah.

424
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,760
 Actually, speaking of clothing, he was well known amongst his other generals for not wearing

425
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
 flamboyant clothing.

426
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
 Okay.

427
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,960
 Right, because in the war, like, the officers had to pay for their own clothes.

428
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
 You didn't get a uniform.

429
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,120
 And you had to kind of wear things that are about similar to the other guys, like a similar

430
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
 colour and stuff.

431
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,280
 But the richer people in there, and often the officers were rich, they would just buy

432
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,880
 the most flamboyant thing they could get away with.

433
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
 But he didn't do that.

434
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,520
 And people thought it was a bit sus, really.

435
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
 Well, he was...

436
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
 I think it was very poor, wasn't he?

437
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
 As a young man.

438
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
 Yeah.

439
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,920
 He grew up extremely poor and scrabbled his way up through...

440
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,040
 So, how did he become a general?

441
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
 I think talent.

442
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
 I think he was very...

443
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
 A shio talent.

444
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
 Yeah.

445
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
 And a...

446
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
 And a Fonyon.

447
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
 He was a...

448
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
 Who wants to be a general?

449
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
 Yeah.

450
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
 I can see you over there.

451
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
 Yeah.

452
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
 He was...

453
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,600
 I mean, apparently, he was, you know, the politics of the Civil War aside.

454
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,360
 He was a brilliant tactician, you know.

455
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,880
 And I think after he died, not long after that came the Battle of Gettysburg, which obviously

456
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,160
 he missed, having just died.

457
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,000
 And that is one of the, certainly, the huge military turning points of the wars, the Battle

458
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 of Gettysburg.

459
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,560
 And his absence from it was cited by a couple of other generals at the time.

460
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
 Yeah.

461
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,640
 So, it could have changed.

462
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,680
 How did you become a general in, like, the Roman army or the Greek army?

463
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
 Very rich.

464
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
 Was it rich?

465
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
 Yes.

466
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,320
 I mean, there's kind of two strands.

467
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,240
 One is the career soldier.

468
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
 Right.

469
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,240
 And you can go up the ladder, a career soldier, you know, a squadron, and then you become

470
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,320
 a centurion, and you might kind of go up to the sort of what we'd call the commissioned

471
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
 ranks.

472
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
 Right.

473
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,440
 But the guys who were leading it, they'd bypassed all that.

474
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
 Right.

475
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,160
 And God knows if they're any good or not.

476
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
 Yeah.

477
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,960
 Or, you know, I kind of, you know, you guys have been talking about, you know, all this

478
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:22,520
 brilliant tactician stuff, you sort of wonder what it is to be a brilliantly tact, tactical

479
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
 general.

480
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,880
 I mean, I've spent a long time looking at Julius Caesar's campaigns.

481
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,920
 Because, you know, Caesar is always, you know, in America, you know, he's on the syllabus

482
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:39,160
 at military academies, you know, how you, you know, because of his brilliance as a general,

483
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,040
 you know, like Old Stonewall.

484
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,160
 But I started looking, he only had one tactic, which is he went round the back.

485
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
 Right.

486
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
 Right.

487
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,680
 You get face-to-face with the army, the opposing army, and what you do is you then pen him

488
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
 in from the back.

489
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,840
 That's what he does all the time.

490
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,480
 You must have felt like such an idiot when you're going, "He won't do it this time."

491
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
 He won't do it this time.

492
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,920
 He wants us to think he's going to do it, but he's not.

493
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,520
 And in fact, it seemed to me, and I've got terrible kind of attacks on social media for

494
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,240
 saying this, because there's an awful lot of people very, very invested in Roman military

495
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
 tactics.

496
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
 I think it's all like that.

497
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,960
 It's all kind of, pen them in from the back.

498
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
 And just-

499
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,480
 Was he also helped by being in charge of the Roman army as well, which was presumably the

500
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,840
 biggest and best at the time?

501
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,040
 In his rise to power, you sure?

502
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
 Yeah.

503
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,080
 I think they're only the biggest and the best because there's more of them.

504
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
 Yeah.

505
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,160
 I mean, you can't defeat the Romans in a war.

506
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,320
 You can defeat them in a battle.

507
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,840
 They lose battles all over the place, and hope is at some things.

508
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,400
 I mean, they're a laughing stock when it comes to navies, but they've always got more men.

509
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
 Yeah.

510
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
 So they can't lose a war.

511
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
 They can lose a battle.

512
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
 Interesting.

513
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,480
 So is there not kind of tactical brilliance?

514
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,640
 Well, you know, when this goes out, I shall no doubt get more of these, you know, offensive

515
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,720
 war, you fucking moron, you don't understand Marybier, doesn't it?

516
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,320
 It doesn't give any crudence to the brilliance.

517
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
 How many legions do you have Marybier?

518
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
 That's right.

519
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,400
 But if you ask me, it's the one-trick bonus, really.

520
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
 Wow.

521
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,200
 So Caesar, just to go back to chariots, he described, in his, not his diaries, his account-

522
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
 His commentaries.

523
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,160
 His commentaries on the British invasion.

524
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,520
 It's one of the only references we have contemporary to British tribes using military

525
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
 chariots.

526
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,360
 And they were a bit, they'd gone out of fashion in rhyme for centuries by then, but we were

527
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,840
 still using them.

528
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,720
 And they were like an uber across the battlefield.

529
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
 Yeah.

530
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,000
 And one really important myth to bust is they didn't have scythes coming out of the wheels.

531
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Oh, okay.

532
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 No, no, no.

533
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 If you go to look at Boudicca on Thames Embankment, her statue, she's got a great set of scythes

534
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,440
 about, but I am told by my archaeological friends that this is a myth.

535
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
 Okay.

536
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
 Absolutely gusset.

537
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
 Sorry.

538
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
 I'm a bit gusset about that.

539
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
 That's my, that's my chariot myth busted.

540
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
 There we go.

541
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,360
 And I've been sending that in to other podcasts for ages.

542
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,160
 Jumping back to the modern just very quickly, so he did, he was responsible for winning

543
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
 a lot of battles.

544
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
 Houston, well, Jackson.

545
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
 Civil Jackson.

546
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
 Modern day.

547
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,680
 Oh, well, more, certainly more modern than the Tiber Caesar.

548
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,720
 But he, one of the places that he won was Frederick's Burg in Virginia, and he beat

549
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,200
 the federal general who was Ambrose E. Burnside, friend of the podcast.

550
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
 We've spoken about him before.

551
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,700
 Inventor of sideburns.

552
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,640
 Inventor of sideburns.

553
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,040
 At some point Burnside, people went, it's, I love it, and I love the name, but not quite

554
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,360
 and they, they changed it round.

555
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
 But yeah.

556
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
 Two.

557
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
 Because he does, he had a real set, didn't he?

558
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
 Yeah.

559
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
 But I think I linked up to his moustache.

560
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
 They weren't really sideburns.

561
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
 It's interesting.

562
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,200
 He was an innovator of the four, but he hadn't perfected it.

563
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
 You know what?

564
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,400
 On this subject, I was reading about hypochondria, and modern day hypochondria was invented kind

565
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,160
 of or defined by an American neurologist called George Beard, who didn't have a beard.

566
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
 And no relation.

567
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
 No relation.

568
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
 No relation.

569
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,080
 Oh, what about Frank Beard, who's easy top?

570
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,480
 Sorry, you must get that all the time, but.

571
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,400
 I have no relations.

572
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,800
 On the tactical side of things, and sort of, like, does the skill exist or not, or did

573
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,120
 Jackson have a gift for it?

574
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,160
 Because he was a military instructor at Virginia Military Institute for a while.

575
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,480
 And his students did not like him at all.

576
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,200
 And the reason they didn't like him was that he was an unbelievably dull lecturer.

577
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,240
 So he would, he would compose a lecture, he would recite it from memory.

578
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,760
 He wouldn't deviate at all.

579
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,880
 And if anyone asked him a question, he would simply spool back in his head to the bit of

580
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,400
 his pre-remembered lecture that he thought answered the question and just recite that

581
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
 again verbatim.

582
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
 Yeah.

583
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,400
 While subtly just reaching out his massive long arms, slapping them across the bed.

584
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,940
 What did he do with the arm at this point?

585
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,060
 In 1856, a group of his own alumni tried to have him sacked for poor teaching.

586
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,060
 And they must have felt.

587
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,060
 In 1856.

588
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,440
 I know, they must have felt so stupid just five years later when he is the pride of the

589
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
 Confederate army.

590
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,640
 You know, one of the greatest blah, blah, blah.

591
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,040
 There were a lot of rumours that were about him.

592
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,000
 I think this is one of the things where people would say stuff about him, and then if they

593
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,800
 were, if other sources were asked, they would say, "No, he never did that.

594
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
 We never saw that."

595
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,080
 One of the things was that he was constantly chewing on lemons, eating lemons, just absolutely

596
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
 love lemons.

597
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,240
 And that was written in a biography.

598
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,560
 And then everyone who read that went, "I never saw him with a lemon.

599
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,800
 I have no idea where that comes from."

600
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
 I know where it comes from.

601
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
 Yeah.

602
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,040
 It's based on a single account of him eating a lemon on the 27th of June, 1862.

603
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
 That's bad.

604
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,280
 But three separate people saw him eat it, and they all wrote it up in their memoirs.

605
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,720
 And so you've now got three sources saying, "Oh, he loved a lemon.

606
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
 Did old Stonewall."

607
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,340
 That's like when I went to my ex's family for the first time, and they offered me dessert.

608
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,880
 And I didn't really want any.

609
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
 And they had some strawberries.

610
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,040
 And I'm like, "Oh, I love strawberries."

611
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,240
 So I had a couple of strawberries in every dessert I've ever got.

612
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,440
 Every present, like a T-shirt with strawberries on it, strips of strawberry fields.

613
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,440
 Is it true that he didn't eat pepper because he thought it weakened his legs?

614
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,360
 Well, that was another thing that was said about him.

615
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
 Yeah.

616
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
 And he passed.

617
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
 What do you think?

618
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
 Don't know.

619
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
 I mean...

620
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,040
 Is it true that he wouldn't let his back touch the back of a chair because it jumbled

621
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,280
 his organs up?

622
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,700
 This man is sounding more and more completely barking, the more you talk about him.

623
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:27,300
 I have not done my research like you clearly have on Stonewall Jackson, but frankly, I'm

624
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,300
 quite glad I haven't.

625
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,660
 But he believed a lot of stuff.

626
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,660
 And he has become...

627
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,140
 He was a definite hypochondriac.

628
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,140
 Definitely.

629
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:37,700
 And because he was tactically skilled, he's become an emblem of the kind of lost cause

630
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,700
 of the Civil War and people saying, "Oh, we could have won it, and we were in the right

631
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
 actually in all this."

632
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,740
 And I said he was a champion sleeper as well.

633
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,560
 He could sleep so brilliantly that he could even, as he was eating a meal, fall asleep

634
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,960
 with the food in his mouth just straight away because he could just get into it that easy.

635
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,800
 And that's tough with 11 because they're quite tart as well, aren't they?

636
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,600
 I read about an hypochondriac, I don't know if you know about this person, Mary, called

637
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
 Aristides.

638
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
 Oh, Elias Aristides.

639
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
 Aristides.

640
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
 Oh, yeah.

641
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
 Sorry, I'm not as learned as it is now.

642
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
 Can't all be.

643
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,080
 A great friend of mine.

644
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,080
 Oh, yeah.

645
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,380
 That's book after book after book on his hypochondriac symptoms.

646
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,060
 This is in the second century, at 80.

647
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,660
 This is an ancient hypochondriac.

648
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,660
 He's an old friend.

649
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660
 Yeah.

650
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,660
 An old friend.

651
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,660
 An old friend.

652
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,220
 He just goes on and on and on.

653
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,660
 But loads of posh Romans were terribly hypochondriac.

654
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,860
 Marcus Aurelius, famous Stoic emperor.

655
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:44,840
 When he is a kid, a teenager, he's always right into his cheetah about his symptoms.

656
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:51,200
 You'll see how I get letter after letter between these two guys saying, I do hope your tummy's

657
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,080
 feeling a bit better this morning because my neck, I thought it was getting better in

658
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
 the night.

659
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,600
 But now I wake up, I appear to have a jabbing pain going through the shoulder blade.

660
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:11,160
 Later, Marcus Aurelius, he employs a doctor who is very keen on getting the proper sort

661
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:17,740
 of, um, pesteries, anal pesteries, he particularly likes, I think he's put up your bum.

662
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,740
 Suppositories.

663
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,740
 Okay.

664
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,740
 Yeah.

665
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,740
 Suppositories.

666
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,740
 Pesteries is a different.

667
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,740
 Oh God, am I giving it?

668
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,740
 Different hot words.

669
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,940
 I uploaded in some ways, Marianne.

670
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
 Suppositories.

671
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
 Oh shit.

672
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,940
 I would see you in boots, Mary.

673
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,940
 Where are the anal pesteries?

674
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
 Oh shit.

675
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,060
 Where are the anal pesteries?

676
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,260
 I think they'd know what I meant.

677
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,840
 I don't think, I don't have any trouble getting, anyway, there's all Marcus Aurelius, you know.

678
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
 Marcus Aurelius is all about-

679
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
 I want just suppository.

680
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,680
 I thought he was all about disregarding the pain and discomfort of the world.

681
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,280
 I mean, I've read the, what is it, the meditations and then they're not.

682
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
 Meditation.

683
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
 Yeah.

684
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
 Well, don't believe all you read in them.

685
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
 Don't believe all you read in the meditation.

686
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,440
 It gives you only one side of how he might like to be seen.

687
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,060
 Cause I have quite a bad shoulder and I put it down to like looking at my phone on my

688
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,700
 screen all the time, but that can't be true for him.

689
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,900
 He'd have had a tablet.

690
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
 Very good.

691
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,900
 Thank you.

692
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,900
 Can I talk, just talk about Aristides.

693
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,900
 Aristides.

694
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
 Aristides again.

695
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,700
 So he was basically an orator and he got nasal congestion, a sore throat, and then couldn't

696
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,900
 really do his oratory anymore.

697
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:27,580
 And so he went to see the priests and they told him to lie down and allow asclepius, the

698
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,120
 god of medicine to appear in his dreams.

699
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,400
 And then whatever happened in his dreams, he had to do them to make him feel better.

700
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,800
 So one of them was like smear mud on his body and run around the temple three times.

701
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,160
 The suppository trick as well.

702
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,880
 The suppository trick, I'm sure, yeah, an enema of honey and to swallow a goose liver

703
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
 sausage.

704
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,040
 Oh, that's a bad dream, isn't it?

705
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,440
 And there are books and books and books of this rubbish.

706
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:04,700
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

707
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,940
 My fact is in 1845, there was an exhibition in London where for a shilling, you could

708
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,060
 pull a lever on a giant machine which would produce a brand new line of poetry for you

709
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,060
 in Latin.

710
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,060
 Wow.

711
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
 Yeah.

712
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,060
 Popular.

713
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
 So popular.

714
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,060
 I think it was popular actually.

715
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:25,360
 I think the inventor supposedly retired on the proceeds of this amazing machine.

716
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:33,080
 And it is, I have to add, making a line of Latin poetry is really complicated.

717
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
 Oh, right.

718
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,400
 Because it's not just like, you know, what you can get out of chat GBT if you say, write

719
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,000
 me a poem on the spring, you know, and it comes out.

720
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:52,340
 Because Latin poetry is done to a very, very fixed format of meter.

721
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:57,140
 So you have to have the right stress and rhythm through the line.

722
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,140
 So it's damn difficult.

723
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,580
 I mean, I can't write a word of Latin verse.

724
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:08,020
 So this machine did better than I can, I can sort of see how it's done, but I can't write

725
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
 a word.

726
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
 But that's stunning.

727
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,940
 That makes it all the more impressive because apparently there were 26 million permutations

728
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,760
 of line that you could get of this machine.

729
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,800
 So it's six, it's six feet Latin hexameter.

730
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,000
 So six different feet in the line.

731
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 What's a feet?

732
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,840
 A foot is like an individual unit.

733
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:31,040
 So pentameter is a, is Iambic pentameter is the sort of famous Shakespearean meter,

734
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,880
 which is da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

735
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
 So it's like a beat, is it?

736
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
 Yeah.

737
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,120
 But a foot will have different numbers of syllables, different numbers of syllables,

738
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,440
 and it's not actually by stress like others is.

739
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,580
 It's by the length of the syllable.

740
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,580
 So it's long, short, short, kind of, ah, ah, ah.

741
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,300
 So it's really difficult.

742
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:58,540
 I mean, it's what in the 19th century, they kind of crucify little boys on doing, you

743
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:05,700
 know, to write Latin hexameters with the absolute echelons of posh education, but also a complete

744
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,700
 nightmare.

745
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,700
 Interesting.

746
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,940
 So this machine, bloody amazing.

747
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
 Wow.

748
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
 It's stunning.

749
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,880
 It's a work called John Clark, and he was an inventor, obviously.

750
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,880
 And he's, I think it's took him about 13 years, sources vary, but it took a long, obviously,

751
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
 long time.

752
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
 And do you know how it worked?

753
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,440
 Um, it had six cylinders, and when you pull the lever, it was exactly like a fruit machine,

754
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,120
 except instead of some boring old cherries, you got a beautiful line of Latin verse,

755
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,440
 and he had arranged it so that it was adjective noun adverb.

756
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
 So it would make sense.

757
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
 It actually meant something.

758
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
 It actually meant something.

759
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,560
 It actually, each line is not, yeah, it's not word salad.

760
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
 It does.

761
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,660
 It might be an eccentric meaning.

762
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,220
 You might not be able to get a huge amount of sense, like, you know, it's not profound.

763
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,140
 Like a lot of Latin poetry.

764
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,140
 Right.

765
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,100
 Um, and he was just a really interesting guy.

766
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,020
 So he was born in 1785, died in 1853.

767
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,780
 The machine still exists today, which is very exciting.

768
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
 I thought you might have been to see it.

769
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,820
 I have never been to see it, but I've read about it even before I saw that you were going

770
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,820
 to talk about it.

771
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,820
 Oh, great.

772
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,220
 Um, it's down in Somerset now, and it's in a collection of items that used to be the

773
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:14,040
 Clark's shoe museum because John Clark, yeah, of Clark's, no, his relatives were the shoe

774
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
 empire people.

775
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,760
 While he was working in feet in poetry, they were working to put feet in shoes.

776
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
 Yeah.

777
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
 Amazing.

778
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,940
 And, um, yeah, they, they held it for a while and, and it's still, it still exists.

779
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,480
 I think it was going to be juiced up and renovated a bit recently, but it apparently played God

780
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,360
 Save the Queen while it was working.

781
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:37,100
 This collection, who own it, the Alfred Gillette Trust, they, they own in their collection

782
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:42,180
 this machine, 25,000 shoes and a significant collection of Somerset ichthyosaur fossils.

783
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,180
 Wow.

784
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,660
 I mean, what a collection.

785
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,660
 Whereabouts is it?

786
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,860
 And Somerset, you know, it's, I think it's literally there yesterday.

787
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,940
 It's a village called street.

788
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,940
 I think.

789
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,940
 Oh, I know that.

790
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,940
 Yeah.

791
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,940
 It's not far from Glastonbury.

792
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
 That's right.

793
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,940
 That's where it is.

794
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
 Yeah.

795
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,940
 Can I ask about the machine just jumping back to the Latin machine?

796
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:03,440
 So it would give you this line of poetry, but it wouldn't print it on, say, a little ticket,

797
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
 right?

798
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
 So you would just see it on the screen as it were.

799
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
 I don't know.

800
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
 You could take a photo of it with your phone.

801
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
 You could take a photo of it.

802
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,920
 So my question is, is how good was everyone's Latin back then and did someone permanently

803
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,140
 stand translating your line of poetry for you?

804
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:25,120
 I think we imagine that they were all terribly Latinate back then, but actually there'd be

805
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,700
 no period of British history after the Romans left when more than a, you know, relatively

806
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:37,100
 small section of the elite, unknown Latin, they've known a lot about classical culture,

807
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:43,220
 but a Latin, more particularly Greek, but even Latin education was still largely for

808
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,660
 boys and largely for the rich ones.

809
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:53,380
 So I mean, there were some, you know, clever auto-died acts who taught themselves Latin,

810
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:59,160
 but who this machine was for, why would anybody who didn't know how difficult it was to compose

811
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,480
 Latin poetry be remotely impressed?

812
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
 Yeah.

813
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:10,600
 And some people have thought that it was actually a kind of pistachio, rather expensive, very

814
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,080
 long-term pistachio.

815
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
 13 years of my life.

816
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,360
 13 years of my life on a joke, right?

817
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,880
 This is going to be great.

818
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,780
 I mean, I don't think this is correct, but some people have argued that the 1840s, this

819
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,020
 is when these, you know, these little boys, private schools were spending hour after hour

820
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,540
 after hour learning how to compose this Latin poetry.

821
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:37,500
 And what this bloke is saying, what Mr. Clark is saying, he's like, "I can get a machine

822
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
 to do it."

823
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,500
 Yeah, I see.

824
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,700
 It's actually undercutting some of that.

825
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,620
 But then that's still true, like now, like my school, we had one Latin teacher for the

826
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,500
 entire school of a thousand kids, right?

827
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,360
 Well, that's a lot more than many have.

828
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
 Yeah, exactly.

829
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,800
 And it's like, there was a report in 2021 that said that staff in the British Civil

830
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,040
 Service are routinely telling jokes in Latin to exclude lower-class colleagues.

831
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,600
 So, okay, it is quite an elitist thing still, isn't it, learning Latin or Greek?

832
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,000
 And is that a problem?

833
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,360
 And should we be teaching everyone it, or shouldn't we be teaching anyone it?

834
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,520
 I think that you should be giving everyone the opportunity to learn it.

835
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,220
 And Latin's always in crisis.

836
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,260
 I mean, in the early 20th century, they were saying Latin was about to die, right?

837
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,780
 Well, you know, it's taken a very long time to do so, if that was the case.

838
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:32,700
 But I was talking quite recently to a teacher at an ordinary state comprehensive school where

839
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,300
 she had reintroduced some Latin for the kids.

840
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,760
 And she said, "Well, it was great about it.

841
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
 It was two things.

842
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,260
 First of all, you didn't have to speak it."

843
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,260
 Right?

844
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:47,200
 And it wasn't that it helped you necessarily with other languages or whatever though it

845
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
 might.

846
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,760
 It was that you didn't have to spend all your time learning how to ask for a pizza in it

847
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
 or whatever.

848
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,080
 So, you were just looking at the language.

849
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,760
 She also said, "It's not like when you start introducing French or German, whatever you

850
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:07,880
 suddenly discover, that misprivileged here is going on for a week, weekend at half-term,

851
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,580
 to get her French better at mum and dad's French chateau."

852
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,820
 No one's going off to the Vatican for the week.

853
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,540
 No one is going off to the Vatican for the week.

854
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,260
 And she said it was really levelling, actually.

855
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,260
 That's a really good point.

856
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,900
 Because anybody could be good at it and nobody had that kind of built-in advantage.

857
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,900
 You know what?

858
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,060
 Everyone in my school was equally good at it because there would be like a quiz at the

859
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:33,980
 end of each lesson and there'd be ten questions and then you'd have to shout out your score

860
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:39,180
 and everyone got six out of ten because the Latin word for six is sex.

861
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,440
 And so, literally, we all deliberately got six out of ten so we just went round the class

862
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,040
 and never went, "Sex, sex, sex."

863
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,440
 You know, what's great about Latin, though, is that everybody remembers their Latin lessons

864
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,520
 and their Latin teacher and people tend not to remember their geography teacher, you know?

865
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:05,540
 But Latin, it has, you know, it really, really kind of gets to you.

866
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,260
 And you remember how you took the piss out of the teacher or whatever, but you'd never

867
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,260
 forget it.

868
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,300
 I don't know until I was 18.

869
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,300
 Did you?

870
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,300
 Yeah.

871
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,300
 And so, how is it?

872
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,300
 My Latin.

873
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,300
 You're still doing it onto your lingo, aren't you?

874
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,300
 That's right.

875
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,300
 Yeah.

876
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,480
 That's only so I can tease my civil service colleagues, though, you know?

877
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
 It was great.

878
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,160
 We had to do it at lunchtimes, like instead of playing football, you can either play football

879
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
 or do Latin.

880
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,400
 And you chose, did you choose Latin?

881
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
 It was chosen for me.

882
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
 I see.

883
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
 I see.

884
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
 And do you regret it?

885
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
 No, I loved it.

886
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
 I really loved it.

887
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
 Yeah, it was mega fun.

888
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,000
 We never did it, but I was in Hong Kong, so I don't think it was an option.

889
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 It's useful in weird ways.

890
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,960
 I do think it's useful for other languages, as in it's genuinely you sort of see how things

891
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
 fit together.

892
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,720
 But the thing I can't get is this time where it was so common, like law was all in Latin,

893
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,040
 so people in ordinary people in courtrooms couldn't really understand what was going

894
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,480
 on because courtroom business was all conducted in Latin until 1362.

895
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
 Lots of church services.

896
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
 Lots of church.

897
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,160
 Look at the whole Catholic church, it existed on Latin until relatively recently.

898
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,240
 Grammar schools were founded to teach Latin to members of the clergy because it was important

899
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
 to have good Latin.

900
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,800
 In primary school, we would have to sing Latin hymns.

901
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
 Would you?

902
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
 Yeah, yeah.

903
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
 Wow.

904
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,760
 I think it was one of the journalists who got the scoop that the Pope was stepping down

905
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,720
 because he delivered it in Latin and she was the only one there who could understand it.

906
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,720
 Yes.

907
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
 Yes.

908
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,120
 There's also such good stuff written in it.

909
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:38,160
 You're actually there with what someone wrote 2000 years ago, and it's still bloody amazing.

910
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,680
 It transports you, I guess, right?

911
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
 It is.

912
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
 It's about time travel.

913
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,680
 Yeah.

914
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:49,160
 Virgil's Aeneid, right? His first century BC poem on the foundation of Rome.

915
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,400
 What I'm going to say is it's a bit of an exaggeration, or at least I couldn't prove

916
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,640
 it, but I'm pretty certain it's true, that there hasn't been a day since 19 BC when Virgil

917
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,080
 popped his clogs, when someone in the world hasn't been reading the Aeneid.

918
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:09,320
 It's been read and recited and studied without a gap for 2000 years.

919
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,880
 I think it's just great.

920
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,880
 Okay.

921
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
 Sold.

922
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,240
 As long as you don't make it, just posh boys only.

923
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,240
 Yeah.

924
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,400
 You never did Latin.

925
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,960
 One person who didn't agree with you was a guy called William Barnes, who was a linguist

926
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,960
 who taught himself Greek and Latin because he didn't want any Greek or Latin words in

927
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,760
 the English language.

928
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,400
 And so he started coining new words to do away with the Latin.

929
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,320
 So like for instance, instead of the word grammar, he called it speechcraft.

930
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,840
 Instead of ornithology, he called it bird law.

931
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,120
 I quite like bird law.

932
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
 Bird law is quite good.

933
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,120
 Yeah.

934
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,120
 These are all quite good.

935
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,440
 Instead of flexible, he wanted people to say Benson.

936
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,400
 And he was like basically saying that people should speak English as in that Anglo-Saxon

937
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,920
 language, not as a Greek slash, which I think even he thought it was just a bit of fun,

938
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,920
 to be honest.

939
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
 When was he around?

940
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,920
 He was around the 19th century.

941
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,280
 About the same time as your Latin machine.

942
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,280
 Yeah.

943
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
 Oh yeah.

944
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
 Yeah.

945
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,400
 But there's only one thing that's still in the OED, which the definition says W Barnes

946
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,920
 term for.

947
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,680
 And that word is push whaling.

948
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,200
 So W-A-I-L-I-N-G push whaling.

949
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
 Push whaling.

950
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
 You know what that is?

951
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
 Push whaling.

952
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
 Force crying.

953
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
 So faking emotion.

954
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,200
 Faking emotion now.

955
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,200
 That sounds like labour.

956
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,200
 Giving birth.

957
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,200
 Good guess.

958
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,200
 You're pushing and you're whaling?

959
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,200
 No.

960
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
 I'm pretty much close.

961
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:45,520
 But it was, the definition in the OED is W Barnes term for a pram, pram plate.

962
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,320
 And that's still in the OED today?

963
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
 That's amazing.

964
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,320
 Push whaling.

965
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,760
 As preparation for today, I'd listen to a bit of Cuomodo Diccita, which is the Latin

966
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,760
 podcast.

967
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,520
 And it's a few, it's really fun, like it's a few very nerdy people who've well versed

968
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,760
 in it and made a study of it.

969
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,280
 And they do it at a kind of slow, slow enough speed that you can just about sort of cling

970
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,280
 on to it.

971
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,280
 And it's, it's fun.

972
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,280
 It's really interesting because you never hear it spoken normally.

973
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,280
 Well, thank God.

974
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,800
 I mean, I think there used to be a set of, you know, slightly eccentric people in Finland

975
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,440
 who did the news in Latin, you know, each week, I think it was, and you think, what's

976
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,440
 the point?

977
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,880
 You know, what is the point?

978
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,880
 Oh, it was fun.

979
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,880
 Cuomodo Diccita is fun.

980
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,880
 It's fun.

981
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
 It's good.

982
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,880
 But I want to read things like the Romans wrote.

983
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,600
 I don't want to sit listening to the news, read by some bloody fins in Latin.

984
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,000
 Is your podcast about the modern day button Latin, Andy, the one you're talking about?

985
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,560
 Yeah, they start with how, what have you been up to?

986
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,120
 This is not difficult, like, because there isn't a Latin word for, you know, telephone,

987
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,120
 for instance.

988
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,120
 Yes, I think they do.

989
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,120
 They haven't defined a lot of work around here.

990
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,120
 Yeah.

991
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
 They haven't started living like Romans to make it more effective.

992
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,120
 Yeah, yeah.

993
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,520
 The effort reward ratio does not seem to make too much sense.

994
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,160
 Is your Latin good enough that if you went to Vatican City, you could use their ATM

995
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,160
 machines?

996
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,160
 Oh.

997
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,160
 They give you a Latin option?

998
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,800
 I think you can use ATM machines in most language.

999
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,320
 You don't need to be able to speak a language.

1000
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,160
 Yeah, I'll jab until numbers come up, and then I'll select immediate.

1001
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,160
 And then what you do is you look at all the numbers and you don't understand the current

1002
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,160
 scene.

1003
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,040
 You choose the second smallest number, and you go for that, because that's probably about

1004
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,040
 10 quid.

1005
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,040
 Because that's probably doable.

1006
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1007
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,040
 And you pull the big handle.

1008
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,040
 Yeah.

1009
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,040
 And then a line of poetry comes up.

1010
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:35,440
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

1011
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,680
 OK, my fact this week is that the biographer of 7th century French king, Dagoburt I, didn't

1012
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:48,680
 include a list of his lovers because they said it would make the book too long to read.

1013
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,680
 Same.

1014
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,680
 Same.

1015
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,680
 I'm waiting.

1016
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,680
 I'm waiting.

1017
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,680
 I'm staring at Andy.

1018
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,680
 Waiting.

1019
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,680
 There's not a gravestone big enough.

1020
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,680
 Oh, dear.

1021
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:04,680
 Just a bed post, your tombstone, full of notches.

1022
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,680
 Oh, my God.

1023
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,680
 Sorry.

1024
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,680
 No.

1025
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,680
 That is very funny.

1026
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,120
 Is that the biographer trying to praise Dagoburt by saying how marvellous he was about it?

1027
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,120
 No, not really.

1028
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,120
 I don't think so.

1029
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,240
 I don't think it was very positive thing.

1030
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,320
 So I read this in BBC History Magazine.

1031
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,320
 It was part...

1032
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,320
 Well, it must be true.

1033
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,320
 And I have subsequently checked it.

1034
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,560
 God, I love you, Mary.

1035
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,360
 We're going to get letters from geography teachers.

1036
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,520
 We're going to get letters from BBC History.

1037
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,880
 If you are going to send a letter in about this episode, if it's not in Latin, we're

1038
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,000
 not going to read it.

1039
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,880
 So it's part of the Q&A section where they answer questions that someone might ask about

1040
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,880
 history.

1041
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,920
 And the question was, how responsible was King Dagoburt I for the decline of the Merovingians?

1042
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,040
 Which I think is a question we're always asking ourselves, aren't we?

1043
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,040
 Absolutely.

1044
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,280
 And it turns out these Merovingians, they were a group that came up with this.

1045
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,400
 They came after the Romans, right, Mary?

1046
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,160
 So maybe you don't like them so much, because...

1047
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,920
 I know nothing about them.

1048
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,160
 I was delighted that you were going to take us into the Merovingians.

1049
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,000
 Because, you know, I've always been busting to know a bit more about them.

1050
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,240
 Well, they were very big around the 5th century AD.

1051
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,920
 They ruled in what's now France, Germany, Belgium.

1052
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,880
 And Dagoburt came along.

1053
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,800
 And he was a bit of a black sheep.

1054
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,440
 And he was dog by scandal.

1055
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,520
 He moved the court to Paris because he was a bit of a playboy.

1056
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,880
 And there was lots of fun happening in Paris.

1057
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,760
 He lived in loads of luxury, tried to get as much gold as possible.

1058
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,120
 And he'd previously married his stepsister to cement the monarchy, as was quite common

1059
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,120
 in those days.

1060
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,120
 Dagoburt.

1061
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,120
 But he divorced her as soon as his father died.

1062
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,080
 Because his father was the one who was kind of organising it all.

1063
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:45,520
 He got in charge, divorced his wife, and then just went through loads and loads of affairs.

1064
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,280
 And basically all this debauchery was the beginning of the end for the Merovingians.

1065
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,040
 So it's a moral tale, really.

1066
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,040
 It really is.

1067
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,040
 Yeah.

1068
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,040
 It seems like that, doesn't it?

1069
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:03,520
 And the biographer links his sort of personal lust with his lust for ecclesiastical lands.

1070
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,200
 You know, it always starts with first, and eventually you're on the ecclesiastical lands.

1071
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,920
 That's what you lust after eventually.

1072
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,360
 This all comes, I should say, from the Chronicle of Fredegar, which was the 7th century Frankish

1073
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,920
 Chronicle written about the Merovingian kings.

1074
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,920
 Because we all know that anyway.

1075
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,920
 Yeah.

1076
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,680
 I have never come across the Merovingians before.

1077
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,120
 It's kind of a word you hear, like the guy in the Matrix?

1078
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,120
 Yeah.

1079
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,120
 The guy in the Matrix.

1080
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:33,120
 But they were the ruling family, weren't they, of the Frankish kingdom.

1081
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,640
 And they were the ones who came before like Charlemagne and...

1082
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,640
 Yeah.

1083
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,640
 We've heard of them.

1084
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:42,480
 The Romans are fine, the Carolingians are fine, but it's the Merovingians which...

1085
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,600
 The Merovingians, when you look them up, there's one thing that comes up on a lot of pages

1086
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:51,480
 and it separates them from the Romans and the Carolingians, which is long hair was seen

1087
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,300
 as power in their society.

1088
00:49:53,300 --> 00:50:02,600
 Roulous had long hair and there's a professor called James Palmer who said that basically

1089
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,000
 if there was someone who was an heir to the throne that they thought it's not going to

1090
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,080
 be quite good enough, they would shave their head, pop them into a monastery like a monk.

1091
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,200
 But have them on standby because they haven't gone bold, they can grow back right.

1092
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,920
 And if the person then, who's been put in power, was seen as bad, they can knock that

1093
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,200
 person out and bring back the monk.

1094
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,640
 Can I say, if you're like the next in line for the Merovingians and you start going bold,

1095
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,640
 is that you done?

1096
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,640
 Well, yeah.

1097
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,520
 There's no hair transplants in those days.

1098
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,520
 No, exactly.

1099
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,520
 It's...

1100
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,520
 There's wigs though.

1101
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,520
 Ah.

1102
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,520
 Okay.

1103
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,520
 There we go.

1104
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,040
 But it was a tool of state power that one of the queens was called Clotild and she was

1105
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:42,640
 6th century queen, widow of King Clovis and Clovis, by the way, is where we get Louis

1106
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,640
 from.

1107
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,840
 Clovis, knock off the sea, you got Lovis, that's why so many French kings are called

1108
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,840
 Louis.

1109
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,840
 Is it?

1110
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,840
 It was all from Clovis, yeah.

1111
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:56,160
 Anyway, her grandsons were meant to be crowned, they were slated next up, all of this.

1112
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,080
 And then some plotters in the family abducted them and dispatched a henchman to Queen Clotild

1113
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,320
 saying, "We've got a pair of scissors here and a sword here.

1114
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,280
 Which do you want for your grandsons?"

1115
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:11,760
 And the idea was either we can execute them as royals or we can cut their hair, which

1116
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,520
 means their life won't be worth living, they'll be living as non-royals.

1117
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,280
 And she said, "Sword please, sword please for my grandsons."

1118
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,280
 Wow.

1119
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,800
 I'd rather that than a haircut, which means a non-royal life.

1120
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,800
 Big decision.

1121
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,800
 Yeah, that's hard.

1122
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,760
 And the Carolingians, when they came in, had to separate themselves from the whole long

1123
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,240
 hair thing, so they went for the mustache.

1124
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,240
 Yeah.

1125
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,240
 That was their big thing.

1126
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,240
 Yeah.

1127
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,240
 Charlemagne, picture his long mustache.

1128
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,240
 Lovely.

1129
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,240
 Yeah.

1130
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,400
 I couldn't tell you what Charlemagne looked like, I must say.

1131
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,840
 What's weird is, I'm not actually sure I've seen a picture of him, I just have conjured

1132
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,840
 that in my head.

1133
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,320
 Here's one thing I found about Dagoburt, which I'd never heard before.

1134
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:50,840
 He was the first French king to be crowned on a folding chair, like a fishing chair.

1135
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:56,040
 And I was reading about these folding chairs, and apparently it was one of the best things

1136
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,280
 you could have for quite a lot, like in ancient Rome.

1137
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,280
 Interesting.

1138
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,160
 What I mean, it's like an X-shape legs and then almost like a cloth belt, but it was

1139
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,520
 actually made of sort of like a director's chair.

1140
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1141
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
 But without a back.

1142
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,520
 But without a back.

1143
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,520
 Yeah.

1144
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,200
 And they were made of wood, and they were huge in ancient Egypt.

1145
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,080
 There's one in the British Museum, Tutankhamun was buried with two of them, and now it's

1146
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,960
 mostly people watching golf.

1147
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,120
 The kings of our age.

1148
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:27,480
 The Emperor Augustus took one to the opening of a rather posh theatre, and he fell off

1149
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,720
 his very bad, bad size, he fell off his folding chair.

1150
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,160
 I bet no one laughed at that.

1151
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,000
 Well only, it was a bit of a risk to tell off it.

1152
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 Wow.

1153
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,840
 That's a quite famous ruler of this period, Dagobot the Second.

1154
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,840
 Oh yeah.

1155
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,840
 Don't get me started on that.

1156
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,840
 Oh boy.

1157
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,840
 Here we go again.

1158
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,400
 Down's on his hobby horse.

1159
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,880
 Well, you never know how history is going to replace you and your story into new light,

1160
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,200
 and that's what happened with Dagobot the Second, because he disappeared and no one quite

1161
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,600
 knows was he murdered, what was the end of his story.

1162
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:06,640
 Cut to many, many years later, this hoax is set up, this thing called the Priory of Scion,

1163
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:12,200
 where the idea is that they are looking after the bloodline of the Merovingians, and then

1164
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:17,160
 that gets picked up by the writers of a book, which is all about the bloodline of Christ,

1165
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,840
 and brought into that.

1166
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,080
 So the Merovingians are the descendants of Christ, is the slave.

1167
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,400
 Exactly, the Da Vinci code is largely…

1168
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,760
 Do you want to retract your very learned comment from earlier, Mary?

1169
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,440
 No, it's not my theory, and I made sure this fact was last at the show, so if Mary walked

1170
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,480
 out we'd have enough in the tank.

1171
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,240
 Do you want to know the truth about the Merovingians, Dan?

1172
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,120
 This is the truth.

1173
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:42,480
 This was a claim made at the time, not by the kings themselves, but I think by people around

1174
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,720
 them, that they were descended from a sea monster, not from a god, but a specific…

1175
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,720
 Have you heard of a…

1176
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,720
 I think your cab's here, Mary.

1177
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,720
 Have you heard of a quina tour?

1178
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,880
 Like a quina tour, but not.

1179
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,880
 Exactly.

1180
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,080
 But with quins, so with five horns.

1181
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,240
 The quina tour is the most ridiculous looking animal you'll ever see.

1182
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,080
 It's a half-bull, half-fish, but it's got five horns up front.

1183
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,080
 It's because the word Merovech, where we get Merovingian, it means sea-bull, so…

1184
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,080
 Oh, of course.

1185
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,080
 I've forgotten.

1186
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,080
 I've forgotten.

1187
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,600
 So the quina tour, supposedly, is the answer.

1188
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,040
 Is his head like one of those, you know those ring-toss things that kids have?

1189
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,040
 Exactly like that.

1190
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,040
 Does it look like that?

1191
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,040
 Exactly like that.

1192
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,040
 Yeah, and they're different colours for different prizes.

1193
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,040
 Oh, yeah.

1194
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,800
 This was so embarrassing when he was trying to give a good talk and just a hoop would

1195
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,800
 land on his…

1196
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,480
 Guys, come on, five minutes, put a big speech there.

1197
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,280
 So this fact was about biographers and stuff.

1198
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,880
 And I want to know, what I read is that it was quite dangerous to be a biographer in

1199
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,200
 ancient times, because you basically had to… you had to say really nice things about the

1200
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:49,480
 person you're biographising, but you couldn't go over the top because it would seem like

1201
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,680
 you were being too obsequious.

1202
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,960
 But then on the other hand, if you said anything bad, you could basically be put to death.

1203
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,960
 Right.

1204
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,360
 So there was an obvious answer to this.

1205
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,560
 You wait till they're dead before you write the biography.

1206
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,560
 Okay.

1207
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:05,080
 So your publishers are going to be on your mirrors, mirrors really looking forward to

1208
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,080
 seeing a proof.

1209
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,080
 Exactly.

1210
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,160
 And you're half the advance, yeah, it's not.

1211
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,760
 I'm sorry, the last chapter's taken me a bit longer than I thought it was going to

1212
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,280
 run working on it.

1213
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,280
 Interesting.

1214
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:23,680
 You just, you know, one thing you never want to do is to talk about the emperor while he's

1215
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,680
 alive.

1216
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,680
 Yeah.

1217
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,560
 The other thing about the biographers is how much of it was true, right?

1218
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:34,720
 See, probably very little, particularly if you're dealing with the concupines of Dacabere,

1219
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,720
 I suspect.

1220
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:41,760
 But when I was a student, a long time ago, we were always taught now you've got to go

1221
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,280
 through all these biographies and you've got to get your blue pencil out and you've

1222
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,440
 got to, you've got to put a line through all the bits that can't possibly be true.

1223
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,880
 So you do that and then you come to some bits and think, could it be true?

1224
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,800
 Well, maybe it could be put a question mark and I spent years of my life doing that really.

1225
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,820
 Because I, in the last few years, I've realised it's not the point.

1226
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:07,200
 The point is that people believe this stuff, you know.

1227
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,700
 It's taking you a bit into the kind of way we think about monarchs and celebs, et cetera.

1228
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:18,840
 We tell these stories about their excesses, which are not true, but they certainly tell

1229
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:24,720
 us about how we envisage, you know, it goes right down to the kind of innocent King Charles,

1230
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,720
 doesn't it?

1231
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:30,120
 You know, he has someone who puts toothpaste on his toothbrush for him.

1232
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:35,080
 The story about King Charles is that he had like 12 different eggs made every morning

1233
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,840
 of different hardness and he would choose which one to eat and stuff.

1234
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:45,640
 And you know, that goes right back to the ancient world because there's a story about

1235
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:52,440
 the kitchens of Antony and Cleopatra and kind of next to Eyewitness visits the kitchens

1236
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,200
 and there's eight boars roasting, right?

1237
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:03,600
 And the guy says to the cook, "God, you must be expecting a large party to dinner tonight."

1238
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,000
 And the cook says, "No, it's just we don't quite know when they're going to sit down

1239
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,080
 to eat, so we put them all on at different times so that one will be ready when they

1240
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,080
 want it."

1241
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,080
 And that's just like the boar's example.

1242
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,080
 It's so funny.

1243
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,080
 Cool?

1244
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:22,320
 I have 12 microwaves in my house and I put one frozen lasagna in each.

1245
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:29,800
 But I was brought up with the idea that the Queen's corgis, the late Queen's corgis,

1246
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,120
 ate out of silver dishes.

1247
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:37,800
 And I once went to do some filming in Windsor Castle with a film crew and we had to go quite

1248
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,440
 near the sort of more domestic apartments.

1249
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:49,000
 And as we passed the door to the pets area, we all looked at each other because lined

1250
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,320
 up by the door were a load of very nasty plastic bowls.

1251
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,320
 Wow.

1252
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:59,320
 They were for the staff, they were for the staff.

1253
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,280
 Everybody said, "So it's not true, then."

1254
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,280
 But the point where you're saying is the fact that we think that about the royal family

1255
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,320
 tells us a lot more about life today than whether it's true or not.

1256
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,320
 And that's what we want to believe as well.

1257
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:18,320
 About how we imagine power, how we imagine wealth, what would we do if we had unlimited

1258
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,320
 wealth?

1259
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,560
 Well, my dog would eat out of silver bowls.

1260
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:28,080
 I feel a bit sorry for Dagoburt the first though, you know, because if you're a monarch,

1261
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:33,280
 one thing they always get you for is too much sex, isn't it?

1262
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,200
 It's always, we couldn't possibly fit the names of all the concubines in.

1263
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,960
 One of the definitions of a monarch is that they have more sex than everybody else.

1264
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,960
 And that's partly about power, but then it gets used against them as they're absolutely

1265
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,160
 lurid bastards who you can't trust.

1266
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:57,360
 And in Rome, of course, the wives are having too much sex as well.

1267
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,520
 Is that the slander or the reputation?

1268
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,560
 That's what's always been, that is always a reputation that, you know, the emperor

1269
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:09,440
 Claudius' wife, Messalina, one story about her cannot possibly be true, but it's a real

1270
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,160
 revelation is that she's supposed to have challenged the prostitutes of Rome to a competition

1271
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,520
 of who could sleep with most men in one night.

1272
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,600
 And she won, of course.

1273
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:26,160
 She fell off halfway through, but the judges decided that she had won.

1274
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,720
 And you think you can't win with your sex life if you're a ruler.

1275
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,040
 When the truth is, they were all happy that once a year like the rest of us.

1276
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,640
 In a very boring way.

1277
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:46,520
 Dagobah's reputation has recovered because now in France, there's a phrase, Le bon roi

1278
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,480
 dagobah, the good King Dagobah.

1279
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,680
 And it's basically the ultra basic nursery rhyme that French children learn and are sung

1280
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,680
 by their parents.

1281
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,920
 Like Old King Cole is a merry old song.

1282
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,920
 It's exactly like that.

1283
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,760
 And it's all, there's a French revolutionary song, Le bon roi dagobah, because that was

1284
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,000
 a way of making fun of kings and monarchy without actually making fun of King Louis

1285
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
 XVI.

1286
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,240
 It was two years before the revolution, this song was written as a way of satirising the

1287
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,480
 monarchy.

1288
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,480
 But now that's survived.

1289
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,480
 And it's one of the absolute root one lullabies in France.

1290
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,640
 But they don't tell them about his sex life, though.

1291
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,640
 That's a later verse.

1292
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,640
 It's normally skipped.

1293
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:32,720
 That's when he calls for his fiddle as three, that's what that's all about.

1294
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,720
 OK, that's it.
