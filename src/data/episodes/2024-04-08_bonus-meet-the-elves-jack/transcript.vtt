 [Music]

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.640
 Hi everyone, welcome to another bonus feature

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.360
 of "Nose to Sing as a Fish" which is... what is it this week? It's me?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.880
 Oh, damn. Oh, sorry. I thought you were... That was my big moment. I thought you were actually

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.400
 grasping. Do I do this to you every week when you sit up doing the intro?

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.280
 No, you usually eat a biscuit or you usually open a fucking noisy soft drink.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.520
 You know what I noticed recently is... sorry, Jack, we'll introduce you in a second.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.000
 Yeah, no worries. But like we used to whenever you did the intro,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.400
 me and Andy would try to put you off every week. Every time.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.520
 But when we had guests over the last year, because Anna wasn't here,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.440
 we kind of... we thought it was rude, so we stopped doing it, but we're definitely going to do it again.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.360
 Anyway, what am I talking about? This is Meet the Elves. It's where we meet one of our lovely friends

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.000
 and colleagues who work for QI, and they ask us a fiendish question, and we spend 50 minutes or so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.200
 fumbling in the dark around the answer, and then they eventually have to tell us the answer,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.720
 and then we all go home. But if one of us guesses the answer straight off the bat,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.520
 it'll be a 30-second show. So fingers crossed. Pressure's on, Jack. And I feel like I've kind of

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.560
 spoiled who the elf is this week. But it is Jack Chambers, who, those of you who are on our Discord,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.480
 will know as the person who edited last week's compilation, and actually quite a lot of our

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.760
 compilations. You caused quite a stir, Jack, because you included Anna screwing up the ending of a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.200
 show, and they all thought it was extremely funny. Oh, no, the veil was lifted, wasn't it?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.160
 Which one was the show? It was the one where you did the final bit of the show, and you said,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.920
 "Hello!" I always confuse hello and goodbye. It's one of my big blinds. But anyway, everyone loved it,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.080
 and I might have let slip that, Jack, you edited that. And in fact, you edit all our compilations,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.400
 don't you? Yeah, I mean, I left that one in, because it was so funny, and I forget that the,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.120
 to preserve the sort of the edifice that is the podcast, and the idea that it's all slick and

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.160
 unedited. That's what you get as the Discordians. You get the... The mess. The bloopers. That's what

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.560
 they're after. The bloopers, yeah, exactly. So, Jack, you have been at QI for a number of years now.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.040
 You are a senior researcher in the QI team, and you have brought for us a question. Absolutely,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.920
 I've been here six years. I feel like this is the pinnacle of my six years of research. Have you

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.120
 been doing this? Oh, yeah. I've been wondering what you've been doing for the last six years.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.480
 How long have you been sitting on this question? Honestly, only when I found out I was doing this

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.440
 last week, but it's a long time in the making, which is your first clue. So, my question to you is,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.840
 what is the worst year ever? It's often considered the worst year... Is that a question?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.320
 Are you ripping the piss out of my accent there? No, no, no, no, no. The worst year ever? Okay.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.800
 Well, 2020. Hang on, it's not the end of your question. It's not like you're going to have a

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.800
 follow-up. That's it. Well, no, just like, what's the worst year to be a human alive around, possibly

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.280
 even because the subsequent years were even worse. It's the start of some... Something which was bad

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.720
 to start off with and then got... How long have you been at QI? Six years, did you say? Six years.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:29.600
 I started in, yeah, 2018. So, 2016 is acknowledged as the... Off-cited. The death of Bowie, the death of

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.520
 quite a few... That's all I remember now. So many great people died. Prince Muhammad Ali, Fidel Castro,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.520
 who I always include in this list. So many great people died. And then there was Trump and then

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.880
 Brexit, who, depending on your political standpoint, were either bad or good things. But obviously,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.560
 that was much better than it was being alive 100 years ago and then 100 years before that was worse

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.520
 and 100 years before that was worse. Obviously, it's got to be pre-2014 because no year could be

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.080
 the worst with fish around, you know. Okay. Well done. All right, you can get a piece.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.720
 So, yeah, like for me, 2020, a lot of people would say that because of COVID and stuff.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.480
 But yeah, 2016 was supposed to be a time when something changed. We went on to a different

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.560
 timeline and everything got terrible, wasn't it? It's like David Bowie died and it's like,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.360
 okay, now we're in the worst timeline ever. About 15 years ago, we thought it would happen in 2012

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.680
 because of the Mayans. Oh, yeah. So some people think maybe it was just four years delayed.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.480
 And then 2000 because of the Y2K scare. Yeah, which we'll say wasn't really a big deal.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.400
 No, but the anxiety leading up to it gave a lot of people a bad year that year.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.880
 Did it? Yeah. 1987, Coventry City winning the FA Cup.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.440
 That was the worst time. I remember that. Well, that's the first one you've mentioned

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.960
 that is an a leap year. And that might be, I mean, that is not clean.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:52.560
 What? 2012, 2016, 2020, obviously the pandemic. They're often cited as the worst years.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.320
 Although obviously in human history, we've just been getting happier and happier and better off

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.760
 and better off, blah, blah, blah. Obviously, we're getting much wealthier. Everyone's happier.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.920
 So I think that's been happening since the dawn of agriculture.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.840
 So I think that was the pits just round about 8,000 years ago when agriculture was bedding in.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.240
 So everyone was getting really sick, living close quarters, but they had no medicine.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.400
 Their diets were getting much worse. And they'd lost all that freedom of being hunter-gatherers.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.520
 I was here earlier, like the Tripelian culture that we mentioned in Ukraine.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.000
 You remember? No, I've got a very bad memory of it. Was it more than a day ago?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.360
 It's the one where they burned the houses down. Oh, yeah, yeah, right.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.840
 They burned the houses down, yeah. Well, that's not pretty fun.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.280
 I'm going to go the opposite angle. Is it 2025?

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.080
 And it's the idea that every subsequent year is the worst year. So once we hit 2025, 2026,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.120
 in terms of the state of the planet, the everything that's...

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.160
 Yes, because what people have been saying is like, we started off with, you know, David Cameron.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.680
 And then we went to Theresa May, who people thought was the worst prime minister.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.480
 And then we went to Boris Johnson, who people thought was the worst prime minister.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.000
 Then we went to Liz Truss, and everyone thought things can't get worse than this.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.880
 And now some political analysts are saying that Rishi Sunak is even worse,

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.680
 and that perhaps we're just going to get worse and worse and worse,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.880
 until we have a slime mold as our prime minister. Yeah.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.480
 I look forward to you explaining that to the person dying of cholera 2,000 years ago.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.720
 Actually, we have a worse year, because our prime minister makes his own buses at home or claims to.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.560
 Can I ask Jack, sorry, we talked about 2000 earlier, Y2K, millennium.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.640
 How old were you at the millennium? I was six when it turned 2000.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.280
 So you weren't partying. No, no, no. I went to the South Bank.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.080
 I remember I was sat on my dad's shoulders and I had a whistle.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.400
 And I swore every time I heard someone whistle, I'd respond back with my own whistle.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.160
 And I was sure I could sort of communicate with these strangers.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.000
 Can I ask a question? Yes.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.600
 Which is, in way of a clue, is this something to do with an area of interest of yours?

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.000
 So I know you're a very zen, you're very foodie, you go to South Africa a lot.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.920
 Is it anything wrapped up in who you are?

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.080
 I know. Other than my, you have a mustache as an elf.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.120
 Okay. Is this a personal theory?

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.920
 No, actually. I mean, it was a theory proposed in 2018

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.600
 by a man called Michael McCormick. So if you know who he is.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.720
 Michael McCormick.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.960
 Okay. Going off the fact that you're a foodie.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.320
 Even though he said it's nothing to do with that.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.840
 Everybody eats food throughout human history.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.200
 But my question is, can you give us an example of what someone living at this time might have eaten?

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.160
 Oh, fantastic.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.200
 Is that too much for a clue?

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.920
 That's great.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.280
 Well, obviously, if they're in Peru, they might be eating quinoa,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.120
 but if they're in Britain, they wouldn't be.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.840
 So you've also got to narrow it down to be a geography.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.600
 That's fair enough, because when was quinoa domesticated?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.360
 Well, that's true.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.440
 So it must have been, I'm going to narrow it down now to somewhere between 500 AD and 1500 AD.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.840
 I think poor old Jack might have just been going

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.120
 Spanish actions into the Americas, rather than the domestication of quinoa.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.400
 So, okay, there's a clue. It's pre-Columbian exchange.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.720
 I think Anna's going down the right lines.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.600
 So what year are we talking about?

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.480
 Several hundreds of years.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.680
 1492.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.960
 1492.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.880
 Can I ask a question about the parameters of this?

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.280
 Of course.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:22.080
 When it says the worst year, this bloke says the worst year, Michael McIntyre would ever say is the best.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.160
 I think it would be better as a Peter K.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.520
 Who remembers the worst year?

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.320
 What a terrible year that was.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.520
 Yeah, so Peter K's theory about the worst year.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.200
 Is it, in terms of globally, the average happiness was bad,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.800
 or was it one particular person had an absolute shocker?

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.240
 Or was it a whole country?

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.560
 Is it about the most people were most unhappy for the most amount of time?

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.760
 I think the latter, yes.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.480
 I think, obviously, it's hard to measure objectively misery.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.680
 But certainly in terms of all the areas where there were people writing things down,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.200
 i.e. we have records for, were pretty miserable.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.000
 And for humans?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.520
 He doesn't care about others.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.480
 The dinosaurs had a bit of a shocking one about 55 million years ago.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.800
 I'm going to now narrow it down to when we had people writing things down.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.160
 So the old monks, sir.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.200
 But also another clue, I suppose, 8,000 years ago,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.680
 we probably can't be too specific to a specific year.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.720
 Can I throw out a word here?

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.200
 Yes.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.000
 Plague.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.760
 Plague is a good word to use.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.640
 Oh, okay.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.720
 Okay, was there a big one around around that time?

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.440
 1665, the Great Plague in London.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.240
 And there had been around that time previously,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.640
 in previous decades, quite a lot of plague in Europe.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.600
 Black Death.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.920
 1349, 14th century.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.480
 Yeah.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.840
 Which is in the right territory, right?

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.600
 Because we're going pre-1492.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.080
 Yeah.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.800
 Is that right?

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.400
 That was bad, and that spread a long way.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.720
 There was that big sort of plague in Roman times,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.840
 so we're not really sure what it was,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.080
 but it was caused by people kissing each other.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.600
 And they all got really disfigured

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.960
 and they banned kissing for a while.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.280
 Didn't need to, because they're all disfigured by then.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.640
 Yeah, no one wanted to stop them.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.440
 No one wanted to.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.040
 You're dancing around it, I think.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.080
 Okay, let's keep, we can narrow this down.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.440
 So it's not the Black Death?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.400
 It's not the Black Death.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.240
 Is it a single year we're looking for?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.560
 Yes.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.200
 1491.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.640
 1490.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:12.800
 No.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.560
 Okay, so let's say...

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.320
 Think back to episode 425 of No Such Things as a Fish.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.440
 Oh, God.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.760
 If you, yeah, it just comes to your mind.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.800
 The title of it was No Such Thing as the Ken Ages.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.840
 So this happened in the Ken Ages.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.960
 Yes, I remember this episode.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.160
 I do.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.200
 I actually do.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.440
 So the Dark Ages, so it's between,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.880
 it ended with the Renaissance

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.520
 and it started when the Romans left.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.640
 Yeah, about 400.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.760
 We're still on the broad.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.360
 Yeah, it's still on the broad.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.640
 We actually broadened it up.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.320
 Okay, so like a play gear.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.440
 For me, I think we have to be talking 1300s.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:53.760
 Sure.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.560
 Well, have we narrowed it down close enough there?

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.120
 No.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.160
 Is the number a number we would know?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.200
 666.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.960
 No, no, it's not a significant number.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.040
 Although it is, I looked into the number

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.320
 and it is the lowest happy number that begins with a five.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.600
 Wait a minute.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.560
 What's a happy number?

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.520
 So wait a minute.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.000
 Can I just?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.440
 If you're mathematical, you can work this out.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.000
 It's a happy number is one where you square all the digits

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.360
 and then add them together

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.560
 and then square all the digits

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.800
 and keep adding them together until they reach one.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.240
 525.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.200
 Oh, close.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.480
 526.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.600
 No, no, it can't be that.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.440
 Tell me what a happy number is again

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.720
 because it's not making me happy right now.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.800
 It's just trying to think about what you just said.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.640
 13 is a number that's happy

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.240
 because you do one square plus three squared,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.120
 which is 10.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.560
 And then you do one square plus zero square

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.600
 to get us back to one.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.320
 And once you're at one, it just iterates forever.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.320
 I'm not sure that helped time a very much.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.280
 Yeah.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.560
 I'm just going to pack my stuff up.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.880
 Sorry, I'm tapping out of this.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.960
 So you get the digits of the number

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.280
 and you square each of them and you add them together.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.280
 Right, 10, yeah.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.160
 So 13, you get one square plus three squares.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:56.640
 Yeah, that's 10.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.200
 Which is 10.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.320
 And then you do it again.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:58.640
 Yeah.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.800
 So you do one square plus zero square, but she's one.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.080
 Why you do one square plus two?

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.400
 Oh, the numbers of 10, you do one square plus zero square,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:04.720
 which is one.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.800
 Oh, can you want to get back down to one?

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.400
 And you keep that, once it's at one,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.080
 it keeps giving the answer one.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.640
 I see.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.640
 Can I phone a friend?

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.680
 Can we call Matt Parker?

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.640
 Who do you ring Matt Parker?

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.840
 Yeah, that's fine.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.360
 If it was 580, it would be five squared plus eight square

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.120
 plus zero squared is a number where then you add the squares

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.240
 of them and it makes one.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.040
 OK.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.920
 It might be lower.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.840
 It could be in the 50s, I suppose.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.800
 No, it's in the 500.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.840
 It's in the 500.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.280
 OK, can I also ask?

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.240
 Yeah.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.960
 Happy numbers is 69 a happy number.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.240
 I haven't actually done that.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.960
 I'll quickly try and the 36 plus 81 is 117.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.760
 117.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.320
 So, one, two.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.920
 505.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.400
 No.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.600
 Give a clue that I can, I can't, I'm gone.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.280
 I have no idea how to get involved in this.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.720
 Like, what's a, is it like a bus route number or like a week?

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.800
 Yeah, it'll say a time of day, I suppose.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.120
 OK.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.800
 But then that annual just less than 60.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.560
 But it's between five o'clock and six o'clock.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.240
 Yeah, exactly.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.440
 Exactly.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.760
 OK, but it can't be over 560, though.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.320
 That's good.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:04.880
 515.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.440
 That is true.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.240
 Right.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.080
 I mean, are you enjoying this?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.440
 Because I can just give you the number.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.720
 516.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.120
 Right.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.680
 OK.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.560
 Think of another way now.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.640
 OK, let's remove the five.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.200
 Yep.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.720
 Now we're looking for a two digits number.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.840
 OK, yeah, yeah.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.320
 Great.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.800
 OK, do that.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.360
 That's good thinking.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:19.760
 That's one.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.000
 Nice one.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.960
 Give us a clue to this.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.560
 Is it one of our ages?

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.840
 Um, I couldn't hasten the guess, but...

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.480
 OK, but it's OK.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.160
 21, 23 and 27.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.600
 But you poor, so that does imply it's not under 20,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.080
 being realistic.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.960
 This is like a, let's do a fingers on buzzers moment.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.320
 Give us just one outrageously close clue

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.280
 and just see you guess to it.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.320
 It's the square number.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:42.960
 Oh, what the hell?

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.520
 527.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.000
 49.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.880
 How does that help?

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.320
 509.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.120
 536.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.880
 Yes, James, got it.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.080
 536 is the worst year.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.280
 I can't believe.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.240
 I know, poor dad said, talk to me in my own language.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.920
 All I needed was a double digit or anything to work that out.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.320
 Well, actually, me and James went to the University of Sheffield

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.240
 not at the same time, but also to study maths.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.600
 So I have a maths degree.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.400
 And actually, you were talking last time on media,

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.800
 it was about bar one being the longest bar in the country.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.200
 So I would have been propping that up.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.160
 Or bar one.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.120
 No, it's called bar one.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.680
 No, it's just bar one.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.400
 Oh, right.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.640
 And I think it's still the longest student bar in the country.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:16.960
 Yeah.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.280
 Right.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.320
 Anyway, so we're quite mathematically biased.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:20.960
 I'm sorry, Dan.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.200
 That was like Oxbridge.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.240
 That was like you wanted...

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.280
 Oxbridge, say it's a square number between 1 and 100.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.120
 No, it was, I mean, like fraternities.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.720
 You wanted your old Sheffield.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.400
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.760
 The in-crew of it here.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.720
 So you can both go back to bar one and two.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.960
 Yeah, we won the little BPLs.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.400
 Go and haze each other next door,

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.480
 down that normal conversation.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.560
 So can you tell us what is so shit about year 536?

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.320
 Yeah, what can we say about 536?

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.440
 Yeah, you guys might be able to guess what was bad about it.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.360
 Well, we already said there's loads of plague.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.280
 Yeah, plague is, but that's not the main problem with 536.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.400
 Is it war-related?

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.600
 Kind of.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.240
 I thought there was a war going on between the Byzantines

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.360
 and the Ostrogoths.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.440
 Oh, yeah, those fucking Ostrogoths.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.440
 Also, it's a square number.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.320
 That's...

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.600
 Well, 36 is.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.560
 Yeah, 536.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.080
 Yeah, yeah, no, I was talking about the 36 bit.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.880
 The happy number.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.440
 Yeah.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.040
 Yeah, actually, it's ironic, isn't it, though?

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.680
 It's the happy number.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.280
 Yeah, that's why I thought to mention it.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.400
 I see why you said it now.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.760
 Can I ask, please, was there lots of natural disasters?

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.880
 There was, or one in particular.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.960
 In not the big one in Lisbon.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.320
 There was a big one later, but...

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.360
 There was a big one later.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.720
 Lisbon's had a few, but no, this was not an earthquake.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.120
 The year that the bottom half of the earth dropped off.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.160
 And they all died.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.960
 We had to rebuild the whole thing.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.560
 Had to reattach Australia, didn't they?

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.320
 Was it a big volcanic eruption somewhere?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.120
 Yes.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.000
 Tambora.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.440
 No, that was 1816.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.400
 Travatoa.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.280
 No, that was late.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.000
 Etna.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.960
 Etna, no.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.520
 The one in Bali.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.560
 Did Vesuvius do one?

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.240
 Well, actually, you'll be here for hours

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.320
 because we actually don't know where it was.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.240
 But basically, 536, there was a big eruption

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.440
 summer in the world.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.520
 And it spewed enough particulate matter

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.040
 that there were 18 months where the sun didn't shine.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.840
 So we know about Tambora, which is 1815.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.400
 And then the subsequent year was the year without summer.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.960
 Do you remember that year that Rihanna's umbrella came out?

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.440
 And it rained for about four months.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.800
 Which was the worst year ever, wasn't it?

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.760
 It was like that.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.480
 Yeah, it was.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.000
 1816, as the sun was so hidden behind particulate matter

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.360
 that all the crops failed.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.960
 And it was like two degrees colder than normal.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.280
 And this is exactly what happened in 536.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.360
 And are we just assuming 536 was even worse

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.120
 because everyone was just poorer and--

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.520
 Well, yeah.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.160
 And we had less agricultural know-how.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.680
 We don't know where the eruption was.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.320
 No.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.240
 Why do we know there was an eruption that caused this?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.480
 People just, people just write, oh, it's gone dark for a year.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.600
 Yes, people did write that.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.920
 And they wrote that across the Middle East and in Europe.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.120
 And there was a famine in Ireland and poverty and war in Sweden.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.880
 And it snowed in China in the summer.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.400
 Anyway, we knew that there was something strange going on.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.560
 What's changed is in 2018, we analyzed some ice cores

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.200
 that were taken from Greenland in, I think, the '90s.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.400
 And what's changed is we've now got the technology

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.880
 to get much finer slices.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.120
 So previously, we could--

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.320
 Because obviously the depth of your ice core slice

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.040
 is a measure of the precision.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.600
 So you could only ever get to within a decade or so.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.080
 And what we're saying is that by looking at ice core slices,

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.280
 you're looking at the imprint that--

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:27.840
 Yes, sorry.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.040
 --history is left on a bit of ice, right?

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.600
 So we noticed there was a large amount of sulfur

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.520
 that happened sometime in the mid-sixth century.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.480
 And now we've been able to slice them into 120 microns thick.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.120
 And so we can pinpoint things to within a few weeks.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.320
 That is amazing, isn't it?

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.440
 Because they knew that it happened this terrible time.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.720
 It happened sometime in a year beginning with five.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.400
 But they just, for years and years,

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.920
 they were just scrambling around

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.160
 trying to find out what this year was.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.280
 And eventually they got that.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.000
 That's incredible.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.200
 So five-thirty-six, an eruption happened.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.960
 And then there was a guy called Procopius,

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.280
 who was Byzantine chronicler.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.600
 And he said that the sun--

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.800
 It just looked really weedy.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.040
 It looked like the moon, even in the middle of the day.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.600
 And--

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.960
 Like it does on most British spring and water days.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.800
 I don't know if people noticed in Ireland, actually.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.040
 And at the time, Constantinople was the biggest city

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.560
 in the world, actually.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.360
 Even though its population is less than modern-day Sheffield.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.240
 And obviously, people in South America

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.880
 or Africa might have had a fine time about it.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.840
 But they didn't write things down,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.880
 and we don't have the records.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:36.640
 So, yes, so Procopius and a few Chinese and Middle Eastern sources,

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.400
 one guy who went through Palestine.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.040
 But he was describing what also happened in the same year,

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.960
 bubonic plague.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.760
 It was the first time.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.440
 And it was known as the Justinian plague,

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.720
 because Justinian I was in charge of Constantinople

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.760
 and the Byzantine Empire.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.080
 Right.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:50.960
 Coral Justinian.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.320
 I don't want that named after--

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:52.800
 Well, exactly.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.920
 It's a bit like Spanish flu.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.760
 Undeserved.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.720
 He didn't bring it.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.000
 No.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.960
 Or the China plague.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.400
 China virus.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.600
 Anyway, that kicked off in 541.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.680
 But we've also discovered that there were

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.080
 subsequent volcanic eruptions in 540 and 547.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.280
 The decade between 536 and 547

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.960
 is the coldest we have on record for 2,500 years.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.920
 Is it really?

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.160
 And it was known as the late antiquity Little Ice Age.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.360
 Or Lallia.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.680
 God, it's really interesting.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.200
 I mean, I've got to say, I prefer Michael's stuff

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.240
 about the mandrel.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.760
 But that's pretty, pretty bloody good.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.040
 And it's kind of long enough ago

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.480
 that it's a bit obscured in history,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.000
 but also there are written sources,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.840
 so we can kind of piece things together.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.560
 And multiple independent sources,

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.800
 talking about eclipses and famines.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.200
 I love that.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.360
 I love when the way that sometimes people looking out

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.360
 when supernovas might have been witnessed on Earth and stuff,

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.840
 they have to then put a call out, you know,

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.200
 here's NASA calling out to the world of archaeology to say,

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.240
 has anyone found any weird rock art that kind of suggests

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.240
 that there was something weird in the sky and stuff?

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.400
 And they can date it through all these different--

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.040
 it's just our ability to date is just getting--

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.040
 Yeah, it's like there's someone in a library with a text

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.400
 next to someone holding an iceberg,

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.400
 and next to someone with a cave painting.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.480
 OK, if we piece these together.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.080
 I came across this article in The Guardian

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.000
 where there was a much wider long read

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.440
 about basically forensic science has got so good

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.480
 that now archaeology isn't about relying on written sources

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.400
 and hunches and lining things up,

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.920
 is you can actually get DNA from people

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.320
 who are alive hundreds of thousands of years ago,

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.640
 and isotopes and carbon dating,

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.720
 and all this has come on a leaps and bounds

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.320
 in the last 10, 15 years.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.040
 And it's kind of changing the idea of what history is

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.120
 because it's been sort of diluted by science.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.720
 It's going to turn out we were all wrong about everything,

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.040
 isn't it?

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.080
 Yeah, probably.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.680
 The retraction special for the fish is going to be going on.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.600
 Tudors didn't exist, it turns out.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.880
 Yeah, no, we've radiocarbon dated bars, and no.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.880
 Also, interestingly, the second largest earthquake

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.000
 ever recorded was in Alaska in 1964.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 It happened at 5.36pm.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.360
 Gow, spooky.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.080
 You kidding?

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.720
 No, no, no.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.120
 You have blown this shit wide open.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.160
 That's what we do.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.480
 But yeah, I also actually re-watched an episode

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.080
 of QI from the J series,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.160
 and we were talking about those dubious theories,

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.640
 do you remember those?

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.600
 And one of them was that the Dark Ages didn't exist.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.640
 Yeah, Phantom Time Hypothesis.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.920
 Phantom Time Hypothesis.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.320
 And I remember watching that when I was much younger

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.120
 and thinking, oh, that's quite an interesting argument,

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.120
 and obviously it's basically been debunked.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.600
 But... Episode three or four of Fish.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.800
 Yeah, when Greg Jenner came up.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.160
 Greg Jenner and Alex Edelman were on it.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.800
 Yeah.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.800
 And then just to call back to the start of this episode,

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.240
 when our episode was called No Such Thing as a Ken Ages,

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.320
 can I just check there weren't any Ken Ages?

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:44.960
 No, it was...

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.920
 Was that a joke that we made?

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.960
 It was a joke that we made.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.680
 Got it.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.200
 So it was the Dark Ages,

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.120
 and no one really calls it the Dark Ages anymore,

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.640
 apart from one guy called Ken Dark.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.920
 Well remembered.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.000
 There was a joke one of us said,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.840
 which is, "I took Ken Ages."

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.600
 I can't remember what it was, yeah.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.920
 Was it as well-delivered as that whole...

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:04.560
 No, no, no, that was good.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.280
 I was pulling it back.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.440
 I didn't know how it was made.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.440
 I think we should edit that moment into...

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.040
 Okay, guys, okay, guys.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.920
 I think we've come to the natural end of this episode

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.720
 of Meet the Elves.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.640
 Thank you so much, Jack, for your question.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.360
 And no problem.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.040
 I can't wait to hear the edit that you might do,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.120
 even, of that five and a half minutes

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.400
 where we just said numbers.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.280
 Can people get in touch with you on social media or not?

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.120
 They can, if they want to.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.000
 I have an Instagram called Interesting Pieces of Metal,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.840
 and it's me posting pieces of metal that I've found on the street.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.960
 And I also run the quite well-meaning Twitter account,

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.720
 or ex-account, as it's now called,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.640
 which is all the facts that I think are kind of like anti-jokes.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.840
 What's that one called?

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.680
 It's called At Quite Wellming.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.400
 It's so annoying because these are now going to become

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.640
 our two most popular social media accounts.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.600
 But other than that, no, I think I'm not frequently on social media.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.240
 Fair enough.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.400
 As seems to be the case of young people so much these days,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.880
 it is the last bastion of us old folk.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.680
 But no, thank you very much, Jack, for coming on the show.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.360
 I'm sure we'll see you on this again soon.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.320
 And I'm on Instagram every day, every moment, every hour.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:16.960
 I'm saying hi.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.640
 Thank you, Stan and Anna.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.920
 And we will see you all for another piece of bonus material

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.160
 again in a couple of weeks.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.120
 And as Andrew Hunter-Murray would say, bye.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.240
 Bye.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:40.800

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.380
 (upbeat music)
