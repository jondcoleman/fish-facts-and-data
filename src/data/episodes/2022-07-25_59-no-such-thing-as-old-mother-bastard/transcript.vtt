00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 Hi everybody, Andy here. I just wanted to start with a quick apology before this

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.600
 week's edition of No Such Thing as a Fish. We've had some letters of complaint

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.240
 about our use of a sponsor square space. I just wanted to read one of them out

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.120
 to you. Dissur and Madame, I am disgusted that you have been using square space

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.320
 to sponsor your podcast. I don't care that it helps you tell your story to the

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 world. I don't care it has beautiful templates, 24/7 support and e-commerce and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.480
 we'll really make your work speak for itself. Nor do I care that if you use the

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.400
 off-code fish you can save 10% off your order and already very reasonable

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.000
 $8 a month. I am disgusted. Please unsubscribe me immediately. So I just wanted to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.140
 share that with you before the podcast and I hope it doesn't you know have any

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:58.440
 subliminal effects on you. Okay, thanks. Bye. Hello and welcome to another

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.540
 episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.780
 offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.280
 Anichesinski, James Arkin and Andy Murray and this is our UK General

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.940
 Election Special podcast. The only UK General Election Special podcast out there

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.740
 that makes absolutely no mention whatsoever of the UK General Election. So once

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.500
 again we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.860
 last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with fact

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.780
 number one, James Arkin. Okay, my fact this week is that the first thing was

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.220
 a parliament. So the first thing called a thing. The first thing called a thing was

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.880
 a parliament. This is an etymology thing. An etymology. I think you mean an etymology

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.980
 parliament. Okay, so let me get this right. The oldest non-parliament which is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.180
 still going is the Al thing which is in Iceland. There's been going since the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.980
 10th century and that was called Al thing from the Icelandic which they used for

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.460
 parliament and then in Old English they used this word "thing" to mean

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.380
 the parliament as well. And then they used "thing" to mean a place where people got

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.220
 together and decided on laws and stuff like that. And then a thing was something you

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.780
 brought to the parliament if you had a problem like it was your, you know, my

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.820
 thing is that my neighbour is stealing my goats. And then a thing became any

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:31.180
 old thing and then it became what it is today. The journey of this thing. Yeah, so

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.380
 basically I thought we just talk about the history of parliaments and Icelandic

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.900
 parliaments in particular because Iceland, like I said, was the oldest ever

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.180
 parliament. It was 9.30 and it was basically everyone would turn up to this

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.820
 particular part of Iceland. It's actually the place where the North American and

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.300
 the European continent are right next to each other. You can jump from one to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.300
 the other. I've been there. It's quite cool. Oh wow. And that place is called "thing

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:06.700
 Belia". And yeah, it was going from 9.30 to 17.99 then it was abolished for a few

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.820
 years and then reinstated in 1844. It's been continuous ever since. I like the

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.580
 simplicity of the Icelandic terms like having it in "thing" field and didn't

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.820
 they used to make their decisions on law rock, I think, which is in the middle of

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.980
 "thing" fields when they met originally. Oh, that's so good. I do really like Icelandic

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.260
 politics mainly because of one character I've come across and looking at this. Andy's

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.380
 shaking his head, John Gnar, right? Yeah, I don't know if I'm pronouncing his

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.140
 surname, right? Did you read about John Gnar? No, John Gnar is fantastic. He basically

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.420
 he set up a satirical party called "The Best Party" and yeah, the idea of the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.220
 best party was that he was just going to challenge all of the things that he

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.020
 thought was wrong that politicians were doing. So part of his political

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.460
 promises was that he said that everyone would get free towels and swimming

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.060
 pools. Ah, that's good. Yep. A polar bear for a Reykjavik zoo. Okay. All kinds of

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.820
 things for weaklings. What do you think that means? I don't know but I'm voting for

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.540
 it. And he wanted a Disney land there as well. But he actually got in, which is

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.820
 really exciting. He's like a post-punk guy as well. When it's a gay pride day, he

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.980
 dresses up in drag. One of the problems was with the free towels. He did

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.620
 it just as a joke. But then when he got in, he realized that actually they had to

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.940
 make a lot of cuts because there've been really bad economic problems in

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.180
 Iceland. All right. So he couldn't give free towels to people after all. So he couldn't

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.460
 keep his mouth shut. He actually doubled the price of towels. He said. They asked him

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.900
 about it and he said, yeah, I had to raise everything that could be raised. All

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.100
 service fees and no free towels. In fact, double the price. Wow. My favorite

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.540
 thing of all about him is that upon being elected, he said that he would not

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.780
 enter a coalition government with anyone who hadn't watched the series The Wire

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:02.700
 on HBO. So another good thing about Icelandic politics, they had the world's first

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.980
 openly gay head of state. And that was Joanna Sigurd Da Dottia. And she was

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.140
 lesbian and she was head of government from the first of February 2009. She's

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.180
 pretty cool. Yeah. A few other things that Iceland's really good at. They've had

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.900
 more Nobel Prizes per capita than anywhere else. Apart from there's a few

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.940
 very, very, very small places that have a few more. If there's only one guy in the

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.940
 country, that's what I want. The country where 100% of people have a Nobel prize.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.780
 Yeah. They have the most expensive big mucks in the world. Why are they so expensive?

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.700
 Just because you've got to get all the food over there. And also it's to do with

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.380
 their currency being very, very strong. Yeah, everything's quite expensive in

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.360
 Iceland, isn't it? Well, last time I got the figures, which was a few years ago

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.540
 now, and they've had a few trouble since then. It was $6.67 each for a big Mac. And

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:03.040
 that was compared to the equivalent of $3.32 in the U.K. Oh, wow. So it's twice as

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.380
 expensive. Is that with fries? It's like Mac meal. Okay, well, I don't know. Do you

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.100
 know about Icelandic horses? No. No. They're very cool. Are they? Yes. And they're

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.820
 very lonely. It's the most isolated breed in the world. So you're not allowed to

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:25.780
 import a horse into Iceland ever. Okay. You can leave if you're a horse, but once you leave,

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.300
 you can't go back. No way. Yeah, because they they they are worried about the Icelandic

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.300
 horses getting diseases or foreign horses infecting them. This is supposedly one of

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.420
 the oldest laws in the world. It goes. It was supposedly decreed by the

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:46.620
 Althing in 982, which I mean no one's quite sure because records are obviously quite scanned.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:53.380
 But it's quite it's quite difficult because they lost about 70% of their horses in 1782

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.340
 because of volcanic ash poisoning. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So there were slim pickings there, but

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.780
 they've they have recovered since 1782. Yeah, it's difficult with Icelandic history because

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:10.940
 it kind of morphs into the sagas quite a lot. Right. So until 1980s, the Icelandic sagas

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.020
 were taught as history. Well, a lot of them are a lot of them are historical though. So they've

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.820
 they found, for instance, the history of the fact that it was Icelandic people who first

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.580
 got to America. There's archaeological evidence, which exactly backs up what was in the sagas,

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.180
 which said that. I think it's kind of half true and half madeeopie stuff. Yeah. That's

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.900
 kind of like Sweden. Have we ever mentioned the fact that Swedish kings about eight or

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.060
 nine of them are fictional because they come from their legends, don't they? So King Swedish

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:46.660
 King Charles the I want to say 16th or 17th is actually only the 11th. Okay. Here's another

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:52.780
 old old law speaking of Parliament and laws as you were since 1313. It's been legal to

00:07:52.780 --> 00:08:00.220
 wear suit of armour in the houses of Parliament and it's still as illegal. So you can't do that. Yeah.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.620
 It would have seemed like a declaration of war like you were going into. Although weirdly,

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:11.500
 it's illegal to have a suit of armour there, but they do have still on the in the cloakroom

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.940
 for their MPs and also in the lifts. They have hooks for your sword. In the lift. Apparently

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:21.900
 there was a guy who went as far as in the lift for the sword. Remember in the 14th century

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.180
 they had these lifts that they used to put their swords up. The invention of the lift. Post

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:33.900
 dates, swords going out of fashion. You would have thought by about 200 years. You don't

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.620
 know what's fashionable in the houses of Parliament. There's still very in. And also how long

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.380
 is the journey of the lift? Yeah. They're like, I'm just going to take the sword off of the

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.620
 duration. Well, it's a very old letter. They were slower in those days. How old is it?

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:53.060
 In the 14th century. No, I don't know. I think it's just must be a customary thing. Apparently

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.620
 quite a lot of plastics or the hooks onto the hangars in the cloakroom. It's going in the

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:06.140
 plastic. There is the idea that we mentioned this before that you're not allowed to die or

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:11.820
 that it's illegal to die. Oh, yes. This is not true. So you can die there. Of course you

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:18.380
 can. Who's going to stop you? Most of the, it's illegal to die. No, no, no, but the, oh, sorry,

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:23.340
 not illegal, but it's not recognised. But it is. It is. You can die in Parliament. Yeah. No one

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.700
 actually knows where that myth even comes from. Oh, really? Okay. The, oh, you're finding about

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:34.380
 etymology speaking of the English houses of Parliament. The origin of the phrase in the bag,

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:39.020
 I think one of the best estimates of where that comes from is from the partition bag,

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:44.140
 which is the bag that's hung on the back of the speaker's chair. Is this not true? I don't know.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.460
 You're looking at me really weird. I don't reckon it's true because I just think it comes from

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:58.780
 there being bags. Where's that pig? It's in the bag. I don't mean, I mean, maybe it's true. Maybe

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:05.260
 it's true. Where's that pig? I can't tell you because it's just no phrase. Wait, so what's it,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:11.500
 so so Parliament is I should clarify, I mean, the metaphorical meaning of in the bag to mean the

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.900
 thing that I wanted to happen is going to happen is from in Parliament. There's a bag, a velvet

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.860
 bag that hangs over the back of the speaker's chair. And it was if you wanted to lodge a petition

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:25.660
 in Parliament and you were too shy to announce it out loud, then you dropped a little petition

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.740
 paper into the, in the bag, maybe like it's in the bag. Wow. That's very cool. Just a theory,

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.380
 just an etymological theory. Where's your petition in the bag? I know that's the pig bag.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:48.460
 Okay, time for fact number two. And that is Chazzynski. Yep, my fact is that one of the largest

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:54.300
 majorities in a Brazilian local election was won by a rhino. So a rhino got elected? A rhino got,

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:59.500
 well, annoyingly, she didn't get elected. So this was a rhinoceros called Kakaleko, who was a

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:05.420
 rhino at Sao Paulo Zoo, and this was a 1958 at the council elections. And she just got this massive

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.380
 majority. So this campaign was started by a bunch of students a few days earlier, who managed to

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:17.180
 get her added to the ballot paper. And 100,000 people voted for Kakaleko, and the second highest

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:22.620
 vote number of votes anyone got in that election was 10,000. But she didn't get elected into office.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:30.060
 What? Why not? Oh, because she's a rhino. Some little detail of bureaucracy, which bans rhinoceros,

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.700
 who came second, got in. Yeah. Doesn't Kakaleko mean rubbish as well? Yeah, it means like

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.100
 pile of rubbish. And that's because she was so mean. It's because she was a really formless

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.860
 baby when she was born, which does seem kind of harsh. Apparently she was really ugly though.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:49.180
 The zookeeper was really harsh about her, in fact. So the idea was that we're voting something so

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:57.180
 hideous and ugly and stupid. And yet it's probably going to be better at this job than a politician.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.660
 Well, I hope she had a very scathing acceptance speech. To everyone who doused me along the way,

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:10.060
 I'm coming for you. So on animals being elected to things. Okay. I can highly recommend the Wikipedia

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:17.020
 page list of non-human electoral candidates, which is very strong. Here's some examples please.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:22.860
 Well, there's, and I'm quoting directly here, there's New Zealand's McGillicatti Sirius party,

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.420
 is the name of the party, that entered a goat in a local election. And then it says,

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.620
 "But they're attempt to have a hedgehog stand for Parliament was unsuccessful."

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:39.260
 Also, in 2001, a daxan called Sossice, or Sossage, was a candidate. Thanks for that, by the way.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:46.220
 In the municipal elections there. And he got 4% of the votes, which is a lot more than

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.540
 quite a lot of fringe candidates. And then a few years later, he went on their

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.580
 homeland of Big Brother, which is called Secret Story. Oh, I remember that, yeah. And because

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.660
 the the point is that when you enter, you have to have a secret. And his secret was that he was a

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:04.940
 candidate in an election. He had to enter under an assumed name. So he entered the house with the

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:11.740
 nickname secret. That was his nickname. But if the whole house was about every single candidate

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:19.180
 having a secret, didn't they all have the nickname secret? Exactly. What else was on that list?

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:26.540
 I got one if you want. There was a sock puppet called Ed the sock, who attempted to run for the

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:33.420
 Fed up party during the Canadian federal election of 2011. How did he fare? He attempted to run,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.460
 so I don't think they allowed him to reach the shame. Actually, one of the people who's running

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:44.380
 against Ed Miliband in this election for the official Monster Raving Looney party is called Nick

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:51.100
 the Flying Brick. But he's not a brick. He's a human. Okay. Imagine the disappointment when you

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.020
 thought he was a brick. He voted for him and then it turns out to be a human. Or maybe it's a pleasant

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.820
 surprise. It was like, I voted for a brick because it was the lesser of two evils. He turned out to be

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.820
 a person. It was great news. I only voted for you because of the housing crisis.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:12.060
 Since you mentioned the Monster Raving Looney party, so going back to the Kakareko, Rhino fact Canada's

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:17.900
 equivalent of the Monster Raving Looney party was called the rhinoceros party. Canada's equivalent

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:24.060
 of the, so just a coincidence. No, it was named after Kakareko, so they had some quite funny

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:29.740
 policies in the 80s and 90s. They determined to repeal the law of gravity to provide higher,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:35.100
 yep, didn't succeed, as far as I know. Although we aren't doing this on the ceiling, which maybe,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:42.620
 provide, they said they'd provide higher education by building taller schools. They said they'd

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.260
 count the thousand islands to make sure America didn't steal any. And then they had this platform,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:52.300
 this election platform in 1984, the Rhino party of Canada, where they declared war on Belgium.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:57.180
 They said they declared war on Belgium because in an episode of Tintin, a rhino had been blown up

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:03.980
 and it turned out that rhino was Cornelius the Rhino's grand mother. And Cornelius the Rhino was the

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:11.180
 nominal leader of the Rhino party of Canada. So this fictional rhino was the... Cornelius the Rhino,

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.060
 sorry, was a real rhino, but his grandmother was a fictional rhino. Yeah, I don't know how that happens.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:23.820
 So yeah, they said they declared war and then the ambassador to Canada from Belgium decided,

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:29.660
 so he made an announcement saying I saw I had a crisis on my hands and they declared war saying the

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:36.060
 only way they wouldn't actually go to war with Belgium was if Belgium handed over a case of

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:41.660
 muscles and a case of Belgium beer to the rhinoceros, delivered to the rhinoceros is hind quarters,

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.060
 as they said. And the Belgian ambassador to Canada actually made an announcement saying,

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.900
 "I will hand this over. I don't want to create an international crisis." And they turned up in

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:55.500
 Montreal and they all met and they had a really great day eating muscles and drinking beer and you know,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.740
 war was aversage. Wow, yeah, thanks. So we should really declare war on anyone who we want

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:07.580
 free beer from. Everyone, the champagne region? Yeah. They've been pissing me off for a while.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:14.620
 Just about Brazil, which is where the rhino was elected and funny people are getting themselves

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:21.260
 elected. I find this so extraordinary. Recently, I think this year, last year, the highest number of votes

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:27.580
 ever recorded in a congressional election in Brazil has been recorded and won. And this was won by

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:33.820
 a clown called Tiri Rika. And so he's just been elected to Congress for São Paulo. And yeah,

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.140
 he's got the highest number of votes ever received by anyone in São Paulo. His election platforms

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.380
 included all his slogans included things like, if it can't get any worse, vote Tiri Rika.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.140
 What does a federal congressman do? I really don't know, but vote for me and I'll let you know.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:53.180
 If elected, I promise I'll help all Brazilian families, especially mine. And he's just a complete

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:58.460
 joke and got more votes than anyone else in São Paulo has ever. So that's amazing. They're really like

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.340
 jibbing at the proper election candidates, don't they? Yeah. Yeah. I'm presumably quite hard

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:09.260
 canvassing as a clown because you're constantly saying to people, "Check my hand." You don't want to be

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:16.620
 holding babies too much. I was really surprised by the fact that as someone who I've read tons of

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.660
 comedy biographies, comedians are largely my heroes. And so many comedians go into politics. There's

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:28.460
 a lot of in America at the moment. Al Franken, he was a Saturday night live writer. He's now a politician.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:34.700
 Eddie Azard has said that he wants to run Russell Brand seems to be al Murray currently in the

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:41.900
 election we're not talking about. I was surprised though, there's an old comedian in America called Gracie

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:48.540
 Allen. Gracie Allen was one of the top comedians of her day in America, household name. And she ran,

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:54.700
 she went on a 34th city tour. She was running for president. She ran as a candidate of the surprise

00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:02.620
 party. Kangaroo is her mascot. I love that, the surprise party. I also know the way you delivered

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:08.540
 that really deadpan. That's just a normal party name. You can have other ones, couldn't you like the

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:16.380
 sex party? No. Why was that the first thing that came to us? The fancy dress party? The house party,

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:21.660
 which is actually bad housing, very important. But this is what my favourite thing, just relevant to

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.860
 a conversation we had earlier. So she had a Kangaroo as a mascot and her slogan was, "It's in the bag."

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:35.340
 So speaking of famous people becoming, going into politics, of course Ronald Reagan was a famous

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:41.980
 actor before he became president. But when he was running, the TV stations couldn't show his films

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.940
 because if they did, they would have to allow equal time to the other candidates. So if he has a

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:53.660
 movie, which is like 90 minutes long, the other guy has to have a 100 minute party election broadcast.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:19:00.860
 I think they should force one of the other guys to make a film, to be in a western all of a sudden.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:06.940
 That's a great idea. Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State was called Donald Reagan, wasn't he?

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:18.860
 Okay, one similar thing, which is some animals vote in their own elections. So they're not getting

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.180
 votes in our elections. They're doing their own things. So monkeys have police.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:32.220
 Well, they have their equivalent, let's say. So they have peacemakers who, when there's trouble,

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.500
 will kind of come in and sort it out. Which sounds like they're more like UN peacekeepers.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:42.140
 Yeah, they are a bit like that. But unlike the UN peacekeepers, they're democratically elected.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:47.900
 And inferior monkeys bear their teeth to a more dominant member of the group to get elected.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.060
 Wow. And once they're elected, they have responsibilities such as breaking up fights.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:57.900
 And if you remove the peacekeeper from the group, then all sorts of nonsense happens.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.380
 And everyone goes crazy. That's amazing. Another animal who votes sometimes is buffalo.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:07.900
 So if you have a load of buffalo in an area and they need to decide which way to go,

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.820
 they'll all kind of stand up in turn and then like do a little stretch thing and then they'll

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:17.100
 sit down and then put their head in a certain direction. And then once everyone's done that,

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:22.140
 whichever direction is the most common, the most democratically chosen, is a direction they'll go.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:29.340
 How do they, can they see? They can see, they have no, but how do they see how everyone else is voting?

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.860
 Because normally you have someone looking over. Yeah, you're right. I don't know if they have

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:39.420
 like a person like collating the votes. Yeah. Can you spoil your ballot by shoving

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.380
 ahead in the ground or something? Yeah. Okay. Has anyone got anything else before we move on?

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.900
 Just speaking about political animals, like, you know, non-humans.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:56.860
 So I got really into reading about David Cameron and George Osborne's pets and their

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:02.620
 relationships with each other. And they really do have a fascinating relationship. So basically there's

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:07.260
 the official Mauser, isn't there, traditionally, who is the Prime Minister's cat, who's supposed to

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:13.180
 keep the Mauser out of Downing Street. So that was Cameron's cat, who is called Larry. It was

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.980
 reported last year that David Cameron has rebuffed calls for Larry to resign because he's too lazy.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:24.220
 There was a Prime Ministerial dinner recently and a Mauser appeared at it. So Larry's obviously not

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.820
 doing his job. There were photographs taken of Larry, who was just lying asleep in the corner for

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:39.100
 the entire duration of that dinner. So Larry fat cats in government. But George Osborne's cat

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:45.180
 Freya was a stray and is an awesome Mauser. So ended up sort of taking over from Larry. And Larry and

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.260
 Freya became joint Mausers. I think Larry was sort of, you know, the face of a cabinet

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.820
 Mausing. But Freya was doing all the hard work and catching all the mice. And Freya used to appear

00:21:53.820 --> 00:22:00.700
 all over London and used to have to be taken. Why didn't Freya used to appear all over London?

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.980
 She just liked to wander. She used to be a stray. All right. Sorry. I think I'm in an election

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:09.020
 event and things like that. That's kind of sound like the Cheshire cats as well, isn't it? Just to clear it.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.900
 There were also sounds like you know when a president or a Prime Minister is visiting your house,

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:19.500
 the sort of secret service come and do a swoop of the house. Freya comes to the mouse fun,

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.900
 but that's good Cameron. You're good to go mate. No, I was here. Larry used to see being in the

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:31.180
 boot of the car again. Yeah, classic Larry. So Freya was once found wandering the streets of

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.580
 Vauxhall by a woman at about five in the morning. He was working for a homeless charity who was trying

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:41.740
 to help out homeless people who were sleeping rough. So she found Freya and she called up the number

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:46.780
 on Freya's. It was like, oh, it's a chance to check it. Come and pick up your cat, please. And she

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.340
 was quoted as saying, I did find it slightly ironic that I've been up at five a.m. trying to help

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.740
 24 people who've been sleeping rough in Newham and we couldn't find anywhere to send them.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:00.780
 And then this cat gets show for driven home. And she did use it for some strong political

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:06.220
 satire as well. She tweeted found on the streets of Vauxhall, not everyone is as lucky as Freya.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:11.020
 George, please stop cutting homeless services. So if you want to make a hearted and political point,

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:19.100
 I think find an MP's cat. And then also it sounds like Freya needs a Twitter account to rebuttal and say,

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.580
 oh, what? So I'm not worth going back into her house because she kind of sounds like she's pissed off

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.740
 at Freya. You're right. She's taking out on Freya who's really the victim. So Freya's written

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.980
 and I've been sent away to the countryside because they got a dog. I think that means Freya's dead.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:38.540
 That's another euphemism isn't it? Oh my god. I bet that's true. All the news reports say that she's

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.740
 been sent away and looked after really carefully by a member of staff and the countryside because

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.140
 the family got a dog. The nation with the classic lie.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:56.860
 Hi everybody. And again, just in the middle of this podcast, we've had some more abusive tweets about

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.820
 our used to square space. Just thought I'd share a couple with you. Beautiful design. I absolutely

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:09.100
 think so, but it has no place in a podcast. That's from @coolguy123 and another one, only $8 a month,

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:16.300
 bargain exclamation mark, which I am not interested in hearing about. Unsubscribe. That's from @malakimanga.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.700
 So thank you very much for those tweets. Do please keep them coming in and don't forget we are sponsored

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:28.460
 by Squarespace. Okay time to move on to fact number three. That's my fact. My fact this week is Finland's

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:35.100
 parliament sometimes makes decisions in their sauna. Oh, political decisions. Political decisions.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:42.860
 Oh, just decisions like, should we get out now? No, they love sonas. They love sonas. So they have a

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:48.060
 sauna in the parliament. Yeah, they do. Their parliament has a sauna. They just absolutely love

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:53.660
 sonas. I found this amazing speech by guy called Mr. Bertie Tostilla. He's a secretary of state

00:24:53.660 --> 00:25:00.620
 and he gave the speech at the International Sauna Congress, which they have and this was in 2010

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.300
 and it was actually in Tokyo that he gave this. So I'm just going to read you a bit of his speech.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:09.900
 Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, there are about 3 million sonas in Finland, more than one for every

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:15.500
 two of the 5.3 million Finns. And did you know that Finland is a country where there are more

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:21.020
 sonas than cars. Practically all the houses in the rural areas have saunas of their own. It's

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:26.380
 hard to imagine a finished summer cottage by a lake without a sauna. And he goes on into talking

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:33.660
 about how Nokia has built saunas for their employees in their company gyms. He said Finns carry

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:39.100
 their saunas with them wherever they go. All the 98. Yeah, they all the 98 finished diplomatic and

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:43.260
 consular missions in different parts of the world have their own saunas. Oh, okay. So yeah,

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:49.420
 that's not by leading. Our representatives here in Tokyo take pride in their two saunas.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:53.900
 The embassy saunor in Tokyo was the first Finnish sauna built in Japan, but certainly not the last one.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:58.060
 I'm sure there are many Finnish saunas in today's Japan and the Japanese guests and friends

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:08.620
 keep queuing to them. They love saunas. Yeah, I got it. Although apparently this was a statement made

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:13.740
 by a statement, a comment made by Oli Rein, who's a Finnish politician who's serving as a European

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:19.900
 commissioner for financial affairs. And he said that with increased emphasis on gender equality,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.660
 it's becoming harder and harder to have political discussions and meetings in saunas,

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.500
 because they are naked saunas. So Finns don't gender mix their saunas, men or saunas,

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.140
 and a different saunata women. I guess there is something nice about doing a debate with all your

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:38.540
 clothes off, because it's like you're naked, you're kind of letting yourself be shown as you don't

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:43.100
 have anything else around you. There's a story about... I mean, I don't want to see it in the British

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:47.020
 parliament. Particularly. Yeah, let's not introduce it to podcasts or anything, but...

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:55.900
 What do you mean? There's a story about Caesar doing that in the Roman Senate. I think it was.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:04.140
 He, someone said, "He's got a knife in crocodile dundee." And he lifted up his toga to show his thigh

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.300
 where you would apparently keep a knife, and there was no knife there, so that was a toilet.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:14.700
 But that's pretty saucy. It's saucy. You could have done with the knife, considering what happened

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:24.220
 later, to be honest. Um, Christian. That is, you know, ancient Roman satire just doesn't cut it.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:30.940
 Oh, yeah. What are you going to say? I was going to say that during the Cold War, um,

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:36.300
 Christian visited Finland for the president of Finland's 60th birthday and the two of them stayed

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.540
 in a sauna till five in the morning, and they came out and they'd resolved a whole bunch of

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:45.900
 international issues. Um, so, um, Christian of came out and expressed his preparedness to support

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.260
 Finland's desire to integrate and cooperate with the West, which was obviously quite a radical

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.660
 thing for Finland to want to do at that stage. So, yeah, stay up till five a.m. and a sauna with a

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:58.060
 Soviet and they will give you concessions. That's a long time to be in a sauna.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.700
 I mean, they might have gone at 4.30 a.m. I actually don't know the start sign.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:06.140
 So that Prime Minister would have been a whole kekenen, right? Yes. Um, so the good thing about

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:14.060
 kekenen is in the 78 elections, uh, he won, obviously. Uh, and they had a thing where they read out the

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:19.980
 vote count on the radio, as in they read out who everyone in the country voted for. What?

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:25.340
 And they did it in groups of five. And so there's like this long standing kind of joke in Finland,

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:32.540
 which is like kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.940
 Can you imagine that? That was been the best radio. Well, not the best, but, you know,

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:41.900
 it's mental. Did they just not have any creative programming ideas for a few weeks?

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.460
 I think it was to show, like, show that there wasn't any dubiousness or anything. They're saying,

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:51.020
 right, the here are all the votes we're going to count them all. All right, because you can't lie in

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:58.940
 an extra kekenen. It must be very hard to read out as well, because presumably if you lost count half

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:05.420
 way through. Yeah. Oh, my god. Imagine we're going to have to start again. Or if they say this time,

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:16.620
 definitely, definitely, you know what they say, ninth times the charm. Kekenen kekenen kekenen. So when this

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:22.220
 is true about them taking them overseas, so as when finished troops have peacekeeping jobs overseas,

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:28.220
 they take a sauna with them, even if the country they're going to is boiling hot. So when they got to

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:35.180
 the Sinai desert in the 1950s, they took, they built 35 sowness with, including one which had wheels.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:39.660
 And in the golden heights, they made sure that both the Israeli and Syrian ambassadors had access

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:44.540
 to maybe, though, you could use it. If you're in the desert, you could kind of go in there to

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:53.260
 cool down. Maybe. It's like a waste of water, doesn't it? In the desert. You're piling water into your

00:29:53.260 --> 00:30:00.940
 sauna. No, I just think it's kind of like the fact that people in the North Pole use refrigerators

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.100
 to keep things warm, to stop things from freezing. That's amazing. So it's kind of like that, isn't it?

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.740
 Yeah. That is very cool. There's actually a hot tub in the South Pole, a natural one.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:15.260
 A natural one. Yeah. Yeah. It's basically there's a volcanic sort of area on one of the islands of

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:21.820
 the South Pole. And the water is, it's naturally heated. And so people actually go, people who are

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:27.260
 stationed there go and actually sit in this natural hot tub. And the Italians over there bring

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.940
 their own jacuzzi anyway, because it's like, well, we'd rather have our own one.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:39.660
 The jacuzzi brothers used to make planes and propellers. That was their original line of work.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:45.500
 I guess it's jacuzzi really, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And then one of them had a son

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:50.860
 who was very old and needed, I think, the massage qualities that a jacuzzi would have. And so they

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:56.460
 rigged up a very, very basic jacuzzi. Just kind of a length of pipe bubbling through some water

00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:06.940
 to help his son. And it kind of took off. Like their planes. So in Austria, there's a town called

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:12.940
 Lins in Austria. And there's a health and fitness centre there that has had to deploy undercover

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.860
 naked security guards to infiltrate its saunas. Not on the much cover, are they?

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.980
 They've got to stop, like, hand keep, hand keep going on in the saunas. So they're employed to sit

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:26.380
 there naked in the saunas. And then if people start fondly each other, they have to be like,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.500
 I don't know where they keep their badge. They have people identity. Oh my god.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:36.540
 Women traditionally gave birth in saunas. Did they? Yeah. Can you stop saying, I know it's the

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:41.180
 way we're supposed to say it? No, I can't. I never will. I never will. It makes me feel sick.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:49.100
 Sauna. Sauna. Women traditionally gave birth in them because the walls of traditional smoke

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:54.940
 sauna were lined with sutt. And that had kind of bacteria-resistant properties supposedly,

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:59.180
 which made them a bit more hygienic than... Could just line the walls of a room that's

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:09.900
 a comfortable temperature with sutt. So in Moscow, earlier on this year, a man got his testicles stolen

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:20.140
 while he was in Corona. Yeah. Wow. He was... He put him down. You put him in the little lockers

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:25.580
 and you think he's going to be safe. You've got to put your pound in the locker. Yeah.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.740
 It's a false economy not to put the pound in the locker.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:38.540
 Was it, was it innocent mistake? Did someone else leave their testicles and he just picked up the wrong pair?

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:46.060
 Later on walking down the street, these are my... I'd lose feel a bit. Should I have them in?

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:52.780
 It might have been... Can you describe them any better? Oh, they're testicles.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:33:01.500
 So look, it actually sounds like a really horrible night with this guy. He was... he started out in a bar

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.580
 and this woman approached him as I had talking to him and he explained to the new station that was

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.980
 infuriating him. We drank a beer together and then she suggested we go to a sauna. They went to a

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.300
 sauna and the next thing he remembers is waking up early in the next morning. At first, the only

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:29.340
 items he noticed were missing were... What is towel? Seriously, at first, the only items he noticed

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:34.300
 were missing were his cell phone tablet computer and some money. It was only later when he

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:41.020
 undressed at home that he noticed. Oh my god. He insisted on it. Oh my god.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:48.300
 Do you ever get the feeling you're missing something? I've got my phone. I've got my keys. I've got my wallet.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:56.620
 Oh my god. I know. That's a terrible story. It is really terrible. The new station

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.820
 did report though. Do remember that he did chose to go into a sauna with this woman he

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:06.940
 been a little bit and the new station reported it. That's not a crime. I didn't feel bad for making

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.740
 jokes about that now. Oh man. I know. I really hope he's not listening. I think he's laughing

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:20.700
 wherever he is. At every dinner party. Do you have to tell your bowl story. Come on. It's so boring.

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:26.460
 Oh no. These guys haven't heard it. Come on. How did he not notice it? They said that it had been

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:31.740
 done by a medical expert. The doctor said that it had been done very professionally. Yes. Wow.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:37.340
 You can get apps that tell you how to do that anyway these days. So, can't we do ever stole this phone?

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.100
 This is why it is. They were about to just leave with the phone in the wallet and then they were like.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.500
 What's this at? Oh wow. You couldn't. This is why those ads always tell you to check your

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:56.300
 testicles over a few months. Okay time for our final back to the show and that is Andrew

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:03.260
 Hunter Murray. My fact is that in British electoral history eight candidates have been awarded

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:11.020
 no votes at all in a general election competition competition. And the whistles blown. The gates are

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:16.060
 up. So this fact comes from a book. I don't know if you guys have heard of it. It's called the Book

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:22.140
 of Heroic Failures by Stephen Pyle and it's such a classic comedy book. It's the official

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:27.260
 handbook of the not terribly good club of Great Britain and when it was first published it contained

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:31.500
 an application form to join the club and you had to give your main area of incompetence and

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:37.580
 a subsidiary area of incompetence and the club was shut down after it received 30,000 applications

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:43.180
 from membership and was therefore too successful to exist. And before that Stephen Pyle the author of

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:51.020
 the book was himself expelled from the club for publishing a best-selling book. So this the first

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:55.900
 hero to achieve this was a guy called Lord Gava and he was standing as a liberal candidate in

00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:03.980
 Rigat in 1832 and turnout was about 66% which was about 151 people in that constituency at the time

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:09.580
 and of the 101 people who voted everyone voted for the other guy. But there's a note in the

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:14.540
 electoral records because I look us up and it says Lord Gava was proposed without his knowledge.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:18.380
 I haven't been able to find any more so he didn't really have a chance to campaign if he didn't

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:26.220
 know that he was a candidate. In Ghana in 1992 there were candidates who got zero votes quite a few

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:31.420
 of them even though they'd voted for themselves and so they didn't know how obviously it was

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:38.220
 the allegations were of electoral fraud but yeah. So they actually when I'm and said I've got zero votes

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.660
 and yet I voted for myself, how is this possible? Were you out of vote for yourself? Yeah you were

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:47.020
 alive. Supposedly in old American elections in the 19th century you weren't actually allowed to

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:51.260
 enter the polling building. Does that ring a bell with anyone? Did you just have to make a paper

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:55.660
 or a plan out of your thing and you had to pass it through the bars into the building and there'll

00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:00.940
 be all kinds of crowds gathered outside. Isn't that pretty? Yeah I need to check it. You say bars

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:05.260
 it's and that's just reminding me of you do have pubs that are polling booths, don't you?

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:10.140
 In the UK. Because anything can kind of be a polling booth. Normally it's schools all.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:16.620
 Churches? Do you say there was a bedroom? Yeah there's one person who it's there's a polling booth

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:22.140
 in the sun's bedroom and they get take the bed out and take all the furniture out amazing just like

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:28.700
 a local because they don't have a local pub or whatever I think it's amazing. Kind of selfish isn't it?

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:34.300
 If you're going to do that put it in your own bedroom. Are you going to bother voting? No.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:43.260
 I six year olds really got energized about this election though. That reminds me of the fact that

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:47.260
 the division bell still rings in a couple of pubs in the red line and another pub near Westminster

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:53.020
 doesn't it? We should say what the division bell is. Yeah so the division bell which in the House

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:59.180
 of Parliament calls MPs to the House to vote. So that's still traditionally rings and still does ring

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:03.180
 in pubs near the House of Parliament. So the MPs who are drinking pints can be like oh whoops

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:07.580
 you daisies got to be at the in the House of Commons and cast my vote in five minute. Apparently

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.900
 when the division bell rings in the pubs tourists in the pubs think that it's fire alarms and

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:16.220
 frequently evacuate the building. Which is another advantage of going to those pubs. Yeah.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:22.060
 It's a great way to leave. Yeah great way of getting a seat. This is quite a weird thing. Control of

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:27.580
 stuff. So if there's a dead heat in an election then it gets just in a general election in a

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:32.140
 constituency then it gets decided by either the toss of a coin or drawing straws I think

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:38.940
 or cutting a deck of cards. So twice running in 1988 and 1992 the local council has been

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:43.580
 decided by cutting a deck of cards. How weird is that? That's so cool. I really hope it was the same

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:51.980
 person who lost both times. This time I'm going to do it. Oh too long. Someone's rigged this deck.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:57.580
 That's like Hong Kong. I got this from I have feelings as James's facts. I got it from our squire

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.660
 database. Political candidates in Hong Kong if they finish in a dead heat the election is

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:07.660
 decided by luck of the draw from a bag of numbered ping pong balls. I think they have ping pong balls

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.580
 in what do we do of that. I think in like the National Florida. Yeah.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:15.660
 Bad news you've lost the election. Good news you're a millionaire.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:22.540
 I think they have it in Florida and in either Texas or New Mexico there's one place where they do it

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:33.180
 from a hand of poker. It must be Texas. Texas old and yeah. But that's a game with skill in it's

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:39.580
 they deal one hand in it's New Mexico. New Mexico. Yeah because you couldn't have it would be good

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:46.220
 if you could have games of skill like whoever's best at boggle. Probably should be an MP actually.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:56.220
 It's grip chess. Plastic sword fight. That's how we do it. Okay so just on some bad candidates in

00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:02.860
 elections. Oh yes please. Have you heard of Bill Bokes? He was a Lieutenant Commander in the

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:11.740
 Navy and he was also the worst election candidate ever. He campaigned in 28 elections and got 7,700

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:19.260
 votes in total. Wow. Which is not very many. He lost his deposit all 28 times. In 1951 he tried to

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:25.180
 stand against the Prime Minister Clement Attlee but he accidentally stood in Wolfenstow East instead

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:34.780
 of Wolfenstow West. His party was called The Land See Air, Road and Public Safety, Democratic

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:39.660
 Monarchist, White Resident and Women's Party. Oh yeah. It was quite racist unfortunately.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:45.980
 But he campaigned against mostly against traffic accidents and in favour of road safety

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.740
 and he bought an old voxel which he painted black and white to make it a mobile zebra crossing.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:58.940
 So people would climb over the top of his car across the road. So yeah and in 1952 his election

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:03.820
 campaign involved fitting his car with a mast and a mainsail at which point he was arrested and

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.300
 fined for using a vehicle for advertising purposes in the centre of town which you weren't allowed

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:14.940
 to do then. Yeah and he said once I am nominated I don't go back to the constituency for one thing.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:26.060
 I can't afford to. He sounds great. There's a great story I really like about a guy called John Wilkes.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:31.740
 He stood for Parliament and barrack upon Tweed. But a bunch of people who heard this

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:35.740
 and they were the opposition they were like no way are we going to allow this guy to get in.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:40.140
 So they sailed up the east coast to Scupper's plans. They basically chartered a boat,

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:44.140
 got into it and headed up to ruin his chance. So they were going to vote against him?

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:48.300
 Yeah they were going to vote against him. But he found out about this and he bribed the captain

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:55.820
 of the ship so instead the ship took them to Norway. But he still lost anyway. He lost anyway.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:01.180
 Yeah he didn't, despite that tactical genius that he showed. So here's something else from the

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:06.140
 Book of Morocco failures. Would you like to hear about Matt Jack Mitten? Oh yes let's hear about him.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.980
 You don't want to hear the other option? No no. All right.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:15.580
 So John Mitten was 19th century aristocrat and he was extremely eccentric in a lot of ways.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:20.060
 But one of the things that he wanted to do, everyone in his family got elected MP for

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:25.900
 Shroesbury. I was just thinking it's just the thing he did. If you if you were in that family,

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:30.620
 he's the Shroesbury House. Loads, loads. So him his father had done it, his grandfathers had it.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.100
 So his campaigning seems to have mostly consisted of him walking around his constituency

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:40.220
 with ten pound notes stuck on his hat. And people could just come up and pick them off.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.660
 And someone else would replace, you know, he had an assistant to replace and he knows

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:48.620
 that we're taken off. He spent £10,000 doing that, which was a fortune. Yeah.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:53.020
 An absolute fortune. He won the seat by 384 votes to 287.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:57.660
 Well these people are going cheap skate. Yeah, only the 20.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:01.180
 And then on the first day he attended Parliament, it was hot and he found it boring.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:06.460
 So he left and he never went back. Not nearly as interesting as walking you

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.860
 out town covered in ten pound notes. That's a weird job isn't it for his assistant.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:15.100
 What do you do? I'm the ten pound note replacer on my boss's hat.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.260
 We don't really have any vacancies for that at the moment.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.980
 That's literally the only thing I can do.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:29.820
 So another 19th century MP who I like is, well, he was from 1784 to 1830.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:36.140
 The MP for Devon was a Tory called John Bastard who was then followed as an MP for

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:42.860
 Devon by his nephew Edmund Bastard. But what I like about John Bastard is his name.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.860
 I hadn't thought about that. It is quite a funny name.

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:52.460
 Yeah. No Edmund Bastard, sorry, inspired the nursery rhyme Old Mother Hubbard.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:59.420
 So why did they call it Hubbard? Because you can't teach children a song Old Mother Bastard.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.500
 How did he inspire it? So yeah, his sister-in-law was someone called Sarah

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:13.020
 Catherine Martin who he instructed to run away and write one of your stupid little rhymes

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.220
 when she was behaving badly in the town or something.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.940
 She was going out with it, floundering with the man she shouldn't have been.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:23.340
 So he told her to go away, write stupid little rhymes, she wrote Old Mother Hubbard and that was that.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.100
 Is that inspiring? Someone to write something? He was her muse.

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:34.700
 Who's the mysterious other person on your list? That's the Earl of Leicester who the fifth Earl of Leicester

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:38.540
 who was a member of the House of Lords. He didn't say anything for 22 years.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:41.980
 He was going to speak about capital punishment and then he changed his mind.

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:46.780
 So that's all we have. We've turned it into a yaw in the last minute.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:55.420
