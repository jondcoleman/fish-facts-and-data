00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everybody, Andy here. I just wanted to start with a quick apology before this"
00:00:04,00:00:07,week's edition of No Such Thing as a Fish. We've had some letters of complaint
00:00:07,00:00:11,about our use of a sponsor square space. I just wanted to read one of them out
00:00:11,00:00:18,"to you. Dissur and Madame, I am disgusted that you have been using square space"
00:00:18,00:00:23,to sponsor your podcast. I don't care that it helps you tell your story to the
00:00:23,00:00:27,"world. I don't care it has beautiful templates, 24/7 support and e-commerce and"
00:00:27,00:00:32,we'll really make your work speak for itself. Nor do I care that if you use the
00:00:32,00:00:36,off-code fish you can save 10% off your order and already very reasonable
00:00:36,00:00:42,$8 a month. I am disgusted. Please unsubscribe me immediately. So I just wanted to
00:00:42,00:00:46,share that with you before the podcast and I hope it doesn't you know have any
00:00:46,00:00:58,"subliminal effects on you. Okay, thanks. Bye. Hello and welcome to another"
00:00:58,00:01:02,"episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI"
00:01:02,00:01:05,offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with
00:01:05,00:01:10,"Anichesinski, James Arkin and Andy Murray and this is our UK General"
00:01:10,00:01:14,Election Special podcast. The only UK General Election Special podcast out there
00:01:14,00:01:19,that makes absolutely no mention whatsoever of the UK General Election. So once
00:01:19,00:01:22,again we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the
00:01:22,00:01:27,last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with fact
00:01:27,00:01:34,"number one, James Arkin. Okay, my fact this week is that the first thing was"
00:01:34,00:01:40,a parliament. So the first thing called a thing. The first thing called a thing was
00:01:40,00:01:46,a parliament. This is an etymology thing. An etymology. I think you mean an etymology
00:01:46,00:01:51,"parliament. Okay, so let me get this right. The oldest non-parliament which is"
00:01:51,00:01:56,still going is the Al thing which is in Iceland. There's been going since the
00:01:56,00:02:01,10th century and that was called Al thing from the Icelandic which they used for
00:02:01,00:02:06,"parliament and then in Old English they used this word ""thing"" to mean"
00:02:06,00:02:11,"the parliament as well. And then they used ""thing"" to mean a place where people got"
00:02:11,00:02:15,together and decided on laws and stuff like that. And then a thing was something you
00:02:15,00:02:18,"brought to the parliament if you had a problem like it was your, you know, my"
00:02:18,00:02:22,thing is that my neighbour is stealing my goats. And then a thing became any
00:02:22,00:02:31,"old thing and then it became what it is today. The journey of this thing. Yeah, so"
00:02:31,00:02:35,basically I thought we just talk about the history of parliaments and Icelandic
00:02:35,00:02:39,"parliaments in particular because Iceland, like I said, was the oldest ever"
00:02:39,00:02:45,parliament. It was 9.30 and it was basically everyone would turn up to this
00:02:45,00:02:48,particular part of Iceland. It's actually the place where the North American and
00:02:48,00:02:53,the European continent are right next to each other. You can jump from one to
00:02:53,00:02:57,"the other. I've been there. It's quite cool. Oh wow. And that place is called ""thing"
00:02:57,00:03:06,"Belia"". And yeah, it was going from 9.30 to 17.99 then it was abolished for a few"
00:03:06,00:03:12,years and then reinstated in 1844. It's been continuous ever since. I like the
00:03:12,00:03:17,"simplicity of the Icelandic terms like having it in ""thing"" field and didn't"
00:03:17,00:03:21,"they used to make their decisions on law rock, I think, which is in the middle of"
00:03:21,00:03:27,"""thing"" fields when they met originally. Oh, that's so good. I do really like Icelandic"
00:03:27,00:03:32,politics mainly because of one character I've come across and looking at this. Andy's
00:03:32,00:03:35,"shaking his head, John Gnar, right? Yeah, I don't know if I'm pronouncing his"
00:03:35,00:03:39,"surname, right? Did you read about John Gnar? No, John Gnar is fantastic. He basically"
00:03:39,00:03:44,"he set up a satirical party called ""The Best Party"" and yeah, the idea of the"
00:03:44,00:03:47,best party was that he was just going to challenge all of the things that he
00:03:47,00:03:51,thought was wrong that politicians were doing. So part of his political
00:03:51,00:03:54,promises was that he said that everyone would get free towels and swimming
00:03:54,00:04:00,"pools. Ah, that's good. Yep. A polar bear for a Reykjavik zoo. Okay. All kinds of"
00:04:00,00:04:04,things for weaklings. What do you think that means? I don't know but I'm voting for
00:04:04,00:04:10,"it. And he wanted a Disney land there as well. But he actually got in, which is"
00:04:10,00:04:14,"really exciting. He's like a post-punk guy as well. When it's a gay pride day, he"
00:04:14,00:04:20,dresses up in drag. One of the problems was with the free towels. He did
00:04:20,00:04:24,"it just as a joke. But then when he got in, he realized that actually they had to"
00:04:24,00:04:27,make a lot of cuts because there've been really bad economic problems in
00:04:27,00:04:32,Iceland. All right. So he couldn't give free towels to people after all. So he couldn't
00:04:32,00:04:36,keep his mouth shut. He actually doubled the price of towels. He said. They asked him
00:04:36,00:04:39,"about it and he said, yeah, I had to raise everything that could be raised. All"
00:04:39,00:04:46,"service fees and no free towels. In fact, double the price. Wow. My favorite"
00:04:46,00:04:49,"thing of all about him is that upon being elected, he said that he would not"
00:04:49,00:04:53,enter a coalition government with anyone who hadn't watched the series The Wire
00:04:53,00:05:02,"on HBO. So another good thing about Icelandic politics, they had the world's first"
00:05:02,00:05:09,openly gay head of state. And that was Joanna Sigurd Da Dottia. And she was
00:05:09,00:05:15,lesbian and she was head of government from the first of February 2009. She's
00:05:15,00:05:19,pretty cool. Yeah. A few other things that Iceland's really good at. They've had
00:05:19,00:05:23,more Nobel Prizes per capita than anywhere else. Apart from there's a few
00:05:23,00:05:27,"very, very, very small places that have a few more. If there's only one guy in the"
00:05:27,00:05:31,"country, that's what I want. The country where 100% of people have a Nobel prize."
00:05:31,00:05:37,Yeah. They have the most expensive big mucks in the world. Why are they so expensive?
00:05:37,00:05:41,Just because you've got to get all the food over there. And also it's to do with
00:05:41,00:05:46,"their currency being very, very strong. Yeah, everything's quite expensive in"
00:05:46,00:05:51,"Iceland, isn't it? Well, last time I got the figures, which was a few years ago"
00:05:51,00:05:56,"now, and they've had a few trouble since then. It was $6.67 each for a big Mac. And"
00:05:56,00:06:03,"that was compared to the equivalent of $3.32 in the U.K. Oh, wow. So it's twice as"
00:06:03,00:06:10,"expensive. Is that with fries? It's like Mac meal. Okay, well, I don't know. Do you"
00:06:10,00:06:15,know about Icelandic horses? No. No. They're very cool. Are they? Yes. And they're
00:06:15,00:06:18,very lonely. It's the most isolated breed in the world. So you're not allowed to
00:06:18,00:06:25,"import a horse into Iceland ever. Okay. You can leave if you're a horse, but once you leave,"
00:06:25,00:06:30,"you can't go back. No way. Yeah, because they they they are worried about the Icelandic"
00:06:30,00:06:35,horses getting diseases or foreign horses infecting them. This is supposedly one of
00:06:35,00:06:39,the oldest laws in the world. It goes. It was supposedly decreed by the
00:06:39,00:06:46,"Althing in 982, which I mean no one's quite sure because records are obviously quite scanned."
00:06:46,00:06:53,But it's quite it's quite difficult because they lost about 70% of their horses in 1782
00:06:53,00:06:58,"because of volcanic ash poisoning. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So there were slim pickings there, but"
00:06:58,00:07:03,"they've they have recovered since 1782. Yeah, it's difficult with Icelandic history because"
00:07:03,00:07:10,"it kind of morphs into the sagas quite a lot. Right. So until 1980s, the Icelandic sagas"
00:07:10,00:07:16,"were taught as history. Well, a lot of them are a lot of them are historical though. So they've"
00:07:16,00:07:20,"they found, for instance, the history of the fact that it was Icelandic people who first"
00:07:20,00:07:25,"got to America. There's archaeological evidence, which exactly backs up what was in the sagas,"
00:07:25,00:07:30,which said that. I think it's kind of half true and half madeeopie stuff. Yeah. That's
00:07:30,00:07:34,kind of like Sweden. Have we ever mentioned the fact that Swedish kings about eight or
00:07:34,00:07:39,"nine of them are fictional because they come from their legends, don't they? So King Swedish"
00:07:39,00:07:46,King Charles the I want to say 16th or 17th is actually only the 11th. Okay. Here's another
00:07:46,00:07:52,old old law speaking of Parliament and laws as you were since 1313. It's been legal to
00:07:52,00:08:00,wear suit of armour in the houses of Parliament and it's still as illegal. So you can't do that. Yeah.
00:08:00,00:08:05,"It would have seemed like a declaration of war like you were going into. Although weirdly,"
00:08:05,00:08:11,"it's illegal to have a suit of armour there, but they do have still on the in the cloakroom"
00:08:11,00:08:15,for their MPs and also in the lifts. They have hooks for your sword. In the lift. Apparently
00:08:15,00:08:21,there was a guy who went as far as in the lift for the sword. Remember in the 14th century
00:08:21,00:08:27,they had these lifts that they used to put their swords up. The invention of the lift. Post
00:08:27,00:08:33,"dates, swords going out of fashion. You would have thought by about 200 years. You don't"
00:08:33,00:08:38,know what's fashionable in the houses of Parliament. There's still very in. And also how long
00:08:38,00:08:42,"is the journey of the lift? Yeah. They're like, I'm just going to take the sword off of the"
00:08:42,00:08:46,"duration. Well, it's a very old letter. They were slower in those days. How old is it?"
00:08:46,00:08:53,"In the 14th century. No, I don't know. I think it's just must be a customary thing. Apparently"
00:08:53,00:08:58,quite a lot of plastics or the hooks onto the hangars in the cloakroom. It's going in the
00:08:58,00:09:06,plastic. There is the idea that we mentioned this before that you're not allowed to die or
00:09:06,00:09:11,"that it's illegal to die. Oh, yes. This is not true. So you can die there. Of course you"
00:09:11,00:09:18,"can. Who's going to stop you? Most of the, it's illegal to die. No, no, no, but the, oh, sorry,"
00:09:18,00:09:23,"not illegal, but it's not recognised. But it is. It is. You can die in Parliament. Yeah. No one"
00:09:23,00:09:28,"actually knows where that myth even comes from. Oh, really? Okay. The, oh, you're finding about"
00:09:28,00:09:34,"etymology speaking of the English houses of Parliament. The origin of the phrase in the bag,"
00:09:34,00:09:39,"I think one of the best estimates of where that comes from is from the partition bag,"
00:09:39,00:09:44,which is the bag that's hung on the back of the speaker's chair. Is this not true? I don't know.
00:09:44,00:09:48,You're looking at me really weird. I don't reckon it's true because I just think it comes from
00:09:48,00:09:58,"there being bags. Where's that pig? It's in the bag. I don't mean, I mean, maybe it's true. Maybe"
00:09:58,00:10:05,"it's true. Where's that pig? I can't tell you because it's just no phrase. Wait, so what's it,"
00:10:05,00:10:11,"so so Parliament is I should clarify, I mean, the metaphorical meaning of in the bag to mean the"
00:10:11,00:10:15,"thing that I wanted to happen is going to happen is from in Parliament. There's a bag, a velvet"
00:10:15,00:10:18,bag that hangs over the back of the speaker's chair. And it was if you wanted to lodge a petition
00:10:18,00:10:25,"in Parliament and you were too shy to announce it out loud, then you dropped a little petition"
00:10:25,00:10:31,"paper into the, in the bag, maybe like it's in the bag. Wow. That's very cool. Just a theory,"
00:10:31,00:10:36,just an etymological theory. Where's your petition in the bag? I know that's the pig bag.
00:10:36,00:10:48,"Okay, time for fact number two. And that is Chazzynski. Yep, my fact is that one of the largest"
00:10:48,00:10:54,"majorities in a Brazilian local election was won by a rhino. So a rhino got elected? A rhino got,"
00:10:54,00:10:59,"well, annoyingly, she didn't get elected. So this was a rhinoceros called Kakaleko, who was a"
00:10:59,00:11:05,"rhino at Sao Paulo Zoo, and this was a 1958 at the council elections. And she just got this massive"
00:11:05,00:11:10,"majority. So this campaign was started by a bunch of students a few days earlier, who managed to"
00:11:10,00:11:17,"get her added to the ballot paper. And 100,000 people voted for Kakaleko, and the second highest"
00:11:17,00:11:22,"vote number of votes anyone got in that election was 10,000. But she didn't get elected into office."
00:11:22,00:11:30,"What? Why not? Oh, because she's a rhino. Some little detail of bureaucracy, which bans rhinoceros,"
00:11:30,00:11:34,"who came second, got in. Yeah. Doesn't Kakaleko mean rubbish as well? Yeah, it means like"
00:11:34,00:11:39,pile of rubbish. And that's because she was so mean. It's because she was a really formless
00:11:39,00:11:42,"baby when she was born, which does seem kind of harsh. Apparently she was really ugly though."
00:11:42,00:11:49,"The zookeeper was really harsh about her, in fact. So the idea was that we're voting something so"
00:11:49,00:11:57,hideous and ugly and stupid. And yet it's probably going to be better at this job than a politician.
00:11:57,00:12:01,"Well, I hope she had a very scathing acceptance speech. To everyone who doused me along the way,"
00:12:01,00:12:10,I'm coming for you. So on animals being elected to things. Okay. I can highly recommend the Wikipedia
00:12:10,00:12:17,"page list of non-human electoral candidates, which is very strong. Here's some examples please."
00:12:17,00:12:22,"Well, there's, and I'm quoting directly here, there's New Zealand's McGillicatti Sirius party,"
00:12:22,00:12:27,"is the name of the party, that entered a goat in a local election. And then it says,"
00:12:27,00:12:30,"""But they're attempt to have a hedgehog stand for Parliament was unsuccessful."""
00:12:30,00:12:39,"Also, in 2001, a daxan called Sossice, or Sossage, was a candidate. Thanks for that, by the way."
00:12:39,00:12:46,"In the municipal elections there. And he got 4% of the votes, which is a lot more than"
00:12:46,00:12:50,"quite a lot of fringe candidates. And then a few years later, he went on their"
00:12:50,00:12:55,"homeland of Big Brother, which is called Secret Story. Oh, I remember that, yeah. And because"
00:12:55,00:12:59,"the the point is that when you enter, you have to have a secret. And his secret was that he was a"
00:12:59,00:13:04,candidate in an election. He had to enter under an assumed name. So he entered the house with the
00:13:04,00:13:11,nickname secret. That was his nickname. But if the whole house was about every single candidate
00:13:11,00:13:19,"having a secret, didn't they all have the nickname secret? Exactly. What else was on that list?"
00:13:19,00:13:26,"I got one if you want. There was a sock puppet called Ed the sock, who attempted to run for the"
00:13:26,00:13:33,"Fed up party during the Canadian federal election of 2011. How did he fare? He attempted to run,"
00:13:33,00:13:38,"so I don't think they allowed him to reach the shame. Actually, one of the people who's running"
00:13:38,00:13:44,against Ed Miliband in this election for the official Monster Raving Looney party is called Nick
00:13:44,00:13:51,the Flying Brick. But he's not a brick. He's a human. Okay. Imagine the disappointment when you
00:13:51,00:13:55,thought he was a brick. He voted for him and then it turns out to be a human. Or maybe it's a pleasant
00:13:55,00:13:59,"surprise. It was like, I voted for a brick because it was the lesser of two evils. He turned out to be"
00:13:59,00:14:03,a person. It was great news. I only voted for you because of the housing crisis.
00:14:06,00:14:12,"Since you mentioned the Monster Raving Looney party, so going back to the Kakareko, Rhino fact Canada's"
00:14:12,00:14:17,equivalent of the Monster Raving Looney party was called the rhinoceros party. Canada's equivalent
00:14:17,00:14:24,"of the, so just a coincidence. No, it was named after Kakareko, so they had some quite funny"
00:14:24,00:14:29,"policies in the 80s and 90s. They determined to repeal the law of gravity to provide higher,"
00:14:29,00:14:35,"yep, didn't succeed, as far as I know. Although we aren't doing this on the ceiling, which maybe,"
00:14:35,00:14:42,"provide, they said they'd provide higher education by building taller schools. They said they'd"
00:14:42,00:14:47,"count the thousand islands to make sure America didn't steal any. And then they had this platform,"
00:14:47,00:14:52,"this election platform in 1984, the Rhino party of Canada, where they declared war on Belgium."
00:14:52,00:14:57,"They said they declared war on Belgium because in an episode of Tintin, a rhino had been blown up"
00:14:57,00:15:03,and it turned out that rhino was Cornelius the Rhino's grand mother. And Cornelius the Rhino was the
00:15:03,00:15:11,"nominal leader of the Rhino party of Canada. So this fictional rhino was the... Cornelius the Rhino,"
00:15:11,00:15:16,"sorry, was a real rhino, but his grandmother was a fictional rhino. Yeah, I don't know how that happens."
00:15:16,00:15:23,"So yeah, they said they declared war and then the ambassador to Canada from Belgium decided,"
00:15:23,00:15:29,so he made an announcement saying I saw I had a crisis on my hands and they declared war saying the
00:15:29,00:15:36,only way they wouldn't actually go to war with Belgium was if Belgium handed over a case of
00:15:36,00:15:41,"muscles and a case of Belgium beer to the rhinoceros, delivered to the rhinoceros is hind quarters,"
00:15:41,00:15:46,"as they said. And the Belgian ambassador to Canada actually made an announcement saying,"
00:15:46,00:15:49,"""I will hand this over. I don't want to create an international crisis."" And they turned up in"
00:15:49,00:15:55,"Montreal and they all met and they had a really great day eating muscles and drinking beer and you know,"
00:15:55,00:16:01,"war was aversage. Wow, yeah, thanks. So we should really declare war on anyone who we want"
00:16:01,00:16:07,"free beer from. Everyone, the champagne region? Yeah. They've been pissing me off for a while."
00:16:07,00:16:14,"Just about Brazil, which is where the rhino was elected and funny people are getting themselves"
00:16:14,00:16:21,"elected. I find this so extraordinary. Recently, I think this year, last year, the highest number of votes"
00:16:21,00:16:27,ever recorded in a congressional election in Brazil has been recorded and won. And this was won by
00:16:27,00:16:33,"a clown called Tiri Rika. And so he's just been elected to Congress for São Paulo. And yeah,"
00:16:33,00:16:38,he's got the highest number of votes ever received by anyone in São Paulo. His election platforms
00:16:38,00:16:42,"included all his slogans included things like, if it can't get any worse, vote Tiri Rika."
00:16:44,00:16:48,"What does a federal congressman do? I really don't know, but vote for me and I'll let you know."
00:16:48,00:16:53,"If elected, I promise I'll help all Brazilian families, especially mine. And he's just a complete"
00:16:53,00:16:58,joke and got more votes than anyone else in São Paulo has ever. So that's amazing. They're really like
00:16:58,00:17:03,"jibbing at the proper election candidates, don't they? Yeah. Yeah. I'm presumably quite hard"
00:17:03,00:17:09,"canvassing as a clown because you're constantly saying to people, ""Check my hand."" You don't want to be"
00:17:09,00:17:16,holding babies too much. I was really surprised by the fact that as someone who I've read tons of
00:17:16,00:17:21,"comedy biographies, comedians are largely my heroes. And so many comedians go into politics. There's"
00:17:21,00:17:28,"a lot of in America at the moment. Al Franken, he was a Saturday night live writer. He's now a politician."
00:17:28,00:17:34,Eddie Azard has said that he wants to run Russell Brand seems to be al Murray currently in the
00:17:34,00:17:41,"election we're not talking about. I was surprised though, there's an old comedian in America called Gracie"
00:17:41,00:17:48,"Allen. Gracie Allen was one of the top comedians of her day in America, household name. And she ran,"
00:17:48,00:17:54,she went on a 34th city tour. She was running for president. She ran as a candidate of the surprise
00:17:54,00:18:02,"party. Kangaroo is her mascot. I love that, the surprise party. I also know the way you delivered"
00:18:02,00:18:08,"that really deadpan. That's just a normal party name. You can have other ones, couldn't you like the"
00:18:08,00:18:16,"sex party? No. Why was that the first thing that came to us? The fancy dress party? The house party,"
00:18:16,00:18:21,"which is actually bad housing, very important. But this is what my favourite thing, just relevant to"
00:18:21,00:18:26,"a conversation we had earlier. So she had a Kangaroo as a mascot and her slogan was, ""It's in the bag."""
00:18:28,00:18:35,"So speaking of famous people becoming, going into politics, of course Ronald Reagan was a famous"
00:18:35,00:18:41,"actor before he became president. But when he was running, the TV stations couldn't show his films"
00:18:41,00:18:46,"because if they did, they would have to allow equal time to the other candidates. So if he has a"
00:18:46,00:18:53,"movie, which is like 90 minutes long, the other guy has to have a 100 minute party election broadcast."
00:18:53,00:19:00,"I think they should force one of the other guys to make a film, to be in a western all of a sudden."
00:19:00,00:19:06,"That's a great idea. Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State was called Donald Reagan, wasn't he?"
00:19:06,00:19:18,"Okay, one similar thing, which is some animals vote in their own elections. So they're not getting"
00:19:18,00:19:23,votes in our elections. They're doing their own things. So monkeys have police.
00:19:23,00:19:32,"Well, they have their equivalent, let's say. So they have peacemakers who, when there's trouble,"
00:19:32,00:19:37,will kind of come in and sort it out. Which sounds like they're more like UN peacekeepers.
00:19:37,00:19:42,"Yeah, they are a bit like that. But unlike the UN peacekeepers, they're democratically elected."
00:19:42,00:19:47,And inferior monkeys bear their teeth to a more dominant member of the group to get elected.
00:19:48,00:19:52,"Wow. And once they're elected, they have responsibilities such as breaking up fights."
00:19:52,00:19:57,"And if you remove the peacekeeper from the group, then all sorts of nonsense happens."
00:19:57,00:20:02,And everyone goes crazy. That's amazing. Another animal who votes sometimes is buffalo.
00:20:02,00:20:07,"So if you have a load of buffalo in an area and they need to decide which way to go,"
00:20:07,00:20:11,they'll all kind of stand up in turn and then like do a little stretch thing and then they'll
00:20:11,00:20:17,"sit down and then put their head in a certain direction. And then once everyone's done that,"
00:20:17,00:20:22,"whichever direction is the most common, the most democratically chosen, is a direction they'll go."
00:20:22,00:20:29,"How do they, can they see? They can see, they have no, but how do they see how everyone else is voting?"
00:20:29,00:20:32,"Because normally you have someone looking over. Yeah, you're right. I don't know if they have"
00:20:32,00:20:39,like a person like collating the votes. Yeah. Can you spoil your ballot by shoving
00:20:39,00:20:44,ahead in the ground or something? Yeah. Okay. Has anyone got anything else before we move on?
00:20:45,00:20:49,"Just speaking about political animals, like, you know, non-humans."
00:20:49,00:20:56,So I got really into reading about David Cameron and George Osborne's pets and their
00:20:56,00:21:02,relationships with each other. And they really do have a fascinating relationship. So basically there's
00:21:02,00:21:07,"the official Mauser, isn't there, traditionally, who is the Prime Minister's cat, who's supposed to"
00:21:07,00:21:13,"keep the Mauser out of Downing Street. So that was Cameron's cat, who is called Larry. It was"
00:21:13,00:21:17,reported last year that David Cameron has rebuffed calls for Larry to resign because he's too lazy.
00:21:17,00:21:24,There was a Prime Ministerial dinner recently and a Mauser appeared at it. So Larry's obviously not
00:21:24,00:21:27,"doing his job. There were photographs taken of Larry, who was just lying asleep in the corner for"
00:21:27,00:21:39,the entire duration of that dinner. So Larry fat cats in government. But George Osborne's cat
00:21:39,00:21:45,Freya was a stray and is an awesome Mauser. So ended up sort of taking over from Larry. And Larry and
00:21:45,00:21:49,"Freya became joint Mausers. I think Larry was sort of, you know, the face of a cabinet"
00:21:49,00:21:53,Mausing. But Freya was doing all the hard work and catching all the mice. And Freya used to appear
00:21:53,00:22:00,all over London and used to have to be taken. Why didn't Freya used to appear all over London?
00:22:00,00:22:03,She just liked to wander. She used to be a stray. All right. Sorry. I think I'm in an election
00:22:03,00:22:09,"event and things like that. That's kind of sound like the Cheshire cats as well, isn't it? Just to clear it."
00:22:09,00:22:13,"There were also sounds like you know when a president or a Prime Minister is visiting your house,"
00:22:13,00:22:19,"the sort of secret service come and do a swoop of the house. Freya comes to the mouse fun,"
00:22:19,00:22:23,"but that's good Cameron. You're good to go mate. No, I was here. Larry used to see being in the"
00:22:23,00:22:31,"boot of the car again. Yeah, classic Larry. So Freya was once found wandering the streets of"
00:22:31,00:22:35,Vauxhall by a woman at about five in the morning. He was working for a homeless charity who was trying
00:22:35,00:22:41,to help out homeless people who were sleeping rough. So she found Freya and she called up the number
00:22:41,00:22:46,"on Freya's. It was like, oh, it's a chance to check it. Come and pick up your cat, please. And she"
00:22:46,00:22:51,"was quoted as saying, I did find it slightly ironic that I've been up at five a.m. trying to help"
00:22:51,00:22:55,24 people who've been sleeping rough in Newham and we couldn't find anywhere to send them.
00:22:55,00:23:00,And then this cat gets show for driven home. And she did use it for some strong political
00:23:00,00:23:06,"satire as well. She tweeted found on the streets of Vauxhall, not everyone is as lucky as Freya."
00:23:06,00:23:11,"George, please stop cutting homeless services. So if you want to make a hearted and political point,"
00:23:11,00:23:19,"I think find an MP's cat. And then also it sounds like Freya needs a Twitter account to rebuttal and say,"
00:23:19,00:23:23,"oh, what? So I'm not worth going back into her house because she kind of sounds like she's pissed off"
00:23:23,00:23:27,at Freya. You're right. She's taking out on Freya who's really the victim. So Freya's written
00:23:27,00:23:31,and I've been sent away to the countryside because they got a dog. I think that means Freya's dead.
00:23:31,00:23:38,That's another euphemism isn't it? Oh my god. I bet that's true. All the news reports say that she's
00:23:38,00:23:41,been sent away and looked after really carefully by a member of staff and the countryside because
00:23:41,00:23:46,the family got a dog. The nation with the classic lie.
00:23:46,00:23:56,"Hi everybody. And again, just in the middle of this podcast, we've had some more abusive tweets about"
00:23:56,00:24:01,our used to square space. Just thought I'd share a couple with you. Beautiful design. I absolutely
00:24:01,00:24:09,"think so, but it has no place in a podcast. That's from @coolguy123 and another one, only $8 a month,"
00:24:09,00:24:16,"bargain exclamation mark, which I am not interested in hearing about. Unsubscribe. That's from @malakimanga."
00:24:16,00:24:20,So thank you very much for those tweets. Do please keep them coming in and don't forget we are sponsored
00:24:20,00:24:28,by Squarespace. Okay time to move on to fact number three. That's my fact. My fact this week is Finland's
00:24:28,00:24:35,"parliament sometimes makes decisions in their sauna. Oh, political decisions. Political decisions."
00:24:35,00:24:42,"Oh, just decisions like, should we get out now? No, they love sonas. They love sonas. So they have a"
00:24:42,00:24:48,"sauna in the parliament. Yeah, they do. Their parliament has a sauna. They just absolutely love"
00:24:48,00:24:53,sonas. I found this amazing speech by guy called Mr. Bertie Tostilla. He's a secretary of state
00:24:53,00:25:00,"and he gave the speech at the International Sauna Congress, which they have and this was in 2010"
00:25:00,00:25:04,and it was actually in Tokyo that he gave this. So I'm just going to read you a bit of his speech.
00:25:04,00:25:09,"Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, there are about 3 million sonas in Finland, more than one for every"
00:25:09,00:25:15,two of the 5.3 million Finns. And did you know that Finland is a country where there are more
00:25:15,00:25:21,sonas than cars. Practically all the houses in the rural areas have saunas of their own. It's
00:25:21,00:25:26,hard to imagine a finished summer cottage by a lake without a sauna. And he goes on into talking
00:25:26,00:25:33,about how Nokia has built saunas for their employees in their company gyms. He said Finns carry
00:25:33,00:25:39,"their saunas with them wherever they go. All the 98. Yeah, they all the 98 finished diplomatic and"
00:25:39,00:25:43,"consular missions in different parts of the world have their own saunas. Oh, okay. So yeah,"
00:25:43,00:25:49,that's not by leading. Our representatives here in Tokyo take pride in their two saunas.
00:25:49,00:25:53,"The embassy saunor in Tokyo was the first Finnish sauna built in Japan, but certainly not the last one."
00:25:53,00:25:58,I'm sure there are many Finnish saunas in today's Japan and the Japanese guests and friends
00:25:58,00:26:08,"keep queuing to them. They love saunas. Yeah, I got it. Although apparently this was a statement made"
00:26:08,00:26:13,"by a statement, a comment made by Oli Rein, who's a Finnish politician who's serving as a European"
00:26:13,00:26:19,"commissioner for financial affairs. And he said that with increased emphasis on gender equality,"
00:26:19,00:26:23,"it's becoming harder and harder to have political discussions and meetings in saunas,"
00:26:23,00:26:27,"because they are naked saunas. So Finns don't gender mix their saunas, men or saunas,"
00:26:27,00:26:32,and a different saunata women. I guess there is something nice about doing a debate with all your
00:26:32,00:26:38,"clothes off, because it's like you're naked, you're kind of letting yourself be shown as you don't"
00:26:38,00:26:43,"have anything else around you. There's a story about... I mean, I don't want to see it in the British"
00:26:43,00:26:47,"parliament. Particularly. Yeah, let's not introduce it to podcasts or anything, but..."
00:26:47,00:26:55,What do you mean? There's a story about Caesar doing that in the Roman Senate. I think it was.
00:26:55,00:27:04,"He, someone said, ""He's got a knife in crocodile dundee."" And he lifted up his toga to show his thigh"
00:27:04,00:27:08,"where you would apparently keep a knife, and there was no knife there, so that was a toilet."
00:27:08,00:27:14,"But that's pretty saucy. It's saucy. You could have done with the knife, considering what happened"
00:27:14,00:27:24,"later, to be honest. Um, Christian. That is, you know, ancient Roman satire just doesn't cut it."
00:27:24,00:27:30,"Oh, yeah. What are you going to say? I was going to say that during the Cold War, um,"
00:27:30,00:27:36,Christian visited Finland for the president of Finland's 60th birthday and the two of them stayed
00:27:36,00:27:40,"in a sauna till five in the morning, and they came out and they'd resolved a whole bunch of"
00:27:40,00:27:45,"international issues. Um, so, um, Christian of came out and expressed his preparedness to support"
00:27:45,00:27:49,"Finland's desire to integrate and cooperate with the West, which was obviously quite a radical"
00:27:49,00:27:53,"thing for Finland to want to do at that stage. So, yeah, stay up till five a.m. and a sauna with a"
00:27:53,00:27:58,Soviet and they will give you concessions. That's a long time to be in a sauna.
00:27:58,00:28:00,"I mean, they might have gone at 4.30 a.m. I actually don't know the start sign."
00:28:00,00:28:06,"So that Prime Minister would have been a whole kekenen, right? Yes. Um, so the good thing about"
00:28:06,00:28:14,"kekenen is in the 78 elections, uh, he won, obviously. Uh, and they had a thing where they read out the"
00:28:14,00:28:19,"vote count on the radio, as in they read out who everyone in the country voted for. What?"
00:28:19,00:28:25,"And they did it in groups of five. And so there's like this long standing kind of joke in Finland,"
00:28:25,00:28:32,which is like kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen.
00:28:32,00:28:36,"Can you imagine that? That was been the best radio. Well, not the best, but, you know,"
00:28:36,00:28:41,it's mental. Did they just not have any creative programming ideas for a few weeks?
00:28:41,00:28:46,"I think it was to show, like, show that there wasn't any dubiousness or anything. They're saying,"
00:28:46,00:28:51,"right, the here are all the votes we're going to count them all. All right, because you can't lie in"
00:28:51,00:28:58,"an extra kekenen. It must be very hard to read out as well, because presumably if you lost count half"
00:28:58,00:29:05,"way through. Yeah. Oh, my god. Imagine we're going to have to start again. Or if they say this time,"
00:29:05,00:29:16,"definitely, definitely, you know what they say, ninth times the charm. Kekenen kekenen kekenen. So when this"
00:29:16,00:29:22,"is true about them taking them overseas, so as when finished troops have peacekeeping jobs overseas,"
00:29:22,00:29:28,"they take a sauna with them, even if the country they're going to is boiling hot. So when they got to"
00:29:28,00:29:35,"the Sinai desert in the 1950s, they took, they built 35 sowness with, including one which had wheels."
00:29:35,00:29:39,"And in the golden heights, they made sure that both the Israeli and Syrian ambassadors had access"
00:29:39,00:29:44,"to maybe, though, you could use it. If you're in the desert, you could kind of go in there to"
00:29:44,00:29:53,"cool down. Maybe. It's like a waste of water, doesn't it? In the desert. You're piling water into your"
00:29:53,00:30:00,"sauna. No, I just think it's kind of like the fact that people in the North Pole use refrigerators"
00:30:00,00:30:05,"to keep things warm, to stop things from freezing. That's amazing. So it's kind of like that, isn't it?"
00:30:05,00:30:09,"Yeah. That is very cool. There's actually a hot tub in the South Pole, a natural one."
00:30:09,00:30:15,A natural one. Yeah. Yeah. It's basically there's a volcanic sort of area on one of the islands of
00:30:15,00:30:21,"the South Pole. And the water is, it's naturally heated. And so people actually go, people who are"
00:30:21,00:30:27,stationed there go and actually sit in this natural hot tub. And the Italians over there bring
00:30:27,00:30:30,"their own jacuzzi anyway, because it's like, well, we'd rather have our own one."
00:30:30,00:30:39,The jacuzzi brothers used to make planes and propellers. That was their original line of work.
00:30:39,00:30:45,"I guess it's jacuzzi really, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And then one of them had a son"
00:30:45,00:30:50,"who was very old and needed, I think, the massage qualities that a jacuzzi would have. And so they"
00:30:50,00:30:56,"rigged up a very, very basic jacuzzi. Just kind of a length of pipe bubbling through some water"
00:30:56,00:31:06,"to help his son. And it kind of took off. Like their planes. So in Austria, there's a town called"
00:31:06,00:31:12,Lins in Austria. And there's a health and fitness centre there that has had to deploy undercover
00:31:12,00:31:16,"naked security guards to infiltrate its saunas. Not on the much cover, are they?"
00:31:18,00:31:21,"They've got to stop, like, hand keep, hand keep going on in the saunas. So they're employed to sit"
00:31:21,00:31:26,"there naked in the saunas. And then if people start fondly each other, they have to be like,"
00:31:26,00:31:29,I don't know where they keep their badge. They have people identity. Oh my god.
00:31:29,00:31:36,"Women traditionally gave birth in saunas. Did they? Yeah. Can you stop saying, I know it's the"
00:31:36,00:31:41,"way we're supposed to say it? No, I can't. I never will. I never will. It makes me feel sick."
00:31:41,00:31:49,Sauna. Sauna. Women traditionally gave birth in them because the walls of traditional smoke
00:31:49,00:31:54,"sauna were lined with sutt. And that had kind of bacteria-resistant properties supposedly,"
00:31:54,00:31:59,which made them a bit more hygienic than... Could just line the walls of a room that's
00:31:59,00:32:09,"a comfortable temperature with sutt. So in Moscow, earlier on this year, a man got his testicles stolen"
00:32:09,00:32:20,while he was in Corona. Yeah. Wow. He was... He put him down. You put him in the little lockers
00:32:20,00:32:25,and you think he's going to be safe. You've got to put your pound in the locker. Yeah.
00:32:25,00:32:29,It's a false economy not to put the pound in the locker.
00:32:29,00:32:38,"Was it, was it innocent mistake? Did someone else leave their testicles and he just picked up the wrong pair?"
00:32:39,00:32:46,"Later on walking down the street, these are my... I'd lose feel a bit. Should I have them in?"
00:32:46,00:32:52,"It might have been... Can you describe them any better? Oh, they're testicles."
00:32:52,00:33:01,"So look, it actually sounds like a really horrible night with this guy. He was... he started out in a bar"
00:33:01,00:33:05,and this woman approached him as I had talking to him and he explained to the new station that was
00:33:05,00:33:09,infuriating him. We drank a beer together and then she suggested we go to a sauna. They went to a
00:33:09,00:33:14,"sauna and the next thing he remembers is waking up early in the next morning. At first, the only"
00:33:14,00:33:29,"items he noticed were missing were... What is towel? Seriously, at first, the only items he noticed"
00:33:29,00:33:34,were missing were his cell phone tablet computer and some money. It was only later when he
00:33:34,00:33:41,undressed at home that he noticed. Oh my god. He insisted on it. Oh my god.
00:33:41,00:33:48,Do you ever get the feeling you're missing something? I've got my phone. I've got my keys. I've got my wallet.
00:33:48,00:33:56,Oh my god. I know. That's a terrible story. It is really terrible. The new station
00:33:56,00:33:59,did report though. Do remember that he did chose to go into a sauna with this woman he
00:33:59,00:34:06,been a little bit and the new station reported it. That's not a crime. I didn't feel bad for making
00:34:06,00:34:11,jokes about that now. Oh man. I know. I really hope he's not listening. I think he's laughing
00:34:11,00:34:20,wherever he is. At every dinner party. Do you have to tell your bowl story. Come on. It's so boring.
00:34:20,00:34:26,Oh no. These guys haven't heard it. Come on. How did he not notice it? They said that it had been
00:34:26,00:34:31,done by a medical expert. The doctor said that it had been done very professionally. Yes. Wow.
00:34:31,00:34:37,"You can get apps that tell you how to do that anyway these days. So, can't we do ever stole this phone?"
00:34:37,00:34:41,This is why it is. They were about to just leave with the phone in the wallet and then they were like.
00:34:41,00:34:45,What's this at? Oh wow. You couldn't. This is why those ads always tell you to check your
00:34:45,00:34:56,testicles over a few months. Okay time for our final back to the show and that is Andrew
00:34:56,00:35:03,Hunter Murray. My fact is that in British electoral history eight candidates have been awarded
00:35:03,00:35:11,no votes at all in a general election competition competition. And the whistles blown. The gates are
00:35:11,00:35:16,up. So this fact comes from a book. I don't know if you guys have heard of it. It's called the Book
00:35:16,00:35:22,of Heroic Failures by Stephen Pyle and it's such a classic comedy book. It's the official
00:35:22,00:35:27,handbook of the not terribly good club of Great Britain and when it was first published it contained
00:35:27,00:35:31,an application form to join the club and you had to give your main area of incompetence and
00:35:31,00:35:37,"a subsidiary area of incompetence and the club was shut down after it received 30,000 applications"
00:35:37,00:35:43,from membership and was therefore too successful to exist. And before that Stephen Pyle the author of
00:35:43,00:35:51,the book was himself expelled from the club for publishing a best-selling book. So this the first
00:35:51,00:35:55,hero to achieve this was a guy called Lord Gava and he was standing as a liberal candidate in
00:35:55,00:36:03,Rigat in 1832 and turnout was about 66% which was about 151 people in that constituency at the time
00:36:03,00:36:09,and of the 101 people who voted everyone voted for the other guy. But there's a note in the
00:36:09,00:36:14,electoral records because I look us up and it says Lord Gava was proposed without his knowledge.
00:36:14,00:36:18,I haven't been able to find any more so he didn't really have a chance to campaign if he didn't
00:36:18,00:36:26,know that he was a candidate. In Ghana in 1992 there were candidates who got zero votes quite a few
00:36:26,00:36:31,of them even though they'd voted for themselves and so they didn't know how obviously it was
00:36:31,00:36:38,the allegations were of electoral fraud but yeah. So they actually when I'm and said I've got zero votes
00:36:38,00:36:41,"and yet I voted for myself, how is this possible? Were you out of vote for yourself? Yeah you were"
00:36:41,00:36:47,alive. Supposedly in old American elections in the 19th century you weren't actually allowed to
00:36:47,00:36:51,enter the polling building. Does that ring a bell with anyone? Did you just have to make a paper
00:36:51,00:36:55,or a plan out of your thing and you had to pass it through the bars into the building and there'll
00:36:55,00:37:00,be all kinds of crowds gathered outside. Isn't that pretty? Yeah I need to check it. You say bars
00:37:00,00:37:05,"it's and that's just reminding me of you do have pubs that are polling booths, don't you?"
00:37:05,00:37:10,In the UK. Because anything can kind of be a polling booth. Normally it's schools all.
00:37:10,00:37:16,Churches? Do you say there was a bedroom? Yeah there's one person who it's there's a polling booth
00:37:16,00:37:22,in the sun's bedroom and they get take the bed out and take all the furniture out amazing just like
00:37:22,00:37:28,a local because they don't have a local pub or whatever I think it's amazing. Kind of selfish isn't it?
00:37:28,00:37:34,If you're going to do that put it in your own bedroom. Are you going to bother voting? No.
00:37:34,00:37:43,I six year olds really got energized about this election though. That reminds me of the fact that
00:37:43,00:37:47,the division bell still rings in a couple of pubs in the red line and another pub near Westminster
00:37:47,00:37:53,doesn't it? We should say what the division bell is. Yeah so the division bell which in the House
00:37:53,00:37:59,of Parliament calls MPs to the House to vote. So that's still traditionally rings and still does ring
00:37:59,00:38:03,in pubs near the House of Parliament. So the MPs who are drinking pints can be like oh whoops
00:38:03,00:38:07,you daisies got to be at the in the House of Commons and cast my vote in five minute. Apparently
00:38:07,00:38:11,when the division bell rings in the pubs tourists in the pubs think that it's fire alarms and
00:38:11,00:38:16,frequently evacuate the building. Which is another advantage of going to those pubs. Yeah.
00:38:16,00:38:22,It's a great way to leave. Yeah great way of getting a seat. This is quite a weird thing. Control of
00:38:22,00:38:27,stuff. So if there's a dead heat in an election then it gets just in a general election in a
00:38:27,00:38:32,constituency then it gets decided by either the toss of a coin or drawing straws I think
00:38:32,00:38:38,or cutting a deck of cards. So twice running in 1988 and 1992 the local council has been
00:38:38,00:38:43,decided by cutting a deck of cards. How weird is that? That's so cool. I really hope it was the same
00:38:43,00:38:51,person who lost both times. This time I'm going to do it. Oh too long. Someone's rigged this deck.
00:38:51,00:38:57,That's like Hong Kong. I got this from I have feelings as James's facts. I got it from our squire
00:38:57,00:39:01,database. Political candidates in Hong Kong if they finish in a dead heat the election is
00:39:01,00:39:07,decided by luck of the draw from a bag of numbered ping pong balls. I think they have ping pong balls
00:39:07,00:39:11,in what do we do of that. I think in like the National Florida. Yeah.
00:39:11,00:39:15,Bad news you've lost the election. Good news you're a millionaire.
00:39:15,00:39:22,I think they have it in Florida and in either Texas or New Mexico there's one place where they do it
00:39:22,00:39:33,from a hand of poker. It must be Texas. Texas old and yeah. But that's a game with skill in it's
00:39:33,00:39:39,they deal one hand in it's New Mexico. New Mexico. Yeah because you couldn't have it would be good
00:39:39,00:39:46,if you could have games of skill like whoever's best at boggle. Probably should be an MP actually.
00:39:46,00:39:56,It's grip chess. Plastic sword fight. That's how we do it. Okay so just on some bad candidates in
00:39:56,00:40:02,elections. Oh yes please. Have you heard of Bill Bokes? He was a Lieutenant Commander in the
00:40:02,00:40:11,"Navy and he was also the worst election candidate ever. He campaigned in 28 elections and got 7,700"
00:40:11,00:40:19,votes in total. Wow. Which is not very many. He lost his deposit all 28 times. In 1951 he tried to
00:40:19,00:40:25,stand against the Prime Minister Clement Attlee but he accidentally stood in Wolfenstow East instead
00:40:25,00:40:34,"of Wolfenstow West. His party was called The Land See Air, Road and Public Safety, Democratic"
00:40:34,00:40:39,"Monarchist, White Resident and Women's Party. Oh yeah. It was quite racist unfortunately."
00:40:39,00:40:45,But he campaigned against mostly against traffic accidents and in favour of road safety
00:40:45,00:40:49,and he bought an old voxel which he painted black and white to make it a mobile zebra crossing.
00:40:52,00:40:58,So people would climb over the top of his car across the road. So yeah and in 1952 his election
00:40:58,00:41:03,campaign involved fitting his car with a mast and a mainsail at which point he was arrested and
00:41:03,00:41:08,fined for using a vehicle for advertising purposes in the centre of town which you weren't allowed
00:41:08,00:41:14,to do then. Yeah and he said once I am nominated I don't go back to the constituency for one thing.
00:41:14,00:41:26,I can't afford to. He sounds great. There's a great story I really like about a guy called John Wilkes.
00:41:26,00:41:31,He stood for Parliament and barrack upon Tweed. But a bunch of people who heard this
00:41:31,00:41:35,and they were the opposition they were like no way are we going to allow this guy to get in.
00:41:35,00:41:40,"So they sailed up the east coast to Scupper's plans. They basically chartered a boat,"
00:41:40,00:41:44,got into it and headed up to ruin his chance. So they were going to vote against him?
00:41:44,00:41:48,Yeah they were going to vote against him. But he found out about this and he bribed the captain
00:41:48,00:41:55,of the ship so instead the ship took them to Norway. But he still lost anyway. He lost anyway.
00:41:55,00:42:01,"Yeah he didn't, despite that tactical genius that he showed. So here's something else from the"
00:42:01,00:42:06,Book of Morocco failures. Would you like to hear about Matt Jack Mitten? Oh yes let's hear about him.
00:42:06,00:42:07,You don't want to hear the other option? No no. All right.
00:42:10,00:42:15,So John Mitten was 19th century aristocrat and he was extremely eccentric in a lot of ways.
00:42:15,00:42:20,"But one of the things that he wanted to do, everyone in his family got elected MP for"
00:42:20,00:42:25,"Shroesbury. I was just thinking it's just the thing he did. If you if you were in that family,"
00:42:25,00:42:30,"he's the Shroesbury House. Loads, loads. So him his father had done it, his grandfathers had it."
00:42:30,00:42:35,So his campaigning seems to have mostly consisted of him walking around his constituency
00:42:35,00:42:40,with ten pound notes stuck on his hat. And people could just come up and pick them off.
00:42:40,00:42:43,"And someone else would replace, you know, he had an assistant to replace and he knows"
00:42:43,00:42:48,"that we're taken off. He spent £10,000 doing that, which was a fortune. Yeah."
00:42:48,00:42:53,An absolute fortune. He won the seat by 384 votes to 287.
00:42:53,00:42:57,"Well these people are going cheap skate. Yeah, only the 20."
00:42:57,00:43:01,"And then on the first day he attended Parliament, it was hot and he found it boring."
00:43:01,00:43:06,So he left and he never went back. Not nearly as interesting as walking you
00:43:06,00:43:10,out town covered in ten pound notes. That's a weird job isn't it for his assistant.
00:43:10,00:43:15,What do you do? I'm the ten pound note replacer on my boss's hat.
00:43:15,00:43:17,We don't really have any vacancies for that at the moment.
00:43:17,00:43:19,That's literally the only thing I can do.
00:43:19,00:43:29,"So another 19th century MP who I like is, well, he was from 1784 to 1830."
00:43:29,00:43:36,The MP for Devon was a Tory called John Bastard who was then followed as an MP for
00:43:36,00:43:42,Devon by his nephew Edmund Bastard. But what I like about John Bastard is his name.
00:43:42,00:43:46,I hadn't thought about that. It is quite a funny name.
00:43:46,00:43:52,"Yeah. No Edmund Bastard, sorry, inspired the nursery rhyme Old Mother Hubbard."
00:43:52,00:43:59,So why did they call it Hubbard? Because you can't teach children a song Old Mother Bastard.
00:44:03,00:44:07,"How did he inspire it? So yeah, his sister-in-law was someone called Sarah"
00:44:07,00:44:13,Catherine Martin who he instructed to run away and write one of your stupid little rhymes
00:44:13,00:44:16,when she was behaving badly in the town or something.
00:44:16,00:44:18,"She was going out with it, floundering with the man she shouldn't have been."
00:44:18,00:44:23,"So he told her to go away, write stupid little rhymes, she wrote Old Mother Hubbard and that was that."
00:44:23,00:44:27,Is that inspiring? Someone to write something? He was her muse.
00:44:29,00:44:34,Who's the mysterious other person on your list? That's the Earl of Leicester who the fifth Earl of Leicester
00:44:34,00:44:38,who was a member of the House of Lords. He didn't say anything for 22 years.
00:44:38,00:44:41,He was going to speak about capital punishment and then he changed his mind.
00:44:41,00:44:46,So that's all we have. We've turned it into a yaw in the last minute.
00:44:46,00:44:55,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening."
