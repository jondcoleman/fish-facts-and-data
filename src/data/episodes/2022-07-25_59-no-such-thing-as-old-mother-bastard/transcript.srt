00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
 Hi everybody, Andy here. I just wanted to start with a quick apology before this

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,600
 week's edition of No Such Thing as a Fish. We've had some letters of complaint

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,240
 about our use of a sponsor square space. I just wanted to read one of them out

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,120
 to you. Dissur and Madame, I am disgusted that you have been using square space

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,320
 to sponsor your podcast. I don't care that it helps you tell your story to the

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,960
 world. I don't care it has beautiful templates, 24/7 support and e-commerce and

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,480
 we'll really make your work speak for itself. Nor do I care that if you use the

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,400
 off-code fish you can save 10% off your order and already very reasonable

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,000
 $8 a month. I am disgusted. Please unsubscribe me immediately. So I just wanted to

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,140
 share that with you before the podcast and I hope it doesn't you know have any

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:58,440
 subliminal effects on you. Okay, thanks. Bye. Hello and welcome to another

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,540
 episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,780
 offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with

14
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,280
 Anichesinski, James Arkin and Andy Murray and this is our UK General

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,940
 Election Special podcast. The only UK General Election Special podcast out there

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,740
 that makes absolutely no mention whatsoever of the UK General Election. So once

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,500
 again we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,860
 last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with fact

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,780
 number one, James Arkin. Okay, my fact this week is that the first thing was

20
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,220
 a parliament. So the first thing called a thing. The first thing called a thing was

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,880
 a parliament. This is an etymology thing. An etymology. I think you mean an etymology

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,980
 parliament. Okay, so let me get this right. The oldest non-parliament which is

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,180
 still going is the Al thing which is in Iceland. There's been going since the

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,980
 10th century and that was called Al thing from the Icelandic which they used for

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,460
 parliament and then in Old English they used this word "thing" to mean

26
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,380
 the parliament as well. And then they used "thing" to mean a place where people got

27
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,220
 together and decided on laws and stuff like that. And then a thing was something you

28
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,780
 brought to the parliament if you had a problem like it was your, you know, my

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,820
 thing is that my neighbour is stealing my goats. And then a thing became any

30
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:31,180
 old thing and then it became what it is today. The journey of this thing. Yeah, so

31
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,380
 basically I thought we just talk about the history of parliaments and Icelandic

32
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,900
 parliaments in particular because Iceland, like I said, was the oldest ever

33
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,180
 parliament. It was 9.30 and it was basically everyone would turn up to this

34
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,820
 particular part of Iceland. It's actually the place where the North American and

35
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,300
 the European continent are right next to each other. You can jump from one to

36
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,300
 the other. I've been there. It's quite cool. Oh wow. And that place is called "thing

37
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:06,700
 Belia". And yeah, it was going from 9.30 to 17.99 then it was abolished for a few

38
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,820
 years and then reinstated in 1844. It's been continuous ever since. I like the

39
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,580
 simplicity of the Icelandic terms like having it in "thing" field and didn't

40
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,820
 they used to make their decisions on law rock, I think, which is in the middle of

41
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,980
 "thing" fields when they met originally. Oh, that's so good. I do really like Icelandic

42
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,260
 politics mainly because of one character I've come across and looking at this. Andy's

43
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,380
 shaking his head, John Gnar, right? Yeah, I don't know if I'm pronouncing his

44
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,140
 surname, right? Did you read about John Gnar? No, John Gnar is fantastic. He basically

45
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,420
 he set up a satirical party called "The Best Party" and yeah, the idea of the

46
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,220
 best party was that he was just going to challenge all of the things that he

47
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,020
 thought was wrong that politicians were doing. So part of his political

48
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,460
 promises was that he said that everyone would get free towels and swimming

49
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:00,060
 pools. Ah, that's good. Yep. A polar bear for a Reykjavik zoo. Okay. All kinds of

50
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,820
 things for weaklings. What do you think that means? I don't know but I'm voting for

51
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,540
 it. And he wanted a Disney land there as well. But he actually got in, which is

52
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,820
 really exciting. He's like a post-punk guy as well. When it's a gay pride day, he

53
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,980
 dresses up in drag. One of the problems was with the free towels. He did

54
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,620
 it just as a joke. But then when he got in, he realized that actually they had to

55
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,940
 make a lot of cuts because there've been really bad economic problems in

56
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,180
 Iceland. All right. So he couldn't give free towels to people after all. So he couldn't

57
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,460
 keep his mouth shut. He actually doubled the price of towels. He said. They asked him

58
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,900
 about it and he said, yeah, I had to raise everything that could be raised. All

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,100
 service fees and no free towels. In fact, double the price. Wow. My favorite

60
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,540
 thing of all about him is that upon being elected, he said that he would not

61
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,780
 enter a coalition government with anyone who hadn't watched the series The Wire

62
00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:02,700
 on HBO. So another good thing about Icelandic politics, they had the world's first

63
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:09,980
 openly gay head of state. And that was Joanna Sigurd Da Dottia. And she was

64
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,140
 lesbian and she was head of government from the first of February 2009. She's

65
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,180
 pretty cool. Yeah. A few other things that Iceland's really good at. They've had

66
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,900
 more Nobel Prizes per capita than anywhere else. Apart from there's a few

67
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,940
 very, very, very small places that have a few more. If there's only one guy in the

68
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,940
 country, that's what I want. The country where 100% of people have a Nobel prize.

69
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,780
 Yeah. They have the most expensive big mucks in the world. Why are they so expensive?

70
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,700
 Just because you've got to get all the food over there. And also it's to do with

71
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,380
 their currency being very, very strong. Yeah, everything's quite expensive in

72
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,360
 Iceland, isn't it? Well, last time I got the figures, which was a few years ago

73
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,540
 now, and they've had a few trouble since then. It was $6.67 each for a big Mac. And

74
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:03,040
 that was compared to the equivalent of $3.32 in the U.K. Oh, wow. So it's twice as

75
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:10,380
 expensive. Is that with fries? It's like Mac meal. Okay, well, I don't know. Do you

76
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,100
 know about Icelandic horses? No. No. They're very cool. Are they? Yes. And they're

77
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,820
 very lonely. It's the most isolated breed in the world. So you're not allowed to

78
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:25,780
 import a horse into Iceland ever. Okay. You can leave if you're a horse, but once you leave,

79
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,300
 you can't go back. No way. Yeah, because they they they are worried about the Icelandic

80
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,300
 horses getting diseases or foreign horses infecting them. This is supposedly one of

81
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,420
 the oldest laws in the world. It goes. It was supposedly decreed by the

82
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:46,620
 Althing in 982, which I mean no one's quite sure because records are obviously quite scanned.

83
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:53,380
 But it's quite it's quite difficult because they lost about 70% of their horses in 1782

84
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,340
 because of volcanic ash poisoning. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So there were slim pickings there, but

85
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,780
 they've they have recovered since 1782. Yeah, it's difficult with Icelandic history because

86
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:10,940
 it kind of morphs into the sagas quite a lot. Right. So until 1980s, the Icelandic sagas

87
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,020
 were taught as history. Well, a lot of them are a lot of them are historical though. So they've

88
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,820
 they found, for instance, the history of the fact that it was Icelandic people who first

89
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,580
 got to America. There's archaeological evidence, which exactly backs up what was in the sagas,

90
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,180
 which said that. I think it's kind of half true and half madeeopie stuff. Yeah. That's

91
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,900
 kind of like Sweden. Have we ever mentioned the fact that Swedish kings about eight or

92
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,060
 nine of them are fictional because they come from their legends, don't they? So King Swedish

93
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:46,660
 King Charles the I want to say 16th or 17th is actually only the 11th. Okay. Here's another

94
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,780
 old old law speaking of Parliament and laws as you were since 1313. It's been legal to

95
00:07:52,780 --> 00:08:00,220
 wear suit of armour in the houses of Parliament and it's still as illegal. So you can't do that. Yeah.

96
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,620
 It would have seemed like a declaration of war like you were going into. Although weirdly,

97
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:11,500
 it's illegal to have a suit of armour there, but they do have still on the in the cloakroom

98
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,940
 for their MPs and also in the lifts. They have hooks for your sword. In the lift. Apparently

99
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,900
 there was a guy who went as far as in the lift for the sword. Remember in the 14th century

100
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:27,180
 they had these lifts that they used to put their swords up. The invention of the lift. Post

101
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,900
 dates, swords going out of fashion. You would have thought by about 200 years. You don't

102
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,620
 know what's fashionable in the houses of Parliament. There's still very in. And also how long

103
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,380
 is the journey of the lift? Yeah. They're like, I'm just going to take the sword off of the

104
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,620
 duration. Well, it's a very old letter. They were slower in those days. How old is it?

105
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:53,060
 In the 14th century. No, I don't know. I think it's just must be a customary thing. Apparently

106
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,620
 quite a lot of plastics or the hooks onto the hangars in the cloakroom. It's going in the

107
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:06,140
 plastic. There is the idea that we mentioned this before that you're not allowed to die or

108
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,820
 that it's illegal to die. Oh, yes. This is not true. So you can die there. Of course you

109
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:18,380
 can. Who's going to stop you? Most of the, it's illegal to die. No, no, no, but the, oh, sorry,

110
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,340
 not illegal, but it's not recognised. But it is. It is. You can die in Parliament. Yeah. No one

111
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,700
 actually knows where that myth even comes from. Oh, really? Okay. The, oh, you're finding about

112
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:34,380
 etymology speaking of the English houses of Parliament. The origin of the phrase in the bag,

113
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,020
 I think one of the best estimates of where that comes from is from the partition bag,

114
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,140
 which is the bag that's hung on the back of the speaker's chair. Is this not true? I don't know.

115
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,460
 You're looking at me really weird. I don't reckon it's true because I just think it comes from

116
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:58,780
 there being bags. Where's that pig? It's in the bag. I don't mean, I mean, maybe it's true. Maybe

117
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:05,260
 it's true. Where's that pig? I can't tell you because it's just no phrase. Wait, so what's it,

118
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,500
 so so Parliament is I should clarify, I mean, the metaphorical meaning of in the bag to mean the

119
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,900
 thing that I wanted to happen is going to happen is from in Parliament. There's a bag, a velvet

120
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,860
 bag that hangs over the back of the speaker's chair. And it was if you wanted to lodge a petition

121
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:25,660
 in Parliament and you were too shy to announce it out loud, then you dropped a little petition

122
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:31,740
 paper into the, in the bag, maybe like it's in the bag. Wow. That's very cool. Just a theory,

123
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,380
 just an etymological theory. Where's your petition in the bag? I know that's the pig bag.

124
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:48,460
 Okay, time for fact number two. And that is Chazzynski. Yep, my fact is that one of the largest

125
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,300
 majorities in a Brazilian local election was won by a rhino. So a rhino got elected? A rhino got,

126
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,500
 well, annoyingly, she didn't get elected. So this was a rhinoceros called Kakaleko, who was a

127
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,420
 rhino at Sao Paulo Zoo, and this was a 1958 at the council elections. And she just got this massive

128
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,380
 majority. So this campaign was started by a bunch of students a few days earlier, who managed to

129
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:17,180
 get her added to the ballot paper. And 100,000 people voted for Kakaleko, and the second highest

130
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,620
 vote number of votes anyone got in that election was 10,000. But she didn't get elected into office.

131
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:30,060
 What? Why not? Oh, because she's a rhino. Some little detail of bureaucracy, which bans rhinoceros,

132
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,700
 who came second, got in. Yeah. Doesn't Kakaleko mean rubbish as well? Yeah, it means like

133
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,100
 pile of rubbish. And that's because she was so mean. It's because she was a really formless

134
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,860
 baby when she was born, which does seem kind of harsh. Apparently she was really ugly though.

135
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:49,180
 The zookeeper was really harsh about her, in fact. So the idea was that we're voting something so

136
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:57,180
 hideous and ugly and stupid. And yet it's probably going to be better at this job than a politician.

137
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,660
 Well, I hope she had a very scathing acceptance speech. To everyone who doused me along the way,

138
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:10,060
 I'm coming for you. So on animals being elected to things. Okay. I can highly recommend the Wikipedia

139
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:17,020
 page list of non-human electoral candidates, which is very strong. Here's some examples please.

140
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,860
 Well, there's, and I'm quoting directly here, there's New Zealand's McGillicatti Sirius party,

141
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,420
 is the name of the party, that entered a goat in a local election. And then it says,

142
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,620
 "But they're attempt to have a hedgehog stand for Parliament was unsuccessful."

143
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:39,260
 Also, in 2001, a daxan called Sossice, or Sossage, was a candidate. Thanks for that, by the way.

144
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:46,220
 In the municipal elections there. And he got 4% of the votes, which is a lot more than

145
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,540
 quite a lot of fringe candidates. And then a few years later, he went on their

146
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,580
 homeland of Big Brother, which is called Secret Story. Oh, I remember that, yeah. And because

147
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,660
 the the point is that when you enter, you have to have a secret. And his secret was that he was a

148
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,940
 candidate in an election. He had to enter under an assumed name. So he entered the house with the

149
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:11,740
 nickname secret. That was his nickname. But if the whole house was about every single candidate

150
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:19,180
 having a secret, didn't they all have the nickname secret? Exactly. What else was on that list?

151
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:26,540
 I got one if you want. There was a sock puppet called Ed the sock, who attempted to run for the

152
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:33,420
 Fed up party during the Canadian federal election of 2011. How did he fare? He attempted to run,

153
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,460
 so I don't think they allowed him to reach the shame. Actually, one of the people who's running

154
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:44,380
 against Ed Miliband in this election for the official Monster Raving Looney party is called Nick

155
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:51,100
 the Flying Brick. But he's not a brick. He's a human. Okay. Imagine the disappointment when you

156
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,020
 thought he was a brick. He voted for him and then it turns out to be a human. Or maybe it's a pleasant

157
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,820
 surprise. It was like, I voted for a brick because it was the lesser of two evils. He turned out to be

158
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,820
 a person. It was great news. I only voted for you because of the housing crisis.

159
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:12,060
 Since you mentioned the Monster Raving Looney party, so going back to the Kakareko, Rhino fact Canada's

160
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,900
 equivalent of the Monster Raving Looney party was called the rhinoceros party. Canada's equivalent

161
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:24,060
 of the, so just a coincidence. No, it was named after Kakareko, so they had some quite funny

162
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,740
 policies in the 80s and 90s. They determined to repeal the law of gravity to provide higher,

163
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,100
 yep, didn't succeed, as far as I know. Although we aren't doing this on the ceiling, which maybe,

164
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:42,620
 provide, they said they'd provide higher education by building taller schools. They said they'd

165
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,260
 count the thousand islands to make sure America didn't steal any. And then they had this platform,

166
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:52,300
 this election platform in 1984, the Rhino party of Canada, where they declared war on Belgium.

167
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,180
 They said they declared war on Belgium because in an episode of Tintin, a rhino had been blown up

168
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,980
 and it turned out that rhino was Cornelius the Rhino's grand mother. And Cornelius the Rhino was the

169
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:11,180
 nominal leader of the Rhino party of Canada. So this fictional rhino was the... Cornelius the Rhino,

170
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,060
 sorry, was a real rhino, but his grandmother was a fictional rhino. Yeah, I don't know how that happens.

171
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:23,820
 So yeah, they said they declared war and then the ambassador to Canada from Belgium decided,

172
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,660
 so he made an announcement saying I saw I had a crisis on my hands and they declared war saying the

173
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:36,060
 only way they wouldn't actually go to war with Belgium was if Belgium handed over a case of

174
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,660
 muscles and a case of Belgium beer to the rhinoceros, delivered to the rhinoceros is hind quarters,

175
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,060
 as they said. And the Belgian ambassador to Canada actually made an announcement saying,

176
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,900
 "I will hand this over. I don't want to create an international crisis." And they turned up in

177
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:55,500
 Montreal and they all met and they had a really great day eating muscles and drinking beer and you know,

178
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,740
 war was aversage. Wow, yeah, thanks. So we should really declare war on anyone who we want

179
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,580
 free beer from. Everyone, the champagne region? Yeah. They've been pissing me off for a while.

180
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:14,620
 Just about Brazil, which is where the rhino was elected and funny people are getting themselves

181
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:21,260
 elected. I find this so extraordinary. Recently, I think this year, last year, the highest number of votes

182
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,580
 ever recorded in a congressional election in Brazil has been recorded and won. And this was won by

183
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,820
 a clown called Tiri Rika. And so he's just been elected to Congress for São Paulo. And yeah,

184
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,140
 he's got the highest number of votes ever received by anyone in São Paulo. His election platforms

185
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,380
 included all his slogans included things like, if it can't get any worse, vote Tiri Rika.

186
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,140
 What does a federal congressman do? I really don't know, but vote for me and I'll let you know.

187
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,180
 If elected, I promise I'll help all Brazilian families, especially mine. And he's just a complete

188
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,460
 joke and got more votes than anyone else in São Paulo has ever. So that's amazing. They're really like

189
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,340
 jibbing at the proper election candidates, don't they? Yeah. Yeah. I'm presumably quite hard

190
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:09,260
 canvassing as a clown because you're constantly saying to people, "Check my hand." You don't want to be

191
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,620
 holding babies too much. I was really surprised by the fact that as someone who I've read tons of

192
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,660
 comedy biographies, comedians are largely my heroes. And so many comedians go into politics. There's

193
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:28,460
 a lot of in America at the moment. Al Franken, he was a Saturday night live writer. He's now a politician.

194
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:34,700
 Eddie Azard has said that he wants to run Russell Brand seems to be al Murray currently in the

195
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,900
 election we're not talking about. I was surprised though, there's an old comedian in America called Gracie

196
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:48,540
 Allen. Gracie Allen was one of the top comedians of her day in America, household name. And she ran,

197
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:54,700
 she went on a 34th city tour. She was running for president. She ran as a candidate of the surprise

198
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:02,620
 party. Kangaroo is her mascot. I love that, the surprise party. I also know the way you delivered

199
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,540
 that really deadpan. That's just a normal party name. You can have other ones, couldn't you like the

200
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:16,380
 sex party? No. Why was that the first thing that came to us? The fancy dress party? The house party,

201
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,660
 which is actually bad housing, very important. But this is what my favourite thing, just relevant to

202
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,860
 a conversation we had earlier. So she had a Kangaroo as a mascot and her slogan was, "It's in the bag."

203
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:35,340
 So speaking of famous people becoming, going into politics, of course Ronald Reagan was a famous

204
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:41,980
 actor before he became president. But when he was running, the TV stations couldn't show his films

205
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,940
 because if they did, they would have to allow equal time to the other candidates. So if he has a

206
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:53,660
 movie, which is like 90 minutes long, the other guy has to have a 100 minute party election broadcast.

207
00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:00,860
 I think they should force one of the other guys to make a film, to be in a western all of a sudden.

208
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,940
 That's a great idea. Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State was called Donald Reagan, wasn't he?

209
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:18,860
 Okay, one similar thing, which is some animals vote in their own elections. So they're not getting

210
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,180
 votes in our elections. They're doing their own things. So monkeys have police.

211
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:32,220
 Well, they have their equivalent, let's say. So they have peacemakers who, when there's trouble,

212
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,500
 will kind of come in and sort it out. Which sounds like they're more like UN peacekeepers.

213
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,140
 Yeah, they are a bit like that. But unlike the UN peacekeepers, they're democratically elected.

214
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,900
 And inferior monkeys bear their teeth to a more dominant member of the group to get elected.

215
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,060
 Wow. And once they're elected, they have responsibilities such as breaking up fights.

216
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:57,900
 And if you remove the peacekeeper from the group, then all sorts of nonsense happens.

217
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,380
 And everyone goes crazy. That's amazing. Another animal who votes sometimes is buffalo.

218
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,900
 So if you have a load of buffalo in an area and they need to decide which way to go,

219
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,820
 they'll all kind of stand up in turn and then like do a little stretch thing and then they'll

220
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,100
 sit down and then put their head in a certain direction. And then once everyone's done that,

221
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,140
 whichever direction is the most common, the most democratically chosen, is a direction they'll go.

222
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:29,340
 How do they, can they see? They can see, they have no, but how do they see how everyone else is voting?

223
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,860
 Because normally you have someone looking over. Yeah, you're right. I don't know if they have

224
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:39,420
 like a person like collating the votes. Yeah. Can you spoil your ballot by shoving

225
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,380
 ahead in the ground or something? Yeah. Okay. Has anyone got anything else before we move on?

226
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,900
 Just speaking about political animals, like, you know, non-humans.

227
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:56,860
 So I got really into reading about David Cameron and George Osborne's pets and their

228
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:02,620
 relationships with each other. And they really do have a fascinating relationship. So basically there's

229
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,260
 the official Mauser, isn't there, traditionally, who is the Prime Minister's cat, who's supposed to

230
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:13,180
 keep the Mauser out of Downing Street. So that was Cameron's cat, who is called Larry. It was

231
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,980
 reported last year that David Cameron has rebuffed calls for Larry to resign because he's too lazy.

232
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:24,220
 There was a Prime Ministerial dinner recently and a Mauser appeared at it. So Larry's obviously not

233
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,820
 doing his job. There were photographs taken of Larry, who was just lying asleep in the corner for

234
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:39,100
 the entire duration of that dinner. So Larry fat cats in government. But George Osborne's cat

235
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:45,180
 Freya was a stray and is an awesome Mauser. So ended up sort of taking over from Larry. And Larry and

236
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,260
 Freya became joint Mausers. I think Larry was sort of, you know, the face of a cabinet

237
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,820
 Mausing. But Freya was doing all the hard work and catching all the mice. And Freya used to appear

238
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:00,700
 all over London and used to have to be taken. Why didn't Freya used to appear all over London?

239
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,980
 She just liked to wander. She used to be a stray. All right. Sorry. I think I'm in an election

240
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:09,020
 event and things like that. That's kind of sound like the Cheshire cats as well, isn't it? Just to clear it.

241
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,900
 There were also sounds like you know when a president or a Prime Minister is visiting your house,

242
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,500
 the sort of secret service come and do a swoop of the house. Freya comes to the mouse fun,

243
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,900
 but that's good Cameron. You're good to go mate. No, I was here. Larry used to see being in the

244
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:31,180
 boot of the car again. Yeah, classic Larry. So Freya was once found wandering the streets of

245
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,580
 Vauxhall by a woman at about five in the morning. He was working for a homeless charity who was trying

246
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:41,740
 to help out homeless people who were sleeping rough. So she found Freya and she called up the number

247
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,780
 on Freya's. It was like, oh, it's a chance to check it. Come and pick up your cat, please. And she

248
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,340
 was quoted as saying, I did find it slightly ironic that I've been up at five a.m. trying to help

249
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,740
 24 people who've been sleeping rough in Newham and we couldn't find anywhere to send them.

250
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,780
 And then this cat gets show for driven home. And she did use it for some strong political

251
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:06,220
 satire as well. She tweeted found on the streets of Vauxhall, not everyone is as lucky as Freya.

252
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:11,020
 George, please stop cutting homeless services. So if you want to make a hearted and political point,

253
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:19,100
 I think find an MP's cat. And then also it sounds like Freya needs a Twitter account to rebuttal and say,

254
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,580
 oh, what? So I'm not worth going back into her house because she kind of sounds like she's pissed off

255
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,740
 at Freya. You're right. She's taking out on Freya who's really the victim. So Freya's written

256
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,980
 and I've been sent away to the countryside because they got a dog. I think that means Freya's dead.

257
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:38,540
 That's another euphemism isn't it? Oh my god. I bet that's true. All the news reports say that she's

258
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,740
 been sent away and looked after really carefully by a member of staff and the countryside because

259
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,140
 the family got a dog. The nation with the classic lie.

260
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:56,860
 Hi everybody. And again, just in the middle of this podcast, we've had some more abusive tweets about

261
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,820
 our used to square space. Just thought I'd share a couple with you. Beautiful design. I absolutely

262
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:09,100
 think so, but it has no place in a podcast. That's from @coolguy123 and another one, only $8 a month,

263
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:16,300
 bargain exclamation mark, which I am not interested in hearing about. Unsubscribe. That's from @malakimanga.

264
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,700
 So thank you very much for those tweets. Do please keep them coming in and don't forget we are sponsored

265
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:28,460
 by Squarespace. Okay time to move on to fact number three. That's my fact. My fact this week is Finland's

266
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:35,100
 parliament sometimes makes decisions in their sauna. Oh, political decisions. Political decisions.

267
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:42,860
 Oh, just decisions like, should we get out now? No, they love sonas. They love sonas. So they have a

268
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:48,060
 sauna in the parliament. Yeah, they do. Their parliament has a sauna. They just absolutely love

269
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,660
 sonas. I found this amazing speech by guy called Mr. Bertie Tostilla. He's a secretary of state

270
00:24:53,660 --> 00:25:00,620
 and he gave the speech at the International Sauna Congress, which they have and this was in 2010

271
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,300
 and it was actually in Tokyo that he gave this. So I'm just going to read you a bit of his speech.

272
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,900
 Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, there are about 3 million sonas in Finland, more than one for every

273
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,500
 two of the 5.3 million Finns. And did you know that Finland is a country where there are more

274
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:21,020
 sonas than cars. Practically all the houses in the rural areas have saunas of their own. It's

275
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:26,380
 hard to imagine a finished summer cottage by a lake without a sauna. And he goes on into talking

276
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:33,660
 about how Nokia has built saunas for their employees in their company gyms. He said Finns carry

277
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:39,100
 their saunas with them wherever they go. All the 98. Yeah, they all the 98 finished diplomatic and

278
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,260
 consular missions in different parts of the world have their own saunas. Oh, okay. So yeah,

279
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:49,420
 that's not by leading. Our representatives here in Tokyo take pride in their two saunas.

280
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,900
 The embassy saunor in Tokyo was the first Finnish sauna built in Japan, but certainly not the last one.

281
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,060
 I'm sure there are many Finnish saunas in today's Japan and the Japanese guests and friends

282
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:08,620
 keep queuing to them. They love saunas. Yeah, I got it. Although apparently this was a statement made

283
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:13,740
 by a statement, a comment made by Oli Rein, who's a Finnish politician who's serving as a European

284
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,900
 commissioner for financial affairs. And he said that with increased emphasis on gender equality,

285
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,660
 it's becoming harder and harder to have political discussions and meetings in saunas,

286
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,500
 because they are naked saunas. So Finns don't gender mix their saunas, men or saunas,

287
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,140
 and a different saunata women. I guess there is something nice about doing a debate with all your

288
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:38,540
 clothes off, because it's like you're naked, you're kind of letting yourself be shown as you don't

289
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:43,100
 have anything else around you. There's a story about... I mean, I don't want to see it in the British

290
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,020
 parliament. Particularly. Yeah, let's not introduce it to podcasts or anything, but...

291
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:55,900
 What do you mean? There's a story about Caesar doing that in the Roman Senate. I think it was.

292
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:04,140
 He, someone said, "He's got a knife in crocodile dundee." And he lifted up his toga to show his thigh

293
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,300
 where you would apparently keep a knife, and there was no knife there, so that was a toilet.

294
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:14,700
 But that's pretty saucy. It's saucy. You could have done with the knife, considering what happened

295
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:24,220
 later, to be honest. Um, Christian. That is, you know, ancient Roman satire just doesn't cut it.

296
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:30,940
 Oh, yeah. What are you going to say? I was going to say that during the Cold War, um,

297
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,300
 Christian visited Finland for the president of Finland's 60th birthday and the two of them stayed

298
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,540
 in a sauna till five in the morning, and they came out and they'd resolved a whole bunch of

299
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,900
 international issues. Um, so, um, Christian of came out and expressed his preparedness to support

300
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,260
 Finland's desire to integrate and cooperate with the West, which was obviously quite a radical

301
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,660
 thing for Finland to want to do at that stage. So, yeah, stay up till five a.m. and a sauna with a

302
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:58,060
 Soviet and they will give you concessions. That's a long time to be in a sauna.

303
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,700
 I mean, they might have gone at 4.30 a.m. I actually don't know the start sign.

304
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,140
 So that Prime Minister would have been a whole kekenen, right? Yes. Um, so the good thing about

305
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:14,060
 kekenen is in the 78 elections, uh, he won, obviously. Uh, and they had a thing where they read out the

306
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,980
 vote count on the radio, as in they read out who everyone in the country voted for. What?

307
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,340
 And they did it in groups of five. And so there's like this long standing kind of joke in Finland,

308
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:32,540
 which is like kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen kekenen.

309
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,940
 Can you imagine that? That was been the best radio. Well, not the best, but, you know,

310
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,900
 it's mental. Did they just not have any creative programming ideas for a few weeks?

311
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,460
 I think it was to show, like, show that there wasn't any dubiousness or anything. They're saying,

312
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,020
 right, the here are all the votes we're going to count them all. All right, because you can't lie in

313
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:58,940
 an extra kekenen. It must be very hard to read out as well, because presumably if you lost count half

314
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:05,420
 way through. Yeah. Oh, my god. Imagine we're going to have to start again. Or if they say this time,

315
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:16,620
 definitely, definitely, you know what they say, ninth times the charm. Kekenen kekenen kekenen. So when this

316
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:22,220
 is true about them taking them overseas, so as when finished troops have peacekeeping jobs overseas,

317
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:28,220
 they take a sauna with them, even if the country they're going to is boiling hot. So when they got to

318
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:35,180
 the Sinai desert in the 1950s, they took, they built 35 sowness with, including one which had wheels.

319
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,660
 And in the golden heights, they made sure that both the Israeli and Syrian ambassadors had access

320
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,540
 to maybe, though, you could use it. If you're in the desert, you could kind of go in there to

321
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:53,260
 cool down. Maybe. It's like a waste of water, doesn't it? In the desert. You're piling water into your

322
00:29:53,260 --> 00:30:00,940
 sauna. No, I just think it's kind of like the fact that people in the North Pole use refrigerators

323
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,100
 to keep things warm, to stop things from freezing. That's amazing. So it's kind of like that, isn't it?

324
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,740
 Yeah. That is very cool. There's actually a hot tub in the South Pole, a natural one.

325
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:15,260
 A natural one. Yeah. Yeah. It's basically there's a volcanic sort of area on one of the islands of

326
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:21,820
 the South Pole. And the water is, it's naturally heated. And so people actually go, people who are

327
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:27,260
 stationed there go and actually sit in this natural hot tub. And the Italians over there bring

328
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,940
 their own jacuzzi anyway, because it's like, well, we'd rather have our own one.

329
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:39,660
 The jacuzzi brothers used to make planes and propellers. That was their original line of work.

330
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:45,500
 I guess it's jacuzzi really, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And then one of them had a son

331
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,860
 who was very old and needed, I think, the massage qualities that a jacuzzi would have. And so they

332
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:56,460
 rigged up a very, very basic jacuzzi. Just kind of a length of pipe bubbling through some water

333
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:06,940
 to help his son. And it kind of took off. Like their planes. So in Austria, there's a town called

334
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,940
 Lins in Austria. And there's a health and fitness centre there that has had to deploy undercover

335
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,860
 naked security guards to infiltrate its saunas. Not on the much cover, are they?

336
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,980
 They've got to stop, like, hand keep, hand keep going on in the saunas. So they're employed to sit

337
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,380
 there naked in the saunas. And then if people start fondly each other, they have to be like,

338
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,500
 I don't know where they keep their badge. They have people identity. Oh my god.

339
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:36,540
 Women traditionally gave birth in saunas. Did they? Yeah. Can you stop saying, I know it's the

340
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,180
 way we're supposed to say it? No, I can't. I never will. I never will. It makes me feel sick.

341
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:49,100
 Sauna. Sauna. Women traditionally gave birth in them because the walls of traditional smoke

342
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:54,940
 sauna were lined with sutt. And that had kind of bacteria-resistant properties supposedly,

343
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,180
 which made them a bit more hygienic than... Could just line the walls of a room that's

344
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:09,900
 a comfortable temperature with sutt. So in Moscow, earlier on this year, a man got his testicles stolen

345
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:20,140
 while he was in Corona. Yeah. Wow. He was... He put him down. You put him in the little lockers

346
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:25,580
 and you think he's going to be safe. You've got to put your pound in the locker. Yeah.

347
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,740
 It's a false economy not to put the pound in the locker.

348
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:38,540
 Was it, was it innocent mistake? Did someone else leave their testicles and he just picked up the wrong pair?

349
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:46,060
 Later on walking down the street, these are my... I'd lose feel a bit. Should I have them in?

350
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:52,780
 It might have been... Can you describe them any better? Oh, they're testicles.

351
00:32:52,780 --> 00:33:01,500
 So look, it actually sounds like a really horrible night with this guy. He was... he started out in a bar

352
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,580
 and this woman approached him as I had talking to him and he explained to the new station that was

353
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,980
 infuriating him. We drank a beer together and then she suggested we go to a sauna. They went to a

354
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,300
 sauna and the next thing he remembers is waking up early in the next morning. At first, the only

355
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:29,340
 items he noticed were missing were... What is towel? Seriously, at first, the only items he noticed

356
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:34,300
 were missing were his cell phone tablet computer and some money. It was only later when he

357
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:41,020
 undressed at home that he noticed. Oh my god. He insisted on it. Oh my god.

358
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:48,300
 Do you ever get the feeling you're missing something? I've got my phone. I've got my keys. I've got my wallet.

359
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:56,620
 Oh my god. I know. That's a terrible story. It is really terrible. The new station

360
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,820
 did report though. Do remember that he did chose to go into a sauna with this woman he

361
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:06,940
 been a little bit and the new station reported it. That's not a crime. I didn't feel bad for making

362
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,740
 jokes about that now. Oh man. I know. I really hope he's not listening. I think he's laughing

363
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:20,700
 wherever he is. At every dinner party. Do you have to tell your bowl story. Come on. It's so boring.

364
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:26,460
 Oh no. These guys haven't heard it. Come on. How did he not notice it? They said that it had been

365
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,740
 done by a medical expert. The doctor said that it had been done very professionally. Yes. Wow.

366
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:37,340
 You can get apps that tell you how to do that anyway these days. So, can't we do ever stole this phone?

367
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,100
 This is why it is. They were about to just leave with the phone in the wallet and then they were like.

368
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,500
 What's this at? Oh wow. You couldn't. This is why those ads always tell you to check your

369
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:56,300
 testicles over a few months. Okay time for our final back to the show and that is Andrew

370
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:03,260
 Hunter Murray. My fact is that in British electoral history eight candidates have been awarded

371
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:11,020
 no votes at all in a general election competition competition. And the whistles blown. The gates are

372
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,060
 up. So this fact comes from a book. I don't know if you guys have heard of it. It's called the Book

373
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:22,140
 of Heroic Failures by Stephen Pyle and it's such a classic comedy book. It's the official

374
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,260
 handbook of the not terribly good club of Great Britain and when it was first published it contained

375
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,500
 an application form to join the club and you had to give your main area of incompetence and

376
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,580
 a subsidiary area of incompetence and the club was shut down after it received 30,000 applications

377
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:43,180
 from membership and was therefore too successful to exist. And before that Stephen Pyle the author of

378
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:51,020
 the book was himself expelled from the club for publishing a best-selling book. So this the first

379
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,900
 hero to achieve this was a guy called Lord Gava and he was standing as a liberal candidate in

380
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:03,980
 Rigat in 1832 and turnout was about 66% which was about 151 people in that constituency at the time

381
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,580
 and of the 101 people who voted everyone voted for the other guy. But there's a note in the

382
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:14,540
 electoral records because I look us up and it says Lord Gava was proposed without his knowledge.

383
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,380
 I haven't been able to find any more so he didn't really have a chance to campaign if he didn't

384
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:26,220
 know that he was a candidate. In Ghana in 1992 there were candidates who got zero votes quite a few

385
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,420
 of them even though they'd voted for themselves and so they didn't know how obviously it was

386
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:38,220
 the allegations were of electoral fraud but yeah. So they actually when I'm and said I've got zero votes

387
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,660
 and yet I voted for myself, how is this possible? Were you out of vote for yourself? Yeah you were

388
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:47,020
 alive. Supposedly in old American elections in the 19th century you weren't actually allowed to

389
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,260
 enter the polling building. Does that ring a bell with anyone? Did you just have to make a paper

390
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,660
 or a plan out of your thing and you had to pass it through the bars into the building and there'll

391
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,940
 be all kinds of crowds gathered outside. Isn't that pretty? Yeah I need to check it. You say bars

392
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,260
 it's and that's just reminding me of you do have pubs that are polling booths, don't you?

393
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,140
 In the UK. Because anything can kind of be a polling booth. Normally it's schools all.

394
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:16,620
 Churches? Do you say there was a bedroom? Yeah there's one person who it's there's a polling booth

395
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:22,140
 in the sun's bedroom and they get take the bed out and take all the furniture out amazing just like

396
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:28,700
 a local because they don't have a local pub or whatever I think it's amazing. Kind of selfish isn't it?

397
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,300
 If you're going to do that put it in your own bedroom. Are you going to bother voting? No.

398
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:43,260
 I six year olds really got energized about this election though. That reminds me of the fact that

399
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,260
 the division bell still rings in a couple of pubs in the red line and another pub near Westminster

400
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:53,020
 doesn't it? We should say what the division bell is. Yeah so the division bell which in the House

401
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:59,180
 of Parliament calls MPs to the House to vote. So that's still traditionally rings and still does ring

402
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,180
 in pubs near the House of Parliament. So the MPs who are drinking pints can be like oh whoops

403
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,580
 you daisies got to be at the in the House of Commons and cast my vote in five minute. Apparently

404
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:11,900
 when the division bell rings in the pubs tourists in the pubs think that it's fire alarms and

405
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,220
 frequently evacuate the building. Which is another advantage of going to those pubs. Yeah.

406
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:22,060
 It's a great way to leave. Yeah great way of getting a seat. This is quite a weird thing. Control of

407
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:27,580
 stuff. So if there's a dead heat in an election then it gets just in a general election in a

408
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:32,140
 constituency then it gets decided by either the toss of a coin or drawing straws I think

409
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:38,940
 or cutting a deck of cards. So twice running in 1988 and 1992 the local council has been

410
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,580
 decided by cutting a deck of cards. How weird is that? That's so cool. I really hope it was the same

411
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:51,980
 person who lost both times. This time I'm going to do it. Oh too long. Someone's rigged this deck.

412
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:57,580
 That's like Hong Kong. I got this from I have feelings as James's facts. I got it from our squire

413
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,660
 database. Political candidates in Hong Kong if they finish in a dead heat the election is

414
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:07,660
 decided by luck of the draw from a bag of numbered ping pong balls. I think they have ping pong balls

415
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,580
 in what do we do of that. I think in like the National Florida. Yeah.

416
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,660
 Bad news you've lost the election. Good news you're a millionaire.

417
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:22,540
 I think they have it in Florida and in either Texas or New Mexico there's one place where they do it

418
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:33,180
 from a hand of poker. It must be Texas. Texas old and yeah. But that's a game with skill in it's

419
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:39,580
 they deal one hand in it's New Mexico. New Mexico. Yeah because you couldn't have it would be good

420
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:46,220
 if you could have games of skill like whoever's best at boggle. Probably should be an MP actually.

421
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:56,220
 It's grip chess. Plastic sword fight. That's how we do it. Okay so just on some bad candidates in

422
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:02,860
 elections. Oh yes please. Have you heard of Bill Bokes? He was a Lieutenant Commander in the

423
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:11,740
 Navy and he was also the worst election candidate ever. He campaigned in 28 elections and got 7,700

424
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:19,260
 votes in total. Wow. Which is not very many. He lost his deposit all 28 times. In 1951 he tried to

425
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:25,180
 stand against the Prime Minister Clement Attlee but he accidentally stood in Wolfenstow East instead

426
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:34,780
 of Wolfenstow West. His party was called The Land See Air, Road and Public Safety, Democratic

427
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:39,660
 Monarchist, White Resident and Women's Party. Oh yeah. It was quite racist unfortunately.

428
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:45,980
 But he campaigned against mostly against traffic accidents and in favour of road safety

429
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,740
 and he bought an old voxel which he painted black and white to make it a mobile zebra crossing.

430
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:58,940
 So people would climb over the top of his car across the road. So yeah and in 1952 his election

431
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,820
 campaign involved fitting his car with a mast and a mainsail at which point he was arrested and

432
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,300
 fined for using a vehicle for advertising purposes in the centre of town which you weren't allowed

433
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:14,940
 to do then. Yeah and he said once I am nominated I don't go back to the constituency for one thing.

434
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:26,060
 I can't afford to. He sounds great. There's a great story I really like about a guy called John Wilkes.

435
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:31,740
 He stood for Parliament and barrack upon Tweed. But a bunch of people who heard this

436
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,740
 and they were the opposition they were like no way are we going to allow this guy to get in.

437
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:40,140
 So they sailed up the east coast to Scupper's plans. They basically chartered a boat,

438
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,140
 got into it and headed up to ruin his chance. So they were going to vote against him?

439
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:48,300
 Yeah they were going to vote against him. But he found out about this and he bribed the captain

440
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:55,820
 of the ship so instead the ship took them to Norway. But he still lost anyway. He lost anyway.

441
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:01,180
 Yeah he didn't, despite that tactical genius that he showed. So here's something else from the

442
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:06,140
 Book of Morocco failures. Would you like to hear about Matt Jack Mitten? Oh yes let's hear about him.

443
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,980
 You don't want to hear the other option? No no. All right.

444
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,580
 So John Mitten was 19th century aristocrat and he was extremely eccentric in a lot of ways.

445
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:20,060
 But one of the things that he wanted to do, everyone in his family got elected MP for

446
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:25,900
 Shroesbury. I was just thinking it's just the thing he did. If you if you were in that family,

447
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,620
 he's the Shroesbury House. Loads, loads. So him his father had done it, his grandfathers had it.

448
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,100
 So his campaigning seems to have mostly consisted of him walking around his constituency

449
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:40,220
 with ten pound notes stuck on his hat. And people could just come up and pick them off.

450
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,660
 And someone else would replace, you know, he had an assistant to replace and he knows

451
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:48,620
 that we're taken off. He spent £10,000 doing that, which was a fortune. Yeah.

452
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:53,020
 An absolute fortune. He won the seat by 384 votes to 287.

453
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,660
 Well these people are going cheap skate. Yeah, only the 20.

454
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,180
 And then on the first day he attended Parliament, it was hot and he found it boring.

455
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,460
 So he left and he never went back. Not nearly as interesting as walking you

456
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,860
 out town covered in ten pound notes. That's a weird job isn't it for his assistant.

457
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:15,100
 What do you do? I'm the ten pound note replacer on my boss's hat.

458
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,260
 We don't really have any vacancies for that at the moment.

459
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,980
 That's literally the only thing I can do.

460
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:29,820
 So another 19th century MP who I like is, well, he was from 1784 to 1830.

461
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:36,140
 The MP for Devon was a Tory called John Bastard who was then followed as an MP for

462
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:42,860
 Devon by his nephew Edmund Bastard. But what I like about John Bastard is his name.

463
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,860
 I hadn't thought about that. It is quite a funny name.

464
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:52,460
 Yeah. No Edmund Bastard, sorry, inspired the nursery rhyme Old Mother Hubbard.

465
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:59,420
 So why did they call it Hubbard? Because you can't teach children a song Old Mother Bastard.

466
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,500
 How did he inspire it? So yeah, his sister-in-law was someone called Sarah

467
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:13,020
 Catherine Martin who he instructed to run away and write one of your stupid little rhymes

468
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,220
 when she was behaving badly in the town or something.

469
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,940
 She was going out with it, floundering with the man she shouldn't have been.

470
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:23,340
 So he told her to go away, write stupid little rhymes, she wrote Old Mother Hubbard and that was that.

471
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,100
 Is that inspiring? Someone to write something? He was her muse.

472
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:34,700
 Who's the mysterious other person on your list? That's the Earl of Leicester who the fifth Earl of Leicester

473
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,540
 who was a member of the House of Lords. He didn't say anything for 22 years.

474
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,980
 He was going to speak about capital punishment and then he changed his mind.

475
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:46,780
 So that's all we have. We've turned it into a yaw in the last minute.

476
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:55,420
