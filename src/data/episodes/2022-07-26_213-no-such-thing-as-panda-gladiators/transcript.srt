00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
 (electronic music)

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,840
 (electronic music)

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,080
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,440
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week,

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,920
 coming to you live from Redding!

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,920
 (audience cheering)

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,920
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,160
 and I am sitting here with Annotch Isinski,

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,280
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin,

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,680
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,840
 and in no particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,000
 Starting with you, James.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 - Okay, my fat this week is that the world record

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
 for most Beermats, flipped and caught in one hand,

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,800
 is held by a man called Matt Hand.

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,000
 (audience laughing)

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,160
 - Stunning.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,840
 (audience laughing)

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,200
 - It's incredible.

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,680
 - It just can't be true, tell it.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,840
 - I shall be sure.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,240
 - And it is, we didn't believe it when he sent it to us.

25
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,720
 - And I send you the link to the Guinness World Records,

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,440
 and there it is. - Yeah.

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,520
 - So, guys, I got in touch with Matt Hand today.

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,240
 - No. - Yes.

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,280
 - He is a lovely man, by the way,

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,800
 and he gave me a list of all of his world records,

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,520
 and I sent him some Q&A's and asked him some questions,

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,560
 and he sent me some answers.

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,920
 The first thing I wanna say is, I asked him,

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,480
 "When you brought the world record for Beermat flipping,

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,480
 "did you consider the aptness of your name for that record?"

36
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,480
 And he said, and I don't know if this is true.

37
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,200
 He said, "I actually changed my name to Matt Hand

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,800
 "after I brought the record."

39
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,840
 - No. (audience laughing)

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,000
 - What?

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,320
 - That's why he said, "I don't know if that's true."

42
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,600
 - What's his real name?

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,720
 - He didn't say, I said, "That can't be true."

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,880
 And then he mysteriously didn't reply to my next email.

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,040
 But I put two questions, he answered the other one

46
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,920
 and didn't answer that, so I don't know if it's true.

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,880
 But the Matt is only one T, so it could be that he did,

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,360
 'cause he's a performance artist.

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,960
 Actually, he lives in Berlin now, he lived in the UK for a while,

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,840
 I lived in Nottingham when he did this,

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,680
 and he kind of thinks that breaking a world record

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,080
 is a bit like a work of performance art.

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,440
 He's basically saying, you know,

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,640
 "People wanna make the mark on the world,"

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,080
 and there are lots of different ways of doing it,

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
 and one way of doing it is by getting

57
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,000
 in the Guinness Book of Records.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,840
 - That's true.

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,240
 - And a lot of the things that he does,

60
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,640
 he invites people to watch him try and break the world record,

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,560
 so he had the world record for the longest table tennis rally,

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,920
 for five hours, eight minutes and 22 seconds,

63
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,240
 and he sold tickets for that.

64
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,480
 - Wow, did he sell tickets for that?

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,240
 Or did he put them on sale?

66
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,440
 - I suppose you wouldn't know how long it was gonna last, do you?

67
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,280
 - That's true.

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,880
 - Like if we did a world's longest podcast now,

69
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,320
 on how long people would stay?

70
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,040
 - Well, the doors are locked and we're about to find out.

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,880
 Start the clock!

72
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,400
 (laughing)

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,640
 There was a rash of great catching records in the '80s and '90s.

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,120
 That was a big thing for a little while.

75
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,560
 So there was a guy who dropped a grape

76
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
 from a 38-story building.

77
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
 - What?

78
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,680
 - He had got his friend, his name was Paul Tavilla,

79
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,240
 and he says, I think he may have written this,

80
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,760
 it was launching him into great catching fame.

81
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,320
 It's his website, but 38 stories, a red grape,

82
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,120
 from 38 stories, he called it in his mouth.

83
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,400
 - No, that's amazing.

84
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,640
 - I would argue that once you've got that hired,

85
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,960
 it doesn't really matter if you go hired, is it?

86
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,320
 'Cause it's gonna reach its terminal velocity of a grape.

87
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,960
 I mean, that can only be a few flaws.

88
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,800
 - Yeah.

89
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
 - So, you know, I reckon I could do one flaw.

90
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,920
 If I can do that, I reckon I could do one flaw higher.

91
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,040
 - Is it a sight thing?

92
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,680
 Is it maybe at 39 feet, suddenly?

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,240
 - It doesn't say how many grapes were around him

94
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
 smashed on the ground.

95
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,360
 - Yeah, that's the thing, yeah.

96
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,080
 - They could have dropped 300 at the same time.

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,800
 - That's true, actually, because when Matt Hand

98
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,680
 beat this world record for a number of Beermats,

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,520
 Flipped and Caught, it was 112 that he managed.

100
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,080
 112.

101
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,720
 - Sorry, it's not at the same time.

102
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,960
 - Yeah. - What?

103
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,800
 - Yeah.

104
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,640
 - No one's got hands back.

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,880
 - What? - What?

106
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,720
 - You know what?

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,360
 It does sound a lot, doesn't it?

108
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,080
 (laughing)

109
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,720
 But I suppose that's why it's a record.

110
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,400
 It's like, if I said, you know,

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,960
 if I say, who's saying Bolt ran 100 meters in 9.7 seconds,

112
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,440
 you'd be like, 9.5 seconds, if I said he did it in two minutes,

113
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,760
 you wouldn't be impressed at all.

114
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,400
 - But if you said he ran it.

115
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,800
 - I'd say, why is he famous?

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,640
 (laughing)

117
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,320
 - If he did it in one second,

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,520
 this feels like a one second 100 meters sprint.

119
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,320
 - 100, I'm not sure, that's as tall as your eye.

120
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,880
 - No, it isn't, I don't know.

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,960
 - Very thick Beermats.

122
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
 (laughing)

123
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
 - But he took a lot of times to do it

124
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,800
 is what I was gonna say,

125
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,240
 'cause you were saying about the grape thing.

126
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,800
 He took more than 100 attempts.

127
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,120
 And I said to him, do you ever consider giving up

128
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,920
 after more than 100 failures?

129
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,080
 And he said, failure is a redundant concept in conceptual art.

130
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,240
 - A great quote from a great man.

131
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,040
 (laughing)

132
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,280
 I only looked at Beermats for this.

133
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,320
 - Oh cool, yeah, let's call Beermats.

134
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,240
 - I know a little about Beermats now.

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,840
 Did you know that the original Beermats were for,

136
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,320
 they were coasters for sliding wine around.

137
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,560
 So, and this is I think the first time the word coaster

138
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,520
 was used was in 18th century Britain.

139
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,480
 And it was for moving wine around

140
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,920
 after the servants had been dismissed.

141
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,440
 So, if you're having kind of a posh dinner,

142
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,640
 then at one point you just miss the servants

143
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,000
 and you just miss the women.

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
 And so, there was no one to hand the wine around the table.

145
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,480
 And so, this thing was invented,

146
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,320
 which you still have today,

147
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,600
 which was the thing that slides the decanter around the table

148
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,520
 and used to have little wheels on the bottom.

149
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,360
 - No.

150
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,840
 - The men drinking their brandy

151
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,200
 could just nudge it to the other end of the table.

152
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,080
 And that's why it was like coasting.

153
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,200
 - Like coasting, on the coast of the table,

154
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,760
 'cause it would go around the edge of it.

155
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,360
 - I heard that the original Beermats

156
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,320
 used to be placed on top of glasses.

157
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,280
 And then, because the idea was to keep insects

158
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,280
 and so on and poison out of your...

159
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
 - I don't think it wasn't poison, was it?

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,440
 - I'd been watching a lot of Game of Thrones recently.

161
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,800
 But yeah, and then it slowly graduated

162
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
 to the bottom of the glass.

163
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,480
 - It wasn't so, it wasn't fair.

164
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
 - Was there ever a period

165
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,640
 where it was in the middle of the glass on the side?

166
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,400
 (audience laughing)

167
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,560
 - That is true though, to an extent.

168
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,240
 Is the kind of invention of Beermats

169
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
 comes from German tankers, which used to have lids on them.

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,360
 And you would kind of...

171
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,160
 They were lids on a hinge on top of the beer

172
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,480
 which stopped it spilling, so stopped it messing up the table.

173
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,000
 And you would kind of flip the lid with your thumb

174
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,680
 like you kind of do with milk jugs now.

175
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,280
 - But you still get those in Germany, don't you?

176
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
 - Yeah, yeah.

177
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,320
 And then people would not be wealthy enough

178
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,400
 to have the lids.

179
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,640
 And so the coat is migrated down to the bottom.

180
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,120
 But it's just incredible to think people,

181
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,680
 who was the first genius to do that?

182
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,760
 To look at the coaster and say,

183
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,680
 "I know where that should go instead."

184
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,520
 - Yeah.

185
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,360
 - There's no poison around.

186
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,200
 There are no insects around.

187
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
 I'm gonna try it.

188
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,040
 It's incredible.

189
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,160
 There is a Beermat which orders a drink for you.

190
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,880
 So it's been invented by some German researchers

191
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,760
 and it orders a new drink for you

192
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,600
 when it senses yours is running low.

193
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,440
 - Sounds really good.

194
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,520
 - It measures the weight of your drink

195
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
 and the weight of your glass.

196
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,680
 - Right, yeah.

197
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,800
 - Is it when it's empty or when it's sort of a quarter full?

198
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,280
 - I don't know.

199
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
 - The song was drunk fast to the another something.

200
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,120
 - Yeah.

201
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,960
 And what if you don't want another drink?

202
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,080
 Does it just keep ordering it?

203
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,440
 Sorry, I don't understand.

204
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,640
 (laughing)

205
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,400
 - Do you know one thing that I thought was quite interesting

206
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,560
 which is the reason that Beermats kind of became very popular

207
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,880
 is the invention of refrigeration.

208
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,080
 And so people had ice on mass.

209
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,520
 Like poorer people had ice

210
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,880
 because you could have a fridge now.

211
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,080
 And then that meant that a lot of condensation happened on drinks

212
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,440
 and so that meant the condensation dribbled down the edge

213
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,040
 and meant you needed a Beermat.

214
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,600
 - So a lot of them are made in Germany,

215
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,440
 aren't they?

216
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,240
 I think the biggest Beermat producer is in Germany still.

217
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,880
 And the people who make Beermats,

218
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,280
 they also make the pretend wood circular discs

219
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,320
 that are found in packets of camembert.

220
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,320
 And also the thin sheets of board

221
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,440
 found at the back of some wardrobes.

222
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,080
 (laughing)

223
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
 It's got that, you know,

224
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,520
 it's good that you can kind of do a few different things.

225
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
 - Yeah, it's really clever.

226
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,320
 - I'm diversifying.

227
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,600
 Although I read that and I've never seen a sheet of board

228
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,920
 at the back of my wardrobe.

229
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,280
 - Have you ever?

230
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,480
 - No, I just go straight to Nalia, doesn't it?

231
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
 (laughing)

232
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,520
 - But this place is amazing.

233
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,840
 So this is the cat's group in the Black Forest in Germany, isn't it?

234
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,680
 And they make an unbelievable number of Beermats.

235
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,120
 So it turns out we go through loads.

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,360
 They make about 75% of the world's Beermats,

237
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,600
 which amounts to 5.5 billion a year.

238
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,120
 They can make 12 million Beermats in one day,

239
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,880
 which is so many Beermats.

240
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,720
 And there--

241
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,440
 - That's too many to flip, isn't it, even for this guy?

242
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,360
 - You can, you can do it.

243
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,560
 The website says, the very first thing you see

244
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,360
 if you go to the cat's website is,

245
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,800
 you could argue that we only make one thing,

246
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,520
 a material based on wood pulp,

247
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,240
 but we do do that one thing outstandingly well,

248
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,080
 which they do.

249
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,240
 And my favorite thing about their factory

250
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,960
 is that they have what they call a debarking machine.

251
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,000
 So Beermats are made from kind of pulped wood

252
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,880
 that's like sent through all these processes

253
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,240
 and then can be flattened out.

254
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,240
 And the debarking machine is where they put huge tree trunks.

255
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,160
 And it's like a giant washing machine.

256
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,200
 And they close the door and they just spin it round and round

257
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,680
 and then the bark will gradually come off.

258
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,440
 Which I think is just really cool.

259
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,960
 - Another thing you can do with Beermats

260
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,600
 is you can make little towers with them, can you?

261
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,440
 - Yeah.

262
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,040
 - Yeah, like you put them like her playing cards.

263
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,360
 You can make them on big, big towers.

264
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,840
 And they have world records for these as well.

265
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,120
 But what the sad thing is, if you get one

266
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,600
 that you think is a world record,

267
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,440
 then the only way you can tell is by knocking it down.

268
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,720
 You have to knock it down to get the record.

269
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,280
 And that is to prove that there was no adhesive used

270
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,120
 when you were building it.

271
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,600
 So the world record was 300,000 coasters to create.

272
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,440
 - Sorry.

273
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,120
 - Whoa.

274
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,480
 - No way.

275
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,400
 - Absolute way.

276
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,080
 - How tall is that?

277
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,920
 - Well, if you think that 100 is the height of you and me.

278
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,760
 - Yeah.

279
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,920
 - This was the Chrysler building, that's massive.

280
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,240
 - I mean, I just don't believe that.

281
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,160
 I just flat out can't believe that.

282
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,160
 - I mean, it's the most amazing achievement ever known to me.

283
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,040
 - It's written on the sauce on this piece of paper.

284
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,880
 So it must be true.

285
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,720
 - All right.

286
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,240
 - So it was a Guinness World Record

287
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,720
 by Sven Gerbal.

288
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,560
 - Cool.

289
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,760
 - The Gerbal's famously strong on propaganda James.

290
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,120
 - You're not usually known that.

291
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,640
 (laughing)

292
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,360
 - That would be the thing to rescue the family name.

293
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,200
 I know it.

294
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,800
 (laughing)

295
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,280
 - We're gonna have to move on shortly to our next facts.

296
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,160
 - Can I just tell you one more thing about beer mats?

297
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

298
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,280
 - So in 2004, some Christians tried to find the 11th

299
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,320
 commandment via beer mats.

300
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,280
 So this was a push by a bunch of Methodists,

301
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,000
 the Methodist Church, to find the 11th commandment

302
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,920
 and they advertised for it on beer mats.

303
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,120
 It was attempt to attract the young to the church

304
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,800
 and they produced 250,000 beer mats

305
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,480
 saying, please let us know what you think the 11th commandment

306
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
 should be.

307
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,600
 And it was really controversial.

308
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,120
 So a lot of other Christians said that it,

309
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,440
 we didn't need an 11th commandment.

310
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,560
 There was someone called the Reverend John Roberts

311
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,400
 who said that 10 were enough.

312
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,560
 And actually, if we lived by those 10,

313
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,480
 we wouldn't need this kind of gimmick.

314
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,760
 (laughing)

315
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,200
 But the Reverend who planned it said that he hope

316
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,600
 that people will want to collect the drinks mats,

317
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,000
 discuss them with friends and use the quick

318
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
 and popular meeting of text messaging

319
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,760
 to tell us their ideas, which is sweet.

320
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,720
 And so they did this and there were a list of winners.

321
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,560
 - So there was more than one winner?

322
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,320
 - There were like five winners.

323
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,120
 - Shit, so when do we have to not do?

324
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,560
 - So the 11th commandment is a toss up between

325
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,160
 thou shalt not confuse text with love.

326
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,000
 And this is my favorite, thou shalt not consume

327
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 thy own body weight in fudge.

328
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,640
 (laughing)

329
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,800
 - Very nice.

330
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,560
 - That's a hard one.

331
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,200
 - We're all sinners, we're all sinners, James.

332
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,040
 We've all done it.

333
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,880
 (laughing)

334
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,240
 - I reckon I could get through life

335
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,720
 not coveting my name as art.

336
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
 (laughing)

337
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,600
 Okay, let's move on to our second fact.

338
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,480
 And that is Andy.

339
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,420
 - My fact is that pandas have their own Harvard.

340
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,680
 So.

341
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,240
 (laughing)

342
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,840
 - That's why the silence in the room is true,

343
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,000
 that pandas have their own Harvard.

344
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,440
 So this is from a magazine I read

345
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,560
 called "Delayed gratification quarterly,"

346
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
 (laughing)

347
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,200
 which I kid you not is so good,

348
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,320
 it arrives every three months

349
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,880
 and the news is at least three months old

350
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,440
 and it's riveting. (laughing)

351
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,800
 So they ran a feature all about

352
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,680
 the practice of rewilding pandas.

353
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,320
 You know, when you train a panda

354
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,600
 that's been born into captivity

355
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,120
 and you train it to survive on its own in the wild.

356
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,920
 And they have something which they,

357
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,360
 the scientists who work on this call "Panda Harvard"

358
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
 because they gradually get moved through training camps

359
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
 to wilder and wilder arenas.

360
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,080
 So from the completely...

361
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,520
 - So they start in like panda kindergarten.

362
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,360
 - Exactly.

363
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,160
 - And then they work the way through

364
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,640
 panda primary school, secondary school.

365
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,200
 - Panda six farm.

366
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,040
 - Yep.

367
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,760
 - And then panda Harvard.

368
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,560
 And it's this 200 hectare dojo

369
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,440
 where they do their final training before they go out.

370
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,760
 - It's the wild.

371
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,600
 - It's true.

372
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,240
 - Are you sure you didn't watch Kung Fu Panda?

373
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,960
 (laughing)

374
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,520
 - So the training program involves finding water

375
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,560
 independently, finding natural shelter,

376
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,320
 staying vigilant, identifying enemies

377
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,200
 and avoiding danger.

378
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,040
 And if they fail any one of the elements of the course,

379
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,120
 they get busted back down to panda school.

380
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,320
 So yeah, and if they pass Panda Harvard,

381
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,240
 they are released into the wild.

382
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,920
 And only I think seven pandas have ever passed.

383
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,760
 - Really?

384
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,600
 - Yeah.

385
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,680
 - It's hard to pass, isn't it?

386
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,440
 So because it is very important that we...

387
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,520
 Well, there's a lot of effort that goes into trying

388
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,960
 to make pandas survive in the wild and make them breed.

389
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,480
 And if they're not gonna survive, it's pointless.

390
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,200
 So I think in their enclosures,

391
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,560
 they're given a stuffed leopard at one point

392
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,000
 that's put into the enclosure.

393
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,240
 And if a panda runs up to the stuffed leopard

394
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,440
 and sniffs it, it fails forever.

395
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,280
 (laughing)

396
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,080
 It's in captivity, forever more.

397
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,920
 - But it's not?

398
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,400
 - Yeah, yeah, it's very loud.

399
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,240
 It's done.

400
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
 - But you could learn that, can't you?

401
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,160
 - Well, if you don't show the instinct,

402
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,080
 I'm afraid you're out.

403
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,040
 You have to be able to climb as a panda.

404
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,160
 You have to master the solo climb.

405
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,360
 And if you can't do that, you fail,

406
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,320
 'cause that's the only way pandas can escape predators,

407
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,800
 'cause they're generally quite slow, aren't they?

408
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
 - So like climb, so good.

409
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,080
 - Would you watch, I would watch Panda Gladiators

410
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,920
 like a shot?

411
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,280
 (laughing)

412
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,120
 - But it is hard.

413
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,640
 And that leopard is stuffed full of leopard excrement,

414
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,280
 so it smells like a real leopard.

415
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,120
 - Okay.

416
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,040
 - Yeah, and the eyesight is so bad

417
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,600
 that if they react correctly to a fake leopard,

418
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,720
 they'll probably react correctly to a real leopard.

419
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
 - Yeah.

420
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,440
 - Well, the thing is that the humans

421
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,160
 all dress as pandas, don't they?

422
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,000
 So if you're like the equivalents of the professors

423
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,480
 in Harvard, they're all dressed in black-and-white

424
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,640
 pandasuits that have been smeared with pandapy and feces.

425
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,760
 - There are a lot of people wondering

426
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,240
 what happened to their lives.

427
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,400
 (laughing)

428
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,320
 They were long-pandering closure.

429
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
 But yeah, that's true,

430
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,080
 'cause they're never allowed to come into contact

431
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,160
 with anyone that resembles a human, are they?

432
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,360
 - And they're always watched by 200 closed-circuit cameras,

433
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
 so it's a bit like Panda Big Brother.

434
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,200
 - Oh, God.

435
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,040
 - Would you watch that?

436
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,360
 - I would.

437
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,240
 - Would you watch basically any TV show

438
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,160
 that had pandas instead of humans?

439
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
 - I definitely watched Panda Driving School.

440
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,720
 (laughing)

441
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,600
 - So some of them get really good, though.

442
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,280
 So for example, they were too released in November 2017,

443
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,640
 very recently.

444
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,600
 They were called Bashi and Ying Shui,

445
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,840
 and they got so good that they spent several days

446
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,640
 on the run in the wildest enclosure,

447
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,720
 and their human handlers had to lear them back with treats.

448
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,840
 - There's a thing where they've noticed that a lot

449
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,800
 of pandas in the wild immediately start acting

450
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,560
 in ways that they really wish they acted in enclosures.

451
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,360
 For example, mating is a big thing

452
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,520
 that's problem with in the zoos and so on,

453
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,040
 which they've got no libido

454
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,760
 and they can't manage to get them to mate.

455
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,640
 There's been in China not too long ago in Chengdu.

456
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,000
 They've been testing new methods about how to get pandas

457
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,480
 to start building a libido and mating.

458
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,480
 And one of the things that they've been testing

459
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,320
 is they've been playing pandaporn to pandas on a TV.

460
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,560
 So I would not watch porn if it was pandas.

461
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,480
 (laughing)

462
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,680
 But that's a genuine thing.

463
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,920
 So they have a TV in the enclosure,

464
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,800
 and they've filmed pandas having sex

465
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,720
 and they just have that on a loop with the sounds

466
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,600
 and so on, with pandas watching it,

467
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,920
 hoping that that turns them.

468
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,000
 - I don't think it really works that well, does it?

469
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
 - No, no, it doesn't.

470
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
 - No.

471
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,760
 - They tried loads of different things.

472
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,160
 They don't hardly anything works.

473
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,320
 - Have they tried storylines,

474
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,920
 like a panda turning up who's a plumber

475
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,960
 when her husband's out?

476
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,800
 - Yeah.

477
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,640
 (laughing)

478
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,720
 - She's thinking about a divorce anyway.

479
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,640
 - I don't know who fitted this bamboo.

480
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,400
 (laughing)

481
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,400
 - Another thing they tried was artificial insemination,

482
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,200
 which was pretty bad actually,

483
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,480
 'cause the male pandas had to be anesthetized

484
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,400
 and then stimulated into ejaculating

485
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,720
 with the help of an electric probe placed in their rectums.

486
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,240
 - Look, there's no shame in that James.

487
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,520
 (laughing)

488
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:05,160
 - You know, Ethan passed the and the panda hybrid baby

489
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,880
 we're expecting in nine months' time.

490
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,200
 No panda females are there.

491
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,520
 - I'm Drew Murray, sorry, sorry.

492
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,360
 - No, no, it's all right.

493
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,000
 I think it was a worthwhile interruption.

494
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,240
 (laughing)

495
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,400
 Panda females often give birth to twins

496
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,520
 and but they can't look after more than one baby,

497
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,880
 which is the great tragedy of pandas.

498
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,000
 So they let the other one die, which is really sad,

499
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,840
 but yeah, 'cause they are literally incapable

500
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,240
 of looking after two children.

501
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,640
 They're so not meant to survive.

502
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,960
 But in captivity, the twins get a surrogate mother.

503
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,120
 So there's a person who's dressed up as a panda

504
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,200
 who acts as the twins' mother

505
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,320
 until it's ready to survive in the wild.

506
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,080
 And then it's fine.

507
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,920
 - Wow.

508
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,880
 Margaret Thatcher didn't like pandas.

509
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,720
 Turns out?

510
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,560
 - No.

511
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,760
 - They've just released some documents under the 30-year rule

512
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
 and it's her being asked by some press people.

513
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,280
 Would you share Concord with a panda?

514
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,440
 - That sounds like it's just a random question

515
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,160
 that she was asked by some.

516
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,720
 Would you rather share Concord with a panda

517
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,920
 or the royal train with a llama?

518
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,600
 - They actually wanted her to get into Concord

519
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,440
 with a panda, didn't they?

520
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,280
 - Yeah, they did.

521
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
 - Because Panda had to get to wherever she was going

522
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,320
 at the same time.

523
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,640
 And they thought it would be a good kind of press thing, didn't they?

524
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,280
 - Yeah, and she might have a picture taken with it

525
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,360
 and she wrote back saying,

526
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,800
 "I am not double underlined, taking a panda with me."

527
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,240
 Pandas and politicians are not happy omens.

528
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
 We don't know why.

529
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
 - Wow.

530
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
 How tragic.

531
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,800
 Such a well-loved figure.

532
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,040
 We suddenly find out that my pandas.

533
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,800
 - But it was to do slightly with panda diplomacy, wasn't it?

534
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,200
 So there was the whole thing of handing over pandas

535
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,360
 as presents to the West.

536
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,800
 And it turns out that that stopped in 1984.

537
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,040
 We now have things where if there's a panda in a zoo,

538
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,200
 it's on loan.

539
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,160
 It's like a, and it costs them any country that has them

540
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,960
 about a million a year now in order to just keep

541
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,640
 the panda in their own zoos.

542
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,480
 And that's official.

543
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,760
 Any panda around the world, if it's from China.

544
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,080
 - They all belong to China, don't they?

545
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,920
 - Yeah.

546
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,120
 If they give birth, that baby belongs to China as well.

547
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,880
 - Do you know the first panda that left China left it as a dog?

548
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,280
 - So is that like a disguise or something?

549
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,360
 - Sort of.

550
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,640
 It was this amazing woman.

551
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,920
 This is the 1930s.

552
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,560
 It's actually quite a long time before we stumbled

553
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,000
 across pandas in the West and decided we wanted them.

554
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,440
 In the 1930s, a woman called Ruth Harkness.

555
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,480
 Her husband died and he'd been determined

556
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,960
 to bring some pandas from China to the US.

557
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,080
 And so she pursued his aims.

558
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,320
 She found a baby panda.

559
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,800
 She fed it on like human baby formula.

560
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,720
 She tried to bring it back and get the ship

561
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,120
 from China back to the US.

562
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,600
 But when she tried to board the ship,

563
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
 they said, "You've got a panda with you.

564
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,680
 You can't take a panda."

565
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,480
 And so she stayed with it in quarantine overnight

566
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,160
 and refused to get on the ship without it.

567
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,800
 And eventually they said, "We just don't know what to do

568
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,640
 because the paperwork, it does not allow for pandas."

569
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,000
 And so the panda left as one dog, come a $20.

570
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,360
 And that was the records in China.

571
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,880
 So one dog left China in 1936.

572
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,120
 - That's right, so cool.

573
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,240
 - It is true, actually, that we didn't really know

574
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,360
 about pandas in the West for a long time, did we?

575
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,680
 I think it was 1969.

576
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
 - What?

577
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,040
 - Until then, for about 50 years,

578
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,400
 they were effectively encrypted.

579
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,560
 They were like the Loch Ness Monster.

580
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,640
 Like people knew that they, people were saying

581
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,520
 that they existed, but no one had seen one in the West.

582
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,720
 - But in the US in the 1930s, there was like a panda menu.

583
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,560
 - Sorry, I should've said 18.

584
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,400
 - 18.

585
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
 - 18.

586
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,240
 - 18.

587
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,080
 - 1969.

588
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,320
 Well, we've landed on the moon.

589
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,520
 Now it's time to nail this pandemic once and for all.

590
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,120
 - You can see the great will of China.

591
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,160
 What's that on the great will of China?

592
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:42,920
 - Speaking of panda dogs, have you guys heard of panda cows?

593
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,040
 - This is very cool.

594
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,080
 This is a genuine thing that happens

595
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,120
 amongst breeders of miniature cows.

596
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,680
 There's a certain group of people who,

597
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,520
 because it's a black and white animal,

598
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,600
 try and breed a panda cow, which is to have

599
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,680
 the black and white fur markings

600
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,520
 to match exactly how a panda would have it.

601
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,720
 And there's only between 30 and 40 on the planet.

602
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,160
 And there's a number of animals that they tried this with

603
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,480
 in different various fields with rabbits.

604
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,960
 There's an impossible rabbit that people try to breed.

605
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,440
 And one of those things is in the cow world is panda cow.

606
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
 - So they're not trying to make a panda with a cow.

607
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,720
 Obviously, they're trying to breed a cow

608
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,000
 that has the markings of a panda.

609
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,400
 - So it has like the black eyes.

610
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,160
 It has the stripe right around, which is very hard to get.

611
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,960
 - Sorry, I zoned out.

612
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,800
 Why are they doing this?

613
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,840
 - You zoned out?

614
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,160
 - Just in the middle bit, where you...

615
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,600
 - I think Andy was speaking for a lot of the audience.

616
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,440
 - Jesus.

617
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,440
 - But just why, 'cause it's hard, 'cause it's...

618
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,000
 - Yeah, because it's an impossible task.

619
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,320
 So if you manage to do it,

620
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,840
 it's an incredibly rare miniature cow

621
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,160
 that you can sell for hundreds of thousands,

622
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,040
 possibly if you wanted to.

623
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,840
 So we need to move on, surely, guys.

624
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,800
 - Just one more thing about rewilding.

625
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,640
 - Yeah.

626
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,480
 - And introductions to the world.

627
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,400
 You might have seen the story.

628
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,360
 It's about a granite called Nigel,

629
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,080
 who has just died this year, and he became famous,

630
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,520
 'cause he spent the last four years

631
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,440
 courting a concrete decoy granite,

632
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,920
 which had been put on his island.

633
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,080
 They were trying to lure more granites to the island,

634
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
 and this was a huge effort.

635
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,000
 They put loads of concrete granites on there,

636
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,440
 and they were 80, and he got a girlfriend,

637
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,840
 who was made of concrete.

638
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,680
 And he was...

639
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,600
 The researchers researching him called him Nigel,

640
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,000
 'cause he had no mates.

641
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,800
 I know.

642
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,440
 And he died just as three real living birds joined the colony,

643
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,800
 and he decided he didn't want to go

644
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,680
 and mate with the actual living female birds.

645
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,280
 He stayed with his concrete girlfriend until he died.

646
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,720
 - I think that's quite romantic, actually.

647
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,560
 - It is romantic.

648
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,400
 - I respect that.

649
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,240
 - Yep.

650
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,080
 - There's also...

651
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,560
 (laughing)

652
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,920
 - Well, you're going out with that ballad at the moment, aren't you?

653
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,560
 (laughing)

654
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,680
 - There's also the Blackfooted Ferret,

655
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,080
 which was once thought extinct,

656
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,720
 which we're trying to bring back into the world,

657
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,240
 and there's a conservation setting,

658
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,480
 Colorado for this ferret.

659
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,440
 So it's extremely rare.

660
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,040
 And again, they have this kind of school

661
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,520
 to try and prepare them for the wild

662
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,920
 so that they can survive there.

663
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,120
 And you have to prepare them for predators

664
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,480
 and for mating and stuff.

665
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,600
 And so for the Blackfooted Ferret in Colorado

666
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,240
 at their kind of prep school,

667
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,680
 they have stuffed raptors that swoop down

668
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,480
 on one of the human keeper's arms

669
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,440
 that they have to defend themselves against.

670
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,960
 They also have a robo badger,

671
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,320
 which is a mecanite...

672
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,720
 - I would watch that film.

673
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,960
 (laughing)

674
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,360
 - It's a mecanized badger.

675
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,160
 And they drive it around the pens of these Blackfooted ferrets.

676
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
 And they hope that the Blackfooted Ferrets would instinctually

677
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,440
 try and avoid it and run away from it.

678
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,000
 And it turned out it didn't work.

679
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,840
 The ferrets immediately started riding on the back of them.

680
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,120
 (laughing)

681
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,720
 - Okay, let's move on to fact number three.

682
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,960
 It's time for fact number three.

683
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,440
 And that is my fact.

684
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,280
 My fact this week is that the American flag

685
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,800
 was designed by a 17 year old student.

686
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,160
 And his teacher gave him a B minus for it.

687
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
 (laughing)

688
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,200
 So this was back in 1958.

689
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,840
 This is when America had 48 states.

690
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,600
 - Back when the panda was still a distant myth.

691
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,360
 (laughing)

692
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,320
 - Okay, 1958, there was a student called Robert Heft.

693
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,240
 And as part of a school project,

694
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
 his teacher wanted them to make something

695
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,080
 that inspired them.

696
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,200
 And he decided that he wanted to make an American flag,

697
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,840
 but he wanted to make an American flag

698
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,200
 that had 50 stars on it.

699
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,160
 Because there'd been lots of talk about Alaska

700
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,400
 and Hawaii joining the states.

701
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,120
 So he handed in his project to school.

702
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,240
 He'd re-sown one of his parents' flags with two extra stars.

703
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,120
 And he sort of moved it around so it made sense

704
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,520
 and it was a lovely design.

705
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,960
 And his teacher said, there's only 48 states, you idiot.

706
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,800
 What is this ridiculous and gave him a B minus.

707
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,600
 So he then said to his teacher,

708
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,040
 well, I'm gonna submit this flag if the states get added.

709
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,680
 And if I submit it and we get it,

710
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,640
 made the official flag, will you remark me?

711
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,200
 And he said, yeah, sure, whatever.

712
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,520
 A year later, President Eisenhower was calling him up

713
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,160
 to say, we've made your flag the official flag of America.

714
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,960
 And he had his mark remark to an A.

715
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,780
 - Really?

716
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,620
 - Yeah.

717
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,460
 - Yeah.

718
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,180
 Because I read, which is flawed, obviously,

719
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,500
 that he was marked down for lack of imagination,

720
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,860
 which I actually would agree with,

721
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,580
 because all he did was add to stars to the existing flag.

722
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,740
 But okay, he was adding the new stars.

723
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,980
 'Cause a lot of people did submit their entries,

724
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,980
 didn't they, to Eisenhower, when it was discovered

725
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,020
 that, you know, new states were gonna be added.

726
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,580
 And a lot of the other suggestions are better.

727
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,500
 And there is a book called Old Glory

728
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,420
 with the other suggestions in them.

729
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,540
 - So the question is, who's a teacher

730
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,020
 that would give this boy a B minus?

731
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,220
 What Pratt would do that?

732
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,580
 Stanley Pratt is the name of the teacher, who did that?

733
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,220
 And very kindly gave him an A.

734
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,260
 - But this guy Heft, he also designed a 51 star flag,

735
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,340
 just in case another state joins the union.

736
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,180
 - Yeah.

737
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,020
 - Sadly, he died recently.

738
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,860
 - And all the way up to 60, actually.

739
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,700
 - Yeah.

740
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,540
 - Yeah.

741
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,580
 - So he's kind of thought, well, I nailed it with a 50.

742
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,820
 (laughing)

743
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,660
 - That's amazing.

744
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,140
 - But what are the 60, that's, I don't know.

745
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,260
 - So Puerto Rico is supposed to be the next one,

746
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,060
 if that, you know, they're trying to get enough.

747
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,900
 - Yeah.

748
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,060
 - And then, probably, Russia.

749
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,900
 (laughing)

750
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,860
 - Newt Ginrich, when he was running against,

751
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,340
 I believe it was Bill Clinton, or was it George Bush.

752
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,540
 He proposed that he wanted a new star on the flag

753
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,660
 within his tenure as president, if he made it,

754
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,580
 which was gonna be the moon.

755
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,700
 He believed the, that was genuinely,

756
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,780
 he sat in a press conference, near NASA,

757
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,300
 and he said, I want the moon to be it.

758
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,300
 And I realized the only way you can get it on the place

759
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,260
 is if you have 13,000 votes.

760
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,740
 So we need to colonize Mars and the moon,

761
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,620
 get 13,000 people on there, but he was saying this

762
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,900
 in a serious way.

763
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,540
 - And yet, he still feels like a great loss

764
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,660
 to the presidential race, is he?

765
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,620
 - I mean, I would have voted for him.

766
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,580
 - This is not as uncommon as you think.

767
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,060
 So the Australian flag was based on design

768
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,740
 submitted by a 14-year-old, so.

769
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,300
 - Yeah, and there were loads of design submitted.

770
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,100
 And one of them, I really wish we'd seen this,

771
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,380
 was a team of native animals playing cricket.

772
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,100
 (laughing)

773
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,980
 - So like the wallabies are fielding

774
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,020
 and the ostrich is bowling.

775
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,660
 - The kangaroos holding a one bat.

776
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,500
 - Yep.

777
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,020
 (laughing)

778
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,060
 - Yeah, that was in 1901, wasn't it?

779
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,780
 Early example of crowdsourcing.

780
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,220
 And there were loads of really cool entries.

781
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,580
 So there was one entry that had a kangaroo with six tails

782
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,780
 to represent all six states.

783
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,780
 (laughing)

784
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,980
 Another one apparently weirdly had a,

785
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,340
 what was described as a fat kangaroo,

786
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,540
 aiming a gun at the Southern Cross constellation,

787
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,900
 which seems quite weird.

788
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,740
 But in the end, the thing that won,

789
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,820
 which a variation of which exists today,

790
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,180
 is something that funny different people submitted,

791
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,020
 which again shows lack of imagination.

792
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,140
 So and also they had to split the prize money five ways.

793
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,300
 So they should have gone with a fat kangaroo.

794
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,140
 - Right.

795
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,980
 There is actually, and I think we've mentioned it before,

796
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,540
 there is a flag that has a gun on it

797
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,940
 for a country Mozambique,

798
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,020
 which has an AK-47 on its flag.

799
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,260
 - Yeah, there was a campaign to get rid of it

800
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,180
 in like the early 2000s, and actually the Mozambique president

801
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,700
 said know it kind of represents our past,

802
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,100
 and you know, the struggle that it took to get there.

803
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,860
 'Cause the red on a lot of flags represents blood.

804
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,380
 And especially in a lot of African flags,

805
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,420
 the red represents kind of the bloodshed

806
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,260
 that it took to gain independence.

807
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,420
 And the green represents like the fertility of the land

808
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,260
 and stuff.

809
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,660
 But all those colors mean really significant things.

810
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,100
 - Almost no flags have purple on them

811
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,140
 because purple was such a rare color for such a long time.

812
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,660
 So I think we've mentioned before,

813
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,180
 it took, in the Roman times, only, was emperors?

814
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,180
 - Yeah, emperors, good price, where purple togas,

815
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,020
 because it was made out of snails,

816
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,700
 and it took 10,000 snails to make a gram of the dye.

817
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,260
 It was very, very rare stuff.

818
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,820
 - And they take ages to get into the machine as well, don't they?

819
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,060
 (laughing)

820
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,900
 - That is good.

821
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,820
 So maybe if there's some new countries that come along,

822
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,580
 they might go for purple.

823
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,420
 - Yes.

824
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,460
 - They should, yeah.

825
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,420
 You know, when the American, so the stars and stripes came along,

826
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,820
 when America came along.

827
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,460
 And obviously a star is added for every new state.

828
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,140
 But in, so it was 1793, I think the original flag came about,

829
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,060
 and it was the 13 colonies, and it was 13 stripes and 13 stars.

830
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,500
 And then in 1795, two stars and two stripes were added,

831
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,100
 because Kentuckian Vermont became states.

832
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,100
 And so initially it was supposed to be a new stripe product

833
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,500
 was added each time.

834
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,140
 And it was only in, so of course, then after that,

835
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,660
 and sort of the 30 years after that,

836
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,820
 loads and loads of new states came.

837
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,540
 And I think it was Monroe, President Monroe,

838
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,060
 who said in 1818, we had to stop with the stripes thing,

839
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,140
 because we can't fit that many stripes on a flag,

840
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,300
 and said we'll go back to 13 stripes,

841
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,300
 and then any number of stars.

842
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,140
 - That's so funny.

843
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,260
 - It's good, isn't it?

844
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,180
 We might have 50 stripes on the flag right now.

845
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,300
 - Well, the thing is, they kind of didn't really care

846
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,540
 about their flag for quite a long time, didn't they?

847
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,260
 Really, the only reason they got it is

848
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,500
 because US ships needed one to sail into foreign ports,

849
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,100
 so they needed a flag for that particular reason.

850
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,300
 And it's not the kind of big, sort of,

851
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,060
 nationalistic thing that it is now.

852
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,420
 It was just for that, really.

853
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,140
 And they had a load of different versions at the time,

854
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,660
 as well, for on ships.

855
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,060
 So they had one flag, which was just a pine tree.

856
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,180
 So it's just a blue background, then a pine tree.

857
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,340
 And that was because pine was a major export

858
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,380
 from the US to Britain.

859
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,060
 And a bit like the Boston Tea Party,

860
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,940
 there was a big riot about pine at one stage.

861
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,980
 - Boston Tree Party.

862
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,300
 (audience laughing)

863
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,820
 - That deserve more than that, guys.

864
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,660
 (audience laughing)

865
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,740
 - I don't know.

866
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,340
 - We need to move on, Charlie, to the last one.

867
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,740
 - Oh, I have a flag hero.

868
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,580
 - Okay.

869
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,420
 - It's such a cool guy.

870
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,460
 He was the US flag expert.

871
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,820
 As in, he was called Whitney Smith.

872
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,740
 He was so obsessed with flags.

873
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,460
 The term for the study of flags is vexilology.

874
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,380
 He came up with that word.

875
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,620
 And he got flag for it because it's half-flatting

876
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,460
 in half Greek.

877
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,260
 Vexilum is Latin,ology is Greek.

878
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,500
 - Yeah, I'm with the rest of the world here.

879
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
 - Okay.

880
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,780
 - Well, he said, "I've been criticized

881
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,100
 because it combines Latin and Greek, a barbarism."

882
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,220
 But I say, "I was a teenager."

883
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,500
 (audience laughing)

884
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,780
 And we all do crazy stuff when we're teenagers, don't we?

885
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,380
 (audience laughing)

886
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,380
 And he designed the flag for Guyana

887
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,740
 because he was so keen to know what the country's new flag

888
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,100
 was going to be when it got independence,

889
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,180
 that he wrote to the president,

890
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,340
 said, "What's your flag going to be?"

891
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,340
 And the president wrote back saying,

892
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,180
 "We haven't thought about it.

893
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,780
 "We've been busy becoming independent."

894
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,260
 And he said, "Yeah, how about this?"

895
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,260
 And then they accepted that, that's really cool.

896
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,820
 - But I read that they didn't tell him.

897
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,820
 So his sister reminisced that he had no idea,

898
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,820
 he just sent off this thing,

899
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,940
 which I think he drew a design,

900
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,260
 and his mom knitted it into an actual flag and sent it off.

901
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,820
 And then a few years later,

902
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,500
 the whole family were like, "Oh, that's weird.

903
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,820
 "The Guyana flag looks a lot like the thing that we designed."

904
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,420
 And he wrote to the government and said,

905
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,420
 "That looks like my flag design."

906
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,740
 And they said, "I've been trying to get in touch with you for ages."

907
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,540
 (audience laughing)

908
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,060
 So I read it similarly.

909
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,740
 I read Nelson Mandela when they were designing

910
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,180
 a new South African flag.

911
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,700
 The person, there was thousands again of designs,

912
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,180
 and the person that they went,

913
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,540
 this is the one to go for, fact it through

914
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,740
 so that they could see it.

915
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,740
 But when it came through, it was black and white.

916
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,980
 So Mandela had to send his team out to get crayons

917
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,820
 to come back and color it in,

918
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,620
 to show him exactly the style that's true.

919
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,460
 - That's true, because actually,

920
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,780
 that wouldn't have been a good symbol

921
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,340
 for a nation of Scotland divided into black and white.

922
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,340
 (audience laughing)

923
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,860
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

924
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,140
 and that is Chazinski.

925
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,540
 - My fact this week is that the inventor of water skiing

926
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,220
 started out being pulled along behind a boat

927
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,620
 standing on his head on a wooden chair.

928
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,860
 (audience laughing)

929
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,860
 As is the original water skiing.

930
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,540
 This is the guy called Ralph Samuelson,

931
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,940
 and I think I read this in sports illustrated

932
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,860
 in like a really good long-weighed piece they did.

933
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,900
 But yeah, this is in 1922.

934
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,380
 He was in Minnesota on Lake Peppin,

935
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,900
 which is part of the Mississippi,

936
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,980
 and he just got really into sort of

937
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,500
 putting big planks of wood in the water

938
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,220
 and standing on them and being pulled along

939
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,940
 behind boats driven by his brother,

940
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,380
 and he experimented with lots of different things,

941
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,020
 and he especially liked to ride

942
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,660
 while either balancing on a friend's shoulders

943
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,340
 or standing on his head on a chair.

944
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,500
 So that's what he did.

945
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,260
 - He's like the opposite of a beer coaster

946
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,820
 in that he started the wrong way up,

947
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,180
 and then he ended the right way up.

948
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,940
 (audience laughing)

949
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,460
 - Yes, I think people often call him that.

950
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,060
 (audience laughing)

951
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,860
 - Actually, he started off on an ice boat, didn't he?

952
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,020
 Because that would freeze over a lot,

953
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,980
 and so they had an ice boat that would go

954
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,420
 through the frozen water,

955
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,980
 and he would go on actual skis,

956
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,220
 and then he thought when the ice went away,

957
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,860
 he thought maybe I could do this on the water,

958
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,620
 'cause it's just hot ice.

959
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,620
 (audience laughing)

960
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,340
 - Could I have a glass of tap hot ice, please?

961
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,140
 (audience laughing)

962
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,420
 - With some cold ice in it, actually, if that's okay.

963
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,420
 (audience laughing)

964
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,860
 - And he didn't pace it, did he?

965
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,180
 No, and someone else swooped in and did.

966
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,260
 - Yeah, it was Fred Waller who paced into it,

967
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,460
 and his product was called Dolphin Acquist Skis,

968
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,140
 and Fred Waller also invented wide-screen motion pictures.

969
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,500
 - Oh, really?

970
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,820
 What exactly? - Yeah.

971
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,020
 - Just like Sinorama, Sinorama thing, yeah.

972
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,180
 - Oh, wow.

973
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,420
 - I quite like about Ralph Samuelson is in,

974
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,940
 when you're water skiing, any new move that you do

975
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,620
 is often through the chaos of falling over

976
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,220
 and recovering and getting back up.

977
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,780
 So there are many moves where people tripped over,

978
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,500
 and they landed on their bum, and suddenly,

979
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,140
 they're like, wow, I'm still on my bum.

980
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,900
 This could be a move, and then they get back up to their feet.

981
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,540
 So Ralph Samuelson, as well as inventing this water skiing

982
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,340
 on two skis, he was one day on the two skis going along,

983
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,940
 and the wake of a boat came over,

984
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,620
 and he got launched into the air,

985
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,420
 and one of the skis left his feet,

986
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,180
 and he landed back down on one ski,

987
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,540
 and put his foot on the front of it,

988
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,420
 and suddenly invented the one ski slalom

989
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,300
 that happens on water skiing.

990
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,900
 So it was just, yeah, just all by accident, was he creating?

991
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,900
 - Yeah, and I mean, he invented a kind of water skiing,

992
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,900
 which I imagine exists now,

993
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,780
 just being pulled along by a plane.

994
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,140
 So he actually got quite a lot of publicity

995
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,780
 for a very short period of time in his little town.

996
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,900
 People used to come and watch him do this,

997
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,180
 he would get over a thousand spectators,

998
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,180
 and he would charge admission staff.

999
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,140
 A bandstand was set up for him,

1000
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,140
 and they used to accompany his performances on skis.

1001
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,820
 But then this guy called Walter Bullock,

1002
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,500
 who was a pilot flew into Lake City, which is where he lived,

1003
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,180
 and so Ralph Samuelson said,

1004
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,060
 "Can you pull me along behind your plane?"

1005
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,620
 And he did, and he went at a 60 miles an hour,

1006
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,340
 and the first time he was pulled along behind this plane,

1007
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,700
 it was like a ski plane,

1008
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,380
 so it was going along in the water,

1009
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,340
 and the propellers of the plane blew water into his face,

1010
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,300
 like Bullets hitting him, he said,

1011
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,300
 like hitting in his face, but he's too scared to let go,

1012
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,220
 'cause it's going too fast, so that would be dangerous.

1013
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,700
 And so eventually he was jerked out with his skis

1014
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,060
 and pulled along on his stomach for about 50 feet.

1015
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,140
 And even then he said,

1016
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,140
 "My first thought wasn't for my safety,

1017
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,580
 "but for whether I'd lost my swimming suit."

1018
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,340
 - Oh, yeah, but then it was 1922 when he first started this,

1019
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,460
 and in 1927 he unfortunately broke his back

1020
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,180
 in a construction accident, and he never skied again.

1021
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,500
 But then weirdly, a fall from a tall ladder

1022
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,340
 would later cure his back problem.

1023
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,180
 - No.

1024
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,260
 - That just doesn't feel like something that happens, does it?

1025
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,100
 - No way.

1026
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,260
 - You know in like cartoons where you bang your head

1027
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,140
 and you lose your memory

1028
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,820
 and that you bang it an even number of times,

1029
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,660
 and it comes back, it feels like that, right?

1030
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,500
 But this is genuinely what happened.

1031
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,340
 - Wow.

1032
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,980
 - Fall from a tall ladder.

1033
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,980
 - It's not, we should say, that is not NHS guidelines.

1034
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,340
 (laughing)

1035
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,260
 Have you heard about the Waterskying Elephant?

1036
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,340
 Only one elephant is ever known to a Waterskied.

1037
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,060
 - Is ever known to a Waterskied?

1038
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,580
 - It was in the 1950s, she was called Queenie,

1039
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,420
 and she did it.

1040
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,660
 - Actually, I did know about that and there were two.

1041
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,380
 There was a previous one called Sunshine Sally.

1042
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,340
 - Well, that is insufficient research for me.

1043
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,460
 I just assumed.

1044
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,620
 It's really cool, 'cause it sounds cruel, but it's not, I...

1045
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,700
 - It probably is.

1046
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,500
 - Yeah.

1047
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,220
 You've put an elephant on this side.

1048
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,380
 They're outside of the normal environment, aren't they?

1049
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,220
 - Yeah.

1050
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,980
 - I guess so, but it looks very sweet when you're doing it.

1051
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
 (laughing)

1052
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,820
 - How does it work?

1053
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,620
 'Cause do they go off a, do they go off a jetty

1054
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,820
 or do they start in the water?

1055
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,060
 - They're basically standing on quite a long thin platform.

1056
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,060
 They're not on two separate seats.

1057
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,300
 - They're basically on a boat, aren't they?

1058
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,420
 - They're basically on a small boat being turned on

1059
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,860
 behind a larger boat.

1060
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,860
 (laughing)

1061
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,700
 - Oh, okay, right.

1062
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,340
 - It's not like, it was made, so Queenie's skis

1063
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,420
 were made up of two huge pontoons.

1064
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,900
 So they did look like two giant waterskies.

1065
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,420
 They were kind of welded together, so she could stand up.

1066
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,580
 But she was quite cool.

1067
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,460
 - And she used to go to rallies for the Republican party.

1068
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,300
 - Did she?

1069
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,860
 - Because they have the elephants as their symbol, don't they?

1070
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,940
 - Oh, okay.

1071
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,300
 - That's why, that makes so much sense.

1072
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,420
 So there were protests from animal rights campaigners,

1073
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,860
 and this was in the '50s and the '60s,

1074
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:01,580
 and then local county chairman Edward Flajati

1075
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,140
 was last what he thought about the protests,

1076
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,740
 and people saying that she shouldn't be water skiing,

1077
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,460
 'cause it was unfair, and he said,

1078
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,900
 he thought the protests were a Democrat plot.

1079
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,740
 - Well, actually, maybe they were.

1080
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,580
 - Yeah, it could have been.

1081
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,140
 - So I was reading about, 'cause there's many different types

1082
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,740
 of basic water skiing that you can doing.

1083
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,220
 So you've got water skiing, you've got wakeboarding,

1084
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,020
 and then you've got barefoot skiing as well.

1085
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,060
 And what's interesting is the different speeds you need

1086
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,540
 in order to get purchase on the top of the water.

1087
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,100
 So wakeboarding is the easiest.

1088
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,620
 20 miles an hour is the one that you need.

1089
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,860
 Then there's 30 miles an hour, and that's four,

1090
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,180
 actual water skiing.

1091
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,180
 And 40 miles an hour is for barefoot skiing.

1092
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,020
 So that's where you need insane speed.

1093
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,340
 But then people have taken it further now.

1094
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,420
 So there are records for people.

1095
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,740
 There's a Guinness World Record for people

1096
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,540
 who ski on their hands now.

1097
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,100
 So what they do is they put their legs

1098
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,020
 into the pulley rope bit that you hold on usually

1099
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,540
 with your hands, and then they go down on their hands.

1100
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,380
 And there's a world record, which was set in September of 2013,

1101
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,460
 and that was someone handskied for 2956 feet,

1102
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,820
 which is amazing.

1103
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,780
 There's another world record where someone

1104
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,540
 jumped from a helicopter, 67 feet in the air, landed,

1105
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,060
 and then went barefoot skiing straight away, which

1106
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,820
 you can see on YouTube, which I've seen as well.

1107
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,660
 And the world record for the longest jump ever done--

1108
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,860
 this is on water skis-- for a jump is 312 feet.

1109
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:29,660
 And that is still held by a guy called Freddie Krueger.

1110
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,940
 And I went online.

1111
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,180
 You would have been good at the handskiing.

1112
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,340
 I went online because I thought I've never heard anyone else

1113
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,180
 called Freddie Krueger, and I went to Wikipedia

1114
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,300
 and there's notable Freddie Krueger.

1115
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,180
 He's quite famous for what scheme, when I think?

1116
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,780
 Is he right?

1117
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,740
 Well, there's only three.

1118
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,580
 Well, he's doing good for the name of Freddie Krueger,

1119
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,500
 because there's only three.

1120
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,300
 There's him.

1121
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,140
 There's a guy from the movie.

1122
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,020
 And then there's a guy called Frederick Wilhelm Krueger

1123
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,860
 and Nazi official from the third Reich.

1124
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,380
 So he--

1125
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,460
 No, this will rehabilitate the Freddie Krueger name.

1126
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:57,900
 I know it.

1127
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,660
 [LAUGHTER]

1128
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,060
 Bedford Water Skigging is very cool, though, and it's--

1129
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,060
 so you're really good at Bedford Water Skigging.

1130
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,300
 If you have flat feet, I learned.

1131
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,140
 Which is quite nice for flat feet to be built,

1132
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,140
 because I have quite a--

1133
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,140
 And that your feet are 10 feet long, and it's amazing.

1134
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,340
 [LAUGHTER]

1135
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,100
 But you don't want your toes to go in.

1136
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,460
 It's toes to nose, they call it.

1137
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,060
 But I've got very high arches in my feet,

1138
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,460
 and I always feel quite smug around my flat footed friends.

1139
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,060
 But actually, I would be--

1140
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,300
 I know, it's a weird reason to be arrogant.

1141
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,140
 But a flat feet is much better.

1142
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,900
 And also, you can get a third degree burns from it.

1143
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,740
 So this is an interview with George Blair,

1144
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:41,260
 who was a Bedford skiing champ in the '70s and '80s, I think.

1145
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,580
 And he Bedford skied for three minutes,

1146
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,700
 which is an extremely long time.

1147
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,100
 And you're going so fast, and the friction is so extreme,

1148
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,260
 that he got third degree burns, and he couldn't walk

1149
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,140
 for days and days.

1150
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,060
 And--

1151
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,500
 You're surrounded by hot ice, and yet--

1152
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,220
 [LAUGHTER]

1153
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,540
 You get third degree burns, that's crazy.

1154
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,700
 You know Swan's windsurf.

1155
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,220
 Are they?

1156
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:00,820
 Yeah.

1157
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,980
 Sorry, no, it's not water skiing, but it is windsurfing.

1158
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,820
 So it's--

1159
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,820
 But it is windsurfing.

1160
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,540
 [LAUGHTER]

1161
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,420
 Yeah, they do.

1162
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,220
 They arch their wings over their back,

1163
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,020
 and they can travel at three miles an hour, which

1164
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,780
 is very fast for them, and it's way faster than they could

1165
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,700
 go with by paddling.

1166
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,420
 That's not as fast as they can fly, though.

1167
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,020
 No.

1168
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,460
 No, it's not their best means of getting

1169
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,980
 from A to B, true.

1170
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,260
 But it does save them a bit of energy.

1171
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,860
 And this, I did not know about Swan's.

1172
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:30,100
 They can run at a top speed of 22 miles an hour.

1173
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,900
 Oh!

1174
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,940
 I'm feeling that it's not true.

1175
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,300
 That's the top speed, James.

1176
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,620
 It's not the bottom speed.

1177
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:39,420
 It's the top speed, who's saying bolts very top speed ever,

1178
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,780
 over the course of 100 meters was 23.35 miles an hour.

1179
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,420
 So a Swan could very nearly catch who's saying bolts.

1180
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,180
 Wow.

1181
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,020
 If at the end, if he stuck his neck out,

1182
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,380
 he might actually manage to--

1183
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,380
 [LAUGHTER]

1184
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,860
 It's all about the finish, mate.

1185
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,420
 I think that needs to be really strict rules,

1186
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,180
 because they can't use their wings.

1187
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,460
 I think that's the important thing.

1188
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,100
 You mustn't be allowed to use your wings

1189
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,980
 when you're racing, you're saying bolts on bolts.

1190
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,900
 But if you're running in the 100 meters,

1191
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,740
 you're allowed to wave your arms around

1192
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,780
 and they get the molecules out of the way, actually.

1193
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,740
 I think, well, they go like this, don't they?

1194
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,780
 Oh, that's true.

1195
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,540
 And not great for a podcast, I must say.

1196
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,260
 If you were sort of--

1197
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,540
 if you were doing this and kind of flapping the air past you.

1198
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,540
 Yeah, like a front crawl while you're running.

1199
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,980
 Basically.

1200
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,100
 It must be better.

1201
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,940
 It must be better.

1202
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,460
 Because it's like air is just like very, very thin water.

1203
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,060
 Oh, gosh.

1204
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,500
 Future Olympians are gripped right now.

1205
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,740
 Hey, we need to wrap up, surely.

1206
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,620
 Yakskiing, have you heard of this?

1207
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,660
 No. Yakskiing.

1208
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,620
 So this happens in the Indian Hill Resort of Manali.

1209
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,100
 And it's a tourist attraction.

1210
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,780
 So it's really only tourist that do it.

1211
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,980
 I'm sure the locals don't really do it.

1212
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,220
 But your skier is at the bottom of a slope.

1213
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,340
 He's attached to a rope with a pulley.

1214
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,500
 And there's a yak at the top of the slope.

1215
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,500
 And the yak-- you then shake some nuts at the yak.

1216
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:07,900
 And for some reason, that makes the yak leg it down the hill.

1217
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,380
 But of course, he's attached to you with a rope.

1218
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,340
 And so you fly up.

1219
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,980
 It's like the most amazing ski lift ever.

1220
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,460
 And you've got an enormous speed.

1221
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,540
 And it was a spot invented by a guy called Mr. Dorgy,

1222
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,340
 who has the advice, never shake the bucket of nuts

1223
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,500
 before your tie to the yak rope.

1224
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
 [LAUGHTER]

1225
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,820
 I think that actually is the 11th commandment.

1226
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,220
 I don't think you're doing that.

1227
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,460
 [LAUGHTER]

1228
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,860
 OK, that is it.

1229
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,260
 That is all of our facts.

1230
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,820

00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,180

1242
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,860
 Nosuchthing is a fish.com.

1243
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,260
 We have everything on there from our tour dates upcoming.

1244
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,580
 We have our links to our books.

1245
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,580
 We have all the episodes that we've done over the course

1246
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,780
 of our four years.

1247
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,860
 And just quickly, before we wrap up this week's episode,

1248
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,620
 we asked the audience here in Redding

1249
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,660
 to give us their favorite facts.

1250
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,620
 So we're going to give away a cassette to the winning

1251
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,220
 fact.

1252
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,700
 And please collect it from us at the end of the show

1253
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,540
 in the 48.

1254
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,300
 So the winner, the winner, is just in potter.

1255
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,460
 And we really like this fact.

1256
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:32,580
 It is when Alan Jones won the 1977 Austrian Grand Prix.

1257
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,340
 They didn't have the Australian National Anthem.

1258
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,860
 Instead, a drunk man played Happy Birthday on a trumpet.

1259
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,500
 [LAUGHTER]

1260
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,780
 That's amazing.

1261
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,180
 We'll be back again next week with another episode

1262
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,300
 we'll see you then.

1263
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,820
 Redding, thank you so much.

1264
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,300
 Goodbye!

1265
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,620
 [APPLAUSE]

1266
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,980
