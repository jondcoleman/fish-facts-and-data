00:00:00,00:00:02,(electronic music)
00:00:02,00:00:05,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:05,00:00:08,(electronic music)
00:00:08,00:00:14,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:14,00:00:17,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week,"
00:00:17,00:00:19,coming to you live from Redding!
00:00:19,00:00:22,(audience cheering)
00:00:22,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber,"
00:00:28,00:00:31,"and I am sitting here with Annotch Isinski,"
00:00:31,00:00:33,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin,"
00:00:33,00:00:35,"and once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:35,00:00:38,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:38,00:00:40,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:40,00:00:43,"Starting with you, James."
00:00:43,00:00:46,"- Okay, my fat this week is that the world record"
00:00:46,00:00:49,"for most Beermats, flipped and caught in one hand,"
00:00:49,00:00:52,is held by a man called Matt Hand.
00:00:52,00:00:55,(audience laughing)
00:00:55,00:00:56,- Stunning.
00:00:56,00:00:59,(audience laughing)
00:00:59,00:01:01,- It's incredible.
00:01:01,00:01:02,"- It just can't be true, tell it."
00:01:02,00:01:03,- I shall be sure.
00:01:03,00:01:07,"- And it is, we didn't believe it when he sent it to us."
00:01:07,00:01:09,"- And I send you the link to the Guinness World Records,"
00:01:09,00:01:11,and there it is. - Yeah.
00:01:11,00:01:14,"- So, guys, I got in touch with Matt Hand today."
00:01:14,00:01:16,- No. - Yes.
00:01:16,00:01:18,"- He is a lovely man, by the way,"
00:01:18,00:01:21,"and he gave me a list of all of his world records,"
00:01:21,00:01:24,"and I sent him some Q&A's and asked him some questions,"
00:01:24,00:01:26,and he sent me some answers.
00:01:26,00:01:28,"The first thing I wanna say is, I asked him,"
00:01:28,00:01:31,"""When you brought the world record for Beermat flipping,"
00:01:31,00:01:34,"""did you consider the aptness of your name for that record?"""
00:01:34,00:01:37,"And he said, and I don't know if this is true."
00:01:37,00:01:40,"He said, ""I actually changed my name to Matt Hand"
00:01:40,00:01:41,"""after I brought the record."""
00:01:41,00:01:43,- No. (audience laughing)
00:01:43,00:01:45,- What?
00:01:45,00:01:47,"- That's why he said, ""I don't know if that's true."""
00:01:47,00:01:48,- What's his real name?
00:01:48,00:01:50,"- He didn't say, I said, ""That can't be true."""
00:01:50,00:01:53,And then he mysteriously didn't reply to my next email.
00:01:53,00:01:56,"But I put two questions, he answered the other one"
00:01:56,00:01:57,"and didn't answer that, so I don't know if it's true."
00:01:57,00:02:01,"But the Matt is only one T, so it could be that he did,"
00:02:01,00:02:03,'cause he's a performance artist.
00:02:03,00:02:05,"Actually, he lives in Berlin now, he lived in the UK for a while,"
00:02:05,00:02:07,"I lived in Nottingham when he did this,"
00:02:07,00:02:11,and he kind of thinks that breaking a world record
00:02:11,00:02:14,is a bit like a work of performance art.
00:02:14,00:02:15,"He's basically saying, you know,"
00:02:15,00:02:18,"""People wanna make the mark on the world,"""
00:02:18,00:02:20,"and there are lots of different ways of doing it,"
00:02:20,00:02:21,and one way of doing it is by getting
00:02:21,00:02:23,in the Guinness Book of Records.
00:02:23,00:02:23,- That's true.
00:02:23,00:02:25,"- And a lot of the things that he does,"
00:02:25,00:02:28,"he invites people to watch him try and break the world record,"
00:02:28,00:02:32,"so he had the world record for the longest table tennis rally,"
00:02:32,00:02:35,"for five hours, eight minutes and 22 seconds,"
00:02:35,00:02:38,and he sold tickets for that.
00:02:38,00:02:40,"- Wow, did he sell tickets for that?"
00:02:40,00:02:42,Or did he put them on sale?
00:02:42,00:02:46,"- I suppose you wouldn't know how long it was gonna last, do you?"
00:02:46,00:02:47,- That's true.
00:02:47,00:02:49,"- Like if we did a world's longest podcast now,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,on how long people would stay?
00:02:51,00:02:55,"- Well, the doors are locked and we're about to find out."
00:02:55,00:02:55,Start the clock!
00:02:55,00:02:58,(laughing)
00:02:58,00:03:03,There was a rash of great catching records in the '80s and '90s.
00:03:03,00:03:05,That was a big thing for a little while.
00:03:05,00:03:09,So there was a guy who dropped a grape
00:03:09,00:03:11,from a 38-story building.
00:03:11,00:03:12,- What?
00:03:12,00:03:14,"- He had got his friend, his name was Paul Tavilla,"
00:03:14,00:03:17,"and he says, I think he may have written this,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,it was launching him into great catching fame.
00:03:19,00:03:24,"It's his website, but 38 stories, a red grape,"
00:03:24,00:03:26,"from 38 stories, he called it in his mouth."
00:03:26,00:03:27,"- No, that's amazing."
00:03:27,00:03:29,"- I would argue that once you've got that hired,"
00:03:29,00:03:31,"it doesn't really matter if you go hired, is it?"
00:03:31,00:03:34,'Cause it's gonna reach its terminal velocity of a grape.
00:03:34,00:03:35,"I mean, that can only be a few flaws."
00:03:35,00:03:36,- Yeah.
00:03:36,00:03:38,"- So, you know, I reckon I could do one flaw."
00:03:38,00:03:40,"If I can do that, I reckon I could do one flaw higher."
00:03:40,00:03:42,- Is it a sight thing?
00:03:42,00:03:43,"Is it maybe at 39 feet, suddenly?"
00:03:43,00:03:45,- It doesn't say how many grapes were around him
00:03:45,00:03:46,smashed on the ground.
00:03:46,00:03:48,"- Yeah, that's the thing, yeah."
00:03:48,00:03:50,- They could have dropped 300 at the same time.
00:03:50,00:03:52,"- That's true, actually, because when Matt Hand"
00:03:52,00:03:55,"beat this world record for a number of Beermats,"
00:03:55,00:03:58,"Flipped and Caught, it was 112 that he managed."
00:03:58,00:04:00,112.
00:04:00,00:04:01,"- Sorry, it's not at the same time."
00:04:01,00:04:02,- Yeah. - What?
00:04:02,00:04:03,- Yeah.
00:04:03,00:04:04,- No one's got hands back.
00:04:04,00:04:05,- What? - What?
00:04:05,00:04:06,- You know what?
00:04:06,00:04:08,"It does sound a lot, doesn't it?"
00:04:08,00:04:10,(laughing)
00:04:10,00:04:12,But I suppose that's why it's a record.
00:04:12,00:04:14,"It's like, if I said, you know,"
00:04:14,00:04:17,"if I say, who's saying Bolt ran 100 meters in 9.7 seconds,"
00:04:17,00:04:22,"you'd be like, 9.5 seconds, if I said he did it in two minutes,"
00:04:22,00:04:23,you wouldn't be impressed at all.
00:04:23,00:04:25,- But if you said he ran it.
00:04:25,00:04:26,"- I'd say, why is he famous?"
00:04:26,00:04:28,(laughing)
00:04:28,00:04:30,"- If he did it in one second,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,this feels like a one second 100 meters sprint.
00:04:32,00:04:35,"- 100, I'm not sure, that's as tall as your eye."
00:04:35,00:04:36,"- No, it isn't, I don't know."
00:04:36,00:04:37,- Very thick Beermats.
00:04:37,00:04:38,(laughing)
00:04:38,00:04:40,- But he took a lot of times to do it
00:04:40,00:04:41,"is what I was gonna say,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,'cause you were saying about the grape thing.
00:04:43,00:04:45,He took more than 100 attempts.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"And I said to him, do you ever consider giving up"
00:04:48,00:04:49,after more than 100 failures?
00:04:49,00:04:54,"And he said, failure is a redundant concept in conceptual art."
00:04:54,00:04:58,- A great quote from a great man.
00:04:58,00:05:00,(laughing)
00:05:00,00:05:02,I only looked at Beermats for this.
00:05:02,00:05:04,"- Oh cool, yeah, let's call Beermats."
00:05:04,00:05:06,- I know a little about Beermats now.
00:05:06,00:05:09,"Did you know that the original Beermats were for,"
00:05:09,00:05:12,they were coasters for sliding wine around.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"So, and this is I think the first time the word coaster"
00:05:15,00:05:18,was used was in 18th century Britain.
00:05:18,00:05:20,And it was for moving wine around
00:05:20,00:05:21,after the servants had been dismissed.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"So, if you're having kind of a posh dinner,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,then at one point you just miss the servants
00:05:26,00:05:28,and you just miss the women.
00:05:28,00:05:30,"And so, there was no one to hand the wine around the table."
00:05:30,00:05:32,"And so, this thing was invented,"
00:05:32,00:05:33,"which you still have today,"
00:05:33,00:05:36,which was the thing that slides the decanter around the table
00:05:36,00:05:38,and used to have little wheels on the bottom.
00:05:38,00:05:39,- No.
00:05:39,00:05:40,- The men drinking their brandy
00:05:40,00:05:43,could just nudge it to the other end of the table.
00:05:43,00:05:45,And that's why it was like coasting.
00:05:45,00:05:48,"- Like coasting, on the coast of the table,"
00:05:48,00:05:49,'cause it would go around the edge of it.
00:05:49,00:05:51,- I heard that the original Beermats
00:05:51,00:05:53,used to be placed on top of glasses.
00:05:53,00:05:56,"And then, because the idea was to keep insects"
00:05:56,00:05:59,and so on and poison out of your...
00:05:59,00:06:01,"- I don't think it wasn't poison, was it?"
00:06:01,00:06:03,- I'd been watching a lot of Game of Thrones recently.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"But yeah, and then it slowly graduated"
00:06:06,00:06:07,to the bottom of the glass.
00:06:07,00:06:09,"- It wasn't so, it wasn't fair."
00:06:09,00:06:10,- Was there ever a period
00:06:10,00:06:12,where it was in the middle of the glass on the side?
00:06:12,00:06:15,(audience laughing)
00:06:15,00:06:17,"- That is true though, to an extent."
00:06:17,00:06:20,Is the kind of invention of Beermats
00:06:20,00:06:24,"comes from German tankers, which used to have lids on them."
00:06:24,00:06:25,And you would kind of...
00:06:25,00:06:27,They were lids on a hinge on top of the beer
00:06:27,00:06:29,"which stopped it spilling, so stopped it messing up the table."
00:06:29,00:06:31,And you would kind of flip the lid with your thumb
00:06:31,00:06:32,like you kind of do with milk jugs now.
00:06:32,00:06:34,"- But you still get those in Germany, don't you?"
00:06:34,00:06:35,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:06:35,00:06:37,And then people would not be wealthy enough
00:06:37,00:06:38,to have the lids.
00:06:38,00:06:40,And so the coat is migrated down to the bottom.
00:06:40,00:06:43,"But it's just incredible to think people,"
00:06:43,00:06:45,who was the first genius to do that?
00:06:45,00:06:46,"To look at the coaster and say,"
00:06:46,00:06:48,"""I know where that should go instead."""
00:06:48,00:06:49,- Yeah.
00:06:49,00:06:50,- There's no poison around.
00:06:50,00:06:51,There are no insects around.
00:06:51,00:06:52,I'm gonna try it.
00:06:52,00:06:53,It's incredible.
00:06:53,00:06:57,There is a Beermat which orders a drink for you.
00:06:57,00:06:59,So it's been invented by some German researchers
00:06:59,00:07:01,and it orders a new drink for you
00:07:01,00:07:03,when it senses yours is running low.
00:07:03,00:07:04,- Sounds really good.
00:07:04,00:07:05,- It measures the weight of your drink
00:07:05,00:07:06,and the weight of your glass.
00:07:06,00:07:07,"- Right, yeah."
00:07:07,00:07:10,- Is it when it's empty or when it's sort of a quarter full?
00:07:10,00:07:12,- I don't know.
00:07:12,00:07:14,- The song was drunk fast to the another something.
00:07:14,00:07:15,- Yeah.
00:07:15,00:07:16,And what if you don't want another drink?
00:07:16,00:07:18,Does it just keep ordering it?
00:07:18,00:07:19,"Sorry, I don't understand."
00:07:19,00:07:21,(laughing)
00:07:21,00:07:23,- Do you know one thing that I thought was quite interesting
00:07:23,00:07:27,which is the reason that Beermats kind of became very popular
00:07:27,00:07:29,is the invention of refrigeration.
00:07:29,00:07:33,And so people had ice on mass.
00:07:33,00:07:34,Like poorer people had ice
00:07:34,00:07:35,because you could have a fridge now.
00:07:35,00:07:39,And then that meant that a lot of condensation happened on drinks
00:07:39,00:07:41,and so that meant the condensation dribbled down the edge
00:07:41,00:07:43,and meant you needed a Beermat.
00:07:43,00:07:44,"- So a lot of them are made in Germany,"
00:07:44,00:07:45,aren't they?
00:07:45,00:07:49,I think the biggest Beermat producer is in Germany still.
00:07:49,00:07:50,"And the people who make Beermats,"
00:07:50,00:07:54,they also make the pretend wood circular discs
00:07:54,00:07:56,that are found in packets of camembert.
00:07:56,00:07:59,And also the thin sheets of board
00:07:59,00:08:01,found at the back of some wardrobes.
00:08:01,00:08:03,(laughing)
00:08:03,00:08:05,"It's got that, you know,"
00:08:05,00:08:07,it's good that you can kind of do a few different things.
00:08:07,00:08:08,"- Yeah, it's really clever."
00:08:08,00:08:09,- I'm diversifying.
00:08:09,00:08:11,Although I read that and I've never seen a sheet of board
00:08:11,00:08:12,at the back of my wardrobe.
00:08:12,00:08:14,- Have you ever?
00:08:14,00:08:16,"- No, I just go straight to Nalia, doesn't it?"
00:08:16,00:08:18,(laughing)
00:08:18,00:08:19,- But this place is amazing.
00:08:19,00:08:22,"So this is the cat's group in the Black Forest in Germany, isn't it?"
00:08:22,00:08:25,And they make an unbelievable number of Beermats.
00:08:25,00:08:27,So it turns out we go through loads.
00:08:27,00:08:30,"They make about 75% of the world's Beermats,"
00:08:30,00:08:33,which amounts to 5.5 billion a year.
00:08:33,00:08:37,"They can make 12 million Beermats in one day,"
00:08:37,00:08:38,which is so many Beermats.
00:08:38,00:08:39,And there--
00:08:39,00:08:41,"- That's too many to flip, isn't it, even for this guy?"
00:08:41,00:08:43,"- You can, you can do it."
00:08:43,00:08:45,"The website says, the very first thing you see"
00:08:45,00:08:47,"if you go to the cat's website is,"
00:08:47,00:08:49,"you could argue that we only make one thing,"
00:08:49,00:08:51,"a material based on wood pulp,"
00:08:51,00:08:55,"but we do do that one thing outstandingly well,"
00:08:55,00:08:56,which they do.
00:08:56,00:08:57,And my favorite thing about their factory
00:08:57,00:08:59,is that they have what they call a debarking machine.
00:08:59,00:09:02,So Beermats are made from kind of pulped wood
00:09:02,00:09:03,that's like sent through all these processes
00:09:03,00:09:05,and then can be flattened out.
00:09:05,00:09:08,And the debarking machine is where they put huge tree trunks.
00:09:08,00:09:10,And it's like a giant washing machine.
00:09:10,00:09:12,And they close the door and they just spin it round and round
00:09:12,00:09:14,and then the bark will gradually come off.
00:09:14,00:09:16,Which I think is just really cool.
00:09:16,00:09:17,- Another thing you can do with Beermats
00:09:17,00:09:20,"is you can make little towers with them, can you?"
00:09:20,00:09:21,- Yeah.
00:09:21,00:09:23,"- Yeah, like you put them like her playing cards."
00:09:23,00:09:25,"You can make them on big, big towers."
00:09:25,00:09:27,And they have world records for these as well.
00:09:27,00:09:30,"But what the sad thing is, if you get one"
00:09:30,00:09:31,"that you think is a world record,"
00:09:31,00:09:34,then the only way you can tell is by knocking it down.
00:09:34,00:09:36,You have to knock it down to get the record.
00:09:36,00:09:39,And that is to prove that there was no adhesive used
00:09:39,00:09:41,when you were building it.
00:09:41,00:09:44,"So the world record was 300,000 coasters to create."
00:09:44,00:09:45,- Sorry.
00:09:45,00:09:46,- Whoa.
00:09:46,00:09:47,- No way.
00:09:47,00:09:48,- Absolute way.
00:09:48,00:09:51,- How tall is that?
00:09:51,00:09:53,"- Well, if you think that 100 is the height of you and me."
00:09:53,00:09:54,- Yeah.
00:09:54,00:09:58,"- This was the Chrysler building, that's massive."
00:09:58,00:10:01,"- I mean, I just don't believe that."
00:10:01,00:10:03,I just flat out can't believe that.
00:10:03,00:10:06,"- I mean, it's the most amazing achievement ever known to me."
00:10:06,00:10:09,- It's written on the sauce on this piece of paper.
00:10:09,00:10:09,So it must be true.
00:10:09,00:10:10,- All right.
00:10:10,00:10:12,- So it was a Guinness World Record
00:10:12,00:10:13,by Sven Gerbal.
00:10:13,00:10:14,- Cool.
00:10:14,00:10:16,- The Gerbal's famously strong on propaganda James.
00:10:16,00:10:18,- You're not usually known that.
00:10:18,00:10:20,(laughing)
00:10:20,00:10:22,- That would be the thing to rescue the family name.
00:10:22,00:10:23,I know it.
00:10:23,00:10:25,(laughing)
00:10:25,00:10:29,- We're gonna have to move on shortly to our next facts.
00:10:29,00:10:31,- Can I just tell you one more thing about beer mats?
00:10:31,00:10:32,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:10:32,00:10:36,"- So in 2004, some Christians tried to find the 11th"
00:10:36,00:10:38,commandment via beer mats.
00:10:38,00:10:41,"So this was a push by a bunch of Methodists,"
00:10:41,00:10:44,"the Methodist Church, to find the 11th commandment"
00:10:44,00:10:45,and they advertised for it on beer mats.
00:10:45,00:10:49,It was attempt to attract the young to the church
00:10:49,00:10:52,"and they produced 250,000 beer mats"
00:10:52,00:10:55,"saying, please let us know what you think the 11th commandment"
00:10:55,00:10:56,should be.
00:10:56,00:10:57,And it was really controversial.
00:10:57,00:11:00,"So a lot of other Christians said that it,"
00:11:00,00:11:01,we didn't need an 11th commandment.
00:11:01,00:11:03,There was someone called the Reverend John Roberts
00:11:03,00:11:05,who said that 10 were enough.
00:11:05,00:11:07,"And actually, if we lived by those 10,"
00:11:07,00:11:09,we wouldn't need this kind of gimmick.
00:11:09,00:11:10,(laughing)
00:11:10,00:11:13,But the Reverend who planned it said that he hope
00:11:13,00:11:15,"that people will want to collect the drinks mats,"
00:11:15,00:11:18,discuss them with friends and use the quick
00:11:18,00:11:19,and popular meeting of text messaging
00:11:19,00:11:22,"to tell us their ideas, which is sweet."
00:11:22,00:11:25,And so they did this and there were a list of winners.
00:11:25,00:11:27,- So there was more than one winner?
00:11:27,00:11:29,- There were like five winners.
00:11:29,00:11:31,"- Shit, so when do we have to not do?"
00:11:31,00:11:35,- So the 11th commandment is a toss up between
00:11:35,00:11:38,thou shalt not confuse text with love.
00:11:38,00:11:42,"And this is my favorite, thou shalt not consume"
00:11:42,00:11:44,thy own body weight in fudge.
00:11:44,00:11:46,(laughing)
00:11:46,00:11:47,- Very nice.
00:11:47,00:11:50,- That's a hard one.
00:11:50,00:11:53,"- We're all sinners, we're all sinners, James."
00:11:53,00:11:54,We've all done it.
00:11:54,00:11:54,(laughing)
00:11:54,00:11:56,- I reckon I could get through life
00:11:56,00:11:57,not coveting my name as art.
00:11:57,00:11:59,(laughing)
00:11:59,00:12:01,"Okay, let's move on to our second fact."
00:12:01,00:12:03,And that is Andy.
00:12:03,00:12:06,- My fact is that pandas have their own Harvard.
00:12:06,00:12:08,So.
00:12:08,00:12:10,(laughing)
00:12:10,00:12:13,"- That's why the silence in the room is true,"
00:12:13,00:12:15,that pandas have their own Harvard.
00:12:15,00:12:16,So this is from a magazine I read
00:12:16,00:12:18,"called ""Delayed gratification quarterly,"""
00:12:18,00:12:19,(laughing)
00:12:19,00:12:21,"which I kid you not is so good,"
00:12:21,00:12:22,it arrives every three months
00:12:22,00:12:23,and the news is at least three months old
00:12:23,00:12:25,and it's riveting. (laughing)
00:12:25,00:12:26,So they ran a feature all about
00:12:26,00:12:28,the practice of rewilding pandas.
00:12:28,00:12:30,"You know, when you train a panda"
00:12:30,00:12:31,that's been born into captivity
00:12:31,00:12:34,and you train it to survive on its own in the wild.
00:12:34,00:12:36,"And they have something which they,"
00:12:36,00:12:39,"the scientists who work on this call ""Panda Harvard"""
00:12:39,00:12:42,because they gradually get moved through training camps
00:12:42,00:12:45,to wilder and wilder arenas.
00:12:45,00:12:47,So from the completely...
00:12:47,00:12:49,- So they start in like panda kindergarten.
00:12:49,00:12:50,- Exactly.
00:12:50,00:12:51,- And then they work the way through
00:12:51,00:12:53,"panda primary school, secondary school."
00:12:53,00:12:55,- Panda six farm.
00:12:55,00:12:56,- Yep.
00:12:56,00:12:57,- And then panda Harvard.
00:12:57,00:13:00,And it's this 200 hectare dojo
00:13:00,00:13:02,where they do their final training before they go out.
00:13:02,00:13:03,- It's the wild.
00:13:03,00:13:04,- It's true.
00:13:04,00:13:06,- Are you sure you didn't watch Kung Fu Panda?
00:13:06,00:13:07,(laughing)
00:13:07,00:13:10,- So the training program involves finding water
00:13:10,00:13:12,"independently, finding natural shelter,"
00:13:12,00:13:15,"staying vigilant, identifying enemies"
00:13:15,00:13:16,and avoiding danger.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"And if they fail any one of the elements of the course,"
00:13:18,00:13:21,they get busted back down to panda school.
00:13:21,00:13:23,"So yeah, and if they pass Panda Harvard,"
00:13:23,00:13:24,they are released into the wild.
00:13:24,00:13:26,And only I think seven pandas have ever passed.
00:13:26,00:13:27,- Really?
00:13:27,00:13:28,- Yeah.
00:13:28,00:13:29,"- It's hard to pass, isn't it?"
00:13:29,00:13:32,So because it is very important that we...
00:13:32,00:13:34,"Well, there's a lot of effort that goes into trying"
00:13:34,00:13:36,to make pandas survive in the wild and make them breed.
00:13:36,00:13:38,"And if they're not gonna survive, it's pointless."
00:13:38,00:13:40,"So I think in their enclosures,"
00:13:40,00:13:42,they're given a stuffed leopard at one point
00:13:42,00:13:44,that's put into the enclosure.
00:13:44,00:13:46,And if a panda runs up to the stuffed leopard
00:13:46,00:13:48,"and sniffs it, it fails forever."
00:13:48,00:13:49,(laughing)
00:13:49,00:13:51,"It's in captivity, forever more."
00:13:51,00:13:51,- But it's not?
00:13:51,00:13:53,"- Yeah, yeah, it's very loud."
00:13:53,00:13:54,It's done.
00:13:54,00:13:56,"- But you could learn that, can't you?"
00:13:56,00:13:58,"- Well, if you don't show the instinct,"
00:13:58,00:14:00,I'm afraid you're out.
00:14:00,00:14:02,You have to be able to climb as a panda.
00:14:02,00:14:04,You have to master the solo climb.
00:14:04,00:14:05,"And if you can't do that, you fail,"
00:14:05,00:14:07,"'cause that's the only way pandas can escape predators,"
00:14:07,00:14:08,"'cause they're generally quite slow, aren't they?"
00:14:08,00:14:11,"- So like climb, so good."
00:14:11,00:14:13,"- Would you watch, I would watch Panda Gladiators"
00:14:13,00:14:13,like a shot?
00:14:13,00:14:15,(laughing)
00:14:15,00:14:16,- But it is hard.
00:14:16,00:14:18,"And that leopard is stuffed full of leopard excrement,"
00:14:18,00:14:21,so it smells like a real leopard.
00:14:21,00:14:22,- Okay.
00:14:22,00:14:25,"- Yeah, and the eyesight is so bad"
00:14:25,00:14:27,"that if they react correctly to a fake leopard,"
00:14:27,00:14:29,they'll probably react correctly to a real leopard.
00:14:29,00:14:30,- Yeah.
00:14:30,00:14:32,"- Well, the thing is that the humans"
00:14:32,00:14:34,"all dress as pandas, don't they?"
00:14:34,00:14:37,So if you're like the equivalents of the professors
00:14:37,00:14:39,"in Harvard, they're all dressed in black-and-white"
00:14:39,00:14:43,pandasuits that have been smeared with pandapy and feces.
00:14:43,00:14:44,- There are a lot of people wondering
00:14:44,00:14:46,what happened to their lives.
00:14:46,00:14:47,(laughing)
00:14:47,00:14:49,They were long-pandering closure.
00:14:49,00:14:50,"But yeah, that's true,"
00:14:50,00:14:52,'cause they're never allowed to come into contact
00:14:52,00:14:55,"with anyone that resembles a human, are they?"
00:14:55,00:14:58,"- And they're always watched by 200 closed-circuit cameras,"
00:14:58,00:15:00,so it's a bit like Panda Big Brother.
00:15:00,00:15:01,"- Oh, God."
00:15:01,00:15:02,- Would you watch that?
00:15:02,00:15:03,- I would.
00:15:03,00:15:05,- Would you watch basically any TV show
00:15:05,00:15:07,that had pandas instead of humans?
00:15:07,00:15:09,- I definitely watched Panda Driving School.
00:15:09,00:15:11,(laughing)
00:15:11,00:15:13,"- So some of them get really good, though."
00:15:13,00:15:16,"So for example, they were too released in November 2017,"
00:15:16,00:15:17,very recently.
00:15:17,00:15:19,"They were called Bashi and Ying Shui,"
00:15:19,00:15:21,and they got so good that they spent several days
00:15:21,00:15:24,"on the run in the wildest enclosure,"
00:15:24,00:15:28,and their human handlers had to lear them back with treats.
00:15:28,00:15:30,- There's a thing where they've noticed that a lot
00:15:30,00:15:33,of pandas in the wild immediately start acting
00:15:33,00:15:36,in ways that they really wish they acted in enclosures.
00:15:36,00:15:38,"For example, mating is a big thing"
00:15:38,00:15:40,"that's problem with in the zoos and so on,"
00:15:40,00:15:42,which they've got no libido
00:15:42,00:15:44,and they can't manage to get them to mate.
00:15:44,00:15:47,There's been in China not too long ago in Chengdu.
00:15:47,00:15:51,They've been testing new methods about how to get pandas
00:15:51,00:15:53,to start building a libido and mating.
00:15:53,00:15:55,And one of the things that they've been testing
00:15:55,00:16:00,is they've been playing pandaporn to pandas on a TV.
00:16:00,00:16:02,So I would not watch porn if it was pandas.
00:16:02,00:16:05,(laughing)
00:16:05,00:16:06,But that's a genuine thing.
00:16:06,00:16:08,"So they have a TV in the enclosure,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,and they've filmed pandas having sex
00:16:10,00:16:12,and they just have that on a loop with the sounds
00:16:12,00:16:14,"and so on, with pandas watching it,"
00:16:14,00:16:15,hoping that that turns them.
00:16:15,00:16:18,"- I don't think it really works that well, does it?"
00:16:18,00:16:19,"- No, no, it doesn't."
00:16:19,00:16:20,- No.
00:16:20,00:16:21,- They tried loads of different things.
00:16:21,00:16:24,They don't hardly anything works.
00:16:24,00:16:26,"- Have they tried storylines,"
00:16:26,00:16:28,like a panda turning up who's a plumber
00:16:28,00:16:30,when her husband's out?
00:16:30,00:16:31,- Yeah.
00:16:31,00:16:32,(laughing)
00:16:32,00:16:34,- She's thinking about a divorce anyway.
00:16:34,00:16:36,- I don't know who fitted this bamboo.
00:16:36,00:16:39,(laughing)
00:16:39,00:16:43,"- Another thing they tried was artificial insemination,"
00:16:43,00:16:45,"which was pretty bad actually,"
00:16:45,00:16:48,'cause the male pandas had to be anesthetized
00:16:48,00:16:50,and then stimulated into ejaculating
00:16:50,00:16:53,with the help of an electric probe placed in their rectums.
00:16:53,00:16:56,"- Look, there's no shame in that James."
00:16:56,00:16:58,(laughing)
00:16:58,00:17:05,"- You know, Ethan passed the and the panda hybrid baby"
00:17:05,00:17:07,we're expecting in nine months' time.
00:17:07,00:17:09,No panda females are there.
00:17:09,00:17:12,"- I'm Drew Murray, sorry, sorry."
00:17:12,00:17:13,"- No, no, it's all right."
00:17:13,00:17:15,I think it was a worthwhile interruption.
00:17:15,00:17:17,(laughing)
00:17:17,00:17:19,Panda females often give birth to twins
00:17:19,00:17:22,"and but they can't look after more than one baby,"
00:17:22,00:17:23,which is the great tragedy of pandas.
00:17:23,00:17:27,"So they let the other one die, which is really sad,"
00:17:27,00:17:29,"but yeah, 'cause they are literally incapable"
00:17:29,00:17:31,of looking after two children.
00:17:31,00:17:32,They're so not meant to survive.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"But in captivity, the twins get a surrogate mother."
00:17:34,00:17:37,So there's a person who's dressed up as a panda
00:17:37,00:17:39,who acts as the twins' mother
00:17:39,00:17:41,until it's ready to survive in the wild.
00:17:41,00:17:43,And then it's fine.
00:17:43,00:17:43,- Wow.
00:17:43,00:17:45,Margaret Thatcher didn't like pandas.
00:17:45,00:17:46,Turns out?
00:17:46,00:17:47,- No.
00:17:47,00:17:49,- They've just released some documents under the 30-year rule
00:17:49,00:17:51,and it's her being asked by some press people.
00:17:51,00:17:54,Would you share Concord with a panda?
00:17:54,00:17:57,- That sounds like it's just a random question
00:17:57,00:17:59,that she was asked by some.
00:17:59,00:18:01,Would you rather share Concord with a panda
00:18:01,00:18:03,or the royal train with a llama?
00:18:03,00:18:07,- They actually wanted her to get into Concord
00:18:07,00:18:08,"with a panda, didn't they?"
00:18:08,00:18:09,"- Yeah, they did."
00:18:09,00:18:11,- Because Panda had to get to wherever she was going
00:18:11,00:18:12,at the same time.
00:18:12,00:18:14,"And they thought it would be a good kind of press thing, didn't they?"
00:18:14,00:18:16,"- Yeah, and she might have a picture taken with it"
00:18:16,00:18:17,"and she wrote back saying,"
00:18:17,00:18:20,"""I am not double underlined, taking a panda with me."""
00:18:20,00:18:24,Pandas and politicians are not happy omens.
00:18:24,00:18:25,We don't know why.
00:18:25,00:18:26,- Wow.
00:18:26,00:18:27,How tragic.
00:18:27,00:18:28,Such a well-loved figure.
00:18:28,00:18:32,We suddenly find out that my pandas.
00:18:32,00:18:34,"- But it was to do slightly with panda diplomacy, wasn't it?"
00:18:34,00:18:37,So there was the whole thing of handing over pandas
00:18:37,00:18:39,as presents to the West.
00:18:39,00:18:42,And it turns out that that stopped in 1984.
00:18:42,00:18:46,"We now have things where if there's a panda in a zoo,"
00:18:46,00:18:47,it's on loan.
00:18:47,00:18:50,"It's like a, and it costs them any country that has them"
00:18:50,00:18:52,about a million a year now in order to just keep
00:18:52,00:18:54,the panda in their own zoos.
00:18:54,00:18:55,And that's official.
00:18:55,00:18:57,"Any panda around the world, if it's from China."
00:18:57,00:18:59,"- They all belong to China, don't they?"
00:18:59,00:18:59,- Yeah.
00:18:59,00:19:03,"If they give birth, that baby belongs to China as well."
00:19:03,00:19:06,- Do you know the first panda that left China left it as a dog?
00:19:06,00:19:09,- So is that like a disguise or something?
00:19:09,00:19:10,- Sort of.
00:19:10,00:19:11,It was this amazing woman.
00:19:11,00:19:12,This is the 1930s.
00:19:12,00:19:14,It's actually quite a long time before we stumbled
00:19:14,00:19:17,across pandas in the West and decided we wanted them.
00:19:17,00:19:19,"In the 1930s, a woman called Ruth Harkness."
00:19:19,00:19:21,Her husband died and he'd been determined
00:19:21,00:19:23,to bring some pandas from China to the US.
00:19:23,00:19:26,And so she pursued his aims.
00:19:26,00:19:27,She found a baby panda.
00:19:27,00:19:29,She fed it on like human baby formula.
00:19:29,00:19:32,She tried to bring it back and get the ship
00:19:32,00:19:35,from China back to the US.
00:19:35,00:19:36,"But when she tried to board the ship,"
00:19:36,00:19:37,"they said, ""You've got a panda with you."
00:19:37,00:19:38,"You can't take a panda."""
00:19:38,00:19:41,And so she stayed with it in quarantine overnight
00:19:41,00:19:44,and refused to get on the ship without it.
00:19:44,00:19:45,"And eventually they said, ""We just don't know what to do"
00:19:45,00:19:48,"because the paperwork, it does not allow for pandas."""
00:19:48,00:19:53,"And so the panda left as one dog, come a $20."
00:19:53,00:19:55,And that was the records in China.
00:19:55,00:19:57,So one dog left China in 1936.
00:19:57,00:19:59,"- That's right, so cool."
00:19:59,00:20:01,"- It is true, actually, that we didn't really know"
00:20:01,00:20:03,"about pandas in the West for a long time, did we?"
00:20:03,00:20:05,I think it was 1969.
00:20:05,00:20:06,- What?
00:20:06,00:20:09,"- Until then, for about 50 years,"
00:20:09,00:20:10,they were effectively encrypted.
00:20:10,00:20:12,They were like the Loch Ness Monster.
00:20:12,00:20:14,"Like people knew that they, people were saying"
00:20:14,00:20:17,"that they existed, but no one had seen one in the West."
00:20:17,00:20:20,"- But in the US in the 1930s, there was like a panda menu."
00:20:20,00:20:22,"- Sorry, I should've said 18."
00:20:22,00:20:23,- 18.
00:20:23,00:20:24,- 18.
00:20:24,00:20:25,- 18.
00:20:25,00:20:26,- 1969.
00:20:26,00:20:27,"Well, we've landed on the moon."
00:20:27,00:20:31,Now it's time to nail this pandemic once and for all.
00:20:31,00:20:35,- You can see the great will of China.
00:20:35,00:20:37,What's that on the great will of China?
00:20:37,00:20:42,"- Speaking of panda dogs, have you guys heard of panda cows?"
00:20:42,00:20:45,- This is very cool.
00:20:45,00:20:47,This is a genuine thing that happens
00:20:47,00:20:50,amongst breeders of miniature cows.
00:20:50,00:20:52,"There's a certain group of people who,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,"because it's a black and white animal,"
00:20:54,00:20:57,"try and breed a panda cow, which is to have"
00:20:57,00:20:59,the black and white fur markings
00:20:59,00:21:02,to match exactly how a panda would have it.
00:21:02,00:21:05,And there's only between 30 and 40 on the planet.
00:21:05,00:21:08,And there's a number of animals that they tried this with
00:21:08,00:21:10,in different various fields with rabbits.
00:21:10,00:21:12,There's an impossible rabbit that people try to breed.
00:21:12,00:21:16,And one of those things is in the cow world is panda cow.
00:21:16,00:21:18,- So they're not trying to make a panda with a cow.
00:21:18,00:21:19,"Obviously, they're trying to breed a cow"
00:21:19,00:21:21,that has the markings of a panda.
00:21:21,00:21:22,- So it has like the black eyes.
00:21:22,00:21:27,"It has the stripe right around, which is very hard to get."
00:21:27,00:21:27,"- Sorry, I zoned out."
00:21:27,00:21:28,Why are they doing this?
00:21:28,00:21:29,- You zoned out?
00:21:29,00:21:33,"- Just in the middle bit, where you..."
00:21:33,00:21:35,- I think Andy was speaking for a lot of the audience.
00:21:35,00:21:36,- Jesus.
00:21:36,00:21:39,"- But just why, 'cause it's hard, 'cause it's..."
00:21:39,00:21:41,"- Yeah, because it's an impossible task."
00:21:41,00:21:42,"So if you manage to do it,"
00:21:42,00:21:43,it's an incredibly rare miniature cow
00:21:43,00:21:46,"that you can sell for hundreds of thousands,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,possibly if you wanted to.
00:21:48,00:21:49,"So we need to move on, surely, guys."
00:21:49,00:21:51,- Just one more thing about rewilding.
00:21:51,00:21:52,- Yeah.
00:21:52,00:21:53,- And introductions to the world.
00:21:53,00:21:54,You might have seen the story.
00:21:54,00:21:56,"It's about a granite called Nigel,"
00:21:56,00:21:59,"who has just died this year, and he became famous,"
00:21:59,00:22:00,'cause he spent the last four years
00:22:00,00:22:03,"courting a concrete decoy granite,"
00:22:03,00:22:04,which had been put on his island.
00:22:04,00:22:07,"They were trying to lure more granites to the island,"
00:22:07,00:22:08,and this was a huge effort.
00:22:08,00:22:10,"They put loads of concrete granites on there,"
00:22:10,00:22:12,"and they were 80, and he got a girlfriend,"
00:22:12,00:22:13,who was made of concrete.
00:22:13,00:22:14,And he was...
00:22:14,00:22:16,"The researchers researching him called him Nigel,"
00:22:16,00:22:18,'cause he had no mates.
00:22:18,00:22:19,I know.
00:22:19,00:22:23,"And he died just as three real living birds joined the colony,"
00:22:23,00:22:24,and he decided he didn't want to go
00:22:24,00:22:26,and mate with the actual living female birds.
00:22:26,00:22:29,He stayed with his concrete girlfriend until he died.
00:22:29,00:22:30,"- I think that's quite romantic, actually."
00:22:30,00:22:31,- It is romantic.
00:22:31,00:22:32,- I respect that.
00:22:32,00:22:33,- Yep.
00:22:33,00:22:34,- There's also...
00:22:34,00:22:36,(laughing)
00:22:36,00:22:38,"- Well, you're going out with that ballad at the moment, aren't you?"
00:22:38,00:22:40,(laughing)
00:22:40,00:22:43,"- There's also the Blackfooted Ferret,"
00:22:43,00:22:45,"which was once thought extinct,"
00:22:45,00:22:46,"which we're trying to bring back into the world,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,"and there's a conservation setting,"
00:22:48,00:22:49,Colorado for this ferret.
00:22:49,00:22:51,So it's extremely rare.
00:22:51,00:22:53,"And again, they have this kind of school"
00:22:53,00:22:54,to try and prepare them for the wild
00:22:54,00:22:55,so that they can survive there.
00:22:55,00:22:58,And you have to prepare them for predators
00:22:58,00:22:59,and for mating and stuff.
00:22:59,00:23:01,And so for the Blackfooted Ferret in Colorado
00:23:01,00:23:03,"at their kind of prep school,"
00:23:03,00:23:06,they have stuffed raptors that swoop down
00:23:06,00:23:09,on one of the human keeper's arms
00:23:09,00:23:11,that they have to defend themselves against.
00:23:11,00:23:13,"They also have a robo badger,"
00:23:13,00:23:16,which is a mecanite...
00:23:16,00:23:17,- I would watch that film.
00:23:17,00:23:19,(laughing)
00:23:19,00:23:21,- It's a mecanized badger.
00:23:21,00:23:24,And they drive it around the pens of these Blackfooted ferrets.
00:23:24,00:23:26,And they hope that the Blackfooted Ferrets would instinctually
00:23:26,00:23:28,try and avoid it and run away from it.
00:23:28,00:23:30,And it turned out it didn't work.
00:23:30,00:23:32,The ferrets immediately started riding on the back of them.
00:23:32,00:23:35,(laughing)
00:23:35,00:23:39,"- Okay, let's move on to fact number three."
00:23:39,00:23:40,It's time for fact number three.
00:23:40,00:23:42,And that is my fact.
00:23:42,00:23:45,My fact this week is that the American flag
00:23:45,00:23:48,was designed by a 17 year old student.
00:23:48,00:23:52,And his teacher gave him a B minus for it.
00:23:52,00:23:53,(laughing)
00:23:53,00:23:55,So this was back in 1958.
00:23:55,00:23:58,This is when America had 48 states.
00:23:58,00:24:01,- Back when the panda was still a distant myth.
00:24:01,00:24:04,(laughing)
00:24:04,00:24:10,"- Okay, 1958, there was a student called Robert Heft."
00:24:10,00:24:13,"And as part of a school project,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,his teacher wanted them to make something
00:24:15,00:24:16,that inspired them.
00:24:16,00:24:20,"And he decided that he wanted to make an American flag,"
00:24:20,00:24:21,but he wanted to make an American flag
00:24:21,00:24:23,that had 50 stars on it.
00:24:23,00:24:26,Because there'd been lots of talk about Alaska
00:24:26,00:24:28,and Hawaii joining the states.
00:24:28,00:24:31,So he handed in his project to school.
00:24:31,00:24:35,He'd re-sown one of his parents' flags with two extra stars.
00:24:35,00:24:38,And he sort of moved it around so it made sense
00:24:38,00:24:39,and it was a lovely design.
00:24:39,00:24:42,"And his teacher said, there's only 48 states, you idiot."
00:24:42,00:24:46,What is this ridiculous and gave him a B minus.
00:24:46,00:24:49,"So he then said to his teacher,"
00:24:49,00:24:53,"well, I'm gonna submit this flag if the states get added."
00:24:53,00:24:55,"And if I submit it and we get it,"
00:24:55,00:24:57,"made the official flag, will you remark me?"
00:24:57,00:24:59,"And he said, yeah, sure, whatever."
00:24:59,00:25:02,"A year later, President Eisenhower was calling him up"
00:25:02,00:25:06,"to say, we've made your flag the official flag of America."
00:25:06,00:25:08,And he had his mark remark to an A.
00:25:08,00:25:09,- Really?
00:25:09,00:25:10,- Yeah.
00:25:10,00:25:11,- Yeah.
00:25:11,00:25:14,"Because I read, which is flawed, obviously,"
00:25:14,00:25:17,"that he was marked down for lack of imagination,"
00:25:17,00:25:18,"which I actually would agree with,"
00:25:18,00:25:22,because all he did was add to stars to the existing flag.
00:25:22,00:25:24,"But okay, he was adding the new stars."
00:25:24,00:25:26,"'Cause a lot of people did submit their entries,"
00:25:26,00:25:28,"didn't they, to Eisenhower, when it was discovered"
00:25:28,00:25:31,"that, you know, new states were gonna be added."
00:25:31,00:25:33,And a lot of the other suggestions are better.
00:25:33,00:25:35,And there is a book called Old Glory
00:25:35,00:25:37,with the other suggestions in them.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"- So the question is, who's a teacher"
00:25:39,00:25:41,that would give this boy a B minus?
00:25:41,00:25:42,What Pratt would do that?
00:25:42,00:25:46,"Stanley Pratt is the name of the teacher, who did that?"
00:25:46,00:25:49,And very kindly gave him an A.
00:25:49,00:25:52,"- But this guy Heft, he also designed a 51 star flag,"
00:25:52,00:25:54,just in case another state joins the union.
00:25:54,00:25:55,- Yeah.
00:25:55,00:25:56,"- Sadly, he died recently."
00:25:56,00:25:57,"- And all the way up to 60, actually."
00:25:57,00:25:58,- Yeah.
00:25:58,00:25:59,- Yeah.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"- So he's kind of thought, well, I nailed it with a 50."
00:26:01,00:26:02,(laughing)
00:26:02,00:26:03,- That's amazing.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"- But what are the 60, that's, I don't know."
00:26:05,00:26:07,"- So Puerto Rico is supposed to be the next one,"
00:26:07,00:26:09,"if that, you know, they're trying to get enough."
00:26:09,00:26:09,- Yeah.
00:26:09,00:26:12,"- And then, probably, Russia."
00:26:12,00:26:14,(laughing)
00:26:14,00:26:17,"- Newt Ginrich, when he was running against,"
00:26:17,00:26:22,"I believe it was Bill Clinton, or was it George Bush."
00:26:22,00:26:25,He proposed that he wanted a new star on the flag
00:26:25,00:26:27,"within his tenure as president, if he made it,"
00:26:27,00:26:29,which was gonna be the moon.
00:26:29,00:26:31,"He believed the, that was genuinely,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,"he sat in a press conference, near NASA,"
00:26:33,00:26:35,"and he said, I want the moon to be it."
00:26:35,00:26:39,And I realized the only way you can get it on the place
00:26:39,00:26:41,"is if you have 13,000 votes."
00:26:41,00:26:43,"So we need to colonize Mars and the moon,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,"get 13,000 people on there, but he was saying this"
00:26:46,00:26:47,in a serious way.
00:26:47,00:26:49,"- And yet, he still feels like a great loss"
00:26:49,00:26:51,"to the presidential race, is he?"
00:26:51,00:26:53,"- I mean, I would have voted for him."
00:26:53,00:26:55,- This is not as uncommon as you think.
00:26:55,00:26:58,So the Australian flag was based on design
00:26:58,00:27:00,"submitted by a 14-year-old, so."
00:27:00,00:27:03,"- Yeah, and there were loads of design submitted."
00:27:03,00:27:05,"And one of them, I really wish we'd seen this,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,was a team of native animals playing cricket.
00:27:07,00:27:09,(laughing)
00:27:09,00:27:10,- So like the wallabies are fielding
00:27:10,00:27:13,and the ostrich is bowling.
00:27:13,00:27:14,- The kangaroos holding a one bat.
00:27:14,00:27:15,- Yep.
00:27:15,00:27:18,(laughing)
00:27:18,00:27:20,"- Yeah, that was in 1901, wasn't it?"
00:27:20,00:27:21,Early example of crowdsourcing.
00:27:21,00:27:24,And there were loads of really cool entries.
00:27:24,00:27:27,So there was one entry that had a kangaroo with six tails
00:27:27,00:27:29,to represent all six states.
00:27:29,00:27:30,(laughing)
00:27:30,00:27:32,"Another one apparently weirdly had a,"
00:27:32,00:27:35,"what was described as a fat kangaroo,"
00:27:35,00:27:38,"aiming a gun at the Southern Cross constellation,"
00:27:38,00:27:39,which seems quite weird.
00:27:39,00:27:41,"But in the end, the thing that won,"
00:27:41,00:27:43,"which a variation of which exists today,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,"is something that funny different people submitted,"
00:27:46,00:27:48,which again shows lack of imagination.
00:27:48,00:27:51,So and also they had to split the prize money five ways.
00:27:51,00:27:53,So they should have gone with a fat kangaroo.
00:27:53,00:27:54,- Right.
00:27:54,00:27:55,"There is actually, and I think we've mentioned it before,"
00:27:55,00:27:58,there is a flag that has a gun on it
00:27:58,00:27:59,"for a country Mozambique,"
00:27:59,00:28:03,which has an AK-47 on its flag.
00:28:03,00:28:05,"- Yeah, there was a campaign to get rid of it"
00:28:05,00:28:09,"in like the early 2000s, and actually the Mozambique president"
00:28:09,00:28:11,"said know it kind of represents our past,"
00:28:11,00:28:14,"and you know, the struggle that it took to get there."
00:28:14,00:28:17,'Cause the red on a lot of flags represents blood.
00:28:17,00:28:20,"And especially in a lot of African flags,"
00:28:20,00:28:22,the red represents kind of the bloodshed
00:28:22,00:28:24,that it took to gain independence.
00:28:24,00:28:26,And the green represents like the fertility of the land
00:28:26,00:28:27,and stuff.
00:28:27,00:28:29,But all those colors mean really significant things.
00:28:29,00:28:31,- Almost no flags have purple on them
00:28:31,00:28:34,because purple was such a rare color for such a long time.
00:28:34,00:28:35,"So I think we've mentioned before,"
00:28:35,00:28:39,"it took, in the Roman times, only, was emperors?"
00:28:39,00:28:42,"- Yeah, emperors, good price, where purple togas,"
00:28:42,00:28:44,"because it was made out of snails,"
00:28:44,00:28:47,"and it took 10,000 snails to make a gram of the dye."
00:28:47,00:28:49,"It was very, very rare stuff."
00:28:49,00:28:51,"- And they take ages to get into the machine as well, don't they?"
00:28:51,00:28:55,(laughing)
00:28:55,00:28:55,- That is good.
00:28:55,00:28:57,"So maybe if there's some new countries that come along,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,they might go for purple.
00:28:59,00:29:00,- Yes.
00:29:00,00:29:01,"- They should, yeah."
00:29:01,00:29:05,"You know, when the American, so the stars and stripes came along,"
00:29:05,00:29:06,when America came along.
00:29:06,00:29:10,And obviously a star is added for every new state.
00:29:10,00:29:15,"But in, so it was 1793, I think the original flag came about,"
00:29:15,00:29:19,"and it was the 13 colonies, and it was 13 stripes and 13 stars."
00:29:19,00:29:23,"And then in 1795, two stars and two stripes were added,"
00:29:23,00:29:26,because Kentuckian Vermont became states.
00:29:26,00:29:29,And so initially it was supposed to be a new stripe product
00:29:29,00:29:30,was added each time.
00:29:30,00:29:33,"And it was only in, so of course, then after that,"
00:29:33,00:29:34,"and sort of the 30 years after that,"
00:29:34,00:29:36,loads and loads of new states came.
00:29:36,00:29:41,"And I think it was Monroe, President Monroe,"
00:29:41,00:29:45,"who said in 1818, we had to stop with the stripes thing,"
00:29:45,00:29:47,"because we can't fit that many stripes on a flag,"
00:29:47,00:29:49,"and said we'll go back to 13 stripes,"
00:29:49,00:29:51,and then any number of stars.
00:29:51,00:29:52,- That's so funny.
00:29:52,00:29:53,"- It's good, isn't it?"
00:29:53,00:29:55,We might have 50 stripes on the flag right now.
00:29:55,00:29:57,"- Well, the thing is, they kind of didn't really care"
00:29:57,00:29:59,"about their flag for quite a long time, didn't they?"
00:29:59,00:30:01,"Really, the only reason they got it is"
00:30:01,00:30:04,"because US ships needed one to sail into foreign ports,"
00:30:04,00:30:07,so they needed a flag for that particular reason.
00:30:07,00:30:09,"And it's not the kind of big, sort of,"
00:30:09,00:30:11,nationalistic thing that it is now.
00:30:11,00:30:13,"It was just for that, really."
00:30:13,00:30:15,"And they had a load of different versions at the time,"
00:30:15,00:30:16,"as well, for on ships."
00:30:16,00:30:19,"So they had one flag, which was just a pine tree."
00:30:19,00:30:21,"So it's just a blue background, then a pine tree."
00:30:21,00:30:23,And that was because pine was a major export
00:30:23,00:30:25,from the US to Britain.
00:30:25,00:30:28,"And a bit like the Boston Tea Party,"
00:30:28,00:30:30,there was a big riot about pine at one stage.
00:30:30,00:30:31,- Boston Tree Party.
00:30:31,00:30:35,(audience laughing)
00:30:35,00:30:36,"- That deserve more than that, guys."
00:30:36,00:30:38,(audience laughing)
00:30:38,00:30:39,- I don't know.
00:30:39,00:30:41,"- We need to move on, Charlie, to the last one."
00:30:41,00:30:42,"- Oh, I have a flag hero."
00:30:42,00:30:43,- Okay.
00:30:43,00:30:44,- It's such a cool guy.
00:30:44,00:30:46,He was the US flag expert.
00:30:46,00:30:48,"As in, he was called Whitney Smith."
00:30:48,00:30:50,He was so obsessed with flags.
00:30:50,00:30:53,The term for the study of flags is vexilology.
00:30:53,00:30:55,He came up with that word.
00:30:55,00:30:57,And he got flag for it because it's half-flatting
00:30:57,00:30:58,in half Greek.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"Vexilum is Latin,ology is Greek."
00:31:00,00:31:02,"- Yeah, I'm with the rest of the world here."
00:31:02,00:31:03,- Okay.
00:31:03,00:31:04,"- Well, he said, ""I've been criticized"
00:31:04,00:31:07,"because it combines Latin and Greek, a barbarism."""
00:31:07,00:31:09,"But I say, ""I was a teenager."""
00:31:09,00:31:10,(audience laughing)
00:31:10,00:31:12,"And we all do crazy stuff when we're teenagers, don't we?"
00:31:12,00:31:14,(audience laughing)
00:31:14,00:31:16,And he designed the flag for Guyana
00:31:16,00:31:18,because he was so keen to know what the country's new flag
00:31:18,00:31:20,"was going to be when it got independence,"
00:31:20,00:31:21,"that he wrote to the president,"
00:31:21,00:31:22,"said, ""What's your flag going to be?"""
00:31:22,00:31:23,"And the president wrote back saying,"
00:31:23,00:31:24,"""We haven't thought about it."
00:31:24,00:31:25,"""We've been busy becoming independent."""
00:31:25,00:31:28,"And he said, ""Yeah, how about this?"""
00:31:28,00:31:31,"And then they accepted that, that's really cool."
00:31:31,00:31:32,- But I read that they didn't tell him.
00:31:32,00:31:35,"So his sister reminisced that he had no idea,"
00:31:35,00:31:36,"he just sent off this thing,"
00:31:36,00:31:38,"which I think he drew a design,"
00:31:38,00:31:42,and his mom knitted it into an actual flag and sent it off.
00:31:42,00:31:43,"And then a few years later,"
00:31:43,00:31:45,"the whole family were like, ""Oh, that's weird."
00:31:45,00:31:48,"""The Guyana flag looks a lot like the thing that we designed."""
00:31:48,00:31:50,"And he wrote to the government and said,"
00:31:50,00:31:51,"""That looks like my flag design."""
00:31:51,00:31:53,"And they said, ""I've been trying to get in touch with you for ages."""
00:31:53,00:31:55,(audience laughing)
00:31:55,00:31:57,So I read it similarly.
00:31:57,00:31:59,I read Nelson Mandela when they were designing
00:31:59,00:32:01,a new South African flag.
00:32:01,00:32:03,"The person, there was thousands again of designs,"
00:32:03,00:32:05,"and the person that they went,"
00:32:05,00:32:07,"this is the one to go for, fact it through"
00:32:07,00:32:08,so that they could see it.
00:32:08,00:32:10,"But when it came through, it was black and white."
00:32:10,00:32:13,So Mandela had to send his team out to get crayons
00:32:13,00:32:15,"to come back and color it in,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,to show him exactly the style that's true.
00:32:17,00:32:18,"- That's true, because actually,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,that wouldn't have been a good symbol
00:32:19,00:32:22,for a nation of Scotland divided into black and white.
00:32:22,00:32:26,(audience laughing)
00:32:26,00:32:30,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:32:30,00:32:33,and that is Chazinski.
00:32:33,00:32:36,- My fact this week is that the inventor of water skiing
00:32:36,00:32:39,started out being pulled along behind a boat
00:32:39,00:32:41,standing on his head on a wooden chair.
00:32:41,00:32:42,(audience laughing)
00:32:42,00:32:44,As is the original water skiing.
00:32:44,00:32:46,"This is the guy called Ralph Samuelson,"
00:32:46,00:32:48,and I think I read this in sports illustrated
00:32:48,00:32:50,in like a really good long-weighed piece they did.
00:32:50,00:32:52,"But yeah, this is in 1922."
00:32:52,00:32:55,"He was in Minnesota on Lake Peppin,"
00:32:55,00:32:56,"which is part of the Mississippi,"
00:32:56,00:32:58,and he just got really into sort of
00:32:58,00:33:00,putting big planks of wood in the water
00:33:00,00:33:02,and standing on them and being pulled along
00:33:02,00:33:03,"behind boats driven by his brother,"
00:33:03,00:33:06,"and he experimented with lots of different things,"
00:33:06,00:33:08,and he especially liked to ride
00:33:08,00:33:10,while either balancing on a friend's shoulders
00:33:10,00:33:13,or standing on his head on a chair.
00:33:13,00:33:14,So that's what he did.
00:33:14,00:33:16,- He's like the opposite of a beer coaster
00:33:16,00:33:17,"in that he started the wrong way up,"
00:33:17,00:33:19,and then he ended the right way up.
00:33:19,00:33:20,(audience laughing)
00:33:20,00:33:22,"- Yes, I think people often call him that."
00:33:22,00:33:24,(audience laughing)
00:33:24,00:33:26,"- Actually, he started off on an ice boat, didn't he?"
00:33:26,00:33:29,"Because that would freeze over a lot,"
00:33:29,00:33:30,and so they had an ice boat that would go
00:33:30,00:33:33,"through the frozen water,"
00:33:33,00:33:34,"and he would go on actual skis,"
00:33:34,00:33:37,"and then he thought when the ice went away,"
00:33:37,00:33:39,"he thought maybe I could do this on the water,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,'cause it's just hot ice.
00:33:41,00:33:44,(audience laughing)
00:33:44,00:33:48,"- Could I have a glass of tap hot ice, please?"
00:33:49,00:33:50,(audience laughing)
00:33:50,00:33:52,"- With some cold ice in it, actually, if that's okay."
00:33:52,00:33:54,(audience laughing)
00:33:54,00:33:55,"- And he didn't pace it, did he?"
00:33:55,00:33:58,"No, and someone else swooped in and did."
00:33:58,00:34:00,"- Yeah, it was Fred Waller who paced into it,"
00:34:00,00:34:03,"and his product was called Dolphin Acquist Skis,"
00:34:03,00:34:07,and Fred Waller also invented wide-screen motion pictures.
00:34:07,00:34:08,"- Oh, really?"
00:34:08,00:34:09,What exactly? - Yeah.
00:34:09,00:34:12,"- Just like Sinorama, Sinorama thing, yeah."
00:34:12,00:34:13,"- Oh, wow."
00:34:13,00:34:16,"- I quite like about Ralph Samuelson is in,"
00:34:16,00:34:19,"when you're water skiing, any new move that you do"
00:34:19,00:34:22,is often through the chaos of falling over
00:34:22,00:34:24,and recovering and getting back up.
00:34:24,00:34:27,"So there are many moves where people tripped over,"
00:34:27,00:34:30,"and they landed on their bum, and suddenly,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,"they're like, wow, I'm still on my bum."
00:34:32,00:34:34,"This could be a move, and then they get back up to their feet."
00:34:34,00:34:38,"So Ralph Samuelson, as well as inventing this water skiing"
00:34:38,00:34:42,"on two skis, he was one day on the two skis going along,"
00:34:42,00:34:43,"and the wake of a boat came over,"
00:34:43,00:34:45,"and he got launched into the air,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,"and one of the skis left his feet,"
00:34:48,00:34:50,"and he landed back down on one ski,"
00:34:50,00:34:52,"and put his foot on the front of it,"
00:34:52,00:34:55,and suddenly invented the one ski slalom
00:34:55,00:34:57,that happens on water skiing.
00:34:57,00:35:00,"So it was just, yeah, just all by accident, was he creating?"
00:35:00,00:35:03,"- Yeah, and I mean, he invented a kind of water skiing,"
00:35:03,00:35:04,"which I imagine exists now,"
00:35:04,00:35:06,just being pulled along by a plane.
00:35:06,00:35:10,So he actually got quite a lot of publicity
00:35:10,00:35:12,for a very short period of time in his little town.
00:35:12,00:35:14,"People used to come and watch him do this,"
00:35:14,00:35:17,"he would get over a thousand spectators,"
00:35:17,00:35:20,and he would charge admission staff.
00:35:20,00:35:22,"A bandstand was set up for him,"
00:35:22,00:35:25,and they used to accompany his performances on skis.
00:35:25,00:35:26,"But then this guy called Walter Bullock,"
00:35:26,00:35:30,"who was a pilot flew into Lake City, which is where he lived,"
00:35:30,00:35:33,"and so Ralph Samuelson said,"
00:35:33,00:35:35,"""Can you pull me along behind your plane?"""
00:35:35,00:35:37,"And he did, and he went at a 60 miles an hour,"
00:35:37,00:35:40,"and the first time he was pulled along behind this plane,"
00:35:40,00:35:41,"it was like a ski plane,"
00:35:41,00:35:43,"so it was going along in the water,"
00:35:43,00:35:46,"and the propellers of the plane blew water into his face,"
00:35:46,00:35:48,"like Bullets hitting him, he said,"
00:35:48,00:35:50,"like hitting in his face, but he's too scared to let go,"
00:35:50,00:35:53,"'cause it's going too fast, so that would be dangerous."
00:35:53,00:35:55,And so eventually he was jerked out with his skis
00:35:55,00:35:59,and pulled along on his stomach for about 50 feet.
00:35:59,00:36:00,"And even then he said,"
00:36:00,00:36:02,"""My first thought wasn't for my safety,"
00:36:02,00:36:04,"""but for whether I'd lost my swimming suit."""
00:36:04,00:36:08,"- Oh, yeah, but then it was 1922 when he first started this,"
00:36:08,00:36:11,and in 1927 he unfortunately broke his back
00:36:11,00:36:15,"in a construction accident, and he never skied again."
00:36:15,00:36:17,"But then weirdly, a fall from a tall ladder"
00:36:17,00:36:19,would later cure his back problem.
00:36:19,00:36:20,- No.
00:36:20,00:36:24,"- That just doesn't feel like something that happens, does it?"
00:36:24,00:36:25,- No way.
00:36:25,00:36:27,- You know in like cartoons where you bang your head
00:36:27,00:36:28,and you lose your memory
00:36:28,00:36:29,"and that you bang it an even number of times,"
00:36:29,00:36:31,"and it comes back, it feels like that, right?"
00:36:31,00:36:33,But this is genuinely what happened.
00:36:33,00:36:34,- Wow.
00:36:34,00:36:35,- Fall from a tall ladder.
00:36:35,00:36:38,"- It's not, we should say, that is not NHS guidelines."
00:36:38,00:36:40,(laughing)
00:36:40,00:36:42,Have you heard about the Waterskying Elephant?
00:36:42,00:36:44,Only one elephant is ever known to a Waterskied.
00:36:44,00:36:46,- Is ever known to a Waterskied?
00:36:46,00:36:49,"- It was in the 1950s, she was called Queenie,"
00:36:49,00:36:50,and she did it.
00:36:50,00:36:52,"- Actually, I did know about that and there were two."
00:36:52,00:36:55,There was a previous one called Sunshine Sally.
00:36:55,00:36:58,"- Well, that is insufficient research for me."
00:36:58,00:36:59,I just assumed.
00:36:59,00:37:03,"It's really cool, 'cause it sounds cruel, but it's not, I..."
00:37:03,00:37:04,- It probably is.
00:37:04,00:37:05,- Yeah.
00:37:05,00:37:08,You've put an elephant on this side.
00:37:08,00:37:10,"They're outside of the normal environment, aren't they?"
00:37:10,00:37:11,- Yeah.
00:37:11,00:37:13,"- I guess so, but it looks very sweet when you're doing it."
00:37:13,00:37:14,(laughing)
00:37:14,00:37:15,- How does it work?
00:37:15,00:37:18,"'Cause do they go off a, do they go off a jetty"
00:37:18,00:37:19,or do they start in the water?
00:37:19,00:37:22,- They're basically standing on quite a long thin platform.
00:37:22,00:37:23,They're not on two separate seats.
00:37:23,00:37:24,"- They're basically on a boat, aren't they?"
00:37:24,00:37:26,- They're basically on a small boat being turned on
00:37:26,00:37:27,behind a larger boat.
00:37:27,00:37:28,(laughing)
00:37:28,00:37:29,"- Oh, okay, right."
00:37:29,00:37:33,"- It's not like, it was made, so Queenie's skis"
00:37:33,00:37:35,were made up of two huge pontoons.
00:37:35,00:37:37,So they did look like two giant waterskies.
00:37:37,00:37:40,"They were kind of welded together, so she could stand up."
00:37:40,00:37:41,But she was quite cool.
00:37:41,00:37:44,- And she used to go to rallies for the Republican party.
00:37:44,00:37:45,- Did she?
00:37:45,00:37:47,"- Because they have the elephants as their symbol, don't they?"
00:37:47,00:37:48,"- Oh, okay."
00:37:48,00:37:51,"- That's why, that makes so much sense."
00:37:51,00:37:54,"So there were protests from animal rights campaigners,"
00:37:54,00:37:56,"and this was in the '50s and the '60s,"
00:37:56,00:38:01,and then local county chairman Edward Flajati
00:38:01,00:38:03,"was last what he thought about the protests,"
00:38:03,00:38:05,"and people saying that she shouldn't be water skiing,"
00:38:05,00:38:07,"'cause it was unfair, and he said,"
00:38:07,00:38:09,he thought the protests were a Democrat plot.
00:38:09,00:38:12,"- Well, actually, maybe they were."
00:38:12,00:38:13,"- Yeah, it could have been."
00:38:13,00:38:16,"- So I was reading about, 'cause there's many different types"
00:38:16,00:38:18,of basic water skiing that you can doing.
00:38:18,00:38:21,"So you've got water skiing, you've got wakeboarding,"
00:38:21,00:38:24,and then you've got barefoot skiing as well.
00:38:24,00:38:26,And what's interesting is the different speeds you need
00:38:26,00:38:28,in order to get purchase on the top of the water.
00:38:28,00:38:30,So wakeboarding is the easiest.
00:38:30,00:38:32,20 miles an hour is the one that you need.
00:38:32,00:38:34,"Then there's 30 miles an hour, and that's four,"
00:38:34,00:38:36,actual water skiing.
00:38:36,00:38:39,And 40 miles an hour is for barefoot skiing.
00:38:39,00:38:42,So that's where you need insane speed.
00:38:42,00:38:44,But then people have taken it further now.
00:38:44,00:38:46,So there are records for people.
00:38:46,00:38:47,There's a Guinness World Record for people
00:38:47,00:38:49,who ski on their hands now.
00:38:49,00:38:51,So what they do is they put their legs
00:38:51,00:38:54,into the pulley rope bit that you hold on usually
00:38:54,00:38:56,"with your hands, and then they go down on their hands."
00:38:56,00:39:00,"And there's a world record, which was set in September of 2013,"
00:39:00,00:39:04,"and that was someone handskied for 2956 feet,"
00:39:04,00:39:05,which is amazing.
00:39:05,00:39:07,There's another world record where someone
00:39:07,00:39:11,"jumped from a helicopter, 67 feet in the air, landed,"
00:39:11,00:39:14,"and then went barefoot skiing straight away, which"
00:39:14,00:39:16,"you can see on YouTube, which I've seen as well."
00:39:16,00:39:20,And the world record for the longest jump ever done--
00:39:20,00:39:24,this is on water skis-- for a jump is 312 feet.
00:39:24,00:39:29,And that is still held by a guy called Freddie Krueger.
00:39:29,00:39:30,And I went online.
00:39:30,00:39:34,You would have been good at the handskiing.
00:39:34,00:39:36,I went online because I thought I've never heard anyone else
00:39:36,00:39:38,"called Freddie Krueger, and I went to Wikipedia"
00:39:38,00:39:40,and there's notable Freddie Krueger.
00:39:40,00:39:42,"He's quite famous for what scheme, when I think?"
00:39:42,00:39:42,Is he right?
00:39:42,00:39:43,"Well, there's only three."
00:39:43,00:39:45,"Well, he's doing good for the name of Freddie Krueger,"
00:39:45,00:39:46,because there's only three.
00:39:46,00:39:47,There's him.
00:39:47,00:39:49,There's a guy from the movie.
00:39:49,00:39:52,And then there's a guy called Frederick Wilhelm Krueger
00:39:52,00:39:53,and Nazi official from the third Reich.
00:39:53,00:39:54,So he--
00:39:54,00:39:57,"No, this will rehabilitate the Freddie Krueger name."
00:39:57,00:39:57,I know it.
00:39:57,00:40:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:00,00:40:05,"Bedford Water Skigging is very cool, though, and it's--"
00:40:05,00:40:07,so you're really good at Bedford Water Skigging.
00:40:07,00:40:09,"If you have flat feet, I learned."
00:40:09,00:40:11,"Which is quite nice for flat feet to be built,"
00:40:11,00:40:12,because I have quite a--
00:40:12,00:40:15,"And that your feet are 10 feet long, and it's amazing."
00:40:15,00:40:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:16,00:40:18,But you don't want your toes to go in.
00:40:18,00:40:19,"It's toes to nose, they call it."
00:40:19,00:40:21,"But I've got very high arches in my feet,"
00:40:21,00:40:23,and I always feel quite smug around my flat footed friends.
00:40:23,00:40:25,"But actually, I would be--"
00:40:25,00:40:29,"I know, it's a weird reason to be arrogant."
00:40:29,00:40:31,But a flat feet is much better.
00:40:31,00:40:34,"And also, you can get a third degree burns from it."
00:40:34,00:40:36,"So this is an interview with George Blair,"
00:40:36,00:40:41,"who was a Bedford skiing champ in the '70s and '80s, I think."
00:40:41,00:40:43,"And he Bedford skied for three minutes,"
00:40:43,00:40:44,which is an extremely long time.
00:40:44,00:40:47,"And you're going so fast, and the friction is so extreme,"
00:40:47,00:40:49,"that he got third degree burns, and he couldn't walk"
00:40:49,00:40:50,for days and days.
00:40:50,00:40:51,And--
00:40:51,00:40:53,"You're surrounded by hot ice, and yet--"
00:40:53,00:40:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:55,00:40:57,"You get third degree burns, that's crazy."
00:40:57,00:40:59,You know Swan's windsurf.
00:40:59,00:41:00,Are they?
00:41:00,00:41:00,Yeah.
00:41:00,00:41:02,"Sorry, no, it's not water skiing, but it is windsurfing."
00:41:02,00:41:03,So it's--
00:41:03,00:41:04,But it is windsurfing.
00:41:04,00:41:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:07,00:41:08,"Yeah, they do."
00:41:08,00:41:10,"They arch their wings over their back,"
00:41:10,00:41:12,"and they can travel at three miles an hour, which"
00:41:12,00:41:14,"is very fast for them, and it's way faster than they could"
00:41:14,00:41:15,go with by paddling.
00:41:15,00:41:18,"That's not as fast as they can fly, though."
00:41:18,00:41:20,No.
00:41:20,00:41:21,"No, it's not their best means of getting"
00:41:21,00:41:22,"from A to B, true."
00:41:22,00:41:24,But it does save them a bit of energy.
00:41:24,00:41:26,"And this, I did not know about Swan's."
00:41:26,00:41:30,They can run at a top speed of 22 miles an hour.
00:41:30,00:41:30,Oh!
00:41:30,00:41:32,I'm feeling that it's not true.
00:41:32,00:41:34,"That's the top speed, James."
00:41:34,00:41:35,It's not the bottom speed.
00:41:35,00:41:39,"It's the top speed, who's saying bolts very top speed ever,"
00:41:39,00:41:42,over the course of 100 meters was 23.35 miles an hour.
00:41:42,00:41:45,So a Swan could very nearly catch who's saying bolts.
00:41:45,00:41:46,Wow.
00:41:46,00:41:48,"If at the end, if he stuck his neck out,"
00:41:48,00:41:49,he might actually manage to--
00:41:49,00:41:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:50,00:41:55,"It's all about the finish, mate."
00:41:55,00:41:58,"I think that needs to be really strict rules,"
00:41:58,00:42:00,because they can't use their wings.
00:42:00,00:42:01,I think that's the important thing.
00:42:01,00:42:03,You mustn't be allowed to use your wings
00:42:03,00:42:04,"when you're racing, you're saying bolts on bolts."
00:42:04,00:42:06,"But if you're running in the 100 meters,"
00:42:06,00:42:08,you're allowed to wave your arms around
00:42:08,00:42:10,"and they get the molecules out of the way, actually."
00:42:10,00:42:12,"I think, well, they go like this, don't they?"
00:42:12,00:42:13,"Oh, that's true."
00:42:13,00:42:15,"And not great for a podcast, I must say."
00:42:15,00:42:17,If you were sort of--
00:42:17,00:42:19,if you were doing this and kind of flapping the air past you.
00:42:19,00:42:21,"Yeah, like a front crawl while you're running."
00:42:21,00:42:23,Basically.
00:42:23,00:42:25,It must be better.
00:42:25,00:42:25,It must be better.
00:42:25,00:42:28,"Because it's like air is just like very, very thin water."
00:42:28,00:42:31,"Oh, gosh."
00:42:31,00:42:35,Future Olympians are gripped right now.
00:42:35,00:42:37,"Hey, we need to wrap up, surely."
00:42:37,00:42:39,"Yakskiing, have you heard of this?"
00:42:39,00:42:40,No. Yakskiing.
00:42:40,00:42:44,So this happens in the Indian Hill Resort of Manali.
00:42:44,00:42:46,And it's a tourist attraction.
00:42:46,00:42:47,So it's really only tourist that do it.
00:42:47,00:42:49,I'm sure the locals don't really do it.
00:42:49,00:42:52,But your skier is at the bottom of a slope.
00:42:52,00:42:54,He's attached to a rope with a pulley.
00:42:54,00:42:57,And there's a yak at the top of the slope.
00:42:57,00:43:01,And the yak-- you then shake some nuts at the yak.
00:43:01,00:43:07,"And for some reason, that makes the yak leg it down the hill."
00:43:07,00:43:10,"But of course, he's attached to you with a rope."
00:43:10,00:43:12,And so you fly up.
00:43:12,00:43:15,It's like the most amazing ski lift ever.
00:43:15,00:43:18,And you've got an enormous speed.
00:43:18,00:43:22,"And it was a spot invented by a guy called Mr. Dorgy,"
00:43:22,00:43:25,"who has the advice, never shake the bucket of nuts"
00:43:25,00:43:27,before your tie to the yak rope.
00:43:27,00:43:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:29,00:43:31,I think that actually is the 11th commandment.
00:43:31,00:43:33,I don't think you're doing that.
00:43:33,00:43:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:36,00:43:37,"OK, that is it."
00:43:37,00:43:39,That is all of our facts.

00:44:05,00:44:07,We have all the episodes that we've done over the course
00:44:07,00:44:08,of our four years.
00:44:08,00:44:12,"And just quickly, before we wrap up this week's episode,"
00:44:12,00:44:14,we asked the audience here in Redding
00:44:14,00:44:16,to give us their favorite facts.
00:44:16,00:44:18,So we're going to give away a cassette to the winning
00:44:18,00:44:19,fact.
00:44:19,00:44:21,And please collect it from us at the end of the show
00:44:21,00:44:22,in the 48.
00:44:22,00:44:26,"So the winner, the winner, is just in potter."
00:44:26,00:44:27,And we really like this fact.
00:44:27,00:44:32,It is when Alan Jones won the 1977 Austrian Grand Prix.
00:44:32,00:44:35,They didn't have the Australian National Anthem.
00:44:35,00:44:38,"Instead, a drunk man played Happy Birthday on a trumpet."
00:44:38,00:44:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:44:41,00:44:46,That's amazing.
00:44:46,00:44:49,We'll be back again next week with another episode
00:44:49,00:44:50,we'll see you then.
00:44:50,00:44:51,"Redding, thank you so much."
