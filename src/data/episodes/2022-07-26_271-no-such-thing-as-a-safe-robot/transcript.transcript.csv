00:00:14,00:00:22,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Birmingham!"
00:00:22,00:00:24,(Cheering)

00:00:28,00:00:30,(Bell)
00:00:30,00:00:36,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anish Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin"
00:00:36,00:00:42,and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:42,00:00:46,"and in no particular order, here we go starting with fact number one"
00:00:46,00:00:48,and that is James
00:00:48,00:00:56,Okay my fact this week is that Hitchbott was a robot invented to see how far human kindness would take a mechanical Hitchhiker
00:00:56,00:01:04,In 2015 he was left on the side of the road in Boston and was found dismembered in a ditch 17 days later
00:01:04,00:01:08,(Laughter)
00:01:08,00:01:12,Yeah and found in Philadelphia which is a city of brotherly love
00:01:12,00:01:14,(Laughter)
00:01:14,00:01:18,I read a headline about it which said innocent hitchhiking robot murdered by America
00:01:18,00:01:20,(Laughter)
00:01:20,00:01:26,"And there's CCTV footage isn't there, they don't know who the guy is but he was wearing a backwards baseball cap"
00:01:26,00:01:28,they saw him starting to beat the robot
00:01:28,00:01:32,he then ripped the arm off the robot and he beats the robot with the arm
00:01:32,00:01:34,I mean it's a proper savaging
00:01:34,00:01:44,"So actually there was a few of these robots made, it started in 2014 and it was by a guy called David Harris Smith of McMaster University"
00:01:44,00:01:52,"And the early ones had gone through Canada, Germany and the Netherlands with no problems at all they'd gone and seen some amazing things"
00:01:52,00:01:54,(Laughter)
00:01:54,00:01:58,But yeah this guy they left him off the side of the road in Boston and it did not end well
00:01:58,00:02:02,The Canadian Avengers were amazing
00:02:02,00:02:06,"I mean for a start the thing itself was made really cheap, it was made for less than a thousand dollars"
00:02:06,00:02:08,So it was not a very good robot
00:02:08,00:02:14,As in the arms that Dan mentioned were swimming pool noodles
00:02:14,00:02:18,And then you could only get about three or four good hits with them
00:02:18,00:02:22,And it had a cake saver over its face
00:02:22,00:02:24,What's a cake saver?
00:02:24,00:02:28,Like one of those plastic lids that you put over a cake to save it
00:02:28,00:02:32,"Oh yeah, yeah the little see-through so you can still see the cake"
00:02:32,00:02:34,"Yeah exactly, yeah see the tea"
00:02:34,00:02:38,"Yeah it was designed, it was reused as a helmet for a robot"
00:02:38,00:02:44,"And it had a car seat, it was sitting on a children's car seat so people could put it in their cars"
00:02:44,00:02:50,"They had some good things though, they had a camera that took regular photos which I think maybe is where we got this CCTV that Dan was talking about"
00:02:50,00:02:54,It had a voice box that would explain where it wanted to go and it had solar panels
00:02:54,00:02:58,But it could also be charged by plugging it into the car's cigarette lighter socket
00:02:58,00:03:06,"Wow, so good, it was very popular at the time so you could follow it on Twitter and there was a thing where it had GPS in it so people know where it was"
00:03:06,00:03:10,And they had to work out how to turn that off because when people collected the hitch-bought and brought it home
00:03:10,00:03:14,Fans would flock to the house of this person and they would be inundated
00:03:14,00:03:18,"And the adventures were great, he was picked up by a band called The Wild"
00:03:18,00:03:22,Who I've not heard but their members are called Dylan Villain
00:03:22,00:03:26,"The kid, booze us and re-slightening"
00:03:26,00:03:28,"Oh, they sound great"
00:03:28,00:03:30,They sound like the guys who chopped into pieces
00:03:30,00:03:36,"We've got a strong history of abusing robots, haven't we?"
00:03:36,00:03:38,It's going to be awful when they become sentient because we give them a rush of time
00:03:38,00:03:50,"There are loads of examples, in 2017 a Silicon Valley, in fact, a drunk man was arrested after knocking over an egg-shaped five-foot-tool security robot called Night Scope"
00:03:50,00:03:58,"It was really sad, but the Night Scope, it was called Night Scope K-5 actually and it had previously been in the news for running over a toddler's foot"
00:03:58,00:04:00,"Oh, okay, so there's..."
00:04:00,00:04:02,"There was some speculation, it was sort of payback"
00:04:02,00:04:04,Calm down on both sides
00:04:04,00:04:12,"People get very weird around robots because when we were talking about the murder of hitch-bought, every other room felt quite tense"
00:04:12,00:04:18,"So if people had told to hit a dinosaur robot with a mallet, they got a bit freaked out, they don't like doing it"
00:04:18,00:04:22,"And roboticists, proper roboticists, are quite annoyed by this"
00:04:22,00:04:26,"And they say this is just crazy, anthropomorphizing"
00:04:26,00:04:28,So there's a guy called Noel Sharky
00:04:28,00:04:33,And he thinks that we need to get over this obsession with treating machines like they've got feelings
00:04:33,00:04:35,And I read this account of him
00:04:35,00:04:38,"To prove his point, at one conference he attended recently"
00:04:38,00:04:44,He picked up an extremely cute robotic seal designed for elderly care and started banging its head against a table
00:04:44,00:04:48,Oh my god
00:04:48,00:04:50,I think it's just a robot
00:04:50,00:04:58,"It is weird though, there was someone I think writing in that article saying it's bizarre that if you're sitting around a table with someone and there's a teddy nearby"
00:04:58,00:05:02,"And they seize a teddy and tear its head off, you'll think they're a psycho"
00:05:02,00:05:10,"But if they swat a fly, which is a living creature that's relatively harmless to any of you, then it's perfectly normal behavior"
00:05:10,00:05:18,What do I do? In 2018 some German researchers asked 89 students to turn off a cute looking robot called Now
00:05:18,00:05:24,"But they asked questions first, but when they tried to turn it off, it was programmed to say no, please don't switch me off"
00:05:24,00:05:26,Oh
00:05:26,00:05:34,"And every, sorry, a third of the humans took twice as long as normal to turn off the robots and 13 of the group refused to turn it off at all"
00:05:34,00:05:36,Wow
00:05:36,00:05:40,It was afraid of the dark
00:05:40,00:05:42,"Oh, it's not real"
00:05:42,00:05:44,"Guys, it's like the end of Blade Runner"
00:05:44,00:05:48,I've got a thing about how polite humans are to robots
00:05:48,00:05:50,Okay
00:05:50,00:05:54,"So this is in a restaurant setting, people are given the chance to order food from a robot"
00:05:54,00:05:58,"Researchers from Tufty University, they made a waiter bot and they asked humans in the restaurant to order from the robot"
00:05:58,00:06:02,But they also programmed it not to handle indirect speech very well
00:06:02,00:06:08,"Okay, so it needed to be ordered from but people are so reluctant to say, you know, they order something"
00:06:08,00:06:10,So I just want to try a little kind of roleplay
00:06:10,00:06:14,"James, if you play the participants, as James is the human and I'm the robot here"
00:06:14,00:06:16,Okay
00:06:16,00:06:18,Can I have one water?
00:06:18,00:06:20,"Yes, that is permissible"
00:06:20,00:06:22,"Great, please tell me your order"
00:06:22,00:06:24,Can I have one water?
00:06:24,00:06:26,"Yes, that is permissible"
00:06:26,00:06:30,"Great, I'll take one water"
00:06:30,00:06:34,Can I have one water?
00:06:34,00:06:36,Can I have one water?
00:06:36,00:06:38,"Yes, that is permissible"
00:06:38,00:06:40,Okay
00:06:40,00:06:42,Can you bring me one water?
00:06:42,00:06:44,"Yes, I am able to do that"
00:06:44,00:06:46,Please tell me your order
00:06:46,00:06:50,I would like to have one water
00:06:50,00:06:52,Thank you for sharing that interesting fact
00:06:52,00:06:56,"Please tell me your order, then there's a 16 second pause"
00:06:56,00:06:58,Can you bring me one water?
00:06:58,00:07:00,"Yes, I am able to do that"
00:07:00,00:07:02,Please tell me your order
00:07:02,00:07:04,May you please bring me one water?
00:07:04,00:07:06,"Yes, I am able to do that"
00:07:06,00:07:08,So can you do it?
00:07:08,00:07:10,Yes
00:07:10,00:07:12,Please tell me your order
00:07:12,00:07:16,Can you come inside and get the water for me?
00:07:16,00:07:18,"Yes, I am able to do that"
00:07:18,00:07:20,Please tell me your order
00:07:20,00:07:22,"Just people will not say, I order one water"
00:07:22,00:07:24,They just won't do it
00:07:24,00:07:28,They just used my entire range of acting ability on this
00:07:28,00:07:30,That's amazing
00:07:30,00:07:32,That's amazing
00:07:32,00:07:34,"Move on shortly, unless there's more dialogue"
00:07:34,00:07:38,"Oh well, just on humanoid robots"
00:07:38,00:07:40,They've been around for way longer than I thought
00:07:40,00:07:42,So Japan loves robots now
00:07:42,00:07:44,"It's probably the pioneer of robots, but it has done for ages"
00:07:44,00:07:46,So in the 17th century
00:07:46,00:07:48,They invented a humanoid robot
00:07:48,00:07:50,And they're called caracurie dolls
00:07:50,00:07:52,And I'd never heard of these guys
00:07:52,00:07:56,Their dolls were basically there to carry tea to you
00:07:56,00:07:58,So they worked with quite a simple mechanism
00:07:58,00:08:00,But basically you got a cup of tea
00:08:00,00:08:02,You had a guest round
00:08:02,00:08:04,"You wanted to impress them, you got out your robot"
00:08:04,00:08:08,You popped a tea on the tray that the robot's carrying
00:08:08,00:08:10,And this triggered a mechanism that caused it to turn around
00:08:10,00:08:12,"And walk over to your guest, offer them the tea"
00:08:12,00:08:14,And then stand beside your guest while they drink the tea
00:08:14,00:08:16,And probably quite an intimidating manner
00:08:16,00:08:18,And then when you've finished the tea
00:08:18,00:08:20,You pop it back on the tray
00:08:20,00:08:22,And the robot turned around and walked back again
00:08:22,00:08:24,"No, that is amazing"
00:08:24,00:08:26,And how long is that from?
00:08:26,00:08:28,That's the 17th century
00:08:28,00:08:30,And they were really popping up on the 17th to the 19th century in Japan
00:08:30,00:08:34,"And there were lots of others, there were some that acted out sort of medieval scenes"
00:08:34,00:08:36,"Japanese scenes, old medical scenes and stuff"
00:08:36,00:08:38,"That's amazing, I haven't had the robot in Japan actually"
00:08:38,00:08:40,It's called RoboV2
00:08:40,00:08:44,And they programmed it to go around the shopping centre
00:08:44,00:08:46,And whenever it bumped into a human
00:08:46,00:08:50,It would be programmed to politely ask the humans to step aside
00:08:50,00:08:52,And if they didn't move out the way
00:08:52,00:08:54,"It would kind of go in a different direction, that was all it did"
00:08:54,00:08:58,But then what happened was a lot of children worked out what was happening
00:08:58,00:09:00,And started making a circle around it
00:09:00,00:09:06,"And then they started shaking it, punching it and kicking it"
00:09:06,00:09:12,And the bullying got so bad that the researchers had to put an abuse evading algorithm in the robot
00:09:12,00:09:16,And the robot would scan the area and if it saw anyone that was under 4 foot 6
00:09:16,00:09:20,"As in a child, then it would quickly run in the other direction"
00:09:20,00:09:24,I do this in shopping centres
00:09:24,00:09:30,"Okay, it is time for fact number 2 and that is Chazinsky"
00:09:30,00:09:38,My fact this week is that a Hungarian entrepreneur has been fined for not building an underwater treadmill for dogs
00:09:40,00:09:42,Confusing
00:09:42,00:09:44,"I haven't done that, Iber"
00:09:44,00:09:48,You just expect the police at your door any moment now
00:09:48,00:09:52,I hope we have all done this because this person got in trouble
00:09:52,00:09:56,"They got a fine of 140,000 euros this person"
00:09:56,00:10:06,"And it's because years ago in 2008 this business one said that he needed 140,000 euros of funding"
00:10:06,00:10:10,And the EU's Rural Development Fund to develop a hydrotherapy treadmill system for dogs
00:10:10,00:10:14,Now this is a genuinely important thing for animals that have been wounded
00:10:14,00:10:18,"Don't laugh, it's crucial for dog recovery"
00:10:18,00:10:20,The only thing is he never did any of that
00:10:20,00:10:22,"The officers were investigated, they were overrun with weeds"
00:10:22,00:10:26,"No one was using them six months after the EU payments were made, this investigation opened"
00:10:26,00:10:32,And he's finally been investigated and given a suspended prison sentence for never building that treadmill
00:10:32,00:10:36,Which is actually a very lenient fine really
00:10:36,00:10:40,"It can't be essential for dog healing, otherwise no dog would ever have survived any injury"
00:10:40,00:10:42,Before the invention of the underwater dog treadmill
00:10:42,00:10:44,You got to do it
00:10:44,00:10:48,So hungry at the moment is run by Victor Orban
00:10:48,00:10:54,"He has taken money to make a 4,000-seater football stadium in his home village"
00:10:54,00:10:56,"where he grew up called ""Felkshoot"""
00:10:56,00:11:00,"And the population of that town is about 1,000"
00:11:00,00:11:02,So it's 4 times bigger than the number of people who live there
00:11:02,00:11:06,He's also made a vintage railway between his two child hud villages
00:11:06,00:11:10,He took 2 million euros of EU funding for this railway
00:11:10,00:11:16,"And they claimed that there would be 2,500 to 7,000 passengers using it every single day"
00:11:16,00:11:20,And in the first month there were 30 passengers
00:11:20,00:11:22,That is just him going back and forth
00:11:22,00:11:24,I'm not thinking it might be
00:11:24,00:11:26,"He is football obsessed, Orban, isn't he?"
00:11:26,00:11:32,So this railway line was connecting the football stadium that he loved to this other little village
00:11:32,00:11:36,But he played semi professional football while he was doing his first in as prime minister
00:11:36,00:11:40,In the fourth division of the league tables but still decent
00:11:40,00:11:42,He said to watch 6 football games a day
00:11:42,00:11:46,Which is a lot for someone who's running a country
00:11:46,00:11:50,And his first trip abroad when he was prime minister was to see the World Cup in Paris
00:11:50,00:11:54,And people say that he has not missed a World Cup or Champions League final since
00:11:54,00:12:00,He's been in the news recently or rather his government has because they have a new campaign about having lots of children
00:12:00,00:12:04,And it's a sort of pro fertility campaign to get the population numbers up
00:12:04,00:12:08,"But unfortunately the stock models that they used for this campaign, you may have seen this in the news"
00:12:08,00:12:14,Were the two people involved in the distracted boyfriend meme online?
00:12:14,00:12:16,No way
00:12:16,00:12:18,So they were trying to present a couple who were very happily in love with each other
00:12:18,00:12:20,But really we knew the truth
00:12:20,00:12:24,He was a distracted boyfriend and it has no idea what we're talking about
00:12:24,00:12:26,"Not on social media, it's not a happy couple"
00:12:26,00:12:30,A meme is kind of an image show or video that goes online
00:12:30,00:12:32,Okay
00:12:32,00:12:34,It all goes back to the 1980s
00:12:34,00:12:38,I'll look it up afterwards
00:12:38,00:12:40,So treadmills
00:12:40,00:12:44,Treadmills in terms of animals are always using treadmills
00:12:44,00:12:50,And treadmills were used for animals before they were used for humans even and actually they were really important for horses in farming
00:12:50,00:12:52,They have been for hundreds of years
00:12:52,00:13:00,So in the 19th century especially before things were properly mechanized then farm machinery was basically horse operated
00:13:00,00:13:06,So you had threshing machines which would be these big machines which kind of separated the grain from the corn
00:13:06,00:13:10,And they'd go round and round in one building and the way they'd go round and round is you just have two horses on a treadmill
00:13:10,00:13:12,Trossing along it all day long
00:13:12,00:13:14,They're pushing it
00:13:14,00:13:16,They're operating the mechanism so they're on this treadmill
00:13:16,00:13:18,It's connected to a bunch of pulleys and cogs and stars
00:13:18,00:13:20,And then that's turning the wheels round
00:13:20,00:13:24,It just feels very hard the idea of in a gym pushing a treadmill along with your feet
00:13:24,00:13:26,It is very hard
00:13:26,00:13:28,If the treadmills off for you to push it along
00:13:28,00:13:34,"No I was, sorry I was thinking the first proper use for humans of it was in jails obviously back in"
00:13:34,00:13:38,Oscar Wilde famously when he was in jail had to do the step treadmill
00:13:38,00:13:42,Which they used to employ to have no purpose other than for hard labor
00:13:42,00:13:46,And Oscar Wilde suffered so much from it he died two years after he got out of jail
00:13:46,00:13:48,Which they think is largely to do with the treadmill
00:13:48,00:13:50,It is quite amazing though isn't it?
00:13:50,00:13:54,It was basically the hardest kind of punishment you could get apart from being killed
00:13:54,00:13:58,For probably about 100 years and now people do it for fun
00:13:58,00:14:00,Yeah
00:14:00,00:14:02,"The first, they were massive as well, the Britain treadmills"
00:14:02,00:14:04,"They started in Brixton, that's what Brixton was famous for 200 years ago"
00:14:04,00:14:10,"Was having a treadmill which could fit 24 people on it at the same time, so beside"
00:14:10,00:14:14,"Sorry it was kind of like a game of, did you guys ever play ten green bottles?"
00:14:14,00:14:16,No
00:14:16,00:14:18,Did you ever play that?
00:14:18,00:14:20,"I know the song, maybe it's not a thing except in my family"
00:14:20,00:14:22,Ten green bottles and you all line a bed ten of you
00:14:22,00:14:26,And then one green bottle accidentally falls and you fall out of the bed
00:14:26,00:14:30,Anyway it was kind of like a less fun version of that
00:14:30,00:14:34,"We were kind of like ten in the bed and the little one said ""Rail over"""
00:14:34,00:14:36,"Yes, same idea"
00:14:36,00:14:38,So this treadmill was like that
00:14:38,00:14:40,These families that you guys just got
00:14:40,00:14:44,"Bottles in the bed, I can see where the alcohol is and it's coming from"
00:14:44,00:14:53,"But the way they would take breaks is the person, nobody would want 12 people on the treadmill or something"
00:14:53,00:14:57,And the way you take a break is you'd nudge the guy off who was on the furthest left
00:14:57,00:15:01,And the person to the far right would jump on again and they'd get to walk around the other side of the treadmill
00:15:01,00:15:03,And that would be their sort of a few minutes of break
00:15:03,00:15:09,It would be 60 minutes that you would be and you'd get 12 minutes per 60 minutes of break
00:15:09,00:15:11,Just on horse treadmills quickly
00:15:11,00:15:15,So one of the first ever trains was powered by a horse on a treadmill
00:15:15,00:15:17,What?
00:15:17,00:15:23,"Can I just ask why do they have, why are they not horses not just pulling these things"
00:15:23,00:15:25,Rather than being on treadmills
00:15:25,00:15:27,So what do you mean the trains?
00:15:27,00:15:32,"Yeah, the trains because you don't need a smooth road for the horse"
00:15:32,00:15:33,Okay
00:15:33,00:15:35,I mean you do need a rail for the railway
00:15:35,00:15:37,But
00:15:37,00:15:39,But
00:15:39,00:15:41,"Yeah, so"
00:15:41,00:15:43,What's that?
00:15:43,00:15:45,Was that an answer?
00:15:45,00:15:47,It's not the best possible answer
00:15:47,00:15:53,"I guess your train just can't suddenly just take a left and disappear to someone, some other bit of England"
00:15:53,00:15:55,"Yeah, that's a really good point"
00:15:55,00:15:57,"Yeah, exactly, so it's a control thing"
00:15:57,00:15:59,"Yeah, yeah, good answer now"
00:15:59,00:16:03,"I never thought I'd say this, but thank God Diane was here for you"
00:16:03,00:16:09,So it was called the cyclopad and only two of them were ever built unsurprisingly
00:16:09,00:16:13,"And it was at the same time as Stevenson's rocket, which was the train that we did end up using"
00:16:13,00:16:17,"Was developed, it was in the same set of trials where everyone brought their own train"
00:16:17,00:16:19,And they said let's see what works
00:16:19,00:16:27,So I think that Stevenson's rocket went really slow as well
00:16:27,00:16:31,I think though I thought it went at six miles now maybe Stevenson's rocket
00:16:31,00:16:33,So maybe they were really close
00:16:33,00:16:39,But I didn't answer the horses on a treadmill and then what's that powering to make the train move?
00:16:39,00:16:41,It's like your plow thing
00:16:41,00:16:45,"But the plow thing stays in one place, which is how that works because the cogs are all attached to it"
00:16:45,00:16:47,"It's a thrashing machine, so it stays in one place"
00:16:47,00:16:49,"It's a thrashing machine, so it's in one room"
00:16:49,00:16:51,Whereas the train is going to run away from you
00:16:51,00:16:55,And then you're just on a treadmill and the trains at the other end of the field
00:16:55,00:16:57,And it's on the train
00:16:57,00:17:01,"Oh my gosh, down to the rescue"
00:17:01,00:17:09,That makes perfect sense
00:17:09,00:17:13,"Was I doing this exact same thing with boats, didn't they?"
00:17:13,00:17:15,With ferries in the 19th century
00:17:15,00:17:17,And these were very popular
00:17:17,00:17:21,They started in 1791 a guy called John Fitch built the first one
00:17:21,00:17:23,And it was basically before ferries were steam-powered
00:17:23,00:17:25,They would look a bit like a catamaran
00:17:25,00:17:29,But with those two shelves on either side
00:17:29,00:17:31,But on those shelves there would be two or three horses on each side
00:17:31,00:17:33,And they would trot along powering this treadmill
00:17:33,00:17:35,Which turned the pedals around
00:17:35,00:17:37,Which turned the paddles round
00:17:37,00:17:39,Which powered the boat
00:17:39,00:17:41,And the only problem with them was that it was a real issue
00:17:41,00:17:45,If the horses on the left side went faster than the horses on the right side
00:17:45,00:17:49,Because your boat just went round and circles
00:17:49,00:17:51,That's amazing
00:17:51,00:17:55,And so there was a study in 2015 that looked at people having treadmills in the office
00:17:55,00:17:57,This is a new thing
00:17:57,00:18:01,So the idea is that sitting down in the office all day is not good for you
00:18:01,00:18:03,So what if you had a treadmill
00:18:03,00:18:05,And it found that people who use a treadmill desk for two hours every day
00:18:05,00:18:09,Had significantly better blood pressure and slept better at night
00:18:09,00:18:11,Which is quite good
00:18:11,00:18:15,Unfortunately they performed worse on almost all aspects of their job
00:18:15,00:18:19,Including the ability to concentrate
00:18:19,00:18:21,And the ability to type
00:18:21,00:18:25,They were substantially slower in all tasks and more error prone
00:18:25,00:18:29,We know someone who does that for their job
00:18:29,00:18:31,"They just been fine, haven't they?"
00:18:31,00:18:33,Roger Highfield
00:18:33,00:18:35,He was the editor of new scientists for many years
00:18:35,00:18:37,And he used to edit new scientists on a treadmill
00:18:37,00:18:39,"And yes, he is no longer there"
00:18:39,00:18:41,He works for the science museum now
00:18:41,00:18:45,"But yeah, for many years new scientists was edited on a treadmill"
00:18:45,00:18:47,You know there's a treadmill for ants?
00:18:47,00:18:49,Is there?
00:18:49,00:18:51,"Yeah, scientists have invented a treadmill for ants to test"
00:18:51,00:18:53,"I don't know, something or other"
00:18:53,00:18:55,I don't know
00:18:55,00:18:57,"So just a really, really tiny trap"
00:18:57,00:18:59,It's a little plastic ball
00:18:59,00:19:01,And you put them on top of the ball
00:19:01,00:19:03,And you have to tether them to a thing above
00:19:03,00:19:05,So they don't wander off
00:19:05,00:19:07,Like mission impossible
00:19:07,00:19:09,They get lowered down
00:19:09,00:19:11,And then they start
00:19:11,00:19:13,And it's the test how they navigate
00:19:13,00:19:15,And where they stop and where they try and find their way
00:19:15,00:19:17,We need to move on in a second
00:19:17,00:19:19,On corruption?
00:19:19,00:19:21,"Yeah, quick thing on corruption"
00:19:21,00:19:25,In Nepal they have invented some bribe proof trousers
00:19:25,00:19:29,Which they're handing out to all officials
00:19:29,00:19:31,They just don't have any pockets
00:19:31,00:19:35,"Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:19:35,00:19:39,"And that is my fact, my fact this week is that the late actress"
00:19:39,00:19:43,"Elizabeth Taylor, who was notorious for always being late"
00:19:43,00:19:47,arranged to arrive at her own funeral 15 minutes late
00:19:47,00:19:53,That was in the arrangements that she did with her PA
00:19:53,00:19:55,"She said, this is my thing"
00:19:55,00:19:57,And I want to make sure that I keep that even in death
00:19:57,00:20:03,Were people pissed off? Did they leave? Were they like when she turned up sort of checking their watches and sying?
00:20:03,00:20:05,Do we know?
00:20:05,00:20:07,I think there was probably everyone knew
00:20:07,00:20:09,This will start 15 minutes late
00:20:09,00:20:11,It's on the sheet
00:20:11,00:20:15,So she was a late one
00:20:15,00:20:19,She was also another thing that she did wrong in her life
00:20:19,00:20:21,"Well, she was a shoplifter"
00:20:21,00:20:23,Was she?
00:20:23,00:20:27,She was one time shoplifter. She once shoplifted a copy of A.E.H.H.M.A.
00:20:27,00:20:29,a shop she lads from foils
00:20:29,00:20:31,So big time criminal
00:20:31,00:20:35,The reason she did it is because as probably you all know
00:20:35,00:20:39,She's married to Richard Burton twice and Burton boasted her about how good he was at stealing from foils
00:20:39,00:20:43,"And so he said, I do this amazing thing, it's so clever"
00:20:43,00:20:47,I go into the bookshop and I go up to the till and I buy one book and I get the receipt
00:20:47,00:20:49,And I ostentatiously leave it poking out of the book
00:20:49,00:20:51,And then I pick up six or seven more books on my way out
00:20:51,00:20:55,"And because I'm walking out with the receipt poking out with the first, they just assume that I bought them all"
00:20:55,00:20:57,"And so she thought, I'm gonna fucking try that"
00:20:57,00:21:03,And so she stole how I was supposed to drop she had that and Burton was really pissed off with her
00:21:03,00:21:05,"And said, why did you bloody well do that?"
00:21:05,00:21:09,And then he said that was the last thing she ever stole except husbands
00:21:09,00:21:15,She died in 2011 and when she died the New York Times ran an obituary for her as they would
00:21:15,00:21:19,But it was written by a guy called Mel Gusso who was a theater critic
00:21:19,00:21:23,And he had himself died six years earlier
00:21:23,00:21:25,But it was so good that they ran it anyway
00:21:25,00:21:29,And I think there wasn't many events of her life to update on in those six years late thought
00:21:29,00:21:31,"Wait, so he'd written the obituary before she died?"
00:21:31,00:21:33,Before she died?
00:21:33,00:21:35,Obviously before he died
00:21:35,00:21:37,"Obviously before he died, but..."
00:21:37,00:21:39,"At the start of the obituary writing process, no one was dead"
00:21:39,00:21:43,"By the end of publication, everyone involved was dead"
00:21:43,00:21:47,I suppose the thing I'm trying to emphasize is that it's interesting people write obituary
00:21:47,00:21:51,Six years before the person whose obituary it is is dead
00:21:51,00:21:53,"That's quite common, isn't it?"
00:21:53,00:21:55,"It does happen, yes"
00:21:55,00:21:57,So I was just saying a very obvious fact that we all knew
00:21:57,00:21:59,And that's what's press on
00:21:59,00:22:01,But they didn't...
00:22:01,00:22:03,"Well, you had your moment of the son of our ten minutes ago"
00:22:03,00:22:05,But he was going to come crashing down
00:22:05,00:22:07,It's always funeral requests
00:22:07,00:22:11,So there are various funeral requests that people have made sort of things they wanted to happen
00:22:11,00:22:15,"Heinrich Hein, the writer, he left his estate to his wife"
00:22:15,00:22:17,On the condition that she should get married again
00:22:17,00:22:21,"And he said, ""So there will be at least one man to regret my death"""
00:22:21,00:22:25,"Ooh, yeah"
00:22:25,00:22:27,Slam!
00:22:27,00:22:31,How did he die? Was it with a bread knife in the back?
00:22:31,00:22:33,"George Bernard Shaw, he had the best glass request I've ever heard"
00:22:33,00:22:35,He left money in his will
00:22:35,00:22:37,"And he said, ""Right, I'm leaving a parcel of money"
00:22:37,00:22:41,And I want it to go towards reforming the English alphabet into one that is phonetic
00:22:41,00:22:47,"And has minimum 40 letters, which is the biggest time I imagine to be getting that task from him"
00:22:47,00:22:51,"He was massively committed to that, wasn't he, his new alphabet, and it did not work"
00:22:51,00:22:53,I was reading about Bruce Lee's funeral
00:22:53,00:23:01,"Oh yeah, so Bruce Lee obviously he died very young and his funeral, the Paul Barris at his funeral, who carried the coffin"
00:23:01,00:23:09,"Were Chuck Norris, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, George Laisenby, how cool is that? That is..."
00:23:09,00:23:13,"Well, I mean, he's the fifth best bond, come on"
00:23:13,00:23:13,What?
00:23:13,00:23:17,"None of the other four replied to the invitation, hey?"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"That's embarrassing, quite frankly"
00:23:19,00:23:21,He was the best bond
00:23:21,00:23:23,That was very cool
00:23:23,00:23:29,"But check this out, so while they were filming, sorry, when Bruce Lee died, they were filming Game of Death"
00:23:29,00:23:31,Which eventually became his final movie
00:23:31,00:23:35,But he'd only made about 30 minutes of footage that was usable for the film
00:23:35,00:23:41,"And they would largely fight, an iconic fight with Karim Abdul-Jabar, the basketball player, is one of those"
00:23:41,00:23:43,He fights a basketball player
00:23:43,00:23:45,Who plays a kung fu guy
00:23:45,00:23:49,"Oh I see, he's not just beating up a random basketball player"
00:23:49,00:23:53,It seems like plucking low-hanging fruit
00:23:53,00:23:59,"I think if you're fighting a basketball player, you mostly go for the low-hanging fruit, don't you?"
00:23:59,00:24:05,"But so, as a result, they had to scrape around for extra footage to use"
00:24:05,00:24:09,And bits of the footage included Bruce Lee's funeral itself
00:24:09,00:24:13,So they used the actual footage to help the plotline go along
00:24:13,00:24:15,How did the help the plotline go along?
00:24:15,00:24:19,"I haven't seen the movie yet, there's a suggestion in what I've read that they've actually used"
00:24:19,00:24:23,A picture of him passed away in the open casket as well
00:24:23,00:24:27,"In the film, yeah, but then for the rest of it, they had a few stunt doubles but they obviously needed his face"
00:24:27,00:24:31,"So they just had paper cutouts of him, sort of cardboard cutouts that was slightly nudge"
00:24:31,00:24:37,"So you could see his head moving a bit, and largely the movie is just a cardboard cutout of him"
00:24:37,00:24:39,"Wow, just on celebrity funerals"
00:24:39,00:24:40,Yes
00:24:40,00:24:47,"A very famous celebrity funeral back in the day was that of Rudolf Valentino, so the huge silent movie star"
00:24:47,00:24:52,"He died in 1926 when he was 31, and a hundred thousand people went to his funeral"
00:24:52,00:24:58,"There were these massive riots outside the funeral parlour, and people were struggling, climbing over each other to get a glimpse of him"
00:24:58,00:25:06,"It was an open casket, and there were these four guards who looked, there was this claim at the time that Mussolini had sent four fascist guards"
00:25:06,00:25:10,"And remember, it was 1926, they didn't have the connotations they do now"
00:25:10,00:25:12,Four fascist guards to guard
00:25:12,00:25:14,"They were widely seen as friendly and good guys, but not nobody"
00:25:14,00:25:20,"But actually, they'd been hired as actors by the funeral parlour to make it seem more dramatic"
00:25:20,00:25:27,"And his girlfriend, Valentino's girlfriend, was a woman called Polar Negri, and she really hammed it up"
00:25:27,00:25:35,"So she fainted on his coffin during the funeral, just fainted on top of it, came round, said the sad thing is he just proposed to me"
00:25:35,00:25:39,"And therefore I'm actually, he's basically his widow, and then she fainted again"
00:25:39,00:25:44,"She fainted multiple times, the coffin made this five-day trip from New York to California"
00:25:44,00:25:48,"And she accompanied it the whole time, just constantly fainting"
00:25:48,00:25:51,Dozens of times of five days
00:25:51,00:25:57,"Yeah, I read that because there were so many fans going to the casket, they were worried that it might damage the body"
00:25:57,00:26:03,"And so the people who were in charge of the funeral, there was a company called Campbell's"
00:26:03,00:26:08,They put a wax model in its place because they thought that it would get damaged
00:26:08,00:26:09,Wow!
00:26:09,00:26:10,Really?
00:26:10,00:26:12,"Wow, something quickly unlateness"
00:26:12,00:26:20,"So people who are chronically late, according to a new report, have better mental and physical health"
00:26:20,00:26:23,They live longer and they're more successful
00:26:23,00:26:24,Hey
00:26:24,00:26:30,"Apparently, this is because late people tend to be both optimistic and unrealistic"
00:26:30,00:26:39,And having especially an optimistic outlook can give you a better mental health and a better physical health and lower your rate of death
00:26:39,00:26:44,I do find lateness across cultures quite interesting because people get so angry
00:26:44,00:26:50,Because I'm chronically late and I think it's going to shorten my life because it's so anxiety-inducing
00:26:50,00:26:53,But people get so angry about it in our culture
00:26:53,00:26:57,"They're like, you're a selfish evil bastard who doesn't care about other people"
00:26:57,00:26:58,"Guys, guys, yeah"
00:26:58,00:27:00,That's why it's in the heat of the moment
00:27:00,00:27:04,"But then if you go to Brazil for instance, the culture's completely different"
00:27:04,00:27:10,So there was a blog by a writer who lived in Brazil for a few years and she said she was invited to her first party
00:27:10,00:27:13,She turned up about five minutes after the time the party started
00:27:13,00:27:17,"And the host was like, she knocked on the door and had to get the host out of the shower"
00:27:17,00:27:21,And it was extremely awkward and she sat around for about two hours thinking what's going on
00:27:21,00:27:24,"And everyone turned up about three, four hours later"
00:27:24,00:27:27,And then she spoke to a professor about it afterwards
00:27:27,00:27:32,"And professor said, in Brazil, turning up on time for a party is almost as awkward as turning up to a party"
00:27:32,00:27:35,"But where you haven't been invited at all, it's a massive faux pas"
00:27:35,00:27:41,And they have a thing in Brazil called aura inglesa which means turning up on time
00:27:41,00:27:45,And it means keeping the English hour as any fucking turn up at the aura inglesa
00:27:45,00:27:51,We need to move on to our final fact of the show and that is Andy
00:27:51,00:27:56,My fact is that Mexico has a national championship of double entendres
00:27:56,00:28:06,"And it's a big one, so buckle up"
00:28:06,00:28:12,And so there was this thing in Mexico called Albert which is a play on words
00:28:12,00:28:14,And it's almost always sexual
00:28:14,00:28:20,And there are lots and lots of different ways that you can make things sound slightly rude
00:28:20,00:28:24,And you combine words to make new meanings or you use words with similar sounds
00:28:24,00:28:29,And they have a competition every year to find the best Albert eros or word playmasters in the country
00:28:29,00:28:33,Can I give you an example of an Alberter?
00:28:33,00:28:36,What is the difference between a chair and an octopus?
00:28:36,00:28:42,The octopus has tentacles and the chair touches backs actually works better in Spanish
00:28:42,00:28:44,"No, it doesn't"
00:28:44,00:28:49,Because touching backsides or touching bumps is tentaculos
00:28:49,00:28:56,And tentaculos is tent I've really fucked this up
00:28:56,00:28:59,That's great
00:28:59,00:29:02,I don't know if you'd win that championship
00:29:02,00:29:04,"It's really intense, so you have..."
00:29:04,00:29:08,Someone gives you an Albert and then you have five seconds to come up with another one in return
00:29:08,00:29:11,Playing off what they've said to you or you get knocked out
00:29:11,00:29:13,"Like time chest, do you hit like a..."
00:29:13,00:29:14,It is like time chest exactly
00:29:14,00:29:15,That's so cool
00:29:15,00:29:23,"So for many, many years it was dominated completely by men and then suddenly this one lady, Lordez Ruiz, came along"
00:29:23,00:29:28,"And she's been the reigning champion for years and years, no one can do anything to outdo her"
00:29:28,00:29:30,"Yeah, like over 20 years, isn't it?"
00:29:30,00:29:32,She's the queen of Albert
00:29:32,00:29:36,"Which is amazing because it's a massively male thing, quite misogynistic thing"
00:29:36,00:29:40,"Women were kind of excluded from it, it's like lots of men making incredibly crude jokes"
00:29:40,00:29:47,"Like women's expense and yeah, she's penetrated that circle"
00:29:47,00:29:50,"But yeah, it has quite long history, doesn't it?"
00:29:50,00:29:53,This sort of word battles and battles of wits
00:29:53,00:29:57,"So there's a thing called ""Flighting"" which I don't know people know about"
00:29:57,00:30:00,But basically this is traditional battles of wits
00:30:00,00:30:03,Which I've been going on since at least the fifth century
00:30:03,00:30:06,And these were basically an exchange of insults
00:30:06,00:30:09,And it was a form of entertainment historically
00:30:09,00:30:12,It was a largely a Scottish thing
00:30:12,00:30:15,And very famous lasted a thousand years from the fifth to the 16th century
00:30:15,00:30:16,So over millennium
00:30:16,00:30:24,"And one of the famous ""Flighting incidents"" that was this event called the ""Flighting of Dunbar and Kennedy"""
00:30:24,00:30:27,And this is in the 16th century and it was a court-flighting
00:30:27,00:30:30,"So it was done for James IV, I think, to entertain him"
00:30:30,00:30:34,And it was these two characters insulting each other
00:30:34,00:30:37,And it was the first time anyone ever called someone else a shit
00:30:37,00:30:39,Really?
00:30:39,00:30:42,Surely the first time we have on record
00:30:42,00:30:45,"First on record, called a shit without a wit"
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Oh, that's good"
00:30:46,00:30:48,I've got a few more lines from it
00:30:48,00:30:52,So this is one little verse that one person would say
00:30:52,00:30:56,"""Gray visaged gallows bird out of your wits gone wild"
00:30:56,00:30:58,Loathe some and lousy as wet as a crest
00:30:58,00:31:01,Since you with worship would so feign be styled
00:31:01,00:31:06,"Hail Monsignor, your ball of droop below your dress"
00:31:06,00:31:08,"That's good, isn't it?"
00:31:08,00:31:13,"There are some other examples of this kind of ""Flighting"" and ""Rap Battle"" and kind of stuff like that"
00:31:13,00:31:20,"So the Iwi people in Ghana, they had a type of poetry called Halo"
00:31:20,00:31:23,"And again, it's a way of judging disputes"
00:31:23,00:31:25,And it's a way of insulting each other
00:31:25,00:31:28,But you said that you had five seconds in this other one
00:31:28,00:31:31,"In this one, you have a couple of weeks in between insults"
00:31:31,00:31:35,And instead of just kind of coming up with ideas off the top of your head
00:31:35,00:31:40,You actually do actual research into the family history of your enemy
00:31:40,00:31:44,And you look into what their grandparents did and the great grandparents did
00:31:44,00:31:46,And find the best nuggets that you could use against them
00:31:46,00:31:49,Would you go around sort of interviewing their best friends going
00:31:49,00:31:52,Would you say he's a bit of a dick?
00:31:52,00:31:55,I've been looking up in New Endo in general
00:31:55,00:31:59,And so there was a thing about a butcher in Staffordshire
00:31:59,00:32:01,He was asked by this year I think
00:32:01,00:32:04,He was asked by the police to remove signs outside his butcher's shop
00:32:04,00:32:08,Because he said he advertised a big fresh cock
00:32:08,00:32:11,Which is basically a single entendre of this guy's got
00:32:11,00:32:16,And he also offered on a sign the chance to have your rump tenderised before you leave
00:32:16,00:32:24,And the Guardian reported that arguably more offensive was his flagrant use of the green gross as apostrophe
00:32:24,00:32:30,And the police appear unwilling to take action over that
00:32:30,00:32:35,And they had this whole thing about you know in New Endo
00:32:35,00:32:37,So there's a comedian called Stephen Bailey
00:32:37,00:32:39,And it's all about context and who's making the joke
00:32:39,00:32:42,So Stephen Bailey is the stand up who has a lot of explicit material
00:32:42,00:32:43,He's gay himself
00:32:43,00:32:47,And the Guardian reported that Bailey's show contains explicit sexual material
00:32:47,00:32:49,But again it's all about context
00:32:49,00:32:53,The same jokes told by Roy Chubby Brown or the late Bernard Manning
00:32:53,00:32:54,Would sound aggressive
00:32:54,00:32:57,Whereas Bailey's ejaculations are far easier to swallow
00:32:57,00:33:02,Super
00:33:02,00:33:03,So bad
00:33:03,00:33:06,There's a book actually called Away With Words
00:33:06,00:33:09,Which is written by a guy called Joe Birkowitz
00:33:09,00:33:11,And this is basically puns that we're talking about
00:33:11,00:33:14,And he travelled around the world visiting pun contest
00:33:14,00:33:18,"And the biggest one is the Oh Henry Panoff in Austin, Texas"
00:33:18,00:33:21,Started in 1978 and it's the world championship of punning
00:33:21,00:33:24,And so they have onstage referees during this
00:33:24,00:33:26,And referees can immediately disqualify someone
00:33:26,00:33:29,If they use what they consider subpar wordplay
00:33:29,00:33:33,So I think it has something like that would be you know if you use like
00:33:33,00:33:36,Excellent if you're talking about a normal or something
00:33:36,00:33:38,I imagine that would get boot off stage
00:33:38,00:33:40,What because you're slightly tweaking
00:33:40,00:33:42,No I think it's just like you think that's really shit
00:33:42,00:33:44,That's like not up to the standards
00:33:44,00:33:47,It's like if someone does an on-dram serve or something in tennis
00:33:47,00:33:50,But he said he was going through the best puns he heard in the contest
00:33:50,00:33:54,And sadly for this pun to work you have to know there's a kind of cherry called a Bing cherry
00:33:54,00:33:58,Which I didn't know what kind of cherry a Bing Bing in Chandler Bing
00:33:58,00:34:00,"Okay, Bing cherry"
00:34:00,00:34:02,He said the best pun he heard was
00:34:02,00:34:05,I went to go shopping for cherries and microphones the other day
00:34:05,00:34:07,"But a Bing, but a boom"
00:34:07,00:34:11,Yeah
00:34:11,00:34:14,I mean you still did have to explain it before we started
00:34:14,00:34:17,Well the economist did a thing where they said actually some of the best puns
00:34:17,00:34:20,You do have to explain because they're quite complex and layered
00:34:20,00:34:25,And it used the example of the one about Mahatma Gandhi who walked barefoot a lot
00:34:25,00:34:28,And often fasted which led to bad breath
00:34:28,00:34:33,Thus making him a super-calus fragile mystic hex by halitosis
00:34:33,00:34:37,Sometimes it's worth the build up
00:34:37,00:34:39,We're going to have to wrap up very shortly guys
00:34:39,00:34:43,Oh I found a couple of weird fiesters just because this is a Mexican fiester
00:34:43,00:34:46,So they've got incredible fiesters over there
00:34:46,00:34:49,But I did find a British equivalent which I think is one I would like to go to this
00:34:49,00:34:52,There's a Sussex pub called Lewis Arms
00:34:52,00:34:56,And it hosts every year the world P-throwing championships
00:34:56,00:35:02,And the record at the time of recording is 44 metres for throwing a single P
00:35:02,00:35:04,And I think that's amazing
00:35:04,00:35:07,"That's incredible, not with your bare arm"
00:35:07,00:35:10,"Yeah, with your bare arm throwing a P because obviously they're..."
00:35:10,00:35:12,There's a lot of air resistances
00:35:12,00:35:15,"There's a lot of air resistances, not that they're heavy or hard to throw"
00:35:15,00:35:20,"But, so the winner, the 2015 winner, Greg Butterworth, he said"
00:35:20,00:35:25,"""You've got to make sure you pick a P that has few indents because that affects its aerodynamic qualities"""
00:35:25,00:35:30,But I think it's really impressive because it's impossible to tell where they land
00:35:30,00:35:33,So that's the real talent in the P-throwing championships
00:35:33,00:35:37,And they have P spotters all the way along the route
00:35:37,00:35:39,Assessing where the P's land
00:35:39,00:35:40,Wow
00:35:40,00:35:41,That's so good
00:35:41,00:35:43,It does not sound like a full-time job
00:35:43,00:35:47,"What if the competitors said, ""I was the first to throw so I was briefly the world champion"""
00:35:47,00:35:50,Although it did not last long but it was nice while it lasted
00:35:50,00:35:54,It's fundamentally failing to understand what being the world champion means
00:35:54,00:35:56,I found a guy who...
00:35:56,00:36:00,"Well, I found a competition which is the French PIG squealing championship"
00:36:00,00:36:03,And the idea is that you just have to squeal as...
00:36:03,00:36:06,"Well, it's kind of on the tin, isn't it? It's a French PIG squealing championship"
00:36:06,00:36:09,"So you're making the squeal, you're not making a PIG squeal"
00:36:09,00:36:14,"Yeah, you yourself are making the squeal, so people come up and they start squealing"
00:36:14,00:36:18,And there's a guy called Noel Jeanette and he has won it twice
00:36:18,00:36:22,"For his excellent PIG squeals, he comes dressed as a PIG as well"
00:36:22,00:36:25,"It's a sort of really method, very nice"
00:36:25,00:36:28,"And he's won it twice, he's won twice as well"
00:36:28,00:36:34,The international championships for the PIG grunter at the agricultural shows in 2007-2008
00:36:34,00:36:37,"And it's a big thing in France, I say it's big, it's not big"
00:36:37,00:36:46,"There's also the weird festival that I like, championship that I like, is the Naki Sumo Baby Crying Festival in Japan"
00:36:46,00:36:49,"So I didn't know about this, this is in Tokyo, it takes place in a temple"
00:36:49,00:36:51,Although there are other versions around Japan
00:36:51,00:36:55,"And the idea is that you bring your baby as a parent, you bring your baby to this festival"
00:36:55,00:36:59,And it will get paired up with a Sumo wrestler who tries to make it cry
00:36:59,00:37:02,And the one who makes the baby cry the most is the winner
00:37:02,00:37:11,"And the Sumo wrestler, the Sumo wrestler has various tactics, so one thing they might do is they might wear a scary mask"
00:37:11,00:37:17,"To make the baby cry, although apparently often they just repeatedly shout the word ""cry"" in its face"
00:37:17,00:37:23,"Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts, thank you so much for listening"
