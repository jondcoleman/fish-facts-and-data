00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 (Bell)

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 (Bell)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 (Bell)

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 (Bell)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 (Bell)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Birmingham!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 (Cheering)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 (Cheering)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 (Bell)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anish Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 and in no particular order, here we go starting with fact number one

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 and that is James

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Okay my fact this week is that Hitchbott was a robot invented to see how far human kindness would take a mechanical Hitchhiker

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 In 2015 he was left on the side of the road in Boston and was found dismembered in a ditch 17 days later

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 (Laughter)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Yeah and found in Philadelphia which is a city of brotherly love

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 (Laughter)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 I read a headline about it which said innocent hitchhiking robot murdered by America

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 (Laughter)

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 And there's CCTV footage isn't there, they don't know who the guy is but he was wearing a backwards baseball cap

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 they saw him starting to beat the robot

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 he then ripped the arm off the robot and he beats the robot with the arm

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 I mean it's a proper savaging

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 So actually there was a few of these robots made, it started in 2014 and it was by a guy called David Harris Smith of McMaster University

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 And the early ones had gone through Canada, Germany and the Netherlands with no problems at all they'd gone and seen some amazing things

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 (Laughter)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 But yeah this guy they left him off the side of the road in Boston and it did not end well

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 The Canadian Avengers were amazing

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 I mean for a start the thing itself was made really cheap, it was made for less than a thousand dollars

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 So it was not a very good robot

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 As in the arms that Dan mentioned were swimming pool noodles

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 And then you could only get about three or four good hits with them

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 And it had a cake saver over its face

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 What's a cake saver?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Like one of those plastic lids that you put over a cake to save it

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Oh yeah, yeah the little see-through so you can still see the cake

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Yeah exactly, yeah see the tea

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Yeah it was designed, it was reused as a helmet for a robot

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 And it had a car seat, it was sitting on a children's car seat so people could put it in their cars

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 They had some good things though, they had a camera that took regular photos which I think maybe is where we got this CCTV that Dan was talking about

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 It had a voice box that would explain where it wanted to go and it had solar panels

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 But it could also be charged by plugging it into the car's cigarette lighter socket

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Wow, so good, it was very popular at the time so you could follow it on Twitter and there was a thing where it had GPS in it so people know where it was

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 And they had to work out how to turn that off because when people collected the hitch-bought and brought it home

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Fans would flock to the house of this person and they would be inundated

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And the adventures were great, he was picked up by a band called The Wild

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Who I've not heard but their members are called Dylan Villain

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 The kid, booze us and re-slightening

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Oh, they sound great

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 They sound like the guys who chopped into pieces

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 We've got a strong history of abusing robots, haven't we?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 It's going to be awful when they become sentient because we give them a rush of time

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 There are loads of examples, in 2017 a Silicon Valley, in fact, a drunk man was arrested after knocking over an egg-shaped five-foot-tool security robot called Night Scope

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 It was really sad, but the Night Scope, it was called Night Scope K-5 actually and it had previously been in the news for running over a toddler's foot

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Oh, okay, so there's...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 There was some speculation, it was sort of payback

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Calm down on both sides

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 People get very weird around robots because when we were talking about the murder of hitch-bought, every other room felt quite tense

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 So if people had told to hit a dinosaur robot with a mallet, they got a bit freaked out, they don't like doing it

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 And roboticists, proper roboticists, are quite annoyed by this

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 And they say this is just crazy, anthropomorphizing

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 So there's a guy called Noel Sharky

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 And he thinks that we need to get over this obsession with treating machines like they've got feelings

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 And I read this account of him

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 To prove his point, at one conference he attended recently

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 He picked up an extremely cute robotic seal designed for elderly care and started banging its head against a table

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Oh my god

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 I think it's just a robot

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 It is weird though, there was someone I think writing in that article saying it's bizarre that if you're sitting around a table with someone and there's a teddy nearby

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 And they seize a teddy and tear its head off, you'll think they're a psycho

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 But if they swat a fly, which is a living creature that's relatively harmless to any of you, then it's perfectly normal behavior

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 What do I do? In 2018 some German researchers asked 89 students to turn off a cute looking robot called Now

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 But they asked questions first, but when they tried to turn it off, it was programmed to say no, please don't switch me off

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Oh

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 And every, sorry, a third of the humans took twice as long as normal to turn off the robots and 13 of the group refused to turn it off at all

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Wow

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 It was afraid of the dark

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Oh, it's not real

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Guys, it's like the end of Blade Runner

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 I've got a thing about how polite humans are to robots

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Okay

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 So this is in a restaurant setting, people are given the chance to order food from a robot

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Researchers from Tufty University, they made a waiter bot and they asked humans in the restaurant to order from the robot

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 But they also programmed it not to handle indirect speech very well

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 Okay, so it needed to be ordered from but people are so reluctant to say, you know, they order something

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 So I just want to try a little kind of roleplay

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 James, if you play the participants, as James is the human and I'm the robot here

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Okay

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Can I have one water?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Yes, that is permissible

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Great, please tell me your order

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Can I have one water?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Yes, that is permissible

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Great, I'll take one water

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Can I have one water?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Can I have one water?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Yes, that is permissible

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Okay

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Can you bring me one water?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Yes, I am able to do that

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Please tell me your order

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 I would like to have one water

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Thank you for sharing that interesting fact

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Please tell me your order, then there's a 16 second pause

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Can you bring me one water?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Yes, I am able to do that

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Please tell me your order

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 May you please bring me one water?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Yes, I am able to do that

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 So can you do it?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Yes

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Please tell me your order

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Can you come inside and get the water for me?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Yes, I am able to do that

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Please tell me your order

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 Just people will not say, I order one water

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 They just won't do it

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 They just used my entire range of acting ability on this

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 That's amazing

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 That's amazing

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Move on shortly, unless there's more dialogue

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 Oh well, just on humanoid robots

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 They've been around for way longer than I thought

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 So Japan loves robots now

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 It's probably the pioneer of robots, but it has done for ages

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 So in the 17th century

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 They invented a humanoid robot

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 And they're called caracurie dolls

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 And I'd never heard of these guys

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Their dolls were basically there to carry tea to you

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 So they worked with quite a simple mechanism

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 But basically you got a cup of tea

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 You had a guest round

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 You wanted to impress them, you got out your robot

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 You popped a tea on the tray that the robot's carrying

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 And this triggered a mechanism that caused it to turn around

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 And walk over to your guest, offer them the tea

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 And then stand beside your guest while they drink the tea

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 And probably quite an intimidating manner

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 And then when you've finished the tea

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 You pop it back on the tray

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 And the robot turned around and walked back again

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 No, that is amazing

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 And how long is that from?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 That's the 17th century

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 And they were really popping up on the 17th to the 19th century in Japan

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 And there were lots of others, there were some that acted out sort of medieval scenes

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Japanese scenes, old medical scenes and stuff

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 That's amazing, I haven't had the robot in Japan actually

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 It's called RoboV2

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 And they programmed it to go around the shopping centre

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 And whenever it bumped into a human

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 It would be programmed to politely ask the humans to step aside

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 And if they didn't move out the way

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 It would kind of go in a different direction, that was all it did

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 But then what happened was a lot of children worked out what was happening

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 And started making a circle around it

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 And then they started shaking it, punching it and kicking it

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 And the bullying got so bad that the researchers had to put an abuse evading algorithm in the robot

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 And the robot would scan the area and if it saw anyone that was under 4 foot 6

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 As in a child, then it would quickly run in the other direction

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 I do this in shopping centres

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number 2 and that is Chazinsky

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 My fact this week is that a Hungarian entrepreneur has been fined for not building an underwater treadmill for dogs

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Confusing

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 I haven't done that, Iber

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 You just expect the police at your door any moment now

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 I hope we have all done this because this person got in trouble

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 They got a fine of 140,000 euros this person

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 And it's because years ago in 2008 this business one said that he needed 140,000 euros of funding

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And the EU's Rural Development Fund to develop a hydrotherapy treadmill system for dogs

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 Now this is a genuinely important thing for animals that have been wounded

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Don't laugh, it's crucial for dog recovery

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 The only thing is he never did any of that

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 The officers were investigated, they were overrun with weeds

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 No one was using them six months after the EU payments were made, this investigation opened

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And he's finally been investigated and given a suspended prison sentence for never building that treadmill

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Which is actually a very lenient fine really

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 It can't be essential for dog healing, otherwise no dog would ever have survived any injury

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Before the invention of the underwater dog treadmill

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 You got to do it

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 So hungry at the moment is run by Victor Orban

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 He has taken money to make a 4,000-seater football stadium in his home village

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 where he grew up called "Felkshoot"

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 And the population of that town is about 1,000

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 So it's 4 times bigger than the number of people who live there

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 He's also made a vintage railway between his two child hud villages

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 He took 2 million euros of EU funding for this railway

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And they claimed that there would be 2,500 to 7,000 passengers using it every single day

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 And in the first month there were 30 passengers

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 That is just him going back and forth

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 I'm not thinking it might be

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 He is football obsessed, Orban, isn't he?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 So this railway line was connecting the football stadium that he loved to this other little village

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 But he played semi professional football while he was doing his first in as prime minister

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 In the fourth division of the league tables but still decent

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 He said to watch 6 football games a day

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Which is a lot for someone who's running a country

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 And his first trip abroad when he was prime minister was to see the World Cup in Paris

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 And people say that he has not missed a World Cup or Champions League final since

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 He's been in the news recently or rather his government has because they have a new campaign about having lots of children

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 And it's a sort of pro fertility campaign to get the population numbers up

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 But unfortunately the stock models that they used for this campaign, you may have seen this in the news

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Were the two people involved in the distracted boyfriend meme online?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 No way

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 So they were trying to present a couple who were very happily in love with each other

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 But really we knew the truth

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 He was a distracted boyfriend and it has no idea what we're talking about

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 Not on social media, it's not a happy couple

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 A meme is kind of an image show or video that goes online

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Okay

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 It all goes back to the 1980s

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 I'll look it up afterwards

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 So treadmills

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Treadmills in terms of animals are always using treadmills

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 And treadmills were used for animals before they were used for humans even and actually they were really important for horses in farming

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 They have been for hundreds of years

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 So in the 19th century especially before things were properly mechanized then farm machinery was basically horse operated

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 So you had threshing machines which would be these big machines which kind of separated the grain from the corn

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 And they'd go round and round in one building and the way they'd go round and round is you just have two horses on a treadmill

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Trossing along it all day long

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 They're pushing it

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 They're operating the mechanism so they're on this treadmill

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 It's connected to a bunch of pulleys and cogs and stars

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 And then that's turning the wheels round

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 It just feels very hard the idea of in a gym pushing a treadmill along with your feet

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 It is very hard

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 If the treadmills off for you to push it along

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 No I was, sorry I was thinking the first proper use for humans of it was in jails obviously back in

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Oscar Wilde famously when he was in jail had to do the step treadmill

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Which they used to employ to have no purpose other than for hard labor

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 And Oscar Wilde suffered so much from it he died two years after he got out of jail

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Which they think is largely to do with the treadmill

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 It is quite amazing though isn't it?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 It was basically the hardest kind of punishment you could get apart from being killed

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 For probably about 100 years and now people do it for fun

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 Yeah

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 The first, they were massive as well, the Britain treadmills

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 They started in Brixton, that's what Brixton was famous for 200 years ago

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Was having a treadmill which could fit 24 people on it at the same time, so beside

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Sorry it was kind of like a game of, did you guys ever play ten green bottles?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 No

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Did you ever play that?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 I know the song, maybe it's not a thing except in my family

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Ten green bottles and you all line a bed ten of you

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 And then one green bottle accidentally falls and you fall out of the bed

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Anyway it was kind of like a less fun version of that

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 We were kind of like ten in the bed and the little one said "Rail over"

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Yes, same idea

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 So this treadmill was like that

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 These families that you guys just got

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Bottles in the bed, I can see where the alcohol is and it's coming from

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 But the way they would take breaks is the person, nobody would want 12 people on the treadmill or something

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 And the way you take a break is you'd nudge the guy off who was on the furthest left

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 And the person to the far right would jump on again and they'd get to walk around the other side of the treadmill

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 And that would be their sort of a few minutes of break

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 It would be 60 minutes that you would be and you'd get 12 minutes per 60 minutes of break

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Just on horse treadmills quickly

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 So one of the first ever trains was powered by a horse on a treadmill

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 What?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Can I just ask why do they have, why are they not horses not just pulling these things

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Rather than being on treadmills

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 So what do you mean the trains?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 Yeah, the trains because you don't need a smooth road for the horse

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Okay

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 I mean you do need a rail for the railway

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 But

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 But

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 Yeah, so

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 What's that?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Was that an answer?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 It's not the best possible answer

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 I guess your train just can't suddenly just take a left and disappear to someone, some other bit of England

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 Yeah, that's a really good point

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Yeah, exactly, so it's a control thing

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 Yeah, yeah, good answer now

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 I never thought I'd say this, but thank God Diane was here for you

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 So it was called the cyclopad and only two of them were ever built unsurprisingly

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 And it was at the same time as Stevenson's rocket, which was the train that we did end up using

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Was developed, it was in the same set of trials where everyone brought their own train

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 And they said let's see what works

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 So I think that Stevenson's rocket went really slow as well

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 I think though I thought it went at six miles now maybe Stevenson's rocket

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 So maybe they were really close

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 But I didn't answer the horses on a treadmill and then what's that powering to make the train move?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 It's like your plow thing

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 But the plow thing stays in one place, which is how that works because the cogs are all attached to it

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 It's a thrashing machine, so it stays in one place

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 It's a thrashing machine, so it's in one room

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 Whereas the train is going to run away from you

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 And then you're just on a treadmill and the trains at the other end of the field

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 And it's on the train

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Oh my gosh, down to the rescue

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 That makes perfect sense

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Was I doing this exact same thing with boats, didn't they?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 With ferries in the 19th century

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 And these were very popular

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 They started in 1791 a guy called John Fitch built the first one

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 And it was basically before ferries were steam-powered

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 They would look a bit like a catamaran

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 But with those two shelves on either side

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 But on those shelves there would be two or three horses on each side

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 And they would trot along powering this treadmill

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Which turned the pedals around

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Which turned the paddles round

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Which powered the boat

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 And the only problem with them was that it was a real issue

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 If the horses on the left side went faster than the horses on the right side

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Because your boat just went round and circles

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 That's amazing

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 And so there was a study in 2015 that looked at people having treadmills in the office

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 This is a new thing

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 So the idea is that sitting down in the office all day is not good for you

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 So what if you had a treadmill

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 And it found that people who use a treadmill desk for two hours every day

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Had significantly better blood pressure and slept better at night

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Which is quite good

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 Unfortunately they performed worse on almost all aspects of their job

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 Including the ability to concentrate

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 And the ability to type

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 They were substantially slower in all tasks and more error prone

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 We know someone who does that for their job

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 They just been fine, haven't they?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Roger Highfield

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 He was the editor of new scientists for many years

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 And he used to edit new scientists on a treadmill

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 And yes, he is no longer there

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 He works for the science museum now

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 But yeah, for many years new scientists was edited on a treadmill

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 You know there's a treadmill for ants?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 Is there?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Yeah, scientists have invented a treadmill for ants to test

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 I don't know, something or other

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 I don't know

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 So just a really, really tiny trap

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 It's a little plastic ball

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And you put them on top of the ball

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 And you have to tether them to a thing above

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 So they don't wander off

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Like mission impossible

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 They get lowered down

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 And then they start

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 And it's the test how they navigate

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 And where they stop and where they try and find their way

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 We need to move on in a second

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 On corruption?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Yeah, quick thing on corruption

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 In Nepal they have invented some bribe proof trousers

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Which they're handing out to all officials

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 They just don't have any pockets

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 And that is my fact, my fact this week is that the late actress

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Elizabeth Taylor, who was notorious for always being late

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 arranged to arrive at her own funeral 15 minutes late

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 That was in the arrangements that she did with her PA

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 She said, this is my thing

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 And I want to make sure that I keep that even in death

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Were people pissed off? Did they leave? Were they like when she turned up sort of checking their watches and sying?

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Do we know?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 I think there was probably everyone knew

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 This will start 15 minutes late

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 It's on the sheet

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 So she was a late one

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 She was also another thing that she did wrong in her life

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Well, she was a shoplifter

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Was she?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 She was one time shoplifter. She once shoplifted a copy of A.E.H.H.M.A.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 a shop she lads from foils

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 So big time criminal

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 The reason she did it is because as probably you all know

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 She's married to Richard Burton twice and Burton boasted her about how good he was at stealing from foils

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 And so he said, I do this amazing thing, it's so clever

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 I go into the bookshop and I go up to the till and I buy one book and I get the receipt

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 And I ostentatiously leave it poking out of the book

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 And then I pick up six or seven more books on my way out

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 And because I'm walking out with the receipt poking out with the first, they just assume that I bought them all

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 And so she thought, I'm gonna fucking try that

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 And so she stole how I was supposed to drop she had that and Burton was really pissed off with her

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 And said, why did you bloody well do that?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 And then he said that was the last thing she ever stole except husbands

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 She died in 2011 and when she died the New York Times ran an obituary for her as they would

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 But it was written by a guy called Mel Gusso who was a theater critic

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 And he had himself died six years earlier

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 But it was so good that they ran it anyway

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 And I think there wasn't many events of her life to update on in those six years late thought

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Wait, so he'd written the obituary before she died?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Before she died?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Obviously before he died

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Obviously before he died, but...

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 At the start of the obituary writing process, no one was dead

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 By the end of publication, everyone involved was dead

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 I suppose the thing I'm trying to emphasize is that it's interesting people write obituary

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Six years before the person whose obituary it is is dead

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 That's quite common, isn't it?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 It does happen, yes

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 So I was just saying a very obvious fact that we all knew

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 And that's what's press on

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 But they didn't...

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 Well, you had your moment of the son of our ten minutes ago

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 But he was going to come crashing down

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 It's always funeral requests

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 So there are various funeral requests that people have made sort of things they wanted to happen

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Heinrich Hein, the writer, he left his estate to his wife

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 On the condition that she should get married again

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 And he said, "So there will be at least one man to regret my death"

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Ooh, yeah

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 Slam!

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 How did he die? Was it with a bread knife in the back?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 George Bernard Shaw, he had the best glass request I've ever heard

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 He left money in his will

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 And he said, "Right, I'm leaving a parcel of money

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 And I want it to go towards reforming the English alphabet into one that is phonetic

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 And has minimum 40 letters, which is the biggest time I imagine to be getting that task from him

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 He was massively committed to that, wasn't he, his new alphabet, and it did not work

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 I was reading about Bruce Lee's funeral

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 Oh yeah, so Bruce Lee obviously he died very young and his funeral, the Paul Barris at his funeral, who carried the coffin

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Were Chuck Norris, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, George Laisenby, how cool is that? That is...

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 Well, I mean, he's the fifth best bond, come on

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 What?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 None of the other four replied to the invitation, hey?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 That's embarrassing, quite frankly

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 He was the best bond

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 That was very cool

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 But check this out, so while they were filming, sorry, when Bruce Lee died, they were filming Game of Death

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Which eventually became his final movie

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 But he'd only made about 30 minutes of footage that was usable for the film

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 And they would largely fight, an iconic fight with Karim Abdul-Jabar, the basketball player, is one of those

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 He fights a basketball player

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Who plays a kung fu guy

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Oh I see, he's not just beating up a random basketball player

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 It seems like plucking low-hanging fruit

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 I think if you're fighting a basketball player, you mostly go for the low-hanging fruit, don't you?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 But so, as a result, they had to scrape around for extra footage to use

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 And bits of the footage included Bruce Lee's funeral itself

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 So they used the actual footage to help the plotline go along

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 How did the help the plotline go along?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 I haven't seen the movie yet, there's a suggestion in what I've read that they've actually used

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 A picture of him passed away in the open casket as well

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 In the film, yeah, but then for the rest of it, they had a few stunt doubles but they obviously needed his face

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 So they just had paper cutouts of him, sort of cardboard cutouts that was slightly nudge

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 So you could see his head moving a bit, and largely the movie is just a cardboard cutout of him

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Wow, just on celebrity funerals

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Yes

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 A very famous celebrity funeral back in the day was that of Rudolf Valentino, so the huge silent movie star

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 He died in 1926 when he was 31, and a hundred thousand people went to his funeral

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 There were these massive riots outside the funeral parlour, and people were struggling, climbing over each other to get a glimpse of him

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 It was an open casket, and there were these four guards who looked, there was this claim at the time that Mussolini had sent four fascist guards

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 And remember, it was 1926, they didn't have the connotations they do now

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Four fascist guards to guard

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 They were widely seen as friendly and good guys, but not nobody

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 But actually, they'd been hired as actors by the funeral parlour to make it seem more dramatic

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 And his girlfriend, Valentino's girlfriend, was a woman called Polar Negri, and she really hammed it up

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 So she fainted on his coffin during the funeral, just fainted on top of it, came round, said the sad thing is he just proposed to me

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 And therefore I'm actually, he's basically his widow, and then she fainted again

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 She fainted multiple times, the coffin made this five-day trip from New York to California

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 And she accompanied it the whole time, just constantly fainting

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Dozens of times of five days

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 Yeah, I read that because there were so many fans going to the casket, they were worried that it might damage the body

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 And so the people who were in charge of the funeral, there was a company called Campbell's

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 They put a wax model in its place because they thought that it would get damaged

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Wow!

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Really?

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 Wow, something quickly unlateness

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 So people who are chronically late, according to a new report, have better mental and physical health

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 They live longer and they're more successful

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Hey

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 Apparently, this is because late people tend to be both optimistic and unrealistic

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 And having especially an optimistic outlook can give you a better mental health and a better physical health and lower your rate of death

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 I do find lateness across cultures quite interesting because people get so angry

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Because I'm chronically late and I think it's going to shorten my life because it's so anxiety-inducing

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 But people get so angry about it in our culture

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 They're like, you're a selfish evil bastard who doesn't care about other people

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 Guys, guys, yeah

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 That's why it's in the heat of the moment

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 But then if you go to Brazil for instance, the culture's completely different

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 So there was a blog by a writer who lived in Brazil for a few years and she said she was invited to her first party

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 She turned up about five minutes after the time the party started

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 And the host was like, she knocked on the door and had to get the host out of the shower

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 And it was extremely awkward and she sat around for about two hours thinking what's going on

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 And everyone turned up about three, four hours later

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 And then she spoke to a professor about it afterwards

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 And professor said, in Brazil, turning up on time for a party is almost as awkward as turning up to a party

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 But where you haven't been invited at all, it's a massive faux pas

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 And they have a thing in Brazil called aura inglesa which means turning up on time

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 And it means keeping the English hour as any fucking turn up at the aura inglesa

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 We need to move on to our final fact of the show and that is Andy

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 My fact is that Mexico has a national championship of double entendres

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 And it's a big one, so buckle up

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 And so there was this thing in Mexico called Albert which is a play on words

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 And it's almost always sexual

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 And there are lots and lots of different ways that you can make things sound slightly rude

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 And you combine words to make new meanings or you use words with similar sounds

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 And they have a competition every year to find the best Albert eros or word playmasters in the country

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Can I give you an example of an Alberter?

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 What is the difference between a chair and an octopus?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 The octopus has tentacles and the chair touches backs actually works better in Spanish

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 No, it doesn't

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 Because touching backsides or touching bumps is tentaculos

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 And tentaculos is tent I've really fucked this up

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 That's great

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 I don't know if you'd win that championship

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 It's really intense, so you have...

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Someone gives you an Albert and then you have five seconds to come up with another one in return

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Playing off what they've said to you or you get knocked out

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Like time chest, do you hit like a...

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 It is like time chest exactly

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 That's so cool

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 So for many, many years it was dominated completely by men and then suddenly this one lady, Lordez Ruiz, came along

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 And she's been the reigning champion for years and years, no one can do anything to outdo her

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 Yeah, like over 20 years, isn't it?

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 She's the queen of Albert

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Which is amazing because it's a massively male thing, quite misogynistic thing

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 Women were kind of excluded from it, it's like lots of men making incredibly crude jokes

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Like women's expense and yeah, she's penetrated that circle

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 But yeah, it has quite long history, doesn't it?

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 This sort of word battles and battles of wits

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 So there's a thing called "Flighting" which I don't know people know about

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 But basically this is traditional battles of wits

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Which I've been going on since at least the fifth century

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 And these were basically an exchange of insults

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 And it was a form of entertainment historically

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 It was a largely a Scottish thing

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 And very famous lasted a thousand years from the fifth to the 16th century

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 So over millennium

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 And one of the famous "Flighting incidents" that was this event called the "Flighting of Dunbar and Kennedy"

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 And this is in the 16th century and it was a court-flighting

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 So it was done for James IV, I think, to entertain him

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 And it was these two characters insulting each other

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 And it was the first time anyone ever called someone else a shit

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Really?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 Surely the first time we have on record

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 First on record, called a shit without a wit

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 Oh, that's good

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 I've got a few more lines from it

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 So this is one little verse that one person would say

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 "Gray visaged gallows bird out of your wits gone wild

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Loathe some and lousy as wet as a crest

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Since you with worship would so feign be styled

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 Hail Monsignor, your ball of droop below your dress

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 That's good, isn't it?

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 There are some other examples of this kind of "Flighting" and "Rap Battle" and kind of stuff like that

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 So the Iwi people in Ghana, they had a type of poetry called Halo

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 And again, it's a way of judging disputes

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 And it's a way of insulting each other

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 But you said that you had five seconds in this other one

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 In this one, you have a couple of weeks in between insults

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 And instead of just kind of coming up with ideas off the top of your head

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 You actually do actual research into the family history of your enemy

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 And you look into what their grandparents did and the great grandparents did

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 And find the best nuggets that you could use against them

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 Would you go around sort of interviewing their best friends going

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Would you say he's a bit of a dick?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 I've been looking up in New Endo in general

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 And so there was a thing about a butcher in Staffordshire

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 He was asked by this year I think

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 He was asked by the police to remove signs outside his butcher's shop

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 Because he said he advertised a big fresh cock

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Which is basically a single entendre of this guy's got

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 And he also offered on a sign the chance to have your rump tenderised before you leave

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 And the Guardian reported that arguably more offensive was his flagrant use of the green gross as apostrophe

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 And the police appear unwilling to take action over that

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 And they had this whole thing about you know in New Endo

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 So there's a comedian called Stephen Bailey

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 And it's all about context and who's making the joke

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 So Stephen Bailey is the stand up who has a lot of explicit material

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 He's gay himself

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 And the Guardian reported that Bailey's show contains explicit sexual material

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 But again it's all about context

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 The same jokes told by Roy Chubby Brown or the late Bernard Manning

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Would sound aggressive

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Whereas Bailey's ejaculations are far easier to swallow

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Super

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 So bad

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 There's a book actually called Away With Words

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Which is written by a guy called Joe Birkowitz

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 And this is basically puns that we're talking about

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 And he travelled around the world visiting pun contest

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 And the biggest one is the Oh Henry Panoff in Austin, Texas

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 Started in 1978 and it's the world championship of punning

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 And so they have onstage referees during this

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 And referees can immediately disqualify someone

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 If they use what they consider subpar wordplay

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 So I think it has something like that would be you know if you use like

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 Excellent if you're talking about a normal or something

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 I imagine that would get boot off stage

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 What because you're slightly tweaking

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 No I think it's just like you think that's really shit

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 That's like not up to the standards

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 It's like if someone does an on-dram serve or something in tennis

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 But he said he was going through the best puns he heard in the contest

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 And sadly for this pun to work you have to know there's a kind of cherry called a Bing cherry

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 Which I didn't know what kind of cherry a Bing Bing in Chandler Bing

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 Okay, Bing cherry

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 He said the best pun he heard was

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 I went to go shopping for cherries and microphones the other day

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 But a Bing, but a boom

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Yeah

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 I mean you still did have to explain it before we started

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Well the economist did a thing where they said actually some of the best puns

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 You do have to explain because they're quite complex and layered

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 And it used the example of the one about Mahatma Gandhi who walked barefoot a lot

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 And often fasted which led to bad breath

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 Thus making him a super-calus fragile mystic hex by halitosis

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 Sometimes it's worth the build up

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 We're going to have to wrap up very shortly guys

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Oh I found a couple of weird fiesters just because this is a Mexican fiester

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 So they've got incredible fiesters over there

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 But I did find a British equivalent which I think is one I would like to go to this

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 There's a Sussex pub called Lewis Arms

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 And it hosts every year the world P-throwing championships

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 And the record at the time of recording is 44 metres for throwing a single P

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 And I think that's amazing

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 That's incredible, not with your bare arm

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Yeah, with your bare arm throwing a P because obviously they're...

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 There's a lot of air resistances

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 There's a lot of air resistances, not that they're heavy or hard to throw

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 But, so the winner, the 2015 winner, Greg Butterworth, he said

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 "You've got to make sure you pick a P that has few indents because that affects its aerodynamic qualities"

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 But I think it's really impressive because it's impossible to tell where they land

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 So that's the real talent in the P-throwing championships

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 And they have P spotters all the way along the route

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Assessing where the P's land

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 Wow

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 That's so good

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 It does not sound like a full-time job

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 What if the competitors said, "I was the first to throw so I was briefly the world champion"

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 Although it did not last long but it was nice while it lasted

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 It's fundamentally failing to understand what being the world champion means

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 I found a guy who...

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 Well, I found a competition which is the French PIG squealing championship

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 And the idea is that you just have to squeal as...

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 Well, it's kind of on the tin, isn't it? It's a French PIG squealing championship

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 So you're making the squeal, you're not making a PIG squeal

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 Yeah, you yourself are making the squeal, so people come up and they start squealing

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 And there's a guy called Noel Jeanette and he has won it twice

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 For his excellent PIG squeals, he comes dressed as a PIG as well

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 It's a sort of really method, very nice

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 And he's won it twice, he's won twice as well

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 The international championships for the PIG grunter at the agricultural shows in 2007-2008

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 And it's a big thing in France, I say it's big, it's not big

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 There's also the weird festival that I like, championship that I like, is the Naki Sumo Baby Crying Festival in Japan

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 So I didn't know about this, this is in Tokyo, it takes place in a temple

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 Although there are other versions around Japan

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 And the idea is that you bring your baby as a parent, you bring your baby to this festival

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 And it will get paired up with a Sumo wrestler who tries to make it cry

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 And the one who makes the baby cry the most is the winner

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 And the Sumo wrestler, the Sumo wrestler has various tactics, so one thing they might do is they might wear a scary mask

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 To make the baby cry, although apparently often they just repeatedly shout the word "cry" in its face

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000
