 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Birmingham!
 (Cheering)
 (Cheering)
 (Bell)
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anish Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
 and in no particular order, here we go starting with fact number one
 and that is James
 Okay my fact this week is that Hitchbott was a robot invented to see how far human kindness would take a mechanical Hitchhiker
 In 2015 he was left on the side of the road in Boston and was found dismembered in a ditch 17 days later
 (Laughter)
 Yeah and found in Philadelphia which is a city of brotherly love
 (Laughter)
 I read a headline about it which said innocent hitchhiking robot murdered by America
 (Laughter)
 And there's CCTV footage isn't there, they don't know who the guy is but he was wearing a backwards baseball cap
 they saw him starting to beat the robot
 he then ripped the arm off the robot and he beats the robot with the arm
 I mean it's a proper savaging
 So actually there was a few of these robots made, it started in 2014 and it was by a guy called David Harris Smith of McMaster University
 And the early ones had gone through Canada, Germany and the Netherlands with no problems at all they'd gone and seen some amazing things
 (Laughter)
 But yeah this guy they left him off the side of the road in Boston and it did not end well
 The Canadian Avengers were amazing
 I mean for a start the thing itself was made really cheap, it was made for less than a thousand dollars
 So it was not a very good robot
 As in the arms that Dan mentioned were swimming pool noodles
 And then you could only get about three or four good hits with them
 And it had a cake saver over its face
 What's a cake saver?
 Like one of those plastic lids that you put over a cake to save it
 Oh yeah, yeah the little see-through so you can still see the cake
 Yeah exactly, yeah see the tea
 Yeah it was designed, it was reused as a helmet for a robot
 And it had a car seat, it was sitting on a children's car seat so people could put it in their cars
 They had some good things though, they had a camera that took regular photos which I think maybe is where we got this CCTV that Dan was talking about
 It had a voice box that would explain where it wanted to go and it had solar panels
 But it could also be charged by plugging it into the car's cigarette lighter socket
 Wow, so good, it was very popular at the time so you could follow it on Twitter and there was a thing where it had GPS in it so people know where it was
 And they had to work out how to turn that off because when people collected the hitch-bought and brought it home
 Fans would flock to the house of this person and they would be inundated
 And the adventures were great, he was picked up by a band called The Wild
 Who I've not heard but their members are called Dylan Villain
 The kid, booze us and re-slightening
 Oh, they sound great
 They sound like the guys who chopped into pieces
 We've got a strong history of abusing robots, haven't we?
 It's going to be awful when they become sentient because we give them a rush of time
 There are loads of examples, in 2017 a Silicon Valley, in fact, a drunk man was arrested after knocking over an egg-shaped five-foot-tool security robot called Night Scope
 It was really sad, but the Night Scope, it was called Night Scope K-5 actually and it had previously been in the news for running over a toddler's foot
 Oh, okay, so there's...
 There was some speculation, it was sort of payback
 Calm down on both sides
 People get very weird around robots because when we were talking about the murder of hitch-bought, every other room felt quite tense
 So if people had told to hit a dinosaur robot with a mallet, they got a bit freaked out, they don't like doing it
 And roboticists, proper roboticists, are quite annoyed by this
 And they say this is just crazy, anthropomorphizing
 So there's a guy called Noel Sharky
 And he thinks that we need to get over this obsession with treating machines like they've got feelings
 And I read this account of him
 To prove his point, at one conference he attended recently
 He picked up an extremely cute robotic seal designed for elderly care and started banging its head against a table
 Oh my god
 I think it's just a robot
 It is weird though, there was someone I think writing in that article saying it's bizarre that if you're sitting around a table with someone and there's a teddy nearby
 And they seize a teddy and tear its head off, you'll think they're a psycho
 But if they swat a fly, which is a living creature that's relatively harmless to any of you, then it's perfectly normal behavior
 What do I do? In 2018 some German researchers asked 89 students to turn off a cute looking robot called Now
 But they asked questions first, but when they tried to turn it off, it was programmed to say no, please don't switch me off
 Oh
 And every, sorry, a third of the humans took twice as long as normal to turn off the robots and 13 of the group refused to turn it off at all
 Wow
 It was afraid of the dark
 Oh, it's not real
 Guys, it's like the end of Blade Runner
 I've got a thing about how polite humans are to robots
 Okay
 So this is in a restaurant setting, people are given the chance to order food from a robot
 Researchers from Tufty University, they made a waiter bot and they asked humans in the restaurant to order from the robot
 But they also programmed it not to handle indirect speech very well
 Okay, so it needed to be ordered from but people are so reluctant to say, you know, they order something
 So I just want to try a little kind of roleplay
 James, if you play the participants, as James is the human and I'm the robot here
 Okay
 Can I have one water?
 Yes, that is permissible
 Great, please tell me your order
 Can I have one water?
 Yes, that is permissible
 Great, I'll take one water
 Can I have one water?
 Can I have one water?
 Yes, that is permissible
 Okay
 Can you bring me one water?
 Yes, I am able to do that
 Please tell me your order
 I would like to have one water
 Thank you for sharing that interesting fact
 Please tell me your order, then there's a 16 second pause
 Can you bring me one water?
 Yes, I am able to do that
 Please tell me your order
 May you please bring me one water?
 Yes, I am able to do that
 So can you do it?
 Yes
 Please tell me your order
 Can you come inside and get the water for me?
 Yes, I am able to do that
 Please tell me your order
 Just people will not say, I order one water
 They just won't do it
 They just used my entire range of acting ability on this
 That's amazing
 That's amazing
 Move on shortly, unless there's more dialogue
 Oh well, just on humanoid robots
 They've been around for way longer than I thought
 So Japan loves robots now
 It's probably the pioneer of robots, but it has done for ages
 So in the 17th century
 They invented a humanoid robot
 And they're called caracurie dolls
 And I'd never heard of these guys
 Their dolls were basically there to carry tea to you
 So they worked with quite a simple mechanism
 But basically you got a cup of tea
 You had a guest round
 You wanted to impress them, you got out your robot
 You popped a tea on the tray that the robot's carrying
 And this triggered a mechanism that caused it to turn around
 And walk over to your guest, offer them the tea
 And then stand beside your guest while they drink the tea
 And probably quite an intimidating manner
 And then when you've finished the tea
 You pop it back on the tray
 And the robot turned around and walked back again
 No, that is amazing
 And how long is that from?
 That's the 17th century
 And they were really popping up on the 17th to the 19th century in Japan
 And there were lots of others, there were some that acted out sort of medieval scenes
 Japanese scenes, old medical scenes and stuff
 That's amazing, I haven't had the robot in Japan actually
 It's called RoboV2
 And they programmed it to go around the shopping centre
 And whenever it bumped into a human
 It would be programmed to politely ask the humans to step aside
 And if they didn't move out the way
 It would kind of go in a different direction, that was all it did
 But then what happened was a lot of children worked out what was happening
 And started making a circle around it
 And then they started shaking it, punching it and kicking it
 And the bullying got so bad that the researchers had to put an abuse evading algorithm in the robot
 And the robot would scan the area and if it saw anyone that was under 4 foot 6
 As in a child, then it would quickly run in the other direction
 I do this in shopping centres
 Okay, it is time for fact number 2 and that is Chazinsky
 My fact this week is that a Hungarian entrepreneur has been fined for not building an underwater treadmill for dogs
 Confusing
 I haven't done that, Iber
 You just expect the police at your door any moment now
 I hope we have all done this because this person got in trouble
 They got a fine of 140,000 euros this person
 And it's because years ago in 2008 this business one said that he needed 140,000 euros of funding
 And the EU's Rural Development Fund to develop a hydrotherapy treadmill system for dogs
 Now this is a genuinely important thing for animals that have been wounded
 Don't laugh, it's crucial for dog recovery
 The only thing is he never did any of that
 The officers were investigated, they were overrun with weeds
 No one was using them six months after the EU payments were made, this investigation opened
 And he's finally been investigated and given a suspended prison sentence for never building that treadmill
 Which is actually a very lenient fine really
 It can't be essential for dog healing, otherwise no dog would ever have survived any injury
 Before the invention of the underwater dog treadmill
 You got to do it
 So hungry at the moment is run by Victor Orban
 He has taken money to make a 4,000-seater football stadium in his home village
 where he grew up called "Felkshoot"
 And the population of that town is about 1,000
 So it's 4 times bigger than the number of people who live there
 He's also made a vintage railway between his two child hud villages
 He took 2 million euros of EU funding for this railway
 And they claimed that there would be 2,500 to 7,000 passengers using it every single day
 And in the first month there were 30 passengers
 That is just him going back and forth
 I'm not thinking it might be
 He is football obsessed, Orban, isn't he?
 So this railway line was connecting the football stadium that he loved to this other little village
 But he played semi professional football while he was doing his first in as prime minister
 In the fourth division of the league tables but still decent
 He said to watch 6 football games a day
 Which is a lot for someone who's running a country
 And his first trip abroad when he was prime minister was to see the World Cup in Paris
 And people say that he has not missed a World Cup or Champions League final since
 He's been in the news recently or rather his government has because they have a new campaign about having lots of children
 And it's a sort of pro fertility campaign to get the population numbers up
 But unfortunately the stock models that they used for this campaign, you may have seen this in the news
 Were the two people involved in the distracted boyfriend meme online?
 No way
 So they were trying to present a couple who were very happily in love with each other
 But really we knew the truth
 He was a distracted boyfriend and it has no idea what we're talking about
 Not on social media, it's not a happy couple
 A meme is kind of an image show or video that goes online
 Okay
 It all goes back to the 1980s
 I'll look it up afterwards
 So treadmills
 Treadmills in terms of animals are always using treadmills
 And treadmills were used for animals before they were used for humans even and actually they were really important for horses in farming
 They have been for hundreds of years
 So in the 19th century especially before things were properly mechanized then farm machinery was basically horse operated
 So you had threshing machines which would be these big machines which kind of separated the grain from the corn
 And they'd go round and round in one building and the way they'd go round and round is you just have two horses on a treadmill
 Trossing along it all day long
 They're pushing it
 They're operating the mechanism so they're on this treadmill
 It's connected to a bunch of pulleys and cogs and stars
 And then that's turning the wheels round
 It just feels very hard the idea of in a gym pushing a treadmill along with your feet
 It is very hard
 If the treadmills off for you to push it along
 No I was, sorry I was thinking the first proper use for humans of it was in jails obviously back in
 Oscar Wilde famously when he was in jail had to do the step treadmill
 Which they used to employ to have no purpose other than for hard labor
 And Oscar Wilde suffered so much from it he died two years after he got out of jail
 Which they think is largely to do with the treadmill
 It is quite amazing though isn't it?
 It was basically the hardest kind of punishment you could get apart from being killed
 For probably about 100 years and now people do it for fun
 Yeah
 The first, they were massive as well, the Britain treadmills
 They started in Brixton, that's what Brixton was famous for 200 years ago
 Was having a treadmill which could fit 24 people on it at the same time, so beside
 Sorry it was kind of like a game of, did you guys ever play ten green bottles?
 No
 Did you ever play that?
 I know the song, maybe it's not a thing except in my family
 Ten green bottles and you all line a bed ten of you
 And then one green bottle accidentally falls and you fall out of the bed
 Anyway it was kind of like a less fun version of that
 We were kind of like ten in the bed and the little one said "Rail over"
 Yes, same idea
 So this treadmill was like that
 These families that you guys just got
 Bottles in the bed, I can see where the alcohol is and it's coming from
 But the way they would take breaks is the person, nobody would want 12 people on the treadmill or something
 And the way you take a break is you'd nudge the guy off who was on the furthest left
 And the person to the far right would jump on again and they'd get to walk around the other side of the treadmill
 And that would be their sort of a few minutes of break
 It would be 60 minutes that you would be and you'd get 12 minutes per 60 minutes of break
 Just on horse treadmills quickly
 So one of the first ever trains was powered by a horse on a treadmill
 What?
 Can I just ask why do they have, why are they not horses not just pulling these things
 Rather than being on treadmills
 So what do you mean the trains?
 Yeah, the trains because you don't need a smooth road for the horse
 Okay
 I mean you do need a rail for the railway
 But
 But
 Yeah, so
 What's that?
 Was that an answer?
 It's not the best possible answer
 I guess your train just can't suddenly just take a left and disappear to someone, some other bit of England
 Yeah, that's a really good point
 Yeah, exactly, so it's a control thing
 Yeah, yeah, good answer now
 I never thought I'd say this, but thank God Diane was here for you
 So it was called the cyclopad and only two of them were ever built unsurprisingly
 And it was at the same time as Stevenson's rocket, which was the train that we did end up using
 Was developed, it was in the same set of trials where everyone brought their own train
 And they said let's see what works
 So I think that Stevenson's rocket went really slow as well
 I think though I thought it went at six miles now maybe Stevenson's rocket
 So maybe they were really close
 But I didn't answer the horses on a treadmill and then what's that powering to make the train move?
 It's like your plow thing
 But the plow thing stays in one place, which is how that works because the cogs are all attached to it
 It's a thrashing machine, so it stays in one place
 It's a thrashing machine, so it's in one room
 Whereas the train is going to run away from you
 And then you're just on a treadmill and the trains at the other end of the field
 And it's on the train
 Oh my gosh, down to the rescue
 That makes perfect sense
 Was I doing this exact same thing with boats, didn't they?
 With ferries in the 19th century
 And these were very popular
 They started in 1791 a guy called John Fitch built the first one
 And it was basically before ferries were steam-powered
 They would look a bit like a catamaran
 But with those two shelves on either side
 But on those shelves there would be two or three horses on each side
 And they would trot along powering this treadmill
 Which turned the pedals around
 Which turned the paddles round
 Which powered the boat
 And the only problem with them was that it was a real issue
 If the horses on the left side went faster than the horses on the right side
 Because your boat just went round and circles
 That's amazing
 And so there was a study in 2015 that looked at people having treadmills in the office
 This is a new thing
 So the idea is that sitting down in the office all day is not good for you
 So what if you had a treadmill
 And it found that people who use a treadmill desk for two hours every day
 Had significantly better blood pressure and slept better at night
 Which is quite good
 Unfortunately they performed worse on almost all aspects of their job
 Including the ability to concentrate
 And the ability to type
 They were substantially slower in all tasks and more error prone
 We know someone who does that for their job
 They just been fine, haven't they?
 Roger Highfield
 He was the editor of new scientists for many years
 And he used to edit new scientists on a treadmill
 And yes, he is no longer there
 He works for the science museum now
 But yeah, for many years new scientists was edited on a treadmill
 You know there's a treadmill for ants?
 Is there?
 Yeah, scientists have invented a treadmill for ants to test
 I don't know, something or other
 I don't know
 So just a really, really tiny trap
 It's a little plastic ball
 And you put them on top of the ball
 And you have to tether them to a thing above
 So they don't wander off
 Like mission impossible
 They get lowered down
 And then they start
 And it's the test how they navigate
 And where they stop and where they try and find their way
 We need to move on in a second
 On corruption?
 Yeah, quick thing on corruption
 In Nepal they have invented some bribe proof trousers
 Which they're handing out to all officials
 They just don't have any pockets
 Okay, it is time for fact number three
 And that is my fact, my fact this week is that the late actress
 Elizabeth Taylor, who was notorious for always being late
 arranged to arrive at her own funeral 15 minutes late
 That was in the arrangements that she did with her PA
 She said, this is my thing
 And I want to make sure that I keep that even in death
 Were people pissed off? Did they leave? Were they like when she turned up sort of checking their watches and sying?
 Do we know?
 I think there was probably everyone knew
 This will start 15 minutes late
 It's on the sheet
 So she was a late one
 She was also another thing that she did wrong in her life
 Well, she was a shoplifter
 Was she?
 She was one time shoplifter. She once shoplifted a copy of A.E.H.H.M.A.
 a shop she lads from foils
 So big time criminal
 The reason she did it is because as probably you all know
 She's married to Richard Burton twice and Burton boasted her about how good he was at stealing from foils
 And so he said, I do this amazing thing, it's so clever
 I go into the bookshop and I go up to the till and I buy one book and I get the receipt
 And I ostentatiously leave it poking out of the book
 And then I pick up six or seven more books on my way out
 And because I'm walking out with the receipt poking out with the first, they just assume that I bought them all
 And so she thought, I'm gonna fucking try that
 And so she stole how I was supposed to drop she had that and Burton was really pissed off with her
 And said, why did you bloody well do that?
 And then he said that was the last thing she ever stole except husbands
 She died in 2011 and when she died the New York Times ran an obituary for her as they would
 But it was written by a guy called Mel Gusso who was a theater critic
 And he had himself died six years earlier
 But it was so good that they ran it anyway
 And I think there wasn't many events of her life to update on in those six years late thought
 Wait, so he'd written the obituary before she died?
 Before she died?
 Obviously before he died
 Obviously before he died, but...
 At the start of the obituary writing process, no one was dead
 By the end of publication, everyone involved was dead
 I suppose the thing I'm trying to emphasize is that it's interesting people write obituary
 Six years before the person whose obituary it is is dead
 That's quite common, isn't it?
 It does happen, yes
 So I was just saying a very obvious fact that we all knew
 And that's what's press on
 But they didn't...
 Well, you had your moment of the son of our ten minutes ago
 But he was going to come crashing down
 It's always funeral requests
 So there are various funeral requests that people have made sort of things they wanted to happen
 Heinrich Hein, the writer, he left his estate to his wife
 On the condition that she should get married again
 And he said, "So there will be at least one man to regret my death"
 Ooh, yeah
 Slam!
 How did he die? Was it with a bread knife in the back?
 George Bernard Shaw, he had the best glass request I've ever heard
 He left money in his will
 And he said, "Right, I'm leaving a parcel of money
 And I want it to go towards reforming the English alphabet into one that is phonetic
 And has minimum 40 letters, which is the biggest time I imagine to be getting that task from him
 He was massively committed to that, wasn't he, his new alphabet, and it did not work
 I was reading about Bruce Lee's funeral
 Oh yeah, so Bruce Lee obviously he died very young and his funeral, the Paul Barris at his funeral, who carried the coffin
 Were Chuck Norris, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, George Laisenby, how cool is that? That is...
 Well, I mean, he's the fifth best bond, come on
 What?
 None of the other four replied to the invitation, hey?
 That's embarrassing, quite frankly
 He was the best bond
 That was very cool
 But check this out, so while they were filming, sorry, when Bruce Lee died, they were filming Game of Death
 Which eventually became his final movie
 But he'd only made about 30 minutes of footage that was usable for the film
 And they would largely fight, an iconic fight with Karim Abdul-Jabar, the basketball player, is one of those
 He fights a basketball player
 Who plays a kung fu guy
 Oh I see, he's not just beating up a random basketball player
 It seems like plucking low-hanging fruit
 I think if you're fighting a basketball player, you mostly go for the low-hanging fruit, don't you?
 But so, as a result, they had to scrape around for extra footage to use
 And bits of the footage included Bruce Lee's funeral itself
 So they used the actual footage to help the plotline go along
 How did the help the plotline go along?
 I haven't seen the movie yet, there's a suggestion in what I've read that they've actually used
 A picture of him passed away in the open casket as well
 In the film, yeah, but then for the rest of it, they had a few stunt doubles but they obviously needed his face
 So they just had paper cutouts of him, sort of cardboard cutouts that was slightly nudge
 So you could see his head moving a bit, and largely the movie is just a cardboard cutout of him
 Wow, just on celebrity funerals
 Yes
 A very famous celebrity funeral back in the day was that of Rudolf Valentino, so the huge silent movie star
 He died in 1926 when he was 31, and a hundred thousand people went to his funeral
 There were these massive riots outside the funeral parlour, and people were struggling, climbing over each other to get a glimpse of him
 It was an open casket, and there were these four guards who looked, there was this claim at the time that Mussolini had sent four fascist guards
 And remember, it was 1926, they didn't have the connotations they do now
 Four fascist guards to guard
 They were widely seen as friendly and good guys, but not nobody
 But actually, they'd been hired as actors by the funeral parlour to make it seem more dramatic
 And his girlfriend, Valentino's girlfriend, was a woman called Polar Negri, and she really hammed it up
 So she fainted on his coffin during the funeral, just fainted on top of it, came round, said the sad thing is he just proposed to me
 And therefore I'm actually, he's basically his widow, and then she fainted again
 She fainted multiple times, the coffin made this five-day trip from New York to California
 And she accompanied it the whole time, just constantly fainting
 Dozens of times of five days
 Yeah, I read that because there were so many fans going to the casket, they were worried that it might damage the body
 And so the people who were in charge of the funeral, there was a company called Campbell's
 They put a wax model in its place because they thought that it would get damaged
 Wow!
 Really?
 Wow, something quickly unlateness
 So people who are chronically late, according to a new report, have better mental and physical health
 They live longer and they're more successful
 Hey
 Apparently, this is because late people tend to be both optimistic and unrealistic
 And having especially an optimistic outlook can give you a better mental health and a better physical health and lower your rate of death
 I do find lateness across cultures quite interesting because people get so angry
 Because I'm chronically late and I think it's going to shorten my life because it's so anxiety-inducing
 But people get so angry about it in our culture
 They're like, you're a selfish evil bastard who doesn't care about other people
 Guys, guys, yeah
 That's why it's in the heat of the moment
 But then if you go to Brazil for instance, the culture's completely different
 So there was a blog by a writer who lived in Brazil for a few years and she said she was invited to her first party
 She turned up about five minutes after the time the party started
 And the host was like, she knocked on the door and had to get the host out of the shower
 And it was extremely awkward and she sat around for about two hours thinking what's going on
 And everyone turned up about three, four hours later
 And then she spoke to a professor about it afterwards
 And professor said, in Brazil, turning up on time for a party is almost as awkward as turning up to a party
 But where you haven't been invited at all, it's a massive faux pas
 And they have a thing in Brazil called aura inglesa which means turning up on time
 And it means keeping the English hour as any fucking turn up at the aura inglesa
 We need to move on to our final fact of the show and that is Andy
 My fact is that Mexico has a national championship of double entendres
 And it's a big one, so buckle up
 And so there was this thing in Mexico called Albert which is a play on words
 And it's almost always sexual
 And there are lots and lots of different ways that you can make things sound slightly rude
 And you combine words to make new meanings or you use words with similar sounds
 And they have a competition every year to find the best Albert eros or word playmasters in the country
 Can I give you an example of an Alberter?
 What is the difference between a chair and an octopus?
 The octopus has tentacles and the chair touches backs actually works better in Spanish
 No, it doesn't
 Because touching backsides or touching bumps is tentaculos
 And tentaculos is tent I've really fucked this up
 That's great
 I don't know if you'd win that championship
 It's really intense, so you have...
 Someone gives you an Albert and then you have five seconds to come up with another one in return
 Playing off what they've said to you or you get knocked out
 Like time chest, do you hit like a...
 It is like time chest exactly
 That's so cool
 So for many, many years it was dominated completely by men and then suddenly this one lady, Lordez Ruiz, came along
 And she's been the reigning champion for years and years, no one can do anything to outdo her
 Yeah, like over 20 years, isn't it?
 She's the queen of Albert
 Which is amazing because it's a massively male thing, quite misogynistic thing
 Women were kind of excluded from it, it's like lots of men making incredibly crude jokes
 Like women's expense and yeah, she's penetrated that circle
 But yeah, it has quite long history, doesn't it?
 This sort of word battles and battles of wits
 So there's a thing called "Flighting" which I don't know people know about
 But basically this is traditional battles of wits
 Which I've been going on since at least the fifth century
 And these were basically an exchange of insults
 And it was a form of entertainment historically
 It was a largely a Scottish thing
 And very famous lasted a thousand years from the fifth to the 16th century
 So over millennium
 And one of the famous "Flighting incidents" that was this event called the "Flighting of Dunbar and Kennedy"
 And this is in the 16th century and it was a court-flighting
 So it was done for James IV, I think, to entertain him
 And it was these two characters insulting each other
 And it was the first time anyone ever called someone else a shit
 Really?
 Surely the first time we have on record
 First on record, called a shit without a wit
 Oh, that's good
 I've got a few more lines from it
 So this is one little verse that one person would say
 "Gray visaged gallows bird out of your wits gone wild
 Loathe some and lousy as wet as a crest
 Since you with worship would so feign be styled
 Hail Monsignor, your ball of droop below your dress
 That's good, isn't it?
 There are some other examples of this kind of "Flighting" and "Rap Battle" and kind of stuff like that
 So the Iwi people in Ghana, they had a type of poetry called Halo
 And again, it's a way of judging disputes
 And it's a way of insulting each other
 But you said that you had five seconds in this other one
 In this one, you have a couple of weeks in between insults
 And instead of just kind of coming up with ideas off the top of your head
 You actually do actual research into the family history of your enemy
 And you look into what their grandparents did and the great grandparents did
 And find the best nuggets that you could use against them
 Would you go around sort of interviewing their best friends going
 Would you say he's a bit of a dick?
 I've been looking up in New Endo in general
 And so there was a thing about a butcher in Staffordshire
 He was asked by this year I think
 He was asked by the police to remove signs outside his butcher's shop
 Because he said he advertised a big fresh cock
 Which is basically a single entendre of this guy's got
 And he also offered on a sign the chance to have your rump tenderised before you leave
 And the Guardian reported that arguably more offensive was his flagrant use of the green gross as apostrophe
 And the police appear unwilling to take action over that
 And they had this whole thing about you know in New Endo
 So there's a comedian called Stephen Bailey
 And it's all about context and who's making the joke
 So Stephen Bailey is the stand up who has a lot of explicit material
 He's gay himself
 And the Guardian reported that Bailey's show contains explicit sexual material
 But again it's all about context
 The same jokes told by Roy Chubby Brown or the late Bernard Manning
 Would sound aggressive
 Whereas Bailey's ejaculations are far easier to swallow
 Super
 So bad
 There's a book actually called Away With Words
 Which is written by a guy called Joe Birkowitz
 And this is basically puns that we're talking about
 And he travelled around the world visiting pun contest
 And the biggest one is the Oh Henry Panoff in Austin, Texas
 Started in 1978 and it's the world championship of punning
 And so they have onstage referees during this
 And referees can immediately disqualify someone
 If they use what they consider subpar wordplay
 So I think it has something like that would be you know if you use like
 Excellent if you're talking about a normal or something
 I imagine that would get boot off stage
 What because you're slightly tweaking
 No I think it's just like you think that's really shit
 That's like not up to the standards
 It's like if someone does an on-dram serve or something in tennis
 But he said he was going through the best puns he heard in the contest
 And sadly for this pun to work you have to know there's a kind of cherry called a Bing cherry
 Which I didn't know what kind of cherry a Bing Bing in Chandler Bing
 Okay, Bing cherry
 He said the best pun he heard was
 I went to go shopping for cherries and microphones the other day
 But a Bing, but a boom
 Yeah
 I mean you still did have to explain it before we started
 Well the economist did a thing where they said actually some of the best puns
 You do have to explain because they're quite complex and layered
 And it used the example of the one about Mahatma Gandhi who walked barefoot a lot
 And often fasted which led to bad breath
 Thus making him a super-calus fragile mystic hex by halitosis
 Sometimes it's worth the build up
 We're going to have to wrap up very shortly guys
 Oh I found a couple of weird fiesters just because this is a Mexican fiester
 So they've got incredible fiesters over there
 But I did find a British equivalent which I think is one I would like to go to this
 There's a Sussex pub called Lewis Arms
 And it hosts every year the world P-throwing championships
 And the record at the time of recording is 44 metres for throwing a single P
 And I think that's amazing
 That's incredible, not with your bare arm
 Yeah, with your bare arm throwing a P because obviously they're...
 There's a lot of air resistances
 There's a lot of air resistances, not that they're heavy or hard to throw
 But, so the winner, the 2015 winner, Greg Butterworth, he said
 "You've got to make sure you pick a P that has few indents because that affects its aerodynamic qualities"
 But I think it's really impressive because it's impossible to tell where they land
 So that's the real talent in the P-throwing championships
 And they have P spotters all the way along the route
 Assessing where the P's land
 Wow
 That's so good
 It does not sound like a full-time job
 What if the competitors said, "I was the first to throw so I was briefly the world champion"
 Although it did not last long but it was nice while it lasted
 It's fundamentally failing to understand what being the world champion means
 I found a guy who...
 Well, I found a competition which is the French PIG squealing championship
 And the idea is that you just have to squeal as...
 Well, it's kind of on the tin, isn't it? It's a French PIG squealing championship
 So you're making the squeal, you're not making a PIG squeal
 Yeah, you yourself are making the squeal, so people come up and they start squealing
 And there's a guy called Noel Jeanette and he has won it twice
 For his excellent PIG squeals, he comes dressed as a PIG as well
 It's a sort of really method, very nice
 And he's won it twice, he's won twice as well
 The international championships for the PIG grunter at the agricultural shows in 2007-2008
 And it's a big thing in France, I say it's big, it's not big
 There's also the weird festival that I like, championship that I like, is the Naki Sumo Baby Crying Festival in Japan
 So I didn't know about this, this is in Tokyo, it takes place in a temple
 Although there are other versions around Japan
 And the idea is that you bring your baby as a parent, you bring your baby to this festival
 And it will get paired up with a Sumo wrestler who tries to make it cry
 And the one who makes the baby cry the most is the winner
 And the Sumo wrestler, the Sumo wrestler has various tactics, so one thing they might do is they might wear a scary mask
 To make the baby cry, although apparently often they just repeatedly shout the word "cry" in its face
