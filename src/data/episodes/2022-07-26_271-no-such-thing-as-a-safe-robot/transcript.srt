00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 (Bell)

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 (Bell)

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Birmingham!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 (Cheering)

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 (Cheering)

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 (Bell)

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anish Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 and in no particular order, here we go starting with fact number one

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 and that is James

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Okay my fact this week is that Hitchbott was a robot invented to see how far human kindness would take a mechanical Hitchhiker

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 In 2015 he was left on the side of the road in Boston and was found dismembered in a ditch 17 days later

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 (Laughter)

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Yeah and found in Philadelphia which is a city of brotherly love

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 (Laughter)

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I read a headline about it which said innocent hitchhiking robot murdered by America

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 (Laughter)

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 And there's CCTV footage isn't there, they don't know who the guy is but he was wearing a backwards baseball cap

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 they saw him starting to beat the robot

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 he then ripped the arm off the robot and he beats the robot with the arm

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I mean it's a proper savaging

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 So actually there was a few of these robots made, it started in 2014 and it was by a guy called David Harris Smith of McMaster University

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And the early ones had gone through Canada, Germany and the Netherlands with no problems at all they'd gone and seen some amazing things

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 (Laughter)

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 But yeah this guy they left him off the side of the road in Boston and it did not end well

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 The Canadian Avengers were amazing

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I mean for a start the thing itself was made really cheap, it was made for less than a thousand dollars

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 So it was not a very good robot

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 As in the arms that Dan mentioned were swimming pool noodles

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And then you could only get about three or four good hits with them

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And it had a cake saver over its face

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 What's a cake saver?

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Like one of those plastic lids that you put over a cake to save it

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Oh yeah, yeah the little see-through so you can still see the cake

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Yeah exactly, yeah see the tea

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Yeah it was designed, it was reused as a helmet for a robot

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 And it had a car seat, it was sitting on a children's car seat so people could put it in their cars

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 They had some good things though, they had a camera that took regular photos which I think maybe is where we got this CCTV that Dan was talking about

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 It had a voice box that would explain where it wanted to go and it had solar panels

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 But it could also be charged by plugging it into the car's cigarette lighter socket

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Wow, so good, it was very popular at the time so you could follow it on Twitter and there was a thing where it had GPS in it so people know where it was

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And they had to work out how to turn that off because when people collected the hitch-bought and brought it home

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Fans would flock to the house of this person and they would be inundated

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And the adventures were great, he was picked up by a band called The Wild

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Who I've not heard but their members are called Dylan Villain

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 The kid, booze us and re-slightening

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Oh, they sound great

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 They sound like the guys who chopped into pieces

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 We've got a strong history of abusing robots, haven't we?

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 It's going to be awful when they become sentient because we give them a rush of time

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 There are loads of examples, in 2017 a Silicon Valley, in fact, a drunk man was arrested after knocking over an egg-shaped five-foot-tool security robot called Night Scope

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 It was really sad, but the Night Scope, it was called Night Scope K-5 actually and it had previously been in the news for running over a toddler's foot

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Oh, okay, so there's...

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 There was some speculation, it was sort of payback

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Calm down on both sides

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 People get very weird around robots because when we were talking about the murder of hitch-bought, every other room felt quite tense

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So if people had told to hit a dinosaur robot with a mallet, they got a bit freaked out, they don't like doing it

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And roboticists, proper roboticists, are quite annoyed by this

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And they say this is just crazy, anthropomorphizing

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So there's a guy called Noel Sharky

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And he thinks that we need to get over this obsession with treating machines like they've got feelings

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And I read this account of him

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 To prove his point, at one conference he attended recently

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 He picked up an extremely cute robotic seal designed for elderly care and started banging its head against a table

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Oh my god

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I think it's just a robot

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 It is weird though, there was someone I think writing in that article saying it's bizarre that if you're sitting around a table with someone and there's a teddy nearby

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And they seize a teddy and tear its head off, you'll think they're a psycho

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 But if they swat a fly, which is a living creature that's relatively harmless to any of you, then it's perfectly normal behavior

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 What do I do? In 2018 some German researchers asked 89 students to turn off a cute looking robot called Now

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 But they asked questions first, but when they tried to turn it off, it was programmed to say no, please don't switch me off

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Oh

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And every, sorry, a third of the humans took twice as long as normal to turn off the robots and 13 of the group refused to turn it off at all

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Wow

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 It was afraid of the dark

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Oh, it's not real

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Guys, it's like the end of Blade Runner

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I've got a thing about how polite humans are to robots

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Okay

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 So this is in a restaurant setting, people are given the chance to order food from a robot

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Researchers from Tufty University, they made a waiter bot and they asked humans in the restaurant to order from the robot

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 But they also programmed it not to handle indirect speech very well

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Okay, so it needed to be ordered from but people are so reluctant to say, you know, they order something

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 So I just want to try a little kind of roleplay

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 James, if you play the participants, as James is the human and I'm the robot here

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Okay

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Can I have one water?

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Yes, that is permissible

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Great, please tell me your order

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Can I have one water?

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Yes, that is permissible

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Great, I'll take one water

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Can I have one water?

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Can I have one water?

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Yes, that is permissible

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Okay

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Can you bring me one water?

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Yes, I am able to do that

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Please tell me your order

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I would like to have one water

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Thank you for sharing that interesting fact

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Please tell me your order, then there's a 16 second pause

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Can you bring me one water?

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Yes, I am able to do that

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Please tell me your order

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 May you please bring me one water?

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Yes, I am able to do that

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 So can you do it?

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Yes

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Please tell me your order

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Can you come inside and get the water for me?

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Yes, I am able to do that

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Please tell me your order

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Just people will not say, I order one water

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 They just won't do it

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 They just used my entire range of acting ability on this

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 That's amazing

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 That's amazing

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Move on shortly, unless there's more dialogue

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Oh well, just on humanoid robots

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 They've been around for way longer than I thought

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 So Japan loves robots now

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 It's probably the pioneer of robots, but it has done for ages

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 So in the 17th century

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 They invented a humanoid robot

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And they're called caracurie dolls

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And I'd never heard of these guys

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Their dolls were basically there to carry tea to you

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 So they worked with quite a simple mechanism

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 But basically you got a cup of tea

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 You had a guest round

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 You wanted to impress them, you got out your robot

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 You popped a tea on the tray that the robot's carrying

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And this triggered a mechanism that caused it to turn around

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And walk over to your guest, offer them the tea

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And then stand beside your guest while they drink the tea

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And probably quite an intimidating manner

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And then when you've finished the tea

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 You pop it back on the tray

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And the robot turned around and walked back again

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 No, that is amazing

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And how long is that from?

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 That's the 17th century

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And they were really popping up on the 17th to the 19th century in Japan

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And there were lots of others, there were some that acted out sort of medieval scenes

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Japanese scenes, old medical scenes and stuff

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 That's amazing, I haven't had the robot in Japan actually

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 It's called RoboV2

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And they programmed it to go around the shopping centre

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And whenever it bumped into a human

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 It would be programmed to politely ask the humans to step aside

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And if they didn't move out the way

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 It would kind of go in a different direction, that was all it did

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 But then what happened was a lot of children worked out what was happening

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And started making a circle around it

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And then they started shaking it, punching it and kicking it

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And the bullying got so bad that the researchers had to put an abuse evading algorithm in the robot

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 And the robot would scan the area and if it saw anyone that was under 4 foot 6

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 As in a child, then it would quickly run in the other direction

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I do this in shopping centres

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number 2 and that is Chazinsky

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 My fact this week is that a Hungarian entrepreneur has been fined for not building an underwater treadmill for dogs

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Confusing

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 I haven't done that, Iber

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 You just expect the police at your door any moment now

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I hope we have all done this because this person got in trouble

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 They got a fine of 140,000 euros this person

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And it's because years ago in 2008 this business one said that he needed 140,000 euros of funding

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And the EU's Rural Development Fund to develop a hydrotherapy treadmill system for dogs

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Now this is a genuinely important thing for animals that have been wounded

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Don't laugh, it's crucial for dog recovery

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 The only thing is he never did any of that

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 The officers were investigated, they were overrun with weeds

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 No one was using them six months after the EU payments were made, this investigation opened

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And he's finally been investigated and given a suspended prison sentence for never building that treadmill

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Which is actually a very lenient fine really

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 It can't be essential for dog healing, otherwise no dog would ever have survived any injury

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Before the invention of the underwater dog treadmill

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 You got to do it

185
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 So hungry at the moment is run by Victor Orban

186
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 He has taken money to make a 4,000-seater football stadium in his home village

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 where he grew up called "Felkshoot"

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 And the population of that town is about 1,000

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 So it's 4 times bigger than the number of people who live there

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 He's also made a vintage railway between his two child hud villages

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 He took 2 million euros of EU funding for this railway

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And they claimed that there would be 2,500 to 7,000 passengers using it every single day

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And in the first month there were 30 passengers

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 That is just him going back and forth

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I'm not thinking it might be

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 He is football obsessed, Orban, isn't he?

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 So this railway line was connecting the football stadium that he loved to this other little village

198
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 But he played semi professional football while he was doing his first in as prime minister

199
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 In the fourth division of the league tables but still decent

200
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 He said to watch 6 football games a day

201
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Which is a lot for someone who's running a country

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And his first trip abroad when he was prime minister was to see the World Cup in Paris

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And people say that he has not missed a World Cup or Champions League final since

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 He's been in the news recently or rather his government has because they have a new campaign about having lots of children

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 And it's a sort of pro fertility campaign to get the population numbers up

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 But unfortunately the stock models that they used for this campaign, you may have seen this in the news

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Were the two people involved in the distracted boyfriend meme online?

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 No way

209
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So they were trying to present a couple who were very happily in love with each other

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 But really we knew the truth

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 He was a distracted boyfriend and it has no idea what we're talking about

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Not on social media, it's not a happy couple

213
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 A meme is kind of an image show or video that goes online

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Okay

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 It all goes back to the 1980s

216
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 I'll look it up afterwards

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 So treadmills

218
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Treadmills in terms of animals are always using treadmills

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And treadmills were used for animals before they were used for humans even and actually they were really important for horses in farming

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 They have been for hundreds of years

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 So in the 19th century especially before things were properly mechanized then farm machinery was basically horse operated

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 So you had threshing machines which would be these big machines which kind of separated the grain from the corn

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And they'd go round and round in one building and the way they'd go round and round is you just have two horses on a treadmill

224
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Trossing along it all day long

225
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 They're pushing it

226
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 They're operating the mechanism so they're on this treadmill

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 It's connected to a bunch of pulleys and cogs and stars

228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And then that's turning the wheels round

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 It just feels very hard the idea of in a gym pushing a treadmill along with your feet

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 It is very hard

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 If the treadmills off for you to push it along

232
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 No I was, sorry I was thinking the first proper use for humans of it was in jails obviously back in

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Oscar Wilde famously when he was in jail had to do the step treadmill

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Which they used to employ to have no purpose other than for hard labor

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And Oscar Wilde suffered so much from it he died two years after he got out of jail

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Which they think is largely to do with the treadmill

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 It is quite amazing though isn't it?

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 It was basically the hardest kind of punishment you could get apart from being killed

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 For probably about 100 years and now people do it for fun

240
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Yeah

241
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 The first, they were massive as well, the Britain treadmills

242
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 They started in Brixton, that's what Brixton was famous for 200 years ago

243
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Was having a treadmill which could fit 24 people on it at the same time, so beside

244
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Sorry it was kind of like a game of, did you guys ever play ten green bottles?

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 No

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Did you ever play that?

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I know the song, maybe it's not a thing except in my family

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Ten green bottles and you all line a bed ten of you

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And then one green bottle accidentally falls and you fall out of the bed

250
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Anyway it was kind of like a less fun version of that

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 We were kind of like ten in the bed and the little one said "Rail over"

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Yes, same idea

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 So this treadmill was like that

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 These families that you guys just got

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Bottles in the bed, I can see where the alcohol is and it's coming from

256
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 But the way they would take breaks is the person, nobody would want 12 people on the treadmill or something

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And the way you take a break is you'd nudge the guy off who was on the furthest left

258
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And the person to the far right would jump on again and they'd get to walk around the other side of the treadmill

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And that would be their sort of a few minutes of break

260
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 It would be 60 minutes that you would be and you'd get 12 minutes per 60 minutes of break

261
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Just on horse treadmills quickly

262
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 So one of the first ever trains was powered by a horse on a treadmill

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 What?

264
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Can I just ask why do they have, why are they not horses not just pulling these things

265
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Rather than being on treadmills

266
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 So what do you mean the trains?

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Yeah, the trains because you don't need a smooth road for the horse

268
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Okay

269
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 I mean you do need a rail for the railway

270
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 But

271
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 But

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Yeah, so

273
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 What's that?

274
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Was that an answer?

275
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 It's not the best possible answer

276
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I guess your train just can't suddenly just take a left and disappear to someone, some other bit of England

277
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Yeah, that's a really good point

278
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Yeah, exactly, so it's a control thing

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Yeah, yeah, good answer now

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I never thought I'd say this, but thank God Diane was here for you

281
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So it was called the cyclopad and only two of them were ever built unsurprisingly

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And it was at the same time as Stevenson's rocket, which was the train that we did end up using

283
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Was developed, it was in the same set of trials where everyone brought their own train

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And they said let's see what works

285
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 So I think that Stevenson's rocket went really slow as well

286
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 I think though I thought it went at six miles now maybe Stevenson's rocket

287
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 So maybe they were really close

288
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 But I didn't answer the horses on a treadmill and then what's that powering to make the train move?

289
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 It's like your plow thing

290
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 But the plow thing stays in one place, which is how that works because the cogs are all attached to it

291
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 It's a thrashing machine, so it stays in one place

292
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 It's a thrashing machine, so it's in one room

293
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Whereas the train is going to run away from you

294
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And then you're just on a treadmill and the trains at the other end of the field

295
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And it's on the train

296
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Oh my gosh, down to the rescue

297
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 That makes perfect sense

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Was I doing this exact same thing with boats, didn't they?

299
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 With ferries in the 19th century

300
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And these were very popular

301
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 They started in 1791 a guy called John Fitch built the first one

302
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And it was basically before ferries were steam-powered

303
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 They would look a bit like a catamaran

304
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 But with those two shelves on either side

305
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 But on those shelves there would be two or three horses on each side

306
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And they would trot along powering this treadmill

307
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Which turned the pedals around

308
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Which turned the paddles round

309
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Which powered the boat

310
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And the only problem with them was that it was a real issue

311
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 If the horses on the left side went faster than the horses on the right side

312
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Because your boat just went round and circles

313
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 That's amazing

314
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And so there was a study in 2015 that looked at people having treadmills in the office

315
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 This is a new thing

316
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 So the idea is that sitting down in the office all day is not good for you

317
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 So what if you had a treadmill

318
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And it found that people who use a treadmill desk for two hours every day

319
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Had significantly better blood pressure and slept better at night

320
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Which is quite good

321
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Unfortunately they performed worse on almost all aspects of their job

322
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Including the ability to concentrate

323
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 And the ability to type

324
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 They were substantially slower in all tasks and more error prone

325
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 We know someone who does that for their job

326
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 They just been fine, haven't they?

327
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Roger Highfield

328
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 He was the editor of new scientists for many years

329
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And he used to edit new scientists on a treadmill

330
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And yes, he is no longer there

331
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 He works for the science museum now

332
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 But yeah, for many years new scientists was edited on a treadmill

333
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 You know there's a treadmill for ants?

334
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Is there?

335
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Yeah, scientists have invented a treadmill for ants to test

336
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 I don't know, something or other

337
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I don't know

338
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 So just a really, really tiny trap

339
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 It's a little plastic ball

340
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And you put them on top of the ball

341
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And you have to tether them to a thing above

342
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 So they don't wander off

343
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Like mission impossible

344
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 They get lowered down

345
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And then they start

346
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And it's the test how they navigate

347
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And where they stop and where they try and find their way

348
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 We need to move on in a second

349
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 On corruption?

350
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Yeah, quick thing on corruption

351
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 In Nepal they have invented some bribe proof trousers

352
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Which they're handing out to all officials

353
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 They just don't have any pockets

354
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

355
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 And that is my fact, my fact this week is that the late actress

356
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Elizabeth Taylor, who was notorious for always being late

357
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 arranged to arrive at her own funeral 15 minutes late

358
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 That was in the arrangements that she did with her PA

359
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 She said, this is my thing

360
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 And I want to make sure that I keep that even in death

361
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Were people pissed off? Did they leave? Were they like when she turned up sort of checking their watches and sying?

362
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Do we know?

363
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I think there was probably everyone knew

364
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 This will start 15 minutes late

365
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 It's on the sheet

366
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 So she was a late one

367
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 She was also another thing that she did wrong in her life

368
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Well, she was a shoplifter

369
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Was she?

370
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 She was one time shoplifter. She once shoplifted a copy of A.E.H.H.M.A.

371
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 a shop she lads from foils

372
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 So big time criminal

373
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 The reason she did it is because as probably you all know

374
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 She's married to Richard Burton twice and Burton boasted her about how good he was at stealing from foils

375
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And so he said, I do this amazing thing, it's so clever

376
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 I go into the bookshop and I go up to the till and I buy one book and I get the receipt

377
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And I ostentatiously leave it poking out of the book

378
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And then I pick up six or seven more books on my way out

379
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And because I'm walking out with the receipt poking out with the first, they just assume that I bought them all

380
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And so she thought, I'm gonna fucking try that

381
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And so she stole how I was supposed to drop she had that and Burton was really pissed off with her

382
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And said, why did you bloody well do that?

383
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And then he said that was the last thing she ever stole except husbands

384
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 She died in 2011 and when she died the New York Times ran an obituary for her as they would

385
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 But it was written by a guy called Mel Gusso who was a theater critic

386
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And he had himself died six years earlier

387
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 But it was so good that they ran it anyway

388
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 And I think there wasn't many events of her life to update on in those six years late thought

389
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Wait, so he'd written the obituary before she died?

390
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Before she died?

391
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Obviously before he died

392
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Obviously before he died, but...

393
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 At the start of the obituary writing process, no one was dead

394
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 By the end of publication, everyone involved was dead

395
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 I suppose the thing I'm trying to emphasize is that it's interesting people write obituary

396
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Six years before the person whose obituary it is is dead

397
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 That's quite common, isn't it?

398
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 It does happen, yes

399
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 So I was just saying a very obvious fact that we all knew

400
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And that's what's press on

401
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 But they didn't...

402
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Well, you had your moment of the son of our ten minutes ago

403
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 But he was going to come crashing down

404
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 It's always funeral requests

405
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 So there are various funeral requests that people have made sort of things they wanted to happen

406
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Heinrich Hein, the writer, he left his estate to his wife

407
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 On the condition that she should get married again

408
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And he said, "So there will be at least one man to regret my death"

409
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Ooh, yeah

410
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Slam!

411
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 How did he die? Was it with a bread knife in the back?

412
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 George Bernard Shaw, he had the best glass request I've ever heard

413
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 He left money in his will

414
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 And he said, "Right, I'm leaving a parcel of money

415
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And I want it to go towards reforming the English alphabet into one that is phonetic

416
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And has minimum 40 letters, which is the biggest time I imagine to be getting that task from him

417
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 He was massively committed to that, wasn't he, his new alphabet, and it did not work

418
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 I was reading about Bruce Lee's funeral

419
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Oh yeah, so Bruce Lee obviously he died very young and his funeral, the Paul Barris at his funeral, who carried the coffin

420
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Were Chuck Norris, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, George Laisenby, how cool is that? That is...

421
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Well, I mean, he's the fifth best bond, come on

422
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 What?

423
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 None of the other four replied to the invitation, hey?

424
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 That's embarrassing, quite frankly

425
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 He was the best bond

426
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 That was very cool

427
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 But check this out, so while they were filming, sorry, when Bruce Lee died, they were filming Game of Death

428
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Which eventually became his final movie

429
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 But he'd only made about 30 minutes of footage that was usable for the film

430
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And they would largely fight, an iconic fight with Karim Abdul-Jabar, the basketball player, is one of those

431
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 He fights a basketball player

432
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Who plays a kung fu guy

433
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Oh I see, he's not just beating up a random basketball player

434
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 It seems like plucking low-hanging fruit

435
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I think if you're fighting a basketball player, you mostly go for the low-hanging fruit, don't you?

436
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 But so, as a result, they had to scrape around for extra footage to use

437
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 And bits of the footage included Bruce Lee's funeral itself

438
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 So they used the actual footage to help the plotline go along

439
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 How did the help the plotline go along?

440
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 I haven't seen the movie yet, there's a suggestion in what I've read that they've actually used

441
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 A picture of him passed away in the open casket as well

442
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 In the film, yeah, but then for the rest of it, they had a few stunt doubles but they obviously needed his face

443
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 So they just had paper cutouts of him, sort of cardboard cutouts that was slightly nudge

444
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 So you could see his head moving a bit, and largely the movie is just a cardboard cutout of him

445
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Wow, just on celebrity funerals

446
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Yes

447
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 A very famous celebrity funeral back in the day was that of Rudolf Valentino, so the huge silent movie star

448
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 He died in 1926 when he was 31, and a hundred thousand people went to his funeral

449
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 There were these massive riots outside the funeral parlour, and people were struggling, climbing over each other to get a glimpse of him

450
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 It was an open casket, and there were these four guards who looked, there was this claim at the time that Mussolini had sent four fascist guards

451
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And remember, it was 1926, they didn't have the connotations they do now

452
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Four fascist guards to guard

453
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 They were widely seen as friendly and good guys, but not nobody

454
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 But actually, they'd been hired as actors by the funeral parlour to make it seem more dramatic

455
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 And his girlfriend, Valentino's girlfriend, was a woman called Polar Negri, and she really hammed it up

456
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 So she fainted on his coffin during the funeral, just fainted on top of it, came round, said the sad thing is he just proposed to me

457
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And therefore I'm actually, he's basically his widow, and then she fainted again

458
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 She fainted multiple times, the coffin made this five-day trip from New York to California

459
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And she accompanied it the whole time, just constantly fainting

460
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Dozens of times of five days

461
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Yeah, I read that because there were so many fans going to the casket, they were worried that it might damage the body

462
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And so the people who were in charge of the funeral, there was a company called Campbell's

463
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 They put a wax model in its place because they thought that it would get damaged

464
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Wow!

465
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Really?

466
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Wow, something quickly unlateness

467
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 So people who are chronically late, according to a new report, have better mental and physical health

468
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 They live longer and they're more successful

469
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Hey

470
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Apparently, this is because late people tend to be both optimistic and unrealistic

471
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And having especially an optimistic outlook can give you a better mental health and a better physical health and lower your rate of death

472
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 I do find lateness across cultures quite interesting because people get so angry

473
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Because I'm chronically late and I think it's going to shorten my life because it's so anxiety-inducing

474
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 But people get so angry about it in our culture

475
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 They're like, you're a selfish evil bastard who doesn't care about other people

476
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Guys, guys, yeah

477
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 That's why it's in the heat of the moment

478
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 But then if you go to Brazil for instance, the culture's completely different

479
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 So there was a blog by a writer who lived in Brazil for a few years and she said she was invited to her first party

480
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 She turned up about five minutes after the time the party started

481
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And the host was like, she knocked on the door and had to get the host out of the shower

482
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 And it was extremely awkward and she sat around for about two hours thinking what's going on

483
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And everyone turned up about three, four hours later

484
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 And then she spoke to a professor about it afterwards

485
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And professor said, in Brazil, turning up on time for a party is almost as awkward as turning up to a party

486
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 But where you haven't been invited at all, it's a massive faux pas

487
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And they have a thing in Brazil called aura inglesa which means turning up on time

488
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And it means keeping the English hour as any fucking turn up at the aura inglesa

489
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 We need to move on to our final fact of the show and that is Andy

490
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 My fact is that Mexico has a national championship of double entendres

491
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And it's a big one, so buckle up

492
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And so there was this thing in Mexico called Albert which is a play on words

493
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And it's almost always sexual

494
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And there are lots and lots of different ways that you can make things sound slightly rude

495
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And you combine words to make new meanings or you use words with similar sounds

496
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And they have a competition every year to find the best Albert eros or word playmasters in the country

497
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Can I give you an example of an Alberter?

498
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 What is the difference between a chair and an octopus?

499
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 The octopus has tentacles and the chair touches backs actually works better in Spanish

500
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 No, it doesn't

501
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Because touching backsides or touching bumps is tentaculos

502
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 And tentaculos is tent I've really fucked this up

503
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 That's great

504
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 I don't know if you'd win that championship

505
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 It's really intense, so you have...

506
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Someone gives you an Albert and then you have five seconds to come up with another one in return

507
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Playing off what they've said to you or you get knocked out

508
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Like time chest, do you hit like a...

509
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 It is like time chest exactly

510
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 That's so cool

511
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 So for many, many years it was dominated completely by men and then suddenly this one lady, Lordez Ruiz, came along

512
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And she's been the reigning champion for years and years, no one can do anything to outdo her

513
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Yeah, like over 20 years, isn't it?

514
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 She's the queen of Albert

515
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Which is amazing because it's a massively male thing, quite misogynistic thing

516
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Women were kind of excluded from it, it's like lots of men making incredibly crude jokes

517
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Like women's expense and yeah, she's penetrated that circle

518
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 But yeah, it has quite long history, doesn't it?

519
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 This sort of word battles and battles of wits

520
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 So there's a thing called "Flighting" which I don't know people know about

521
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 But basically this is traditional battles of wits

522
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Which I've been going on since at least the fifth century

523
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And these were basically an exchange of insults

524
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And it was a form of entertainment historically

525
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 It was a largely a Scottish thing

526
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 And very famous lasted a thousand years from the fifth to the 16th century

527
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 So over millennium

528
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 And one of the famous "Flighting incidents" that was this event called the "Flighting of Dunbar and Kennedy"

529
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 And this is in the 16th century and it was a court-flighting

530
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 So it was done for James IV, I think, to entertain him

531
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 And it was these two characters insulting each other

532
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And it was the first time anyone ever called someone else a shit

533
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Really?

534
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Surely the first time we have on record

535
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 First on record, called a shit without a wit

536
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Oh, that's good

537
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 I've got a few more lines from it

538
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 So this is one little verse that one person would say

539
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 "Gray visaged gallows bird out of your wits gone wild

540
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Loathe some and lousy as wet as a crest

541
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Since you with worship would so feign be styled

542
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Hail Monsignor, your ball of droop below your dress

543
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 That's good, isn't it?

544
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 There are some other examples of this kind of "Flighting" and "Rap Battle" and kind of stuff like that

545
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 So the Iwi people in Ghana, they had a type of poetry called Halo

546
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 And again, it's a way of judging disputes

547
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 And it's a way of insulting each other

548
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 But you said that you had five seconds in this other one

549
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 In this one, you have a couple of weeks in between insults

550
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 And instead of just kind of coming up with ideas off the top of your head

551
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 You actually do actual research into the family history of your enemy

552
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 And you look into what their grandparents did and the great grandparents did

553
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And find the best nuggets that you could use against them

554
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Would you go around sort of interviewing their best friends going

555
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Would you say he's a bit of a dick?

556
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 I've been looking up in New Endo in general

557
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 And so there was a thing about a butcher in Staffordshire

558
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 He was asked by this year I think

559
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 He was asked by the police to remove signs outside his butcher's shop

560
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Because he said he advertised a big fresh cock

561
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Which is basically a single entendre of this guy's got

562
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 And he also offered on a sign the chance to have your rump tenderised before you leave

563
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 And the Guardian reported that arguably more offensive was his flagrant use of the green gross as apostrophe

564
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And the police appear unwilling to take action over that

565
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And they had this whole thing about you know in New Endo

566
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 So there's a comedian called Stephen Bailey

567
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 And it's all about context and who's making the joke

568
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 So Stephen Bailey is the stand up who has a lot of explicit material

569
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 He's gay himself

570
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 And the Guardian reported that Bailey's show contains explicit sexual material

571
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 But again it's all about context

572
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 The same jokes told by Roy Chubby Brown or the late Bernard Manning

573
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Would sound aggressive

574
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Whereas Bailey's ejaculations are far easier to swallow

575
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Super

576
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 So bad

577
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 There's a book actually called Away With Words

578
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Which is written by a guy called Joe Birkowitz

579
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And this is basically puns that we're talking about

580
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 And he travelled around the world visiting pun contest

581
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 And the biggest one is the Oh Henry Panoff in Austin, Texas

582
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Started in 1978 and it's the world championship of punning

583
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 And so they have onstage referees during this

584
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 And referees can immediately disqualify someone

585
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 If they use what they consider subpar wordplay

586
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 So I think it has something like that would be you know if you use like

587
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Excellent if you're talking about a normal or something

588
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 I imagine that would get boot off stage

589
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 What because you're slightly tweaking

590
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 No I think it's just like you think that's really shit

591
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 That's like not up to the standards

592
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 It's like if someone does an on-dram serve or something in tennis

593
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 But he said he was going through the best puns he heard in the contest

594
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 And sadly for this pun to work you have to know there's a kind of cherry called a Bing cherry

595
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Which I didn't know what kind of cherry a Bing Bing in Chandler Bing

596
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Okay, Bing cherry

597
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 He said the best pun he heard was

598
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 I went to go shopping for cherries and microphones the other day

599
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 But a Bing, but a boom

600
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Yeah

601
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 I mean you still did have to explain it before we started

602
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 Well the economist did a thing where they said actually some of the best puns

603
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 You do have to explain because they're quite complex and layered

604
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And it used the example of the one about Mahatma Gandhi who walked barefoot a lot

605
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 And often fasted which led to bad breath

606
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Thus making him a super-calus fragile mystic hex by halitosis

607
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Sometimes it's worth the build up

608
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 We're going to have to wrap up very shortly guys

609
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Oh I found a couple of weird fiesters just because this is a Mexican fiester

610
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 So they've got incredible fiesters over there

611
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 But I did find a British equivalent which I think is one I would like to go to this

612
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 There's a Sussex pub called Lewis Arms

613
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And it hosts every year the world P-throwing championships

614
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 And the record at the time of recording is 44 metres for throwing a single P

615
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 And I think that's amazing

616
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 That's incredible, not with your bare arm

617
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Yeah, with your bare arm throwing a P because obviously they're...

618
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 There's a lot of air resistances

619
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 There's a lot of air resistances, not that they're heavy or hard to throw

620
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 But, so the winner, the 2015 winner, Greg Butterworth, he said

621
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 "You've got to make sure you pick a P that has few indents because that affects its aerodynamic qualities"

622
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 But I think it's really impressive because it's impossible to tell where they land

623
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 So that's the real talent in the P-throwing championships

624
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And they have P spotters all the way along the route

625
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 Assessing where the P's land

626
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Wow

627
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 That's so good

628
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 It does not sound like a full-time job

629
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 What if the competitors said, "I was the first to throw so I was briefly the world champion"

630
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Although it did not last long but it was nice while it lasted

631
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 It's fundamentally failing to understand what being the world champion means

632
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 I found a guy who...

633
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Well, I found a competition which is the French PIG squealing championship

634
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And the idea is that you just have to squeal as...

635
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Well, it's kind of on the tin, isn't it? It's a French PIG squealing championship

636
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 So you're making the squeal, you're not making a PIG squeal

637
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Yeah, you yourself are making the squeal, so people come up and they start squealing

638
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 And there's a guy called Noel Jeanette and he has won it twice

639
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 For his excellent PIG squeals, he comes dressed as a PIG as well

640
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 It's a sort of really method, very nice

641
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 And he's won it twice, he's won twice as well

642
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 The international championships for the PIG grunter at the agricultural shows in 2007-2008

643
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 And it's a big thing in France, I say it's big, it's not big

644
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 There's also the weird festival that I like, championship that I like, is the Naki Sumo Baby Crying Festival in Japan

645
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 So I didn't know about this, this is in Tokyo, it takes place in a temple

646
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Although there are other versions around Japan

647
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 And the idea is that you bring your baby as a parent, you bring your baby to this festival

648
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 And it will get paired up with a Sumo wrestler who tries to make it cry

649
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And the one who makes the baby cry the most is the winner

650
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 And the Sumo wrestler, the Sumo wrestler has various tactics, so one thing they might do is they might wear a scary mask

651
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 To make the baby cry, although apparently often they just repeatedly shout the word "cry" in its face

652
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts, thank you so much for listening
