00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.120
 And welcome to another podcast from no such thing as a fish a weekly show coming to you

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.600
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.680
 My name is Anna Toshinsky and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.960
 and fellow QI Elf James Rawson and we are going to tell you our four favourite facts

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.160
 from our last seven days starting with Rawson.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.840
 My fact this week is that Usain Bolt could fly on Titan.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.040
 Do we say Usain or Usain?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.040
 Oh good question.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 I say Usain.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.040
 Do you?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.040
 But Usain, Usain.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.040
 What?

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.080
 Let's call the whole thing up.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.720
 And so Titan we're talking about the Isaac Titan.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.720
 No it's Titan.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.600
 We're talking about the moon.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.880
 We are talking about Saturn's largest moon and it has a couple of things going for it

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.160
 that make it really great for human flight.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.800
 Well one bad thing, lack of humans.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.040
 Yes, that is a bad thing but a good thing is that its gravity is only 14% as strong

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.280
 as Earth's, so pretty low gravity and its air pressure is 50% higher than Earth's.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.080
 So really weak gravity and really strong nice thick air.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.840
 So people have said anecdotally for years that if you could get people on their straps

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.160
 and wings on them they'd be able to fly like birds.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.920
 But in 2014 some students from the University of Leicester actually did the physics and they

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.040
 worked out that if you were on a normal wingsuit which has a wingspan of about 1.4 square meters

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.360
 and if you were on a 11 meters per second you would be able to run, jump up and take off

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 and fly.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 So great.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.760
 So if you're a normal person you couldn't, right?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.520
 It's only if you're as fast as Usain Bolt.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.480
 He is just him and a few others who are cracking that speed.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.720
 So Usain Bolt can go at 12 meters per second or he could in his head, he's now retired.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.280
 So I imagine that he's useless but yeah, Usain Bolt in the day could do it, a normal person

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.200
 could do it if they could run at 6 meters per second but they would have a large and unwieldy

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.200
 wingsuit.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.840
 So they wouldn't be able to get away with the normal sort of day-to-day wingsuit that we're

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.840
 all wearing now.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840
 Very cool.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.600
 You also need a very warm coat though wouldn't you?

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.640
 Because the temperature is about -180 degrees Celsius.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.640
 Yes.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.920
 And actually warm coat would weigh you down quite a lot and then the physics probably wouldn't

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.920
 work anymore.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.920
 We've got a very big coat.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.920
 Yeah.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.080
 You remember when you were a kid and there was high winds, like gales and you would hold

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.120
 your coat out and then try and fly with it.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.120
 Yeah, that was great.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.120
 Or your umbrella.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.600
 Sometimes you'd fly with an umbrella?

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 Yeah.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.400
 Well, I wasn't Mary Poppins when I went to school but actually you couldn't do it with

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.840
 the winds because there's not much wind on Titan, is there?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.840
 No.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.600
 And that's because the temperature is always very low and we get our wind on Earth because

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.920
 of the changes in temperature with the sun and they don't really get those changes of temperature.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.200
 Yeah, which is why they - because they've got lakes.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.320
 One of the reasons it's so great for human habitation, apparently, is that it's got stable

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.720
 liquids on its surface, hasn't it, which is extremely unusual, and it has an atmosphere

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.280
 that is sort of similar to Earth's, but it's liquids - well, similar, yes.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.280
 It's not similar.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.320
 It's a fairly similar level of kind of thickness and it's got some nitrogen in it.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.320
 It's got lots and lots of nitrogen.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.640
 There's no problem with nitrogen.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.000
 You like nitrogen, you get a lot of Titan, but it's got no oxygen basically.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Yeah.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 So the lakes are made out of methane.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 They are.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.760
 It sort of has a lot of methane and ethane in it, which I imagine means that it smells really

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.760
 bad on there.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.880
 Well, in fact, I think they might have looked into how the atmosphere there smells.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.920
 They've tried to recreate it.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.040
 Scientists did this this year or last year and they got some methane and ethane involved.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.440
 They got some nitrogen involved and it still wasn't behaving quite like Titan's atmosphere.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.360
 And then they added some benzene and that's the crucial ingredient that mimics the atmosphere

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.800
 and it smells like petrol.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.360
 So the whole place, if we live there, smells like petrol station.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360
 Yeah.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.360
 I kept the smell of petrol stations.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.520
 Can I just say it's one of my favourite smells?

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.520
 Yeah.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520
 It's very nice.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.640
 I like that too, but a lot of people kept saying how good Titan would be and they were saying

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640
 things like that.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.640
 It's got some liquid.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.640
 It's got an atmosphere.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.240
 It's the only other place in our solar system where it rains.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.960
 It just sounds like a recipe for a very bad picnic.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.200
 I think it's really, really habitable compared to the other moons of solar system, which is

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.200
 a bit of a low bar.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.480
 The other thing about picnics is instead of lost flying around, you have 100 meter runners

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.000
 kind of fly around.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.400
 Another good thing about Titan, since you're so busy bouncing it, is that they've recreated

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.520
 also Titan's lakes because there's a plan for NASA to send a submarine up there in 2025.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.000
 I'd send a spaceship if I was NASA, but I'd go on.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 You need to ride to them.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 They're sending a submarine up and they're going to get there and they need to dive, so they

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.800
 need to deal with the coldness of the liquid, but they realise that icebergs can't form.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.120
 So one of the people we're creating, as I said, a really vital positive is the fact that

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.560
 because the freezing temperature of these methane lakes is so low, icebergs not a possibility,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.400
 so you won't get Titanic on Titan and also the submarine won't crash into any icebergs.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.880
 Do you know who might be crewing this submarine that we're going to send up?

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.880
 Robots.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.880
 Bacteria.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.880
 Come on.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.680
 Well, it's a stretch, but.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.960
 No, so there are deep sea bacteria which theoretically could survive there.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.200
 Well, they can't drive a spaceship or a submarine, they'll be an intense training montage

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.680
 with the bacteria.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.200
 No, but they're called, oh, this is a tough name, methanol thermococcus ocanoensis and

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.080
 they can survive irrespective of temperature and pressure and vitamins and toxic chemicals.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.280
 And I think they live around vents very deep in the sea.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.280
 Vitamin E, did you say?

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.280
 Yeah, they don't even.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.560
 They wouldn't even need to take vitamin meals in pill form when they're at bay.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.120
 I don't save on satzoomerite.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.920
 I think basically they just go into hibernation as soon as the conditions are right for them

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.240
 to spring back into what they do.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.520
 So we could possibly set up a submarine in front of those guys and just see how they did.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.200
 I went on to Yale Scientific Magazine because they had an article, "Why can't humans fly?"

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.160
 Yeah, we can't, turns out.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.800
 We would need a wingspan of at least 6.7 meters to fly according to this website.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.120
 That's 6.7 across the whole wingspan, so 3.35 either side.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.400
 Yeah, it's still a lot and would make the wings too heavy to function, and also the muscles

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.400
 that you need.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.560
 So those wings wouldn't need to have smaller wings, helping them fly.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.560
 But we've sort of cracked quite an important human powered flight thing really recently,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.560
 isn't we?

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:47.080
 Because there was a price set up in 1970, I think it was, awarding £250,000 for the first

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.640
 person to make a human powered helicopter.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.560
 And it was thought to be impossible and all these studies were written saying it's impossible.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.240
 And I only found Nick's was reading a Washington Post article saying, "No one's come anywhere

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.880
 close to achieving this in 2011."

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.800
 And in 2013, we did it, or engineers from the University of Toronto did it.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.440
 And they've built this helicopter, which is basically about the size of a football pitch with

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.440
 these...

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.640
 I would buy one human.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.320
 Yeah, it's unbelievably light.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.200
 It weighs only 50 kilos, but it's ridiculously large, because as you say, you've got to have

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.200
 really big wings.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.080
 And there's a little guy on a bicycle in the middle of it, who does, but he's cycling up.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.080
 It's amazing.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.680
 And then, well, it's not as amazing as it would be.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.680
 But it's so...

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.080
 My wife flies helicopters.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.080
 Yeah.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.360
 And we always have to find a place for her to land, which is not too many trees around

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360
 and stuff like that.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.720
 I think if your helicopter's a size of a football pitch, that is going to be tough, right?

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.720
 It's too big.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.320
 I looked up a list of names of human-powered flight machines.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.320
 Oh, great.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.200
 They were called things like the reluctant Phoenix.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.600
 That's what a drag name is, isn't it?

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.960
 That does sound like they once crashed it in a ball of flames.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.960
 Yeah.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.960
 They couldn't get it back again, right?

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.960
 There was a reluctantly...

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.600
 The Perkins inflatable, which I liked, there was the puffin.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 The puffin, too.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.960
 And there were three called Icarus, named after...

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.960
 Why did they name it after the thing that...

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.960
 The one who dies?

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
 Yeah.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.960
 They only read the first half of the story.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.960
 This is great.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960
 Don't need to finish.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.040
 Really respect this guy's confidence.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.080
 You same Bolt, who I know you've touched on in the past, but did you know that...

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.480
 So he has scoliosis, so he has curvature of the spine.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.920
 So his legs are actually significantly different length from each other.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.920
 So his...

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.920
 So his...

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.120
 Not quite as dramatic as Richard III, I don't think.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.960
 But his right leg is half an inch shorter than his left.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.760
 The prevailing wisdom is that if you want to go in a straight line as fast as you can,

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.760
 you should be symmetrical.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.120
 And obviously he's not quite symmetrical.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.760
 And they don't know if he was symmetrical, would he go faster?

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.520
 Or does this slight off-balance somehow work in his favour?

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.760
 Because he goes pretty quick from what out of his hands, actually, yeah.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.760
 You do know about the sport.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.200
 For someone who doesn't like sport, you've picked a very sport-based fact, involving

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.480
 both printing and flying.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.880
 And there is a sprinter at the moment called Brianna Liston.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.800
 And she's 12 years old.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.320
 She's from Jamaica.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:18.880
 And in 2017, she ran the 100 metres in 11.86 seconds, which is unbelievably fast.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.040
 And in fact, if she'd have taken part in the 1896 Olympics, she would have won.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.080
 By more than 0.1 of a second.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.600
 12-year-old girl.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.560
 And the team behind the Cassini mission, which was the probe that went to Saturn, and it

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.840
 dropped off the, how do you pronounce it?

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.200
 Huygens is the moon lander that they dropped down.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.440
 It's the only human thing ever to land on a body beyond the asteroid belt.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440
 And now it's there.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.640
 It's going to be there for millions of years.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.640
 It's very, very cool.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.440
 Anyway, the Cassini probe, the team behind it.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.080
 They spent 20 years working on it.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.000
 There's a huge long project.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.160
 And they got so close that they had all these cool team things that they did together.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.120
 So, they had a softball team called the Roving Marauders.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.960
 And whenever there was a big date in Cassini or Saturn or what it tightened history, they would

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.760
 brew a special beer and they'd give it a special name.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760
 Yeah.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.760
 Nice.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.760
 Do you think we should do that?

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.760
 We don't have enough for softball teams.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.760
 Oh, we already do, James.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.760
 Do we?

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.960
 The softball's only a three-player game.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.960
 Oh.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.280
 And there's a no James's rule, and I already turn up, so.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:32.680
 OK, we should move on to fact number two.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.080
 And that is my fact.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:40.040
 My fact this week is that in 1604, one of King James' first grooms rode from London to York

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.120
 and back five times in the space of five days for a bet.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.120
 Wow.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.120
 Did you choose a James' fact because James Rossin is here today?

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.120
 I did, yeah.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.120
 It's the first James.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.320
 You've never done a James' fact before.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.920
 I just never noticed you being here, I guess.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.080
 Yeah, this is really cool.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.800
 So this is a guy called John Lepton.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.320
 And it was first recorded in this amazing book, which I wasted all my research time reading

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.480
 today, which was this book called "A Bridgment of the English Chronicle."

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.720
 And it was written in 1604 by a guy who died in 1605, so he just got in there.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.440
 And yeah, it was this story that he sort of said that he reckon he'd be able to go to

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.200
 and from London and York five times in six days.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.400
 And he ended up managing to do it with one day, too, spare.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.400
 Wow.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.400
 It is really good, doesn't it?

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.400
 Yeah.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.400
 Is it a different horse every time?

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.400
 That's the annoying thing.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400
 It wasn't recorded.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.400
 How have any changed his horses?

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.880
 You would normally change your horse, though, on a journey that long, I think.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.880
 Would you?

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.880
 Yeah.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880
 From my knowledge of horses.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.880
 Probably swapping at Watford Gap.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.880
 Yeah.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:47.000
 So when he finished this, according to the book that I read, it said, I think this is probably

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 the same one.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.520
 So he finished his appointed journey to the admiration of all men.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.840
 In five days, and upon Tuesday the 28th, he came to court at Greenwich to his majesty in

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.080
 a fresh and cheerful amount as when he first began.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.080
 Yeah.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.080
 Nice.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.320
 Although he arrived on, so he was due to arrive on the Saturday night, it's really cool

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.520
 this account because it really gives intense details of the time he arrived, how long he slept

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.520
 for.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.880
 He arrived on the Friday night, and then there is a gap in our knowledge for the Saturday

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.880
 and the Sunday.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.000
 Let me imagine he got absolutely hammered in York for Saturday and Sunday.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Workout with it.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.520
 Hainers hang over on Monday and then struggled back to be cheerful on Tuesday.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.520
 Sounds great.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.080
 One thing that I think I read about this, which I think is quite interesting, from the Journal

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:39.000
 of Sport History, it said that this could kind of be seen as the first sporting record.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.800
 So it wasn't really until the 19th century that people became obsessed with like, I've

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.880
 done this sport in this amount of time.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.760
 You know, that kind of record-breaking mentality.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.080
 There was another two centuries before men began routinely to abstract the quantified performance

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.640
 as a mark to be equaled or surpassed.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.040
 But this is kind of the first instance of that happening, he said, I can travel this long

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.040
 in this distance.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.040
 Yeah.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.040
 Will you put money on it?

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.040
 Exactly.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.040
 Yeah.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.040
 That's really cool.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.040
 They do, don't they?

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040
 They call it the first sort of sporting match that we have a record of.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.200
 But I was reading again in this book that there were lots of really weirdly progressive rules

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.200
 around it.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.000
 So it became a huge gambling thing.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.440
 We often bet on horse races then as now, but if you won more than 100 marks on a horse race,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.080
 you had to give up all of your remainder to the poor.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.840
 So that was a rule that was introduced in James' time.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.720
 There was an act passed in Scotland that said, stop feeding horses hard meat in summer.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.280
 That practice being held one among other occasions of death of the victims, which I think is basically

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.720
 the poor people need meat in summer.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.280
 And if people keep feeding it to their horses, then the poor people aren't getting it, which

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.280
 is very progressive.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.160
 I feel like the National Lottery.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
 Exactly like the National Lottery.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.000
 Where if you were more than 100 quid, you have to give the rest of the poor.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.640
 Have you been not quite like the National Lottery?

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.520
 Do you know about John Lepton's other horse feet?

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.520
 No.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.520
 Do you mean hooves?

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.240
 Yeah, hooves, that's it.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.200
 So, surely after this event, there was, remember, remember the fifth November, the Gump

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.920
 Harder Plot, and a couple of days after Thomas Percy was a fugitive, he was involved in the

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.400
 conspiracy, everyone was looking for him.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.360
 So he had connections in Northumberland, Cumberland and Yorkshire in the North of England.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.040
 And people thought that he might be sort of hiding out there.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.160
 So our hero, John Lepton, was sent to see if they could find him.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160
 No way.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.400
 And according to my source, John Lepton missed his man and his epic ride took him to Scotland

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.800
 before he realised that the trail had gone cold.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.920
 So in that instance, he sort of overshot his mark a little bit.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.520
 Well, because he was so fast, so he was probably going by the average time he was told

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.520
 it would be.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.520
 He probably thought he was in Wolverhampton.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.520
 Yeah.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.800
 And then he was in Scotland.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.560
 I've got to think about a great horse racing bet.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.560
 Oh god.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.400
 Well, this is a bet about distance and travel.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:04.320
 So there was a guy called Lord March, who made a bet that he could get a letter 50 miles

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.440
 in an hour, which at the time exactly was impossible.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.440
 I would take that bet.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.440
 Yeah, exactly.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.680
 No horse couldn't run at 50 miles an hour for an hour.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.680
 No.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.280
 Even if you were on a cheetah, it would be pretty hard.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.920
 A cheetah couldn't do that.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.920
 He won the bet.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.920
 No.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.920
 Yes, he didn't use horses.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.920
 And he used pigeons.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.920
 No.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.920
 That's quite a good idea.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.920
 Although, I don't know.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.680
 Even though I'm not sure they can go at 50 miles an hour.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.360
 What he did was, this is very clever.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.280
 He put the letter inside a ball.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.280
 Okay.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.280
 And then he hired...

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.280
 Oh, hamsters.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.280
 No.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:40.400
 He hired 20 expert cricketers and for an hour, they threw it in a massive circle all the

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.640
 way around over and over again.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.640
 Oh.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.480
 The letter travelled more than 50 miles.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.480
 No way.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.480
 In that hour.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.480
 Doesn't count.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.480
 He won the bet.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.480
 Well, I wouldn't pay up.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.480
 Wait.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.480
 Hasn't got anywhere.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.680
 I think that's a really crafty, crafty Lord March.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.680
 It's a clever man.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.520
 I've got a couple of ridiculous wages from the 18th century.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.280
 So I think that wages really took off in the 18th century when it all just got a bit

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.280
 silly.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:10.480
 In 1735, Count De Bookberg, better large wage on riding to Edinburgh, backwards on a horse,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.560
 which was accomplished in just under four days.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.680
 I don't know if the count did it or if it got someone to do it.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.680
 So just to be clear, the horse is going forwards, but you're facing backwards.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.960
 Oh, it's the horse facing backwards.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.320
 I think it's like on a train where the train's going forward and you're facing backwards.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.320
 Yeah.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.080
 You probably didn't need to make a train analogy though.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.240
 It's like a horse going forwards and you're facing backwards.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:38.320
 And in 1770, I read this from the gentleman, which is just so great, two hours bad that

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.320
 one could ride from London to Edinburgh and back in less time than it took the other one

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.120
 to draw a million dots.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.480
 He's counting the million.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.480
 I do not know.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.160
 And so they announced the wager, but then there doesn't seem to be any sort of follow-up

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.240
 or result section in the following in the following issue.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.240
 So you don't know who won that?

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.240
 So I don't know who won.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.120
 It's actually, actually, you only don't know who won because it's a little

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.120
 very long line of dots and you don't know what happens at the end of the long line of dots.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.120
 Yeah.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.840
 There's a lot of suspense.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.640
 But he could make the dots in the most expedient manner that he could contrive.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.440
 Which I think includes hiring people to draw dots or some sort of mechanical hiring million

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.440
 people.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.440
 It's just one dot each.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440
 Yeah.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.760
 Just glue a million pencils together and make one dot.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.240
 Just glue a million pencils together.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.800
 Does it count the time that you take gluing the pencils together or?

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.800
 Yeah.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.800
 That's all part of it.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800
 That's part of the time.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800
 I mean, you missed the problem.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.800
 I see.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.800
 Like the time it takes me to press a dot.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.800
 Right, a dot.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.280
 You're not going to be able to do one pencil gluing, are you?

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.280
 I would start gluing.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.440
 I would start drawing dots, but I would instruct a friend to go and hire a lot of people

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.680
 immediately to come and join and hire more and draw more dots.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.120
 I reckon 1,000 people are 1,000 dots.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.120
 Oh, easy.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.120
 Yeah.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.120
 I'm paying 1,000 people.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.120
 Like peasants?

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.120
 Yeah.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.120
 18th century peasants?

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.120
 Can we just do what you tell them?

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.120
 Yeah.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.120
 But so many peasants are illiterate.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.120
 I don't know that.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.680
 You can still draw a dot if you're illiterate.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.040
 No, they were really illiterate back then.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.400
 I've got lines.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.720
 What if you get a paintbrush and just kind of flick it?

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.720
 Does that count as a dot?

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.720
 Ooh.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.880
 Let me revisit the word here.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880
 Amazing.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.520
 But what a good bet, because he will be drawing dots, drawing dots, and the other guy will

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.720
 be writing to Edinburgh.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.120
 It's very exciting as a pencil, and they're different kinds of achievement as well.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.120
 Yeah.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.120
 I think that'll be really exciting.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.520
 I think if they had the Grand National and they also had some dots, writing competition

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.520
 at the same time.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.520
 Yeah.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.920
 It would be a hell of a lot more popular.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.920
 Yeah.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920
 No.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.880
 And there's another good bet, which is another kind of crafty bet, a bit like Andes, where

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880
 someone was outwisted.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.200
 This is in the 18th century, and the Earl of Barrymore, who apparently was known as Hellgate

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:54.400
 or Rake of Rakes, because he was a big womanizer and a bit of a rake, he thought he was a bit

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.400
 of a sport.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.400
 Yeah, like that.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.920
 He fancied himself as a sportsman, and this guy called Mr Bullock challenged him to a running

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.240
 race, and Bullock was a massively fat, unfit man.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:14.520
 He weighed 18 stone, and he said, "I challenge you to a race, all I'm saying is I want a 35-yard

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.840
 head start, and I want to be able to choose the route."

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.840
 And Barrymore said, "Yeah, sure.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.840
 I'm way fatter than you.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.560
 Look at you, you're a mess."

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.320
 And so lots of people put money on it, everyone backed Barrymore, and Bullock took those bets,

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.360
 so he's the only one backing himself, and the route he chose ran through an extremely

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:37.600
 narrow alley, and so he ran the entire route with poor old Barrymore not being able to squeeze

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.480
 past him on either side, and apparently he sort of wobbled from side to side as he went

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.840
 to make sure there was no way of passing.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.840
 Wow.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.840
 That is brilliant.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:52.160
 The fact about jockeys, as we're on horse racing, so jockey posture, that weird posture that

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:57.400
 jockeys have, they're kind of crouched on the horse, they're all sort of hunched up.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.240
 This only caught on in 1898, before that, you would just sit upright and try and win the

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:06.280
 horse race, and there was a guy, a jockey called James Forman Sloan, he started doing it,

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:12.160
 and it was like the Fosbury flop, you know, in high jumping, within ten years, everyone

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.800
 around the world was doing it, and horse race, completion times, improved by 5% to 7% over

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.080
 those ten years, solely because of this guy.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.080
 Wow.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.080
 Yeah.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.080
 I can't believe they didn't figure that out before.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.080
 It's so obvious.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.120
 But it's not where reducing wind resistance, which I think it would be.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.120
 No, I wouldn't have thought that.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.760
 I would have thought you were kind of getting a bit of a kind of a movement going.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.040
 I mean, doing the jump, it's not grinding back and forth.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.200
 It's when you're upright, you're like a sandbag, and you jog up and down on the horse,

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.520
 but when you're in a jockey position, or if they call it martini-glass position, you can

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.000
 move relative to the horse, so you are moving at a more constant speed, and I think it just

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.120
 helps the whole thing go a bit more smoothly.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.120
 Maybe for the horse and for you.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.680
 Like finding a resident's almost.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.680
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:01.440
 Do you guys know that the precursor to the steeple chase was the wild goose chase.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.960
 So I just came across this in old book, which was referring to a wild goose chase as an

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.240
 actual race, and this was the main horse race that people bet on before the steeple chase,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.840
 and what you did was the horses all started running, and after racing each other, after 12 score

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.280
 yards, after 240 yards, whoever was in the lead was the one who chose the route from that

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.280
 point onwards.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.280
 And you had to play.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.280
 Amazing.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:27.880
 And so they all went into this really thin house.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.160
 And it was mad, and so you'd like dodge about, you jump over a ditch, and then suddenly

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.520
 you'd take them over a massive fence, they didn't know what they were doing.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.680
 That's a really good idea, but then if you overtake them, do you then get to choose

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.680
 the route?

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.680
 No.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680
 You've won.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:45.240
 Wait, but if you, if you overtake them, there's no route to get wrong, is there?

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.160
 So if you overtake them, you choose the route.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.480
 That's why I was thinking, but actually that's the end of the race, if you are.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.680
 That's the end of the race, because apparently when you choose the route, when is the race

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.680
 end?

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.680
 You just have to run forever.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.680
 This is why it was banned.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.440
 So again, too many thousands of deaths.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.600
 It was very dangerous, and it was banned, according to this, like Sports Illustrated

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:10.440
 Equivalent. It was banned because it was too hard on the horses and the riders, because

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.720
 they would just collapse in the end.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.640
 They'd just go on and on and on, dodging about, and then one of them would collapse.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.640
 That's amazing.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.240
 But that's the original world goose chase.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.400
 In 2012, Prince Harry bought chairs in a horse called Usain Colt.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.400
 Amazing.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.800
 James, you get to edit that into either section of the show.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:36.560
 I love that. That's so funny.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.440
 Okay, we should move on to fact number three, and that is Andy's fact.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.440
 That's right.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.240
 My fact is that there are species of wasps, the size of a meba.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.240
 That's so cool.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.240
 Very cool.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.960
 And not special giant a meba, either, because there are giant a meba we talked about before

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.960
 on the show.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.600
 Yeah, because I was going to say there's an a meba, which is 10 centimetres long.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.600
 Exactly.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:04.960
 The smallest dog is 9.65 centimetres, so there are dogs that are smaller than the mebbers.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.960
 So exactly.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.960
 A meba, James.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.720
 Yeah, can we clarify plurals?

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.720
 A meba.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.880
 A meba, yeah.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:16.920
 So this is a wasp called Megafragma Mimari Penne, and it's 0.2 millimetres long.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.560
 It's the third smallest insect known, and the other two smaller ones are also wasps, so

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.360
 I've just picked this guy, because he's been studied.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.560
 But it's the size of an meba.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.400
 And it's got eyes, brains, wings, muscle, gut.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.360
 So it's obviously made up of thousands and thousands and thousands of cells, but it's

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.800
 the size of a one cell organism.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.800
 And it's done that.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.640
 There's been a study by a scientist called Alexei Pololov, and it found that basically they're

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.560
 missing huge amounts of stuff, and they have to cut down on their own brains and remove

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:51.080
 all the nuclei from the cells inside their skull just to make room for a few neurons.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.080
 Really?

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.080
 It's incredibly weird.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.680
 So do they have nuclei, and then they extract them as they grow, or they just don't have any

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.920
 nuclei having to start?

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.800
 I think it destroys them until it only has a few hundred.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.120
 This is what I read.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.400
 Is it one of these that doesn't really need to make that many decisions in life?

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400
 Yeah.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400
 It's like simple.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.040
 It doesn't need that many neurons, right?

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.440
 But it's got to make, it's only got 100, 100th, perhaps, as many as a bee.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.440
 OK.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.600
 And bees themselves do not make that many decisions.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.600
 No.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.600
 Flower, high, flower, high.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.640
 It's about the size of a human ovum.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.480
 That does not help putting some effect on you.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.480
 No, no.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.480
 Think of a human ovum.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.480
 No.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.480
 I think of a very small full stop.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.480
 What the heck?

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.480
 I think of a dot.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.480
 I think of a million of those.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.640
 I'm afraid you've only drawn 99999 dots, because this is a wasp.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.640
 The other...

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.640
 Oh, winds of the wedge.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.640
 Yeah.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.640
 What was the name of the wasp?

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.120
 Mega fragment, my maripeni.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.720
 There's another one, which is small.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.600
 I think it might be one of the two that's smaller than this one, called decopo motha.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.120
 Ech mepterygis, something like that.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.600
 And it's the males that are really small in this species.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.320
 I don't know if it's the same with yours.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:12.200
 And the reason they're so small is because basically they never leave their egg.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:18.000
 They kind of live inside their egg, and they mate with their sisters inside the egg.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.920
 And then the sisters fly off and they just die.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920
 Oh, mate.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920
 Broaden your eyes.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.920
 How?

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.920
 That's crazy.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.920
 Yeah.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.920
 So that's the whole life.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920
 They just...

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.920
 They grow up in the egg.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.920
 They mate with their sisters.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920
 They die.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.920
 So are these parasitic wasps?

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920
 Is it their own egg they're in?

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.920
 Or are they in someone else's?

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.920
 They're in their own egg.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.920
 OK.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920
 Yeah.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.920
 But parasitic wasps are amazing.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920
 Yeah.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.920
 Actually, you said wasps there instead of wasps.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.920
 So I'll say it again, then.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.920
 But do you know that wasp used to be wasps?

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.920
 Really?

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.920
 Yeah.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.920
 Just through people saying it wrong over the years.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.920
 As in it comes from an old, Germanic word, whoops.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.920
 And I really hope it shows an etymology with whoops.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.920
 It probably doesn't.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.920
 But it would be nice, wouldn't it?

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.920
 Well, like whoops I've stepped on a...

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.920
 On a wasps.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.920
 Yeah.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.920
 Yeah, parasitic wasps are totally awesome, aren't they?

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.920
 Well, there's a piece by Ed Young, who writes a lot about bacteria.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.920
 He writes for the Atlantic.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.920
 It's a great piece.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.920
 He's so good.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.920
 I just want to say he's probably my favorite science journalist.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.920
 And you should all look.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920
 Yeah, I agree.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.920
 All right.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.920
 I'll have my turn.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.920
 Do you get his weekly email that he sends with all of his writings?

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.920
 And it...

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.920
 Oh, well, I called you so much.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.920
 I called you so much.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.920
 I called you so much.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.920
 I called you so much.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.920
 I called you so much.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.920
 I called you so much.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.920
 There's a piece by him.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.920
 Where he's saying everyone thinks the beetle is the king of the things,

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.920
 because there are so many species of them.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.920
 So he writes a bit better than saying the king of the things.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.920
 I don't think he does.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.920
 I don't think it's possible.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.920
 So there are 380,000 species of beetle,

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.920
 which is a quarter of all animal species, which is a lot, obviously.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.920
 But there's a scientist from the University of Iowa called Andrew Forbes,

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.920
 who reckons that there are so many parasitic wasps

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.920
 and that every single species of insect even has at least one

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.920
 and probably several species of tiny, tiny parasitic wasps inside it.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.920
 He reckons that wasps outnumber even beetles by about two and a half times.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.920
 So is that like if everyone on the planet had an average of two hats,

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.920
 then there has to be more hats than people?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.920
 Exactly.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.920
 So the people are beetles than the hats of wasps?

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.920
 Yes, exactly.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.920
 There are shed loads of wasps, given that we don't give them enough credit.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.920
 I think there are just over 5,000 species of mammal

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.920
 and 14,000 of ant and 200,000 species of wasps.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.920
 And even if fig wasps have many thousands of species of fig wasps, don't they?

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.920
 So we need to pay them more attention.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920
 So small.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.920
 They're so small that no one notices them.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.920
 Even if you find a new beetle, it's probably got loads of wasps living in it,

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.920
 but you don't know about.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.920
 There's an amazing quote from Josephine Rodriguez, who is an entomologist,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.920
 who was responding to this discussion about there being more wasps than beetles.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.920
 And she says, "It doesn't surprise me at all that there are more wasps.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.920
 I really think that only people that would disagree would be the fly people."

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.920
 So just like the politics within entomology is great.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.920
 Oh, Pericomicalister isn't listening to this.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.920
 Yeah, she's a fly person.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.920
 Has she been on that fly?

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.920
 We've had a run?

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.920
 Yes.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.920
 Yeah, she'll be fuming.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.920
 She'll go out and find 100,000 different species of fly today.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.920
 There's a really cool parasitic wasp called the green eyed wasp,

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.920
 which parasites of a ladybird.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.920
 So it lays its eggs inside a ladybird.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.920
 And then when they hatch, they come out.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.920
 And they immediately weave this cocoon between this ladybird's legs.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.920
 And this paralyzes the ladybird, but it also sort of possesses the ladybird,

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.920
 so it turns it into a zombie.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.920
 When you say so weaving the cocoon between the legs, which paralyzes them,

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.920
 is it like tying someone shoelaces together?

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.920
 Exactly the same as that, except also if you tie someone shoelaces together

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.920
 and then you injected their brain with some kind of chemical that turned them into a zombie.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.920
 That is a next-level prank.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.920
 You get two detentions for that one.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.920
 But yeah, this is really cool.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.920
 So this ladybird sits there and it's possessed, which means it twitches involuntarily,

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.920
 which scares away any potential predators.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.920
 So it's just standing there like this great fort with the babies all in between its legs.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.920
 And then they crack out and leave, and the ladybird, I guess, dies.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.920
 No, not true.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.920
 Really?

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.920
 A quarter of the ladybirds recover, and some of them are even parasitized again.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.920
 Oh my God.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.920
 So no.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.920
 Do you want to hear about my favourite messed-up was?

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.920
 Yes, please.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.920
 Oh no, it's not.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.920
 It's a fly.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.920
 Anyway.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:19.920
 Well, Erica will love this.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.920
 Okay.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.920
 This is the smallest fly that exists.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.920
 Okay.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.920
 And it feeds on itself really tiny ants, not even normal size ants, really small ants.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.920
 And what it does is the egg hatches inside the ant parasitic fly.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:39.920
 It goes into the head of the ant from inside, and it starts eating it.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.920
 So it feeds on the muscles that control the mouth parts, which are very big and muscular bits.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.920
 So the ant then can't chew.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.920
 So he's walking and I'm thinking, I can't chew anymore.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.920
 And then this tiny fly eats the brain.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.920
 So the ant now can't think anymore.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.920
 It can't even think I can't chew anymore.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.920
 Exactly.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.920
 But it stays walking around.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.920
 It walks around for another fortnight while this fly is inside it, eating it.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.920
 And then finally, the fly lover dissolves the membrane, which keeps the ants head on.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.920
 And the ants head comes off.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.920
 And then the fly just lives in the decapitated head for another fortnight,

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.920
 which I think is the most goth thing I can possibly imagine.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.920
 How cool is that?

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.920
 And then once it's an adult, it just leaves the head, leaves this decapitated head longer.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.920
 How insane.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.920
 Its self-hooks up, isn't it?

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.920
 It's horrible.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:27.920
 You know that it's so fucked up, it made Charles Darwin question his belief in God.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.920
 Paracetic wasps, he wrote a letter to a fellow naturalist Aissa Gray,

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.920
 said, "I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.920
 would have designeddly created parasitic wasps."

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.920
 He is the technical term, with the express intention of their feeding

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.920
 within the living bodies of caterpillars.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920
 Wow.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920
 It's a good point.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.920
 It's not a nice thing to do.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.920
 He's a god, he's a god.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.920
 He then goes on to say, "Order to cat should play with mice."

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.920
 So that also seemed up so in quite a lot as well.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.920
 Oh no, they're just having fun cats and mice.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.920
 We've all seen Tom and Jerry.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.920
 Fortunately, he didn't live to see that terror.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.920
 Do you want to hear my favourite paracetic wasps?

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.920
 Yeah.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.920
 Oh, we've all got one.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.920
 It's so nice.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.920
 So it's Aissa Cody's Abitasis.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.920
 And it's a parasitic wasp, which lays its eggs in another wasp,

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.920
 which is called Dibrakis Bukianus, and then that lays its eggs

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.920
 in the pupae of a species of Icknumonodai wasps,

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.920
 which then lays its eggs in the caterpillar of the Cricopia moth,

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.920
 which lives and feeds in a popular wild cherry or apple tree.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:38.920
 So that means it's a parasite inside a parasite inside a parasite inside a tree.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920
 Wow.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.920
 This is where my hat metaphor falls down.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.920
 It's the inception of the wasp world.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.920
 I think it's the most disgusting Russian doll you could ever see.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.920
 Do you want to know my least favourite wasp?

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.920
 Yeah.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.920
 It's the tarantula hawk, and it's a type of wasp,

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.920
 and it has the worst sting, probably, of any wasp.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.920
 And the recommendation, if you're stung by this wasp,

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.920
 and this is in a peer-reviewed journal,

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.920
 is to lie down and start screaming.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.920
 What does that do?

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.920
 Well, apparently what happens is it's so painful that you're not going to be able

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.920
 to maintain verbal or physical coordination after you're stung,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.920
 and you're likely to just kind of run off and hurt yourself.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.920
 I'll lie down.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.920
 And so the best thing to do is just lie down and scream,

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.920
 and hopefully someone will come and help you.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.920
 Oh my God.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:28.920
 Wow.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.920
 It's such a good name as well.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.920
 Is it a tarantula?

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.920
 Is it a hawk?

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.920
 No, it's a wasp.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:39.920
 The smallest fly in the world is named after Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.920
 Nice, is that an ironic kind of thing?

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.920
 No, it's because it's got big arms.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.920
 Yeah, come on.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.920
 It's a tiny fly with massive arms.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.920
 It's 0.395 millimeters long,

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.920
 and it's arms are big relative to its body,

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.920
 but they're not the size of Arnie.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.920
 You don't just see a pair of arms flying on the ground

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.920
 and a tiny thing in between them.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.920
 And the scientist who discovered it, Brian Brown said,

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.920
 "As soon as I saw those bulging legs,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.920
 I knew I had to name this one after Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.920
 He doesn't have, of course they don't have arms.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.920
 They've got front legs, haven't they?

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.920
 It's that way you got your arms.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.920
 Oh, I've got my arms.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.920
 I've never known where you walk on all fours.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.920
 But we're all, all mammals have two arms and two legs,

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.920
 or four legs.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.920
 But I believe flies are not mammals.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.920
 Well, we don't have time to give them the science of the fence.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.920
 We should probably move on in this case.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.920
 We can dig this hole on it deeper and we lose you entirely.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:36.920
 We should go on to fact number four,

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.920
 and that is James' facts.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.920
 Okay, my fact this week is when Patonc players getting to fights,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.920
 it is known in the French press as bulliganism.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.920
 It's amazing.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.920
 Love it.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.920
 That's very good.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.920
 So I read this in a recent telegraph article,

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.920
 and it is all about how they're trying

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.920
 to smarten up the reputation of the sport of Patonc,

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.920
 which is French bull.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.920
 So for anyone who doesn't know that,

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.920
 it's basically you have a big iron ball.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.920
 It's not that big.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.920
 It's about the size of a cricket ball.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.920
 I am bull, and you throw it towards a small wooden jack

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.920
 and whoever gets closest wins.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.920
 And they're trying to smarten it up.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.920
 They've stopped people from wearing jeans,

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.920
 and also they're trying to stop this bulliganism,

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.920
 which is alcohol-fueled brawls between players,

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.920
 which has been tarnishing the sport for the last few years.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.920
 And it's an extremely traditional French past time.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:30.920
 I've seen people playing it.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.920
 People playing it in a square near where I used to live.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.920
 On the piece.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.920
 I've been to playing that square.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.920
 It's brilliant in South London.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.920
 It's very nice.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.920
 You love it.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.920
 Yeah, and you hire the equipment out from the pub.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.920
 Did you get into any fights?

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.920
 It's huge, bro.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.920
 I'm not allowed back to South London, actually.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.920
 Well, I thought this can't possibly be true,

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.920
 but it goes back about 10 years.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.920
 So in 2017 some referees had to be given special protection

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.920
 from Bulligans.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.920
 There were death threats at the World Cup in 2016.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.920
 Yeah.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.920
 And there are so many stories.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.920
 One team said they were going to rip their heads off

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.920
 another team exactly like them when.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.920
 And then the tournament's organisers said this sort of incident

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.920
 happens quite often in Patonk in response to that.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.920
 There was one guy who got a 200 Euro fine in a four-year ban

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.920
 for hurling a Bull at his rival.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.920
 Geez.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.920
 They are hard bulls.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.920
 They are hard, don't they?

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.920
 You don't want that.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.920
 I think one guy, according to an economist article,

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.920
 was jailed for shooting dead a Patonk rival

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.920
 when one of his Bulls landed on his foot.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.920
 What?

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.920
 What year was this?

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.920
 It didn't say it just said in brackets.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.920
 It was an economist article about Patonk and then it was just like,

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.920
 for instance, the guy from Grenoble,

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.920
 who was jailed for shooting dead a rival when his Bull landed

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.920
 on his foot, closed brackets, no more information.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.920
 Oh my god.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.920
 So I found three examples of people who've died

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.920
 in the last 10 years playing Patonk

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.920
 and I was not looking for them.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.920
 They just kept coming up in my search results.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.920
 One of them was trampled by a runaway circus elephant, though.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.920
 So I don't know if that counts as...

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.920
 It's the dangers of Patonk.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.920
 That's what eventually cleared us off the South London.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.920
 Right.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.920
 Actually, this thing about them not being able to wear jeans,

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.920
 it's annoyed a lot of Patonk players

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.920
 and one player has protested by turning up

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.920
 to an official tournament game dressed as a clown,

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.920
 which now I hear about it.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.920
 Seems a little bit too soon, almost.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.920
 Yeah.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.920
 Although, at least if another player's Bull lands on your shoe,

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.920
 it probably won't hurt your foot.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.920
 There is one thing that Patonk players are now allowed to do,

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.920
 which they weren't a little while ago,

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.920
 which is to drink during matches.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.920
 And this is competition players.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.920
 Oh, yes, you're right.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.920
 They are trying to professionalise, aren't they?

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.920
 Because they wanted to be an Olympic thing.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.920
 But they did persuade the world...

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.920
 This is a very French thing.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.920
 They did persuade the world anti-doping agency

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.920
 it is okay to have a glass of pasties

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.920
 or whatever during a competition.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.920
 And they've been allowed to, as of 2008,

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.920
 but they are still asked to abstain

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.920
 from steroids, growth hormones, heroin and cocaine.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.920
 I can't imagine heroin is going to help you play for talk that much.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.920
 It's a slow game.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.920
 I mean, steroids aren't going to help you either.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.920
 Oh, come on. You can get some proper power in your...

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.920
 If you're really big, you can just kind of lean over it.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.920
 Put the ball down.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.920
 Doesn't make your arms lengthen.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.920
 Don't really, don't really fit it.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.920
 I think a stretch arm is strong.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:20.920
 I can't get over how full of both of your arguments are.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.920
 And these steroids don't lengthen your arms.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.920
 And James, it's not really a game of power.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.920
 Look, we'll have a game soon.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.920
 But there are a few different shots you can play.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.920
 One way you just try and get it close to the jack

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.920
 and another one where you try and bash the other guys

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.920
 ball out of the way.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.920
 It's kind of like Quidditch.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.920
 Yeah, because in Quidditch, there are people who are trying to score points.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.920
 And those are the people in Potonk who are shooting for the jack.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.920
 The tiny wooden thing.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.920
 And then you've also got shooters in Potonk

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.920
 who are the, you would be the bludgers who try to, you know,

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.920
 they're just attacking the people.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.920
 And they've played it on Titan.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.920
 Look, everyone actually breaks down eventually.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.920
 I'm just saying, you've got Schesgeras and Nockers.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.920
 Do you?

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.920
 Talking of Nockers, can we talk about kissing the funny?

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:14.920
 So, kissing the funny is when, if you lose a match 30 nil,

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.920
 you then have to kiss the funny,

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.920
 which is where you ideally have to kiss the bare bottom of a lady

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.920
 called Fanny.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.920
 But as there isn't always one available,

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.920
 you can kiss a picture of the bare bottom of a lady called Fanny,

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.920
 or quite often they have like small statues of Fanny's nearby

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.920
 that you could kiss the bottom of.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.920
 So, do you, is that part of the equipment list for a match?

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.920
 I assume it.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.920
 I assume it.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.920
 Every club has its own model, Fanny, norm, inference.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.920
 Wow.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.920
 They have them specially made.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.920
 They have a match where someone lost very badly.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.920
 And a local waitress, I think, called Fanny said,

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.920
 "You'll have to kiss me on the cheek if you lose."

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.920
 And then when the male lost really, really badly,

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.920
 she said, "Well, you have to kiss me on the bum now."

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.920
 And some clubs in Provence have special rugs to nil on

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.920
 while you're kissing the statue of the one we call Fanny on the arse.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.920
 Yeah.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.920
 It's a weird boy prayer.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.920
 Do you know why England is not so good at batonk?

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.920
 Is it because we have crown green bowling or tempin bowling,

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.920
 so we don't really play it as much?

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.920
 That's a nice idea.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.920
 I think, well, my theory, as to why we're not a world leading petonk power,

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.920
 is that you like to wear jeans a lot,

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.920
 so we won't be able to play anymore.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.920
 That's another one.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.920
 This is a bit more historical, is that ever the third for bad people from playing,

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.920
 legally, you were not allowed to play, especially if you were an archer.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.920
 And this goes back, you know, loads of sports were banned if you were an archer

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.920
 because you had to be doing your archery practice.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.920
 But until the 18th century,

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.920
 Artifices, Laborers, Apprentices and Servants were banned from playing

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.920
 any time outside Christmas.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.920
 Really?

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.920
 Yeah, which is not good for training.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.920
 And also, yeah, because Christmas, the ground's going to be cold.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.920
 Yes.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.920
 Snowy maybe, so you might not be able to play anyway.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.920
 Poor playing conditions.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.920
 Good point.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.920
 Yeah, it was thought of as a kind of corrupt sport, wasn't it?

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.920
 I'd like only people of ill-repute played it.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.920
 It was associated with saloons and gambling and stuff like that.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.920
 Or bites of the gambling.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.920
 The gambling.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.920
 Well, you say that Britain isn't a petonk powerhouse.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.920
 But we do have teams.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.920
 In 2002, Purcell sponsored and paid for the kit of the British nude petonk team.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.920
 Paid for the kit.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.920
 Yes.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.920
 Sorry, I think it was mostly sweat buns.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.920
 So, do you say, say, a Purcell?

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.920
 Purcell.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.920
 So, exactly the clothes detergent brand.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:43.920
 Why do you associate yourself with something as risque as nude petonk?

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.920
 Risky and also not terribly popular, I imagine.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.920
 Purcell makes your clothes disappear.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:49.920
 What are they trying to tell you?

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.920
 Do they turn up to competition saying, "Look, we're not wearing jeans."

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.920
 I've got a quote from Pat Thompson, the team manager and president of British naturism.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:01.920
 We might not have a Beckham or an Owen, but landing this sponsorship

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.920
 is set to boost the profile of naturist petonk just as we go head to head with the World Cup.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.920
 Head to head.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.920
 What year was that?

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.920
 2002.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.920
 And see, did anyone pay attention to that World Cup?

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:16.920
 I think not.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.920
 Patent kind of advertises itself as being good for kind of all ages, all genders.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.920
 It's not a super physically testing sport.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.920
 Even to the extent that you can buy magnets attached to cords

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.920
 so you can pick up the balls without having to bend down.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.920
 And there's nothing, so that's fine, it's all like you go fishing for your peton balls.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.920
 Exactly, but you won't pick up the wooden one, will it?

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.920
 No, no.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.920
 So you're...

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.920
 God, you're right.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.920
 What do you do about that?

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.920
 Long Hoover.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.920
 You could get those claw things that park rangers have, you know?

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.920
 Yeah, you're right.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.920
 That's called a piglet.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.920
 It's called a kosch on it, to that little wooden thing.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.920
 Yes.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.920
 Or, like, we would call it a jack, right?

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:57.920
 Yes.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.920
 One of England's best players is called Jack Blows.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:01.920
 Really?

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.920
 Nice.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:03.920
 It's a really cool one.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.920
 So prior to researching this, did anyone else assume that Patonk was an onomatopoeic name?

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.920
 Yeah.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:10.920
 Patonk?

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.920
 I mean, it is onomatopoeic.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.920
 I just wasn't named for that reason, yeah.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:13.920
 Yeah, just not intentionally so.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.920
 There was an old man who loved to play ball, which involved taking three steps and then throwing your ball.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.920
 He had terrible roomatism, so as if you could do it sitting down.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.920
 His friend said, yes, and they agreed to be stationary when they threw the ball as well.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:32.920
 And that is Patonk, which comes from the Provence words, 'pedtanko', which means 'feet still'.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.920
 Yeah.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:40.920
 And I think that's really nice as an origin, because it originates in basically early disability rights, right?

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:44.920
 It used to be much more active, so I think in Provence it was called Provence Long.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.920
 And you threw the ball really far.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.920
 It was often about throwing the ball quite a long way.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.920
 And the ball for some reason, I couldn't discover, was sheathed in nails.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.920
 And it resulted in so many injuries in the 18th and 19th centuries that it was banned,

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.920
 almost everywhere.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.920
 Sorry, can I just say, so the nails, the spiky bit is on the inside, right?

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.920
 Yeah.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.920
 Because the way you said it, it could have possibly been sticking out.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:12.920
 So it's basically cock, and then you would stick a load of nails so that the outside of it was the heads of the nails.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.920
 And so that's how you got your iron kind of ball.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.920
 So that's how you got the weight or whatever.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.920
 Yeah, so it's not like a hedgehog or something.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:19.920
 Yeah, got it.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.920
 That would be very dangerous though.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.920
 Yeah, but maybe more fun.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.920
 To use a hedgehog?

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:26.920
 No, no.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.920
 I was thinking of the sticky apple.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.920
 Oh, sorry.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.920
 Yeah, I was thinking, oh, this is Alice in Wonderland.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.920
 I'm sure I've read this before.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.920
 With a real piglet.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.920
 Thank you for everything.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.920
 Well, you know why the metal balls came about from the technology of the First World War.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.920
 So sort of making small mines and bombs and stuff.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.920
 Using that technology that was improved in the First World War, they could then make petonk balls.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:48.920
 Wow.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.920
 Yeah.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.920
 So it was good for something.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920
 It was.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.920
 You know what, what is it good for?

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.920
 Petonk.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.920
 Finally, we've answered the question.

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:03.920
 Petonk balls are dangerous objects officially.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.420
 According to the Federal Transportation Safety Administration, you're not allowed to take them

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.920
 onto aircrafts.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.920
 Did you find an example of that?

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.920
 No.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.920
 I found a guy who, he's a star player from Jersey, Keith Boliad.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.920
 And he had his luggage seized on route to a big competition in Denmark.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.920
 Because it had three suspicious looking, perfectly round, iron balls in it.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.920
 And obviously they thought, well, this could be a bomb.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.920
 What is it?

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.920
 And he had to borrow another set.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.920
 And someone else is trousers.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.920
 Because he traveled in jeans.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.920
 And the umpire wouldn't let him play in the competition.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.920
 Oh, really?

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.920
 So his game suffered very badly.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.920
 Because he was playing with a set.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.920
 He wasn't familiar with the weights.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.920
 And different trousers.

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.920
 And different trousers.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.920
 Yeah.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.920
 It's important to like, use your own balls.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:54.920
 He says that they have slightly different weightings and slightly possibly even different sizes.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.920
 Or just that he was used to his feel of his own balls.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.920
 He did size.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.920
 This is the nudist Petonk ball, actually.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.920
 Okay.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:06.920
 Well, you should wrap up.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.920
 Thanks so much for listening.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.920
 We'll be back again next week with another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.920
 In the meantime, if you want to get in touch with us, you can do so on these guys.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.920

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:18.920
 Andy's on.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.920
 And Andrew Hunter M.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:20.920
 And James Rawson is on.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.920
 @JamesRawson.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.920
 Sorry.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.920
 It shouldn't be like James is the obvious James and your James Rawson.

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.920
 You just call me other James.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.920
 Brandon James is on.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.920
 @JamesHarkin.

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.920
 Say it again.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.920
 @JamesRawson.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.920
 And also he is in control of all of our other social media accounts.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.920
 So if you want to abuse him anywhere, that's where to do it.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.920
 If that's if you want to abuse anyone anywhere, just do it on social media.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.920
 It's fashionable.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:53.920
 If you want to get in touch with us as a group, you can get in touch with us via @No Such Thing

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.920

 That's all for this week.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.920
 See you again next week.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.920
