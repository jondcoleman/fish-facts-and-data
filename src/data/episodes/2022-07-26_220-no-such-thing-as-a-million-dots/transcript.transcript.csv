00:00:00,00:00:20,And welcome to another podcast from no such thing as a fish a weekly show coming to you
00:00:20,00:00:22,from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:27,"My name is Anna Toshinsky and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:27,00:00:32,and fellow QI Elf James Rawson and we are going to tell you our four favourite facts
00:00:32,00:00:37,from our last seven days starting with Rawson.
00:00:37,00:00:41,My fact this week is that Usain Bolt could fly on Titan.
00:00:41,00:00:44,Do we say Usain or Usain?
00:00:44,00:00:45,Oh good question.
00:00:45,00:00:46,I say Usain.
00:00:46,00:00:47,Do you?
00:00:47,00:00:48,"But Usain, Usain."
00:00:48,00:00:49,What?
00:00:49,00:00:51,Let's call the whole thing up.
00:00:51,00:00:53,And so Titan we're talking about the Isaac Titan.
00:00:53,00:00:54,No it's Titan.
00:00:54,00:00:56,We're talking about the moon.
00:00:56,00:01:00,We are talking about Saturn's largest moon and it has a couple of things going for it
00:01:00,00:01:03,that make it really great for human flight.
00:01:03,00:01:05,"Well one bad thing, lack of humans."
00:01:05,00:01:11,"Yes, that is a bad thing but a good thing is that its gravity is only 14% as strong"
00:01:11,00:01:17,"as Earth's, so pretty low gravity and its air pressure is 50% higher than Earth's."
00:01:17,00:01:21,So really weak gravity and really strong nice thick air.
00:01:21,00:01:24,So people have said anecdotally for years that if you could get people on their straps
00:01:24,00:01:28,and wings on them they'd be able to fly like birds.
00:01:28,00:01:33,But in 2014 some students from the University of Leicester actually did the physics and they
00:01:33,00:01:40,worked out that if you were on a normal wingsuit which has a wingspan of about 1.4 square meters
00:01:40,00:01:45,"and if you were on a 11 meters per second you would be able to run, jump up and take off"
00:01:45,00:01:46,and fly.
00:01:46,00:01:47,So great.
00:01:47,00:01:49,"So if you're a normal person you couldn't, right?"
00:01:49,00:01:51,It's only if you're as fast as Usain Bolt.
00:01:51,00:01:54,He is just him and a few others who are cracking that speed.
00:01:54,00:01:59,"So Usain Bolt can go at 12 meters per second or he could in his head, he's now retired."
00:01:59,00:02:06,"So I imagine that he's useless but yeah, Usain Bolt in the day could do it, a normal person"
00:02:06,00:02:10,could do it if they could run at 6 meters per second but they would have a large and unwieldy
00:02:10,00:02:11,wingsuit.
00:02:11,00:02:14,So they wouldn't be able to get away with the normal sort of day-to-day wingsuit that we're
00:02:14,00:02:15,all wearing now.
00:02:15,00:02:16,Very cool.
00:02:16,00:02:19,You also need a very warm coat though wouldn't you?
00:02:19,00:02:22,Because the temperature is about -180 degrees Celsius.
00:02:22,00:02:23,Yes.
00:02:23,00:02:26,And actually warm coat would weigh you down quite a lot and then the physics probably wouldn't
00:02:26,00:02:27,work anymore.
00:02:27,00:02:28,We've got a very big coat.
00:02:28,00:02:29,Yeah.
00:02:29,00:02:33,"You remember when you were a kid and there was high winds, like gales and you would hold"
00:02:33,00:02:35,your coat out and then try and fly with it.
00:02:35,00:02:36,"Yeah, that was great."
00:02:36,00:02:37,Or your umbrella.
00:02:37,00:02:38,Sometimes you'd fly with an umbrella?
00:02:38,00:02:39,Yeah.
00:02:39,00:02:44,"Well, I wasn't Mary Poppins when I went to school but actually you couldn't do it with"
00:02:44,00:02:46,"the winds because there's not much wind on Titan, is there?"
00:02:46,00:02:47,No.
00:02:47,00:02:51,And that's because the temperature is always very low and we get our wind on Earth because
00:02:51,00:02:55,of the changes in temperature with the sun and they don't really get those changes of temperature.
00:02:55,00:02:58,"Yeah, which is why they - because they've got lakes."
00:02:58,00:03:04,"One of the reasons it's so great for human habitation, apparently, is that it's got stable"
00:03:04,00:03:07,"liquids on its surface, hasn't it, which is extremely unusual, and it has an atmosphere"
00:03:07,00:03:12,"that is sort of similar to Earth's, but it's liquids - well, similar, yes."
00:03:12,00:03:13,It's not similar.
00:03:13,00:03:17,It's a fairly similar level of kind of thickness and it's got some nitrogen in it.
00:03:17,00:03:18,It's got lots and lots of nitrogen.
00:03:18,00:03:19,There's no problem with nitrogen.
00:03:19,00:03:23,"You like nitrogen, you get a lot of Titan, but it's got no oxygen basically."
00:03:23,00:03:24,Yeah.
00:03:24,00:03:25,So the lakes are made out of methane.
00:03:25,00:03:26,They are.
00:03:26,00:03:29,"It sort of has a lot of methane and ethane in it, which I imagine means that it smells really"
00:03:29,00:03:30,bad on there.
00:03:30,00:03:34,"Well, in fact, I think they might have looked into how the atmosphere there smells."
00:03:34,00:03:36,They've tried to recreate it.
00:03:36,00:03:41,Scientists did this this year or last year and they got some methane and ethane involved.
00:03:41,00:03:45,They got some nitrogen involved and it still wasn't behaving quite like Titan's atmosphere.
00:03:45,00:03:50,And then they added some benzene and that's the crucial ingredient that mimics the atmosphere
00:03:50,00:03:51,and it smells like petrol.
00:03:51,00:03:55,"So the whole place, if we live there, smells like petrol station."
00:03:55,00:03:56,Yeah.
00:03:56,00:03:57,I kept the smell of petrol stations.
00:03:57,00:03:59,Can I just say it's one of my favourite smells?
00:03:59,00:04:00,Yeah.
00:04:00,00:04:01,It's very nice.
00:04:01,00:04:06,"I like that too, but a lot of people kept saying how good Titan would be and they were saying"
00:04:06,00:04:07,things like that.
00:04:07,00:04:08,It's got some liquid.
00:04:08,00:04:09,It's got an atmosphere.
00:04:09,00:04:12,It's the only other place in our solar system where it rains.
00:04:12,00:04:15,It just sounds like a recipe for a very bad picnic.
00:04:15,00:04:21,"I think it's really, really habitable compared to the other moons of solar system, which is"
00:04:21,00:04:22,a bit of a low bar.
00:04:22,00:04:26,"The other thing about picnics is instead of lost flying around, you have 100 meter runners"
00:04:26,00:04:30,kind of fly around.
00:04:30,00:04:36,"Another good thing about Titan, since you're so busy bouncing it, is that they've recreated"
00:04:36,00:04:41,also Titan's lakes because there's a plan for NASA to send a submarine up there in 2025.
00:04:41,00:04:45,"I'd send a spaceship if I was NASA, but I'd go on."
00:04:45,00:04:47,You need to ride to them.
00:04:47,00:04:51,"They're sending a submarine up and they're going to get there and they need to dive, so they"
00:04:51,00:04:55,"need to deal with the coldness of the liquid, but they realise that icebergs can't form."
00:04:55,00:05:00,"So one of the people we're creating, as I said, a really vital positive is the fact that"
00:05:00,00:05:05,"because the freezing temperature of these methane lakes is so low, icebergs not a possibility,"
00:05:05,00:05:11,so you won't get Titanic on Titan and also the submarine won't crash into any icebergs.
00:05:11,00:05:15,Do you know who might be crewing this submarine that we're going to send up?
00:05:15,00:05:16,Robots.
00:05:16,00:05:17,Bacteria.
00:05:17,00:05:18,Come on.
00:05:18,00:05:21,"Well, it's a stretch, but."
00:05:21,00:05:27,"No, so there are deep sea bacteria which theoretically could survive there."
00:05:27,00:05:33,"Well, they can't drive a spaceship or a submarine, they'll be an intense training montage"
00:05:33,00:05:34,with the bacteria.
00:05:34,00:05:40,"No, but they're called, oh, this is a tough name, methanol thermococcus ocanoensis and"
00:05:40,00:05:45,they can survive irrespective of temperature and pressure and vitamins and toxic chemicals.
00:05:45,00:05:47,And I think they live around vents very deep in the sea.
00:05:47,00:05:48,"Vitamin E, did you say?"
00:05:48,00:05:49,"Yeah, they don't even."
00:05:49,00:05:53,They wouldn't even need to take vitamin meals in pill form when they're at bay.
00:05:53,00:05:56,I don't save on satzoomerite.
00:05:56,00:05:58,I think basically they just go into hibernation as soon as the conditions are right for them
00:05:58,00:06:00,to spring back into what they do.
00:06:00,00:06:04,So we could possibly set up a submarine in front of those guys and just see how they did.
00:06:04,00:06:09,"I went on to Yale Scientific Magazine because they had an article, ""Why can't humans fly?"""
00:06:09,00:06:13,"Yeah, we can't, turns out."
00:06:13,00:06:18,We would need a wingspan of at least 6.7 meters to fly according to this website.
00:06:18,00:06:23,"That's 6.7 across the whole wingspan, so 3.35 either side."
00:06:23,00:06:28,"Yeah, it's still a lot and would make the wings too heavy to function, and also the muscles"
00:06:28,00:06:29,that you need.
00:06:29,00:06:34,"So those wings wouldn't need to have smaller wings, helping them fly."
00:06:34,00:06:38,"But we've sort of cracked quite an important human powered flight thing really recently,"
00:06:38,00:06:39,isn't we?
00:06:39,00:06:47,"Because there was a price set up in 1970, I think it was, awarding Â£250,000 for the first"
00:06:47,00:06:50,person to make a human powered helicopter.
00:06:50,00:06:53,And it was thought to be impossible and all these studies were written saying it's impossible.
00:06:53,00:06:57,"And I only found Nick's was reading a Washington Post article saying, ""No one's come anywhere"
00:06:57,00:06:59,"close to achieving this in 2011."""
00:06:59,00:07:04,"And in 2013, we did it, or engineers from the University of Toronto did it."
00:07:04,00:07:09,"And they've built this helicopter, which is basically about the size of a football pitch with"
00:07:09,00:07:10,these...
00:07:10,00:07:12,I would buy one human.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"Yeah, it's unbelievably light."
00:07:14,00:07:18,"It weighs only 50 kilos, but it's ridiculously large, because as you say, you've got to have"
00:07:18,00:07:19,really big wings.
00:07:19,00:07:23,"And there's a little guy on a bicycle in the middle of it, who does, but he's cycling up."
00:07:23,00:07:24,It's amazing.
00:07:24,00:07:25,"And then, well, it's not as amazing as it would be."
00:07:25,00:07:26,But it's so...
00:07:26,00:07:28,My wife flies helicopters.
00:07:28,00:07:29,Yeah.
00:07:29,00:07:32,"And we always have to find a place for her to land, which is not too many trees around"
00:07:32,00:07:33,and stuff like that.
00:07:33,00:07:37,"I think if your helicopter's a size of a football pitch, that is going to be tough, right?"
00:07:37,00:07:38,It's too big.
00:07:38,00:07:43,I looked up a list of names of human-powered flight machines.
00:07:43,00:07:44,"Oh, great."
00:07:44,00:07:48,They were called things like the reluctant Phoenix.
00:07:48,00:07:52,"That's what a drag name is, isn't it?"
00:07:52,00:07:55,That does sound like they once crashed it in a ball of flames.
00:07:55,00:07:56,Yeah.
00:07:56,00:07:58,"They couldn't get it back again, right?"
00:07:58,00:07:59,There was a reluctantly...
00:07:59,00:08:02,"The Perkins inflatable, which I liked, there was the puffin."
00:08:02,00:08:03,"The puffin, too."
00:08:03,00:08:05,"And there were three called Icarus, named after..."
00:08:05,00:08:07,Why did they name it after the thing that...
00:08:07,00:08:08,The one who dies?
00:08:08,00:08:09,Yeah.
00:08:09,00:08:11,They only read the first half of the story.
00:08:11,00:08:12,This is great.
00:08:12,00:08:13,Don't need to finish.
00:08:13,00:08:17,Really respect this guy's confidence.
00:08:17,00:08:21,"You same Bolt, who I know you've touched on in the past, but did you know that..."
00:08:21,00:08:24,"So he has scoliosis, so he has curvature of the spine."
00:08:24,00:08:28,So his legs are actually significantly different length from each other.
00:08:28,00:08:29,So his...
00:08:29,00:08:30,So his...
00:08:30,00:08:34,"Not quite as dramatic as Richard III, I don't think."
00:08:34,00:08:36,But his right leg is half an inch shorter than his left.
00:08:36,00:08:39,"The prevailing wisdom is that if you want to go in a straight line as fast as you can,"
00:08:39,00:08:40,you should be symmetrical.
00:08:40,00:08:43,And obviously he's not quite symmetrical.
00:08:43,00:08:46,"And they don't know if he was symmetrical, would he go faster?"
00:08:46,00:08:51,Or does this slight off-balance somehow work in his favour?
00:08:51,00:08:54,"Because he goes pretty quick from what out of his hands, actually, yeah."
00:08:54,00:08:57,You do know about the sport.
00:08:57,00:09:00,"For someone who doesn't like sport, you've picked a very sport-based fact, involving"
00:09:00,00:09:02,both printing and flying.
00:09:02,00:09:06,And there is a sprinter at the moment called Brianna Liston.
00:09:06,00:09:08,And she's 12 years old.
00:09:08,00:09:10,She's from Jamaica.
00:09:10,00:09:18,"And in 2017, she ran the 100 metres in 11.86 seconds, which is unbelievably fast."
00:09:18,00:09:24,"And in fact, if she'd have taken part in the 1896 Olympics, she would have won."
00:09:24,00:09:26,By more than 0.1 of a second.
00:09:26,00:09:27,12-year-old girl.
00:09:27,00:09:33,"And the team behind the Cassini mission, which was the probe that went to Saturn, and it"
00:09:33,00:09:36,"dropped off the, how do you pronounce it?"
00:09:36,00:09:41,Huygens is the moon lander that they dropped down.
00:09:41,00:09:44,It's the only human thing ever to land on a body beyond the asteroid belt.
00:09:44,00:09:45,And now it's there.
00:09:45,00:09:46,It's going to be there for millions of years.
00:09:46,00:09:47,"It's very, very cool."
00:09:47,00:09:50,"Anyway, the Cassini probe, the team behind it."
00:09:50,00:09:52,They spent 20 years working on it.
00:09:52,00:09:54,There's a huge long project.
00:09:54,00:09:57,And they got so close that they had all these cool team things that they did together.
00:09:57,00:10:01,"So, they had a softball team called the Roving Marauders."
00:10:01,00:10:05,"And whenever there was a big date in Cassini or Saturn or what it tightened history, they would"
00:10:05,00:10:08,brew a special beer and they'd give it a special name.
00:10:08,00:10:09,Yeah.
00:10:09,00:10:10,Nice.
00:10:10,00:10:11,Do you think we should do that?
00:10:11,00:10:12,We don't have enough for softball teams.
00:10:12,00:10:13,"Oh, we already do, James."
00:10:13,00:10:14,Do we?
00:10:14,00:10:16,The softball's only a three-player game.
00:10:16,00:10:17,Oh.
00:10:17,00:10:22,"And there's a no James's rule, and I already turn up, so."
00:10:22,00:10:32,"OK, we should move on to fact number two."
00:10:32,00:10:34,And that is my fact.
00:10:34,00:10:40,"My fact this week is that in 1604, one of King James' first grooms rode from London to York"
00:10:40,00:10:44,and back five times in the space of five days for a bet.
00:10:44,00:10:45,Wow.
00:10:45,00:10:49,Did you choose a James' fact because James Rossin is here today?
00:10:49,00:10:50,"I did, yeah."
00:10:50,00:10:51,It's the first James.
00:10:51,00:10:53,You've never done a James' fact before.
00:10:53,00:10:55,"I just never noticed you being here, I guess."
00:10:55,00:10:57,"Yeah, this is really cool."
00:10:57,00:10:59,So this is a guy called John Lepton.
00:10:59,00:11:04,"And it was first recorded in this amazing book, which I wasted all my research time reading"
00:11:04,00:11:07,"today, which was this book called ""A Bridgment of the English Chronicle."""
00:11:07,00:11:11,"And it was written in 1604 by a guy who died in 1605, so he just got in there."
00:11:11,00:11:16,"And yeah, it was this story that he sort of said that he reckon he'd be able to go to"
00:11:16,00:11:19,and from London and York five times in six days.
00:11:19,00:11:22,"And he ended up managing to do it with one day, too, spare."
00:11:22,00:11:23,Wow.
00:11:23,00:11:24,"It is really good, doesn't it?"
00:11:24,00:11:25,Yeah.
00:11:25,00:11:26,Is it a different horse every time?
00:11:26,00:11:27,That's the annoying thing.
00:11:27,00:11:28,It wasn't recorded.
00:11:28,00:11:29,How have any changed his horses?
00:11:29,00:11:33,"You would normally change your horse, though, on a journey that long, I think."
00:11:33,00:11:34,Would you?
00:11:34,00:11:35,Yeah.
00:11:35,00:11:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:36,00:11:37,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:37,00:11:38,From my knowledge of horses.
00:11:38,00:11:39,Probably swapping at Watford Gap.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Yeah.
00:11:40,00:11:47,"So when he finished this, according to the book that I read, it said, I think this is probably"
00:11:47,00:11:48,the same one.
00:11:48,00:11:52,So he finished his appointed journey to the admiration of all men.
00:11:52,00:11:57,"In five days, and upon Tuesday the 28th, he came to court at Greenwich to his majesty in"
00:11:57,00:12:01,a fresh and cheerful amount as when he first began.
00:12:01,00:12:02,Yeah.
00:12:02,00:12:03,Nice.
00:12:03,00:12:07,"Although he arrived on, so he was due to arrive on the Saturday night, it's really cool"
00:12:07,00:12:11,"this account because it really gives intense details of the time he arrived, how long he slept"
00:12:11,00:12:12,for.
00:12:12,00:12:16,"He arrived on the Friday night, and then there is a gap in our knowledge for the Saturday"
00:12:16,00:12:17,and the Sunday.
00:12:17,00:12:22,Let me imagine he got absolutely hammered in York for Saturday and Sunday.
00:12:22,00:12:23,Workout with it.
00:12:23,00:12:26,Hainers hang over on Monday and then struggled back to be cheerful on Tuesday.
00:12:26,00:12:28,Sounds great.
00:12:28,00:12:32,"One thing that I think I read about this, which I think is quite interesting, from the Journal"
00:12:32,00:12:39,"of Sport History, it said that this could kind of be seen as the first sporting record."
00:12:39,00:12:42,"So it wasn't really until the 19th century that people became obsessed with like, I've"
00:12:42,00:12:44,done this sport in this amount of time.
00:12:44,00:12:47,"You know, that kind of record-breaking mentality."
00:12:47,00:12:52,There was another two centuries before men began routinely to abstract the quantified performance
00:12:52,00:12:54,as a mark to be equaled or surpassed.
00:12:54,00:12:59,"But this is kind of the first instance of that happening, he said, I can travel this long"
00:12:59,00:13:00,in this distance.
00:13:00,00:13:01,Yeah.
00:13:01,00:13:02,Will you put money on it?
00:13:02,00:13:03,Exactly.
00:13:03,00:13:04,Yeah.
00:13:04,00:13:05,That's really cool.
00:13:05,00:13:06,"They do, don't they?"
00:13:06,00:13:07,They call it the first sort of sporting match that we have a record of.
00:13:07,00:13:11,But I was reading again in this book that there were lots of really weirdly progressive rules
00:13:11,00:13:12,around it.
00:13:12,00:13:14,So it became a huge gambling thing.
00:13:14,00:13:19,"We often bet on horse races then as now, but if you won more than 100 marks on a horse race,"
00:13:19,00:13:22,you had to give up all of your remainder to the poor.
00:13:22,00:13:24,So that was a rule that was introduced in James' time.
00:13:24,00:13:30,"There was an act passed in Scotland that said, stop feeding horses hard meat in summer."
00:13:30,00:13:36,"That practice being held one among other occasions of death of the victims, which I think is basically"
00:13:36,00:13:38,the poor people need meat in summer.
00:13:38,00:13:42,"And if people keep feeding it to their horses, then the poor people aren't getting it, which"
00:13:42,00:13:43,is very progressive.
00:13:43,00:13:45,I feel like the National Lottery.
00:13:45,00:13:47,Exactly like the National Lottery.
00:13:47,00:13:51,"Where if you were more than 100 quid, you have to give the rest of the poor."
00:13:51,00:13:54,Have you been not quite like the National Lottery?
00:13:54,00:13:58,Do you know about John Lepton's other horse feet?
00:13:58,00:13:59,No.
00:13:59,00:14:00,Do you mean hooves?
00:14:00,00:14:02,"Yeah, hooves, that's it."
00:14:02,00:14:08,"So, surely after this event, there was, remember, remember the fifth November, the Gump"
00:14:08,00:14:13,"Harder Plot, and a couple of days after Thomas Percy was a fugitive, he was involved in the"
00:14:13,00:14:16,"conspiracy, everyone was looking for him."
00:14:16,00:14:21,"So he had connections in Northumberland, Cumberland and Yorkshire in the North of England."
00:14:21,00:14:24,And people thought that he might be sort of hiding out there.
00:14:24,00:14:29,"So our hero, John Lepton, was sent to see if they could find him."
00:14:29,00:14:30,No way.
00:14:30,00:14:35,"And according to my source, John Lepton missed his man and his epic ride took him to Scotland"
00:14:35,00:14:38,before he realised that the trail had gone cold.
00:14:38,00:14:42,"So in that instance, he sort of overshot his mark a little bit."
00:14:42,00:14:46,"Well, because he was so fast, so he was probably going by the average time he was told"
00:14:46,00:14:47,it would be.
00:14:47,00:14:48,He probably thought he was in Wolverhampton.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Yeah.
00:14:49,00:14:51,And then he was in Scotland.
00:14:51,00:14:54,I've got to think about a great horse racing bet.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Oh god.
00:14:55,00:14:58,"Well, this is a bet about distance and travel."
00:14:58,00:15:04,"So there was a guy called Lord March, who made a bet that he could get a letter 50 miles"
00:15:04,00:15:08,"in an hour, which at the time exactly was impossible."
00:15:08,00:15:09,I would take that bet.
00:15:09,00:15:10,"Yeah, exactly."
00:15:10,00:15:12,No horse couldn't run at 50 miles an hour for an hour.
00:15:12,00:15:13,No.
00:15:13,00:15:15,"Even if you were on a cheetah, it would be pretty hard."
00:15:15,00:15:16,A cheetah couldn't do that.
00:15:16,00:15:17,He won the bet.
00:15:17,00:15:18,No.
00:15:18,00:15:19,"Yes, he didn't use horses."
00:15:19,00:15:20,And he used pigeons.
00:15:20,00:15:21,No.
00:15:21,00:15:22,That's quite a good idea.
00:15:22,00:15:23,"Although, I don't know."
00:15:23,00:15:25,Even though I'm not sure they can go at 50 miles an hour.
00:15:25,00:15:27,"What he did was, this is very clever."
00:15:27,00:15:29,He put the letter inside a ball.
00:15:29,00:15:30,Okay.
00:15:30,00:15:31,And then he hired...
00:15:31,00:15:32,"Oh, hamsters."
00:15:32,00:15:33,No.
00:15:33,00:15:40,"He hired 20 expert cricketers and for an hour, they threw it in a massive circle all the"
00:15:40,00:15:41,way around over and over again.
00:15:41,00:15:42,Oh.
00:15:42,00:15:44,The letter travelled more than 50 miles.
00:15:44,00:15:45,No way.
00:15:45,00:15:46,In that hour.
00:15:46,00:15:47,Doesn't count.
00:15:47,00:15:48,He won the bet.
00:15:48,00:15:49,"Well, I wouldn't pay up."
00:15:49,00:15:50,Wait.
00:15:50,00:15:51,Hasn't got anywhere.
00:15:51,00:15:54,"I think that's a really crafty, crafty Lord March."
00:15:54,00:15:55,It's a clever man.
00:15:55,00:15:58,I've got a couple of ridiculous wages from the 18th century.
00:15:58,00:16:02,So I think that wages really took off in the 18th century when it all just got a bit
00:16:02,00:16:03,silly.
00:16:03,00:16:10,"In 1735, Count De Bookberg, better large wage on riding to Edinburgh, backwards on a horse,"
00:16:10,00:16:12,which was accomplished in just under four days.
00:16:12,00:16:15,I don't know if the count did it or if it got someone to do it.
00:16:15,00:16:18,"So just to be clear, the horse is going forwards, but you're facing backwards."
00:16:18,00:16:20,"Oh, it's the horse facing backwards."
00:16:20,00:16:25,I think it's like on a train where the train's going forward and you're facing backwards.
00:16:25,00:16:26,Yeah.
00:16:26,00:16:28,You probably didn't need to make a train analogy though.
00:16:28,00:16:32,It's like a horse going forwards and you're facing backwards.
00:16:32,00:16:38,"And in 1770, I read this from the gentleman, which is just so great, two hours bad that"
00:16:38,00:16:43,one could ride from London to Edinburgh and back in less time than it took the other one
00:16:43,00:16:45,to draw a million dots.
00:16:45,00:16:49,He's counting the million.
00:16:49,00:16:50,I do not know.
00:16:50,00:16:54,"And so they announced the wager, but then there doesn't seem to be any sort of follow-up"
00:16:54,00:16:57,or result section in the following in the following issue.
00:16:57,00:16:58,So you don't know who won that?
00:16:58,00:16:59,So I don't know who won.
00:16:59,00:17:02,"It's actually, actually, you only don't know who won because it's a little"
00:17:02,00:17:05,very long line of dots and you don't know what happens at the end of the long line of dots.
00:17:05,00:17:06,Yeah.
00:17:06,00:17:07,There's a lot of suspense.
00:17:07,00:17:12,But he could make the dots in the most expedient manner that he could contrive.
00:17:12,00:17:18,Which I think includes hiring people to draw dots or some sort of mechanical hiring million
00:17:18,00:17:19,people.
00:17:19,00:17:20,It's just one dot each.
00:17:20,00:17:21,Yeah.
00:17:21,00:17:23,Just glue a million pencils together and make one dot.
00:17:23,00:17:27,Just glue a million pencils together.
00:17:27,00:17:30,Does it count the time that you take gluing the pencils together or?
00:17:30,00:17:31,Yeah.
00:17:31,00:17:32,That's all part of it.
00:17:32,00:17:33,That's part of the time.
00:17:33,00:17:34,"I mean, you missed the problem."
00:17:34,00:17:35,I see.
00:17:35,00:17:36,Like the time it takes me to press a dot.
00:17:36,00:17:37,"Right, a dot."
00:17:37,00:17:40,"You're not going to be able to do one pencil gluing, are you?"
00:17:40,00:17:41,I would start gluing.
00:17:41,00:17:45,"I would start drawing dots, but I would instruct a friend to go and hire a lot of people"
00:17:45,00:17:48,immediately to come and join and hire more and draw more dots.
00:17:48,00:17:51,"I reckon 1,000 people are 1,000 dots."
00:17:51,00:17:52,"Oh, easy."
00:17:52,00:17:53,Yeah.
00:17:53,00:17:54,"I'm paying 1,000 people."
00:17:54,00:17:55,Like peasants?
00:17:55,00:17:56,Yeah.
00:17:56,00:17:57,18th century peasants?
00:17:57,00:17:58,Can we just do what you tell them?
00:17:58,00:17:59,Yeah.
00:17:59,00:18:00,But so many peasants are illiterate.
00:18:00,00:18:01,I don't know that.
00:18:01,00:18:03,You can still draw a dot if you're illiterate.
00:18:03,00:18:06,"No, they were really illiterate back then."
00:18:06,00:18:08,I've got lines.
00:18:08,00:18:11,What if you get a paintbrush and just kind of flick it?
00:18:11,00:18:12,Does that count as a dot?
00:18:12,00:18:13,Ooh.
00:18:13,00:18:16,Let me revisit the word here.
00:18:16,00:18:17,Amazing.
00:18:17,00:18:20,"But what a good bet, because he will be drawing dots, drawing dots, and the other guy will"
00:18:20,00:18:21,be writing to Edinburgh.
00:18:21,00:18:25,"It's very exciting as a pencil, and they're different kinds of achievement as well."
00:18:25,00:18:26,Yeah.
00:18:26,00:18:27,I think that'll be really exciting.
00:18:27,00:18:32,"I think if they had the Grand National and they also had some dots, writing competition"
00:18:32,00:18:33,at the same time.
00:18:33,00:18:34,Yeah.
00:18:34,00:18:35,It would be a hell of a lot more popular.
00:18:35,00:18:36,Yeah.
00:18:36,00:18:37,No.
00:18:37,00:18:41,"And there's another good bet, which is another kind of crafty bet, a bit like Andes, where"
00:18:41,00:18:42,someone was outwisted.
00:18:42,00:18:48,"This is in the 18th century, and the Earl of Barrymore, who apparently was known as Hellgate"
00:18:48,00:18:54,"or Rake of Rakes, because he was a big womanizer and a bit of a rake, he thought he was a bit"
00:18:54,00:18:57,of a sport.
00:18:57,00:19:01,"Yeah, like that."
00:19:01,00:19:05,"He fancied himself as a sportsman, and this guy called Mr Bullock challenged him to a running"
00:19:05,00:19:09,"race, and Bullock was a massively fat, unfit man."
00:19:09,00:19:14,"He weighed 18 stone, and he said, ""I challenge you to a race, all I'm saying is I want a 35-yard"
00:19:14,00:19:16,"head start, and I want to be able to choose the route."""
00:19:16,00:19:17,"And Barrymore said, ""Yeah, sure."
00:19:17,00:19:18,I'm way fatter than you.
00:19:18,00:19:20,"Look at you, you're a mess."""
00:19:20,00:19:25,"And so lots of people put money on it, everyone backed Barrymore, and Bullock took those bets,"
00:19:25,00:19:30,"so he's the only one backing himself, and the route he chose ran through an extremely"
00:19:30,00:19:37,"narrow alley, and so he ran the entire route with poor old Barrymore not being able to squeeze"
00:19:37,00:19:41,"past him on either side, and apparently he sort of wobbled from side to side as he went"
00:19:41,00:19:43,to make sure there was no way of passing.
00:19:43,00:19:44,Wow.
00:19:44,00:19:45,That is brilliant.
00:19:45,00:19:52,"The fact about jockeys, as we're on horse racing, so jockey posture, that weird posture that"
00:19:52,00:19:57,"jockeys have, they're kind of crouched on the horse, they're all sort of hunched up."
00:19:57,00:20:01,"This only caught on in 1898, before that, you would just sit upright and try and win the"
00:20:01,00:20:06,"horse race, and there was a guy, a jockey called James Forman Sloan, he started doing it,"
00:20:06,00:20:12,"and it was like the Fosbury flop, you know, in high jumping, within ten years, everyone"
00:20:12,00:20:17,"around the world was doing it, and horse race, completion times, improved by 5% to 7% over"
00:20:17,00:20:20,"those ten years, solely because of this guy."
00:20:20,00:20:21,Wow.
00:20:21,00:20:22,Yeah.
00:20:22,00:20:23,I can't believe they didn't figure that out before.
00:20:23,00:20:24,It's so obvious.
00:20:24,00:20:27,"But it's not where reducing wind resistance, which I think it would be."
00:20:27,00:20:28,"No, I wouldn't have thought that."
00:20:28,00:20:32,I would have thought you were kind of getting a bit of a kind of a movement going.
00:20:32,00:20:37,"I mean, doing the jump, it's not grinding back and forth."
00:20:37,00:20:41,"It's when you're upright, you're like a sandbag, and you jog up and down on the horse,"
00:20:41,00:20:45,"but when you're in a jockey position, or if they call it martini-glass position, you can"
00:20:45,00:20:50,"move relative to the horse, so you are moving at a more constant speed, and I think it just"
00:20:50,00:20:52,helps the whole thing go a bit more smoothly.
00:20:52,00:20:53,Maybe for the horse and for you.
00:20:53,00:20:54,Like finding a resident's almost.
00:20:54,00:20:55,"Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:20:55,00:21:01,Do you guys know that the precursor to the steeple chase was the wild goose chase.
00:21:01,00:21:05,"So I just came across this in old book, which was referring to a wild goose chase as an"
00:21:05,00:21:10,"actual race, and this was the main horse race that people bet on before the steeple chase,"
00:21:10,00:21:14,"and what you did was the horses all started running, and after racing each other, after 12 score"
00:21:14,00:21:19,"yards, after 240 yards, whoever was in the lead was the one who chose the route from that"
00:21:19,00:21:20,point onwards.
00:21:20,00:21:21,And you had to play.
00:21:21,00:21:22,Amazing.
00:21:22,00:21:27,And so they all went into this really thin house.
00:21:27,00:21:31,"And it was mad, and so you'd like dodge about, you jump over a ditch, and then suddenly"
00:21:31,00:21:33,"you'd take them over a massive fence, they didn't know what they were doing."
00:21:33,00:21:36,"That's a really good idea, but then if you overtake them, do you then get to choose"
00:21:36,00:21:37,the route?
00:21:37,00:21:38,No.
00:21:38,00:21:39,You've won.
00:21:39,00:21:45,"Wait, but if you, if you overtake them, there's no route to get wrong, is there?"
00:21:45,00:21:47,"So if you overtake them, you choose the route."
00:21:47,00:21:49,"That's why I was thinking, but actually that's the end of the race, if you are."
00:21:49,00:21:52,"That's the end of the race, because apparently when you choose the route, when is the race"
00:21:52,00:21:53,end?
00:21:53,00:21:54,You just have to run forever.
00:21:54,00:21:55,This is why it was banned.
00:21:55,00:22:00,"So again, too many thousands of deaths."
00:22:00,00:22:04,"It was very dangerous, and it was banned, according to this, like Sports Illustrated"
00:22:04,00:22:10,"Equivalent. It was banned because it was too hard on the horses and the riders, because"
00:22:10,00:22:11,they would just collapse in the end.
00:22:11,00:22:15,"They'd just go on and on and on, dodging about, and then one of them would collapse."
00:22:15,00:22:16,That's amazing.
00:22:16,00:22:19,But that's the original world goose chase.
00:22:19,00:22:23,"In 2012, Prince Harry bought chairs in a horse called Usain Colt."
00:22:23,00:22:24,Amazing.
00:22:24,00:22:28,"James, you get to edit that into either section of the show."
00:22:28,00:22:36,I love that. That's so funny.
00:22:36,00:22:41,"Okay, we should move on to fact number three, and that is Andy's fact."
00:22:41,00:22:42,That's right.
00:22:42,00:22:45,"My fact is that there are species of wasps, the size of a meba."
00:22:45,00:22:46,That's so cool.
00:22:46,00:22:47,Very cool.
00:22:47,00:22:50,"And not special giant a meba, either, because there are giant a meba we talked about before"
00:22:50,00:22:51,on the show.
00:22:51,00:22:55,"Yeah, because I was going to say there's an a meba, which is 10 centimetres long."
00:22:55,00:22:56,Exactly.
00:22:56,00:23:04,"The smallest dog is 9.65 centimetres, so there are dogs that are smaller than the mebbers."
00:23:04,00:23:05,So exactly.
00:23:05,00:23:06,"A meba, James."
00:23:06,00:23:08,"Yeah, can we clarify plurals?"
00:23:08,00:23:09,A meba.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"A meba, yeah."
00:23:10,00:23:16,"So this is a wasp called Megafragma Mimari Penne, and it's 0.2 millimetres long."
00:23:16,00:23:21,"It's the third smallest insect known, and the other two smaller ones are also wasps, so"
00:23:21,00:23:25,"I've just picked this guy, because he's been studied."
00:23:25,00:23:26,But it's the size of an meba.
00:23:26,00:23:29,"And it's got eyes, brains, wings, muscle, gut."
00:23:29,00:23:33,"So it's obviously made up of thousands and thousands and thousands of cells, but it's"
00:23:33,00:23:35,the size of a one cell organism.
00:23:35,00:23:36,And it's done that.
00:23:36,00:23:41,"There's been a study by a scientist called Alexei Pololov, and it found that basically they're"
00:23:41,00:23:45,"missing huge amounts of stuff, and they have to cut down on their own brains and remove"
00:23:45,00:23:51,all the nuclei from the cells inside their skull just to make room for a few neurons.
00:23:51,00:23:52,Really?
00:23:52,00:23:53,It's incredibly weird.
00:23:53,00:23:57,"So do they have nuclei, and then they extract them as they grow, or they just don't have any"
00:23:57,00:23:58,nuclei having to start?
00:23:58,00:24:01,I think it destroys them until it only has a few hundred.
00:24:01,00:24:03,This is what I read.
00:24:03,00:24:06,Is it one of these that doesn't really need to make that many decisions in life?
00:24:06,00:24:07,Yeah.
00:24:07,00:24:08,It's like simple.
00:24:08,00:24:10,"It doesn't need that many neurons, right?"
00:24:10,00:24:14,"But it's got to make, it's only got 100, 100th, perhaps, as many as a bee."
00:24:14,00:24:15,OK.
00:24:15,00:24:17,And bees themselves do not make that many decisions.
00:24:17,00:24:18,No.
00:24:18,00:24:20,"Flower, high, flower, high."
00:24:20,00:24:23,It's about the size of a human ovum.
00:24:23,00:24:25,That does not help putting some effect on you.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"No, no."
00:24:26,00:24:27,Think of a human ovum.
00:24:27,00:24:28,No.
00:24:28,00:24:31,I think of a very small full stop.
00:24:31,00:24:32,What the heck?
00:24:32,00:24:33,I think of a dot.
00:24:33,00:24:35,I think of a million of those.
00:24:35,00:24:39,"I'm afraid you've only drawn 99999 dots, because this is a wasp."
00:24:39,00:24:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:41,00:24:42,The other...
00:24:42,00:24:44,"Oh, winds of the wedge."
00:24:44,00:24:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:46,00:24:47,Yeah.
00:24:47,00:24:49,What was the name of the wasp?
00:24:49,00:24:52,"Mega fragment, my maripeni."
00:24:52,00:24:53,"There's another one, which is small."
00:24:53,00:24:58,"I think it might be one of the two that's smaller than this one, called decopo motha."
00:24:58,00:25:03,"Ech mepterygis, something like that."
00:25:03,00:25:05,And it's the males that are really small in this species.
00:25:05,00:25:07,I don't know if it's the same with yours.
00:25:07,00:25:12,And the reason they're so small is because basically they never leave their egg.
00:25:12,00:25:18,"They kind of live inside their egg, and they mate with their sisters inside the egg."
00:25:18,00:25:19,And then the sisters fly off and they just die.
00:25:19,00:25:20,"Oh, mate."
00:25:20,00:25:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:21,00:25:22,Broaden your eyes.
00:25:22,00:25:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:23,00:25:24,How?
00:25:24,00:25:25,That's crazy.
00:25:25,00:25:26,Yeah.
00:25:26,00:25:27,So that's the whole life.
00:25:27,00:25:28,They just...
00:25:28,00:25:29,They grow up in the egg.
00:25:29,00:25:30,They mate with their sisters.
00:25:30,00:25:31,They die.
00:25:31,00:25:32,So are these parasitic wasps?
00:25:32,00:25:33,Is it their own egg they're in?
00:25:33,00:25:34,Or are they in someone else's?
00:25:34,00:25:35,They're in their own egg.
00:25:35,00:25:36,OK.
00:25:36,00:25:37,Yeah.
00:25:37,00:25:38,But parasitic wasps are amazing.
00:25:38,00:25:39,Yeah.
00:25:39,00:25:41,"Actually, you said wasps there instead of wasps."
00:25:41,00:25:42,"So I'll say it again, then."
00:25:42,00:25:44,But do you know that wasp used to be wasps?
00:25:44,00:25:45,Really?
00:25:45,00:25:46,Yeah.
00:25:46,00:25:49,Just through people saying it wrong over the years.
00:25:49,00:25:52,"As in it comes from an old, Germanic word, whoops."
00:25:52,00:25:55,And I really hope it shows an etymology with whoops.
00:25:55,00:25:56,It probably doesn't.
00:25:56,00:25:58,"But it would be nice, wouldn't it?"
00:25:58,00:26:00,"Well, like whoops I've stepped on a..."
00:26:00,00:26:01,On a wasps.
00:26:01,00:26:02,Yeah.
00:26:02,00:26:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:04,00:26:07,"Yeah, parasitic wasps are totally awesome, aren't they?"
00:26:07,00:26:11,"Well, there's a piece by Ed Young, who writes a lot about bacteria."
00:26:11,00:26:12,He writes for the Atlantic.
00:26:12,00:26:13,It's a great piece.
00:26:13,00:26:14,He's so good.
00:26:14,00:26:17,I just want to say he's probably my favorite science journalist.
00:26:17,00:26:18,And you should all look.
00:26:18,00:26:19,"Yeah, I agree."
00:26:19,00:26:20,All right.
00:26:20,00:26:21,I'll have my turn.
00:26:21,00:26:24,Do you get his weekly email that he sends with all of his writings?
00:26:24,00:26:25,And it...
00:26:25,00:26:26,"Oh, well, I called you so much."
00:26:26,00:26:27,I called you so much.
00:26:27,00:26:28,I called you so much.
00:26:28,00:26:29,I called you so much.
00:26:29,00:26:30,I called you so much.
00:26:30,00:26:31,I called you so much.
00:26:31,00:26:32,There's a piece by him.
00:26:32,00:26:34,"Where he's saying everyone thinks the beetle is the king of the things,"
00:26:34,00:26:36,because there are so many species of them.
00:26:36,00:26:38,So he writes a bit better than saying the king of the things.
00:26:38,00:26:39,I don't think he does.
00:26:39,00:26:41,I don't think it's possible.
00:26:41,00:26:43,"So there are 380,000 species of beetle,"
00:26:43,00:26:47,"which is a quarter of all animal species, which is a lot, obviously."
00:26:47,00:26:50,"But there's a scientist from the University of Iowa called Andrew Forbes,"
00:26:50,00:26:53,who reckons that there are so many parasitic wasps
00:26:53,00:26:58,and that every single species of insect even has at least one
00:26:58,00:27:02,"and probably several species of tiny, tiny parasitic wasps inside it."
00:27:02,00:27:05,He reckons that wasps outnumber even beetles by about two and a half times.
00:27:05,00:27:09,"So is that like if everyone on the planet had an average of two hats,"
00:27:09,00:27:11,then there has to be more hats than people?
00:27:11,00:27:12,Exactly.
00:27:12,00:27:15,So the people are beetles than the hats of wasps?
00:27:15,00:27:16,"Yes, exactly."
00:27:16,00:27:19,"There are shed loads of wasps, given that we don't give them enough credit."
00:27:19,00:27:22,"I think there are just over 5,000 species of mammal"
00:27:22,00:27:26,"and 14,000 of ant and 200,000 species of wasps."
00:27:26,00:27:31,"And even if fig wasps have many thousands of species of fig wasps, don't they?"
00:27:31,00:27:33,So we need to pay them more attention.
00:27:33,00:27:34,So small.
00:27:34,00:27:36,They're so small that no one notices them.
00:27:36,00:27:39,"Even if you find a new beetle, it's probably got loads of wasps living in it,"
00:27:39,00:27:40,but you don't know about.
00:27:40,00:27:44,"There's an amazing quote from Josephine Rodriguez, who is an entomologist,"
00:27:44,00:27:48,who was responding to this discussion about there being more wasps than beetles.
00:27:48,00:27:52,"And she says, ""It doesn't surprise me at all that there are more wasps."
00:27:52,00:27:56,"I really think that only people that would disagree would be the fly people."""
00:27:56,00:28:00,So just like the politics within entomology is great.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"Oh, Pericomicalister isn't listening to this."
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Yeah, she's a fly person."
00:28:03,00:28:04,Has she been on that fly?
00:28:04,00:28:05,We've had a run?
00:28:05,00:28:06,Yes.
00:28:06,00:28:07,"Yeah, she'll be fuming."
00:28:07,00:28:11,"She'll go out and find 100,000 different species of fly today."
00:28:11,00:28:14,"There's a really cool parasitic wasp called the green eyed wasp,"
00:28:14,00:28:17,which parasites of a ladybird.
00:28:17,00:28:19,So it lays its eggs inside a ladybird.
00:28:19,00:28:21,"And then when they hatch, they come out."
00:28:21,00:28:24,And they immediately weave this cocoon between this ladybird's legs.
00:28:24,00:28:27,"And this paralyzes the ladybird, but it also sort of possesses the ladybird,"
00:28:27,00:28:29,so it turns it into a zombie.
00:28:29,00:28:32,"When you say so weaving the cocoon between the legs, which paralyzes them,"
00:28:32,00:28:34,is it like tying someone shoelaces together?
00:28:34,00:28:38,"Exactly the same as that, except also if you tie someone shoelaces together"
00:28:38,00:28:41,and then you injected their brain with some kind of chemical that turned them into a zombie.
00:28:41,00:28:43,That is a next-level prank.
00:28:43,00:28:47,You get two detentions for that one.
00:28:47,00:28:49,"But yeah, this is really cool."
00:28:49,00:28:53,"So this ladybird sits there and it's possessed, which means it twitches involuntarily,"
00:28:53,00:28:55,which scares away any potential predators.
00:28:55,00:29:00,So it's just standing there like this great fort with the babies all in between its legs.
00:29:00,00:29:03,"And then they crack out and leave, and the ladybird, I guess, dies."
00:29:03,00:29:04,"No, not true."
00:29:04,00:29:05,Really?
00:29:05,00:29:09,"A quarter of the ladybirds recover, and some of them are even parasitized again."
00:29:09,00:29:10,Oh my God.
00:29:10,00:29:11,So no.
00:29:11,00:29:14,Do you want to hear about my favourite messed-up was?
00:29:14,00:29:15,"Yes, please."
00:29:15,00:29:16,"Oh no, it's not."
00:29:16,00:29:17,It's a fly.
00:29:17,00:29:18,Anyway.
00:29:18,00:29:19,"Well, Erica will love this."
00:29:19,00:29:20,Okay.
00:29:20,00:29:23,This is the smallest fly that exists.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Okay.
00:29:24,00:29:29,"And it feeds on itself really tiny ants, not even normal size ants, really small ants."
00:29:29,00:29:34,And what it does is the egg hatches inside the ant parasitic fly.
00:29:34,00:29:39,"It goes into the head of the ant from inside, and it starts eating it."
00:29:39,00:29:44,"So it feeds on the muscles that control the mouth parts, which are very big and muscular bits."
00:29:44,00:29:46,So the ant then can't chew.
00:29:46,00:29:48,"So he's walking and I'm thinking, I can't chew anymore."
00:29:48,00:29:51,And then this tiny fly eats the brain.
00:29:51,00:29:53,So the ant now can't think anymore.
00:29:53,00:29:55,It can't even think I can't chew anymore.
00:29:55,00:29:56,Exactly.
00:29:56,00:29:58,But it stays walking around.
00:29:58,00:30:02,"It walks around for another fortnight while this fly is inside it, eating it."
00:30:02,00:30:06,"And then finally, the fly lover dissolves the membrane, which keeps the ants head on."
00:30:06,00:30:08,And the ants head comes off.
00:30:08,00:30:11,"And then the fly just lives in the decapitated head for another fortnight,"
00:30:11,00:30:14,which I think is the most goth thing I can possibly imagine.
00:30:14,00:30:15,How cool is that?
00:30:15,00:30:19,"And then once it's an adult, it just leaves the head, leaves this decapitated head longer."
00:30:19,00:30:20,How insane.
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Its self-hooks up, isn't it?"
00:30:21,00:30:22,It's horrible.
00:30:22,00:30:27,"You know that it's so fucked up, it made Charles Darwin question his belief in God."
00:30:27,00:30:32,"Paracetic wasps, he wrote a letter to a fellow naturalist Aissa Gray,"
00:30:32,00:30:36,"said, ""I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God"
00:30:36,00:30:39,"would have designeddly created parasitic wasps."""
00:30:39,00:30:43,"He is the technical term, with the express intention of their feeding"
00:30:43,00:30:45,within the living bodies of caterpillars.
00:30:45,00:30:46,Wow.
00:30:46,00:30:47,It's a good point.
00:30:47,00:30:49,It's not a nice thing to do.
00:30:49,00:30:51,"He's a god, he's a god."
00:30:51,00:30:54,"He then goes on to say, ""Order to cat should play with mice."""
00:30:54,00:30:57,So that also seemed up so in quite a lot as well.
00:30:57,00:30:59,"Oh no, they're just having fun cats and mice."
00:30:59,00:31:01,We've all seen Tom and Jerry.
00:31:01,00:31:03,"Fortunately, he didn't live to see that terror."
00:31:03,00:31:05,Do you want to hear my favourite paracetic wasps?
00:31:05,00:31:06,Yeah.
00:31:06,00:31:07,"Oh, we've all got one."
00:31:07,00:31:08,It's so nice.
00:31:08,00:31:11,So it's Aissa Cody's Abitasis.
00:31:11,00:31:15,"And it's a parasitic wasp, which lays its eggs in another wasp,"
00:31:15,00:31:20,"which is called Dibrakis Bukianus, and then that lays its eggs"
00:31:20,00:31:24,"in the pupae of a species of Icknumonodai wasps,"
00:31:24,00:31:28,"which then lays its eggs in the caterpillar of the Cricopia moth,"
00:31:28,00:31:32,which lives and feeds in a popular wild cherry or apple tree.
00:31:32,00:31:38,So that means it's a parasite inside a parasite inside a parasite inside a tree.
00:31:38,00:31:39,Wow.
00:31:39,00:31:42,This is where my hat metaphor falls down.
00:31:42,00:31:44,It's the inception of the wasp world.
00:31:44,00:31:49,I think it's the most disgusting Russian doll you could ever see.
00:31:49,00:31:52,Do you want to know my least favourite wasp?
00:31:52,00:31:53,Yeah.
00:31:53,00:31:56,"It's the tarantula hawk, and it's a type of wasp,"
00:31:56,00:32:00,"and it has the worst sting, probably, of any wasp."
00:32:00,00:32:03,"And the recommendation, if you're stung by this wasp,"
00:32:03,00:32:05,"and this is in a peer-reviewed journal,"
00:32:05,00:32:09,is to lie down and start screaming.
00:32:09,00:32:11,What does that do?
00:32:11,00:32:15,"Well, apparently what happens is it's so painful that you're not going to be able"
00:32:15,00:32:19,"to maintain verbal or physical coordination after you're stung,"
00:32:19,00:32:21,and you're likely to just kind of run off and hurt yourself.
00:32:21,00:32:22,I'll lie down.
00:32:22,00:32:24,"And so the best thing to do is just lie down and scream,"
00:32:24,00:32:26,and hopefully someone will come and help you.
00:32:26,00:32:27,Oh my God.
00:32:27,00:32:28,Wow.
00:32:28,00:32:30,It's such a good name as well.
00:32:30,00:32:31,Is it a tarantula?
00:32:31,00:32:32,Is it a hawk?
00:32:32,00:32:34,"No, it's a wasp."
00:32:34,00:32:39,The smallest fly in the world is named after Arnold Schwarzenegger.
00:32:39,00:32:41,"Nice, is that an ironic kind of thing?"
00:32:41,00:32:43,"No, it's because it's got big arms."
00:32:43,00:32:46,"Yeah, come on."
00:32:46,00:32:48,It's a tiny fly with massive arms.
00:32:48,00:32:50,"It's 0.395 millimeters long,"
00:32:50,00:32:52,"and it's arms are big relative to its body,"
00:32:52,00:32:54,but they're not the size of Arnie.
00:32:54,00:32:56,You don't just see a pair of arms flying on the ground
00:32:56,00:32:58,and a tiny thing in between them.
00:32:58,00:33:00,"And the scientist who discovered it, Brian Brown said,"
00:33:00,00:33:02,"""As soon as I saw those bulging legs,"
00:33:02,00:33:04,I knew I had to name this one after Arnold Schwarzenegger.
00:33:04,00:33:06,"He doesn't have, of course they don't have arms."
00:33:06,00:33:08,"They've got front legs, haven't they?"
00:33:08,00:33:10,It's that way you got your arms.
00:33:10,00:33:12,"Oh, I've got my arms."
00:33:12,00:33:15,I've never known where you walk on all fours.
00:33:15,00:33:19,"But we're all, all mammals have two arms and two legs,"
00:33:19,00:33:20,or four legs.
00:33:20,00:33:22,But I believe flies are not mammals.
00:33:22,00:33:25,"Well, we don't have time to give them the science of the fence."
00:33:25,00:33:27,We should probably move on in this case.
00:33:27,00:33:30,We can dig this hole on it deeper and we lose you entirely.
00:33:30,00:33:36,"We should go on to fact number four,"
00:33:36,00:33:37,and that is James' facts.
00:33:37,00:33:42,"Okay, my fact this week is when Patonc players getting to fights,"
00:33:42,00:33:45,it is known in the French press as bulliganism.
00:33:45,00:33:47,It's amazing.
00:33:47,00:33:48,Love it.
00:33:48,00:33:49,That's very good.
00:33:49,00:33:52,"So I read this in a recent telegraph article,"
00:33:52,00:33:54,and it is all about how they're trying
00:33:54,00:33:57,"to smarten up the reputation of the sport of Patonc,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,which is French bull.
00:33:59,00:34:01,"So for anyone who doesn't know that,"
00:34:01,00:34:04,it's basically you have a big iron ball.
00:34:04,00:34:05,It's not that big.
00:34:05,00:34:06,It's about the size of a cricket ball.
00:34:06,00:34:10,"I am bull, and you throw it towards a small wooden jack"
00:34:10,00:34:11,and whoever gets closest wins.
00:34:11,00:34:13,And they're trying to smarten it up.
00:34:13,00:34:15,"They've stopped people from wearing jeans,"
00:34:15,00:34:18,"and also they're trying to stop this bulliganism,"
00:34:18,00:34:21,"which is alcohol-fueled brawls between players,"
00:34:21,00:34:25,which has been tarnishing the sport for the last few years.
00:34:25,00:34:29,And it's an extremely traditional French past time.
00:34:29,00:34:30,I've seen people playing it.
00:34:30,00:34:34,People playing it in a square near where I used to live.
00:34:34,00:34:35,On the piece.
00:34:35,00:34:36,I've been to playing that square.
00:34:36,00:34:37,It's brilliant in South London.
00:34:37,00:34:38,It's very nice.
00:34:38,00:34:39,You love it.
00:34:39,00:34:41,"Yeah, and you hire the equipment out from the pub."
00:34:41,00:34:42,Did you get into any fights?
00:34:42,00:34:43,"It's huge, bro."
00:34:43,00:34:46,"I'm not allowed back to South London, actually."
00:34:46,00:34:48,"Well, I thought this can't possibly be true,"
00:34:48,00:34:50,but it goes back about 10 years.
00:34:50,00:34:53,So in 2017 some referees had to be given special protection
00:34:53,00:34:55,from Bulligans.
00:34:55,00:34:58,There were death threats at the World Cup in 2016.
00:34:58,00:34:59,Yeah.
00:34:59,00:35:00,And there are so many stories.
00:35:00,00:35:02,One team said they were going to rip their heads off
00:35:02,00:35:04,another team exactly like them when.
00:35:04,00:35:06,And then the tournament's organisers said this sort of incident
00:35:06,00:35:09,happens quite often in Patonk in response to that.
00:35:09,00:35:13,There was one guy who got a 200 Euro fine in a four-year ban
00:35:13,00:35:15,for hurling a Bull at his rival.
00:35:15,00:35:16,Geez.
00:35:16,00:35:18,They are hard bulls.
00:35:18,00:35:20,"They are hard, don't they?"
00:35:20,00:35:21,You don't want that.
00:35:21,00:35:24,"I think one guy, according to an economist article,"
00:35:24,00:35:27,was jailed for shooting dead a Patonk rival
00:35:27,00:35:29,when one of his Bulls landed on his foot.
00:35:29,00:35:30,What?
00:35:30,00:35:31,What year was this?
00:35:31,00:35:33,It didn't say it just said in brackets.
00:35:33,00:35:35,"It was an economist article about Patonk and then it was just like,"
00:35:35,00:35:37,"for instance, the guy from Grenoble,"
00:35:37,00:35:39,who was jailed for shooting dead a rival when his Bull landed
00:35:39,00:35:41,"on his foot, closed brackets, no more information."
00:35:41,00:35:43,Oh my god.
00:35:43,00:35:45,So I found three examples of people who've died
00:35:45,00:35:47,in the last 10 years playing Patonk
00:35:47,00:35:49,and I was not looking for them.
00:35:49,00:35:51,They just kept coming up in my search results.
00:35:51,00:35:55,"One of them was trampled by a runaway circus elephant, though."
00:35:55,00:35:57,So I don't know if that counts as...
00:35:57,00:35:59,It's the dangers of Patonk.
00:35:59,00:36:01,That's what eventually cleared us off the South London.
00:36:01,00:36:03,Right.
00:36:03,00:36:06,"Actually, this thing about them not being able to wear jeans,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,it's annoyed a lot of Patonk players
00:36:08,00:36:10,and one player has protested by turning up
00:36:10,00:36:13,"to an official tournament game dressed as a clown,"
00:36:13,00:36:15,which now I hear about it.
00:36:15,00:36:17,"Seems a little bit too soon, almost."
00:36:17,00:36:18,Yeah.
00:36:18,00:36:20,"Although, at least if another player's Bull lands on your shoe,"
00:36:20,00:36:22,it probably won't hurt your foot.
00:36:22,00:36:27,"There is one thing that Patonk players are now allowed to do,"
00:36:27,00:36:29,"which they weren't a little while ago,"
00:36:29,00:36:31,which is to drink during matches.
00:36:31,00:36:33,And this is competition players.
00:36:33,00:36:35,"Oh, yes, you're right."
00:36:35,00:36:37,"They are trying to professionalise, aren't they?"
00:36:37,00:36:39,Because they wanted to be an Olympic thing.
00:36:39,00:36:41,But they did persuade the world...
00:36:41,00:36:43,This is a very French thing.
00:36:43,00:36:45,They did persuade the world anti-doping agency
00:36:45,00:36:47,it is okay to have a glass of pasties
00:36:47,00:36:49,or whatever during a competition.
00:36:49,00:36:51,"And they've been allowed to, as of 2008,"
00:36:51,00:36:53,but they are still asked to abstain
00:36:53,00:36:56,"from steroids, growth hormones, heroin and cocaine."
00:36:56,00:37:00,I can't imagine heroin is going to help you play for talk that much.
00:37:00,00:37:02,It's a slow game.
00:37:02,00:37:04,"I mean, steroids aren't going to help you either."
00:37:04,00:37:06,"Oh, come on. You can get some proper power in your..."
00:37:06,00:37:08,"If you're really big, you can just kind of lean over it."
00:37:08,00:37:10,Put the ball down.
00:37:10,00:37:12,Doesn't make your arms lengthen.
00:37:12,00:37:14,"Don't really, don't really fit it."
00:37:14,00:37:16,I think a stretch arm is strong.
00:37:16,00:37:20,I can't get over how full of both of your arguments are.
00:37:20,00:37:22,And these steroids don't lengthen your arms.
00:37:22,00:37:24,"And James, it's not really a game of power."
00:37:24,00:37:28,"Look, we'll have a game soon."
00:37:28,00:37:30,But there are a few different shots you can play.
00:37:30,00:37:32,One way you just try and get it close to the jack
00:37:32,00:37:34,and another one where you try and bash the other guys
00:37:34,00:37:36,ball out of the way.
00:37:36,00:37:38,It's kind of like Quidditch.
00:37:38,00:37:42,"Yeah, because in Quidditch, there are people who are trying to score points."
00:37:42,00:37:44,And those are the people in Potonk who are shooting for the jack.
00:37:44,00:37:46,The tiny wooden thing.
00:37:46,00:37:48,And then you've also got shooters in Potonk
00:37:48,00:37:52,"who are the, you would be the bludgers who try to, you know,"
00:37:52,00:37:54,they're just attacking the people.
00:37:54,00:37:56,And they've played it on Titan.
00:37:56,00:37:58,"Look, everyone actually breaks down eventually."
00:37:58,00:38:00,"I'm just saying, you've got Schesgeras and Nockers."
00:38:00,00:38:02,Do you?
00:38:02,00:38:04,"Talking of Nockers, can we talk about kissing the funny?"
00:38:04,00:38:14,"So, kissing the funny is when, if you lose a match 30 nil,"
00:38:14,00:38:16,"you then have to kiss the funny,"
00:38:16,00:38:20,which is where you ideally have to kiss the bare bottom of a lady
00:38:20,00:38:22,called Fanny.
00:38:22,00:38:26,"But as there isn't always one available,"
00:38:26,00:38:30,"you can kiss a picture of the bare bottom of a lady called Fanny,"
00:38:30,00:38:34,or quite often they have like small statues of Fanny's nearby
00:38:34,00:38:36,that you could kiss the bottom of.
00:38:36,00:38:38,"So, do you, is that part of the equipment list for a match?"
00:38:38,00:38:40,I assume it.
00:38:40,00:38:42,I assume it.
00:38:42,00:38:44,"Every club has its own model, Fanny, norm, inference."
00:38:44,00:38:46,Wow.
00:38:46,00:38:48,They have them specially made.
00:38:48,00:38:50,They have a match where someone lost very badly.
00:38:50,00:38:52,"And a local waitress, I think, called Fanny said,"
00:38:52,00:38:54,"""You'll have to kiss me on the cheek if you lose."""
00:38:54,00:38:56,"And then when the male lost really, really badly,"
00:38:56,00:38:58,"she said, ""Well, you have to kiss me on the bum now."""
00:38:58,00:39:02,And some clubs in Provence have special rugs to nil on
00:39:02,00:39:06,while you're kissing the statue of the one we call Fanny on the arse.
00:39:06,00:39:08,Yeah.
00:39:08,00:39:10,It's a weird boy prayer.
00:39:10,00:39:14,Do you know why England is not so good at batonk?
00:39:14,00:39:18,"Is it because we have crown green bowling or tempin bowling,"
00:39:18,00:39:20,so we don't really play it as much?
00:39:20,00:39:22,That's a nice idea.
00:39:22,00:39:26,"I think, well, my theory, as to why we're not a world leading petonk power,"
00:39:26,00:39:28,"is that you like to wear jeans a lot,"
00:39:28,00:39:30,so we won't be able to play anymore.
00:39:30,00:39:32,That's another one.
00:39:32,00:39:36,"This is a bit more historical, is that ever the third for bad people from playing,"
00:39:36,00:39:38,"legally, you were not allowed to play, especially if you were an archer."
00:39:38,00:39:42,"And this goes back, you know, loads of sports were banned if you were an archer"
00:39:42,00:39:44,because you had to be doing your archery practice.
00:39:44,00:39:46,"But until the 18th century,"
00:39:46,00:39:50,"Artifices, Laborers, Apprentices and Servants were banned from playing"
00:39:50,00:39:52,any time outside Christmas.
00:39:52,00:39:54,Really?
00:39:54,00:39:56,"Yeah, which is not good for training."
00:39:56,00:40:00,"And also, yeah, because Christmas, the ground's going to be cold."
00:40:00,00:40:01,Yes.
00:40:01,00:40:03,"Snowy maybe, so you might not be able to play anyway."
00:40:03,00:40:04,Poor playing conditions.
00:40:04,00:40:05,Good point.
00:40:05,00:40:08,"Yeah, it was thought of as a kind of corrupt sport, wasn't it?"
00:40:08,00:40:10,I'd like only people of ill-repute played it.
00:40:10,00:40:14,It was associated with saloons and gambling and stuff like that.
00:40:14,00:40:16,Or bites of the gambling.
00:40:16,00:40:17,The gambling.
00:40:17,00:40:20,"Well, you say that Britain isn't a petonk powerhouse."
00:40:20,00:40:22,But we do have teams.
00:40:22,00:40:27,"In 2002, Purcell sponsored and paid for the kit of the British nude petonk team."
00:40:27,00:40:28,Paid for the kit.
00:40:28,00:40:29,Yes.
00:40:29,00:40:31,"Sorry, I think it was mostly sweat buns."
00:40:31,00:40:34,"So, do you say, say, a Purcell?"
00:40:34,00:40:35,Purcell.
00:40:35,00:40:37,"So, exactly the clothes detergent brand."
00:40:37,00:40:43,Why do you associate yourself with something as risque as nude petonk?
00:40:43,00:40:46,"Risky and also not terribly popular, I imagine."
00:40:46,00:40:48,Purcell makes your clothes disappear.
00:40:48,00:40:49,What are they trying to tell you?
00:40:49,00:40:52,"Do they turn up to competition saying, ""Look, we're not wearing jeans."""
00:40:52,00:40:57,"I've got a quote from Pat Thompson, the team manager and president of British naturism."
00:40:57,00:41:01,"We might not have a Beckham or an Owen, but landing this sponsorship"
00:41:01,00:41:06,is set to boost the profile of naturist petonk just as we go head to head with the World Cup.
00:41:06,00:41:09,Head to head.
00:41:09,00:41:12,What year was that?
00:41:12,00:41:13,2002.
00:41:13,00:41:15,"And see, did anyone pay attention to that World Cup?"
00:41:15,00:41:16,I think not.
00:41:16,00:41:20,"Patent kind of advertises itself as being good for kind of all ages, all genders."
00:41:20,00:41:23,It's not a super physically testing sport.
00:41:23,00:41:28,Even to the extent that you can buy magnets attached to cords
00:41:28,00:41:31,so you can pick up the balls without having to bend down.
00:41:31,00:41:36,"And there's nothing, so that's fine, it's all like you go fishing for your peton balls."
00:41:36,00:41:39,"Exactly, but you won't pick up the wooden one, will it?"
00:41:39,00:41:40,"No, no."
00:41:40,00:41:41,So you're...
00:41:41,00:41:42,"God, you're right."
00:41:42,00:41:43,What do you do about that?
00:41:43,00:41:44,Long Hoover.
00:41:44,00:41:48,"You could get those claw things that park rangers have, you know?"
00:41:48,00:41:49,"Yeah, you're right."
00:41:49,00:41:50,That's called a piglet.
00:41:50,00:41:53,"It's called a kosch on it, to that little wooden thing."
00:41:53,00:41:54,Yes.
00:41:54,00:41:56,"Or, like, we would call it a jack, right?"
00:41:56,00:41:57,Yes.
00:41:57,00:42:00,One of England's best players is called Jack Blows.
00:42:00,00:42:01,Really?
00:42:01,00:42:02,Nice.
00:42:02,00:42:03,It's a really cool one.
00:42:03,00:42:08,"So prior to researching this, did anyone else assume that Patonk was an onomatopoeic name?"
00:42:08,00:42:09,Yeah.
00:42:09,00:42:10,Patonk?
00:42:10,00:42:11,"I mean, it is onomatopoeic."
00:42:11,00:42:12,"I just wasn't named for that reason, yeah."
00:42:12,00:42:13,"Yeah, just not intentionally so."
00:42:13,00:42:18,"There was an old man who loved to play ball, which involved taking three steps and then throwing your ball."
00:42:18,00:42:22,"He had terrible roomatism, so as if you could do it sitting down."
00:42:22,00:42:26,"His friend said, yes, and they agreed to be stationary when they threw the ball as well."
00:42:26,00:42:32,"And that is Patonk, which comes from the Provence words, 'pedtanko', which means 'feet still'."
00:42:32,00:42:33,Yeah.
00:42:33,00:42:40,"And I think that's really nice as an origin, because it originates in basically early disability rights, right?"
00:42:40,00:42:44,"It used to be much more active, so I think in Provence it was called Provence Long."
00:42:44,00:42:46,And you threw the ball really far.
00:42:46,00:42:48,It was often about throwing the ball quite a long way.
00:42:48,00:42:51,"And the ball for some reason, I couldn't discover, was sheathed in nails."
00:42:51,00:42:55,"And it resulted in so many injuries in the 18th and 19th centuries that it was banned,"
00:42:55,00:42:56,almost everywhere.
00:42:56,00:43:01,"Sorry, can I just say, so the nails, the spiky bit is on the inside, right?"
00:43:01,00:43:02,Yeah.
00:43:02,00:43:06,"Because the way you said it, it could have possibly been sticking out."
00:43:06,00:43:12,"So it's basically cock, and then you would stick a load of nails so that the outside of it was the heads of the nails."
00:43:12,00:43:14,And so that's how you got your iron kind of ball.
00:43:14,00:43:16,So that's how you got the weight or whatever.
00:43:16,00:43:18,"Yeah, so it's not like a hedgehog or something."
00:43:18,00:43:19,"Yeah, got it."
00:43:19,00:43:21,That would be very dangerous though.
00:43:21,00:43:22,"Yeah, but maybe more fun."
00:43:22,00:43:25,To use a hedgehog?
00:43:25,00:43:26,"No, no."
00:43:26,00:43:27,I was thinking of the sticky apple.
00:43:27,00:43:28,"Oh, sorry."
00:43:28,00:43:29,"Yeah, I was thinking, oh, this is Alice in Wonderland."
00:43:29,00:43:31,I'm sure I've read this before.
00:43:31,00:43:32,With a real piglet.
00:43:32,00:43:34,Thank you for everything.
00:43:34,00:43:39,"Well, you know why the metal balls came about from the technology of the First World War."
00:43:39,00:43:42,So sort of making small mines and bombs and stuff.
00:43:42,00:43:47,"Using that technology that was improved in the First World War, they could then make petonk balls."
00:43:47,00:43:48,Wow.
00:43:48,00:43:49,Yeah.
00:43:49,00:43:50,So it was good for something.
00:43:50,00:43:51,It was.
00:43:51,00:43:54,"You know what, what is it good for?"
00:43:54,00:43:55,Petonk.
00:43:55,00:43:58,"Finally, we've answered the question."
00:43:58,00:44:03,Petonk balls are dangerous objects officially.
00:44:03,00:44:09,"According to the Federal Transportation Safety Administration, you're not allowed to take them"
00:44:09,00:44:10,onto aircrafts.
00:44:10,00:44:11,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:11,00:44:13,Did you find an example of that?
00:44:13,00:44:14,No.
00:44:14,00:44:18,"I found a guy who, he's a star player from Jersey, Keith Boliad."
00:44:18,00:44:21,And he had his luggage seized on route to a big competition in Denmark.
00:44:21,00:44:26,"Because it had three suspicious looking, perfectly round, iron balls in it."
00:44:26,00:44:28,"And obviously they thought, well, this could be a bomb."
00:44:28,00:44:29,What is it?
00:44:29,00:44:31,And he had to borrow another set.
00:44:31,00:44:32,And someone else is trousers.
00:44:32,00:44:34,Because he traveled in jeans.
00:44:34,00:44:38,And the umpire wouldn't let him play in the competition.
00:44:38,00:44:39,"Oh, really?"
00:44:39,00:44:40,So his game suffered very badly.
00:44:40,00:44:41,Because he was playing with a set.
00:44:41,00:44:42,He wasn't familiar with the weights.
00:44:42,00:44:43,And different trousers.
00:44:43,00:44:44,And different trousers.
00:44:44,00:44:45,Yeah.
00:44:45,00:44:48,"It's important to like, use your own balls."
00:44:48,00:44:54,He says that they have slightly different weightings and slightly possibly even different sizes.
00:44:54,00:44:56,Or just that he was used to his feel of his own balls.
00:44:56,00:44:57,He did size.
00:44:57,00:44:59,"This is the nudist Petonk ball, actually."
00:44:59,00:45:05,Okay.
00:45:05,00:45:06,"Well, you should wrap up."
00:45:06,00:45:07,Thanks so much for listening.
