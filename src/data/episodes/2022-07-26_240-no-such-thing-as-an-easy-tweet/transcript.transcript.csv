00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, before we start this week's show, I want to introduce to you our special guest,"
00:00:05,00:00:06,and that is... Hello!
00:00:06,00:00:07,"No, not you, Dan."
00:00:07,00:00:13,"I want to introduce our special guest, his name is Paul Smith, and he is the lead singer of one of"
00:00:13,00:00:18,"my very, very most favorite bands in the whole world, Maximo Park. And actually, he has an"
00:00:18,00:00:23,"album about this very day. Yes, it's called Diagrams. You can get it at PaulSmithMusic.eu."
00:00:23,00:00:28,"It's an awesome album, and we actually know Paul because we did his podcast last year to promote"
00:00:28,00:00:33,"our book, The Book of the Year, and our new book has come out exactly the same time as his album,"
00:00:33,00:00:38,"so we thought why not reunite? Let's make it an annual thing. We'll make it an annual thing. So,"
00:00:38,00:00:41,"if you want to buy that book to help us get another one so we can meet Paul again,"
00:00:41,00:00:46,"do go to Amazon, or no such thing as a fish.com. There's links there. We'd love it if you'd get"
00:00:46,00:00:48,our book as well. I'm with the podcast.
00:00:48,00:01:05,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:05,00:01:11,"from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Shriver, and I'm sitting here with Anichezinski,"
00:01:11,00:01:17,"Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and special guest. It's the lead singer of Maximo Park,"
00:01:17,00:01:22,"Paul Smith, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from"
00:01:22,00:01:28,"the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that"
00:01:28,00:01:34,"is Paul. The studio that made a hard day's nice demanded the Beatles' voices be dubbed, because"
00:01:34,00:01:40,"their thought Americans wouldn't understand their accents. So good. And just for context, they were"
00:01:40,00:01:45,"massive at that point, weren't they, in America? There were, and that's why the film was actually"
00:01:45,00:01:53,"commissioned. United artists gave them, I think it was Â£200,000, and I don't know what the equivalent"
00:01:53,00:01:58,"of that is these days, but it's still not a great deal to make a feature film. And they thought,"
00:01:58,00:02:02,"well, we'll sell loads of records off the back of this terrible movie that will probably bomb,"
00:02:02,00:02:08,"and it ended up being one of the biggest movies ever. Yeah, so it was a loophole, wasn't it? It was a"
00:02:08,00:02:13,loophole for the movie company because it meant that they were able to release a Beatles album outside
00:02:13,00:02:18,of the recording studio contract. So they actually bought a Beatles album for an incredibly low summer
00:02:18,00:02:23,money. Yeah. And it wasn't dubbed in the end. It wasn't dubbed in the end. You don't hear deep
00:02:23,00:02:28,"South accents, do you? In a hot days night? Not the nine of. So Paul, you must sell records in America,"
00:02:28,00:02:34,"right? Just about. Because they hadn't to send anything that you say? I'm very charming abroad,"
00:02:34,00:02:38,"apparently. Right, okay. After the show's, you know, you get the usual, I love your British accent,"
00:02:38,00:02:45,"that kind of thing. And it's, you know, I don't have a traditional British accent. So around America,"
00:02:45,00:02:52,"I get a lot of, hey, you sound really Scottish. I go, well, I'm nearly in Scotland. I live in Newcastle,"
00:02:52,00:02:57,"and it's the last big city before you get to Scotland. Yeah. You get people, I think American"
00:02:57,00:03:03,"sometimes will, you know, say a scourcer as an Australian or a liver poddins, you know, from South Africa."
00:03:03,00:03:07,They're pretty wacky with where they get where they're from. But Scourcer's accent is particularly
00:03:07,00:03:13,"hard for people to get, isn't it? It's like a really hard accent for non-liver poddlins to understand."
00:03:13,00:03:18,"So for instance, Jamie Carriger did a documentary, so he's a Liverpool footballer. He did a"
00:03:18,00:03:23,"documentary a few years ago called Being Liverpool, and they even subtitled that for the UK audience."
00:03:23,00:03:30,"No, that's amazing. No way. Wow. So on the accent thing, so the Beatles, they did have,"
00:03:30,00:03:34,"I didn't know this, they're in cartoon, which ran for about four years in the mid-60s,"
00:03:34,00:03:39,"but none of the Beatles had any part in it whatsoever. So none of them sounded like themselves,"
00:03:39,00:03:44,"because they were all voiced by other people. So apparently George Sounded Irish, maybe Scourcer,"
00:03:44,00:03:49,"John London Sounded American, Paul Sounded like a PG Woodhouse character. They just bore no relation"
00:03:49,00:03:54,"to what they were like. Well, they did sing in American accents, didn't they? Like a lot of bands,"
00:03:54,00:03:59,"but like if you listen to early Beatles, they sound American. And then in later Beatles albums,"
00:03:59,00:04:04,"they go more British sounding. So I've ever puddley in sounding, they go."
00:04:04,00:04:08,"More literally puddley in sounding, exactly. And I think because American is a bit easier to"
00:04:08,00:04:11,"understand the words, because Americans drag their words out more, and they have felt like"
00:04:11,00:04:14,rotex saying there are. And also it was just where all the rock and roll was at.
00:04:14,00:04:18,"Yeah, all the influences. All the influences were American. There were no."
00:04:18,00:04:22,"But also it was a good way to sell to a market that was used in listening to American music,"
00:04:22,00:04:25,"whereas once they were well established enough by the time they got to Sergeant Peppers,"
00:04:25,00:04:29,"then they'd have things like, you know, it's getting better all the time,"
00:04:29,00:04:36,"gutting better all the time. That's what the song sounds like. So in the first studio album,"
00:04:36,00:04:41,"they pronounce there as 47% of the time. And by the time they were doing Let It Be,"
00:04:41,00:04:45,it was 3% of the time. But it's statistics. And then they went around the other side where
00:04:45,00:04:49,now Ringo sounds like he lives somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
00:04:49,00:04:55,"Yeah. Because he's lived in America for a long time, and his obviously lives in a celebrity bubble."
00:04:55,00:05:00,Which is fine. That's not that's no criticism. I would probably be living in that bubble as well
00:05:00,00:05:06,"if I was Ringo. But yeah, it's like a little, yeah, I had a little. Oh, it's a decent piece, kind of."
00:05:06,00:05:11,"Yes, just out of curiosity, because I know sometimes words are missed out. So there's a song"
00:05:11,00:05:18,fixing a hole. Would that have been fixing a hole? What? Like like using internet or not fixing.
00:05:18,00:05:23,"Oh, so you know how I would say using internet or something? That's not a little puddley"
00:05:23,00:05:28,"in fact. No, I know. I'm just thinking Northern accents. I think in Liverpool they tend to"
00:05:28,00:05:34,pronounce all of the words. But not the ours. Not the ours. Although I'm thinking you said they
00:05:34,00:05:38,"didn't pronounce the ours in Let It Be. I'm thinking of the lyrics of Let It Be, and it's mostly the"
00:05:38,00:05:42,word Let It Be over and over and over and over and over again. You speak on Let It Be.
00:05:42,00:05:48,"None of us pronounce those are ours though, we should say. I saw it you do."
00:05:48,00:05:53,You do insert ours into words that don't have them. You pronounce far too many. You collect up all
00:05:53,00:05:59,"of our drop-dars and say them all. But yeah, do you know why the Scouse accent is so singular and kind"
00:05:59,00:06:04,of odd? No. So I didn't quite know. So it does sound really different to places quite nearby. So
00:06:04,00:06:12,linguists say that actually if you take sort of a Manchester accent and a Newcastle accent maybe
00:06:12,00:06:16,"they can be seen as different variations of the same kind of pattern, whereas Scouse is really"
00:06:16,00:06:20,totally different and it's because when it became this really important port there was so much
00:06:21,00:06:26,Irish and Welsh immigration and so there's quite a lot of Welsh in the Scouse accent isn't there?
00:06:26,00:06:30,"Irish definitely. And Irish, yeah. Which makes it completely stand out."
00:06:30,00:06:36,But there is a theory that the Scouse accent is changing and softening as the air gets cleaner.
00:06:36,00:06:42,So there's an old gag that it's what is it? It's one third Irish one third Manchester and one third
00:06:42,00:06:50,Qatar. And that's not the country of Qatar isn't it? But so the industrial economy obviously is not
00:06:50,00:06:54,as big as it was it started changing to service and so clean air legislation has cleaned the air up.
00:06:54,00:06:58,So there is a theory that this will have an effect. I wish I'd written down more of the details
00:06:58,00:07:03,of how exactly it's affected. Well the idea is that because people spoke more adonoidally or
00:07:03,00:07:08,nasally because the air was so bad you would kind of close your airways while you were talking.
00:07:08,00:07:13,"Yeah, like a camel. Like a camel. Yeah, do they do that? Well they can close their nostrils,"
00:07:13,00:07:21,they can close their nostrils as well. I can close my eye. Am I a camel?
00:07:21,00:07:27,The other thing about the pollution in Liverpool is you used to be able to tell a true
00:07:27,00:07:33,Liverpoolian in Liverpool by his dirty raincoat because if they had a clean raincoat it meant it was
00:07:33,00:07:37,a sailor who just arrived from sea whereas if you were living in Liverpool all the time the pollution
00:07:37,00:07:42,was so bad that your raincoat would be dirty. So if the inside of the raincoat flashing at you
00:07:42,00:07:46,is clean it's a newly arise. That's not true of our liver puddley isn't it?
00:07:46,00:07:52,Have you ever I was reading a lot about in music how when a re-dub needs to happen
00:07:52,00:07:57,lyrically because of a different country where the where the song is being done in France or in
00:07:57,00:08:02,Italy and so either they bring someone else in to sing a dubbed version or the lead singer of a band.
00:08:02,00:08:06,So I don't know if Maxima Park is ever with you solo stuff. Yes. Have you ever done a different
00:08:06,00:08:13,version? I have. Yes I did German for on my last record contradictions by Paul Smith and the
00:08:13,00:08:20,intimations which is just a made-up band-in. I've got a confess it's just me. And yeah I did a
00:08:20,00:08:24,version of this song called People on Sunday obviously it's called something different it's called
00:08:24,00:08:32,mention and Zontag in German and when I was about to play my German tour I got a friend of my wife's
00:08:32,00:08:38,who's German to translate it for me but I was obviously I'd honed it for the recording when I did it
00:08:38,00:08:44,live I had all of the words pasted on in front of me on the mic stand and it was it's obviously there's
00:08:44,00:08:52,quite awkward translations. So do you speak German a little bit? I'm bishin. I'm bishin. I would just say
00:08:52,00:08:57,it's quite trusting with your friend that they tell you that this is the right words. But she's
00:08:57,00:09:02,German so she's quite serious. So this is the thing you know and stereo typically she's very straight
00:09:02,00:09:08,down the line and so I thought she won't have me on. But yeah I could cross check it with my little
00:09:08,00:09:15,bit of German I knew. That must because you have a singing style which is your accent plays into
00:09:15,00:09:20,the tone and the style of singing and I always think that must just scramble what your identity as
00:09:20,00:09:25,a vocalist is all of sudden when you say the language you don't know how does your accent play
00:09:25,00:09:30,into it? In some ways it does because when I like when we first started one of the first songs that
00:09:30,00:09:38,was put on it it was put on a German magazine on a CD that you get on the front cover and so lots of
00:09:38,00:09:43,people knew this song the coast as I was changing and in this particular song I say I am young and I
00:09:43,00:09:51,am lost and they love the young in German. I love the way you pronounce the word young. Yeah it's
00:09:51,00:09:57,really great. I think it's about the psychologist young girl. Well this is the thing. I didn't go
00:09:57,00:10:04,further but it's yeah like young and is a German verb I think and anywhere. There's a great recording
00:10:04,00:10:08,of the injury playing in Germany and he's just shouting at the audience in Cockney Germans for
00:10:08,00:10:13,at least half the album is amazing and he translates blockheads into dumb cop and he just keeps getting
00:10:13,00:10:19,the audience to shout dumb cop it's great. Yeah when things went wrong in Germany they had a little
00:10:19,00:10:24,bit of German so our keyboard used to break all the time and I would go 'das Klavier ist kaputt?'
00:10:24,00:10:33,It goes down so well in Germany just that little sprinkling of GCSE German got wrong but it's
00:10:33,00:10:41,"appreciated so much. Boys, does Kino a bit there? My German isn't good enough. I'm sure it wasn't."
00:10:41,00:10:44,I just assumed that was funny and gave you the laugh. Our small German listenership would have
00:10:44,00:10:51,gone absolutely crazy. Speaking of dubbing in Russia you would not have subtitles very often for
00:10:51,00:10:58,movies and they would just dub it into Russian. These days they kind of do have subtitles but in Poland
00:10:58,00:11:04,"they don't still they don't and both countries have a thing called a lector and that was person,"
00:11:04,00:11:09,one person who would dub all the parts for everyone in a movie. They still have that in Poland.
00:11:09,00:11:14,In Poland they do in Russia they do a little bit but not as much as they used to and basically
00:11:14,00:11:18,these are extremely professional people who would just read all these different things out and
00:11:18,00:11:24,they're so professional they're not allowed to swear so you would say rude word whenever you
00:11:24,00:11:28,came up to a swear word and stuff like that. They're doing all the voices. No they don't even get into
00:11:28,00:11:32,character. They just read it almost like you would read Shakespeare or something like that. In the
00:11:32,00:11:37,monitor. So if the example that someone that some angry person gave on a forum because I think
00:11:37,00:11:41,some like more modern polls get a bit annoyed that this ridiculous system was that you're watching
00:11:41,00:11:47,sex in the city and all the voices are just this 65-year-old man speaking of all this stuff.
00:11:47,00:11:53,History. Like the younger people don't like it but there was a poll in 2008 saying that only 19%
00:11:53,00:11:57,of polls supported the switch to subtitling and television. I don't think we can trust one poll
00:11:57,00:12:05,to represent the entire nation coming days. Just on the Beatles I have a fact about so and even
00:12:05,00:12:10,in 1963 Paul McCartney was still signing his name Paul McCartney brackets the Beatles.
00:12:10,00:12:16,Even in 1963. And they were quite famous by 1963. There must be. There must be a lost Paul McCartney
00:12:16,00:12:21,here. Super famous. Let's try to find out about Beatles Mania because your fact polls about
00:12:21,00:12:26,you know when they were becoming huge in America and they did the Ed Sullivan show and something like
00:12:26,00:12:32,37% of all American people watched that live which is just you know mind blowing. Anyway I got
00:12:32,00:12:40,from there on to One Direction Mania. I'm just trying to talk to you through my process. I'll see.
00:12:40,00:12:47,I've always tried to bring it around to One Direction. So One Direction fan hidden a bin for four
00:12:47,00:12:52,hours to try and meet the band and didn't even get to meet them. No because they couldn't see them.
00:12:52,00:12:56,They're in a bin. No but they would I think they'll plan to burst out of the bin when One Direction
00:12:56,00:13:03,came into the room. Did they miss the queue? Is it like when it was bin day for someone from One Direction?
00:13:03,00:13:08,Harry Styles? Yes it's bin day. Harry Styles House. He's taken the bin out. It's been emptied and
00:13:08,00:13:12,then you hide in the bin and hope that he drags it back to his house. Is that it? I think it was in a hotel
00:13:12,00:13:19,or something. But they're not for being really tidy. They're bound to use the bound the frequency
00:13:19,00:13:26,of One Direction using litter bin is very high. They put a source told the mirror admittedly.
00:13:26,00:13:30,The boys' minders won't be letting any of these tracks get past them. They'll look in every bin if they
00:13:30,00:13:39,have to. Oh the intern that gets that job. He really important job for you to do for One Direction.
00:13:39,00:13:43,It's very exciting. So even the small bathroom. The bathroom bins you'll say. Yep. Even the small
00:13:43,00:13:52,bathroom bins. Even the ash trays in the cars. We need to move on to our next verse. Can I just
00:13:52,00:13:57,do you guys know Shares first ever song? Is she released? The first single she ever released was when
00:13:57,00:14:02,she was 18. It was under the pseudonym Bonnie Joe Mason because her real name Sheryl Eden Appier
00:14:02,00:14:07,wasn't thought to be American enough and it was called Ringo I Love You and it's a song about how
00:14:07,00:14:16,much she loves Ringo Star. She recorded it in a bend isn't she? It's so weird. It was a massive flop.
00:14:16,00:14:21,Have you heard it? Yes. If you listen to it it is a complete ripoff or it's like a splurging
00:14:21,00:14:26,together of she loves you yeah yeah yeah and another beat or song. I can't believe they didn't get
00:14:26,00:14:31,sued for it. I think the fact that no one heard it outside did help. She did pick the drummer as well.
00:14:31,00:14:37,She could have picked a more popular member. Exactly. Yeah I know. Although I actually went to the
00:14:37,00:14:42,British Embassy in Washington on our last tour and played there and they said well you know it's great
00:14:42,00:14:46,that you've come and played here this is really exciting but one of the bands that we had before
00:14:46,00:14:54,was the Beatles. Obviously nothing to live up to that and they said the Beatles came and did a gig
00:14:54,00:14:58,in the Embassy but they never did anything like that again. It was one of the last live things they
00:14:58,00:15:03,did because somebody came with a pair of scissors into the British Embassy which I can attest to it
00:15:03,00:15:09,being fairly security conscious. I went to the toilet and it's got on the back of the door in the
00:15:09,00:15:14,toilet in the British Embassy a sort of secure really heavy it's like you could lock yourself in if
00:15:14,00:15:19,something goes down and something really horrific so it's quite serious. When you say sorry something
00:15:19,00:15:28,really horrific goes down in the toilet. If you've been in a band band members are just notoriously
00:15:28,00:15:33,stinky. Locked in the frowards. Yeah you don't want to get locked in there when something like that
00:15:33,00:15:40,goes down in a adjacent toilet. Anyway so somebody got into the British Embassy in whatever 1965
00:15:40,00:15:46,with a pair of scissors and put a lock of Ringo's hair off so perhaps Cher wasn't actually that you
00:15:46,00:15:52,know going in the wrong direction. You say that maybe it was Cher. It might have been. It's a long time
00:15:52,00:16:00,between booking bands isn't it for it. It is. It is beetles maximum. You could say that you had
00:16:00,00:16:05,lined him for the beetles but there was just a long gun. Exactly they're supported as
00:16:05,00:16:15,Italy. Okay it is time for fact number two and that is Andy. My fact is that monkeys in Melbourne Zoo
00:16:15,00:16:20,are no longer allowed to eat bananas because humans have bred them to have so much sugar that the
00:16:20,00:16:26,monkeys were getting obese. It's a funny story but it's quite a sad story I think. It's funny
00:16:26,00:16:34,answer. It's got everything. It's got everything. It's going to be a movie. Yeah. So it's bizarre and
00:16:34,00:16:37,it's not just Melbourne Zoo like loads of zoos have done this so there are zoos in there's one in
00:16:37,00:16:42,Devon called Peynton Zoo. There's Bristol Zoo. They've done the same thing. It's because humans are
00:16:42,00:16:46,"great at breeding bananas, sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and in the wild monkeys wouldn't get"
00:16:46,00:16:50,anywhere near this kind of sugar. They're not even neat bananas. I try to find proof that monkeys do
00:16:50,00:16:54,eat bananas. I call into Catherine Milton who studied the diets of primates for decades.
00:16:54,00:17:02,I'll buy that. Yeah. The entire wild monkey banana connection is a total fabrication. That's great.
00:17:02,00:17:06,Yeah. That should be a journey. Where did it come from then with this obsession with monkeys and
00:17:06,00:17:11,bananas? I think it must be the circus because the thing is like you don't get bananas in the wild.
00:17:11,00:17:15,These kind of bananas that we eat you just don't get them in the wild so unless they're breaking into
00:17:15,00:17:21,farms. Are we saying that no monkey in the wild is Dr. Catherine saying that no monkey in the wild
00:17:21,00:17:27,"has ever eaten a plantain or a plantain. Yeah, but the kind of bananas that we eat they don't."
00:17:27,00:17:32,The wild bananas you get are rubbish like round and have loads of seeds in them and taste terrible
00:17:32,00:17:36,apparently. So monkeys probably just don't want them. But the thing is they love bananas.
00:17:36,00:17:42,I'm not saying they don't like bananas. It's like Catherine Milton. He's just saying that they
00:17:42,00:17:46,would never get the ones that you get in weight trousers. They wouldn't get them in the wild. It's
00:17:46,00:17:51,basically like having an all cracked diet. Yeah. Which is not healthy. What have we done to them?
00:17:51,00:17:55,Or sort of cake or chocolate. It's like eating only cake or chocolate. So instead they're
00:17:55,00:17:59,just fed leafy vegetables these days and they only get a banana if they have to have some
00:17:59,00:18:04,medication and then they hide the medication inside the banana. It sounds so rubbish. They're
00:18:04,00:18:09,getting kind of kale and lettuce aren't they? Yeah. It's like delicious. If it's the only time
00:18:09,00:18:15,we ever let you have a pint we put some volume in it or something. Yeah. Yeah. I'd claim I need a
00:18:15,00:18:22,volume. Yeah. Very often. Their favourite food though. Not banana. That's number two. Apparently
00:18:22,00:18:27,this is according to a study that was done in 1936. But has never been disproved. Monkeys favourite
00:18:27,00:18:32,food is grape. Apparently grape is number one and then bananas are number two. They get apps
00:18:32,00:18:37,in nuts for grapes. So that's kind of the heroin I think and the banana is the cocaine. So if this
00:18:37,00:18:42,was a thing about monkeys and grapes if you make a monkey do a job and I'm talking a simple
00:18:42,00:18:47,simple job. Not like civil engineer or something. No it was to take a rock and put it in the experimenter's
00:18:47,00:18:55,hands. So it's a basic task but if you make a monkey do that task for a reward like a bit of cucumber
00:18:55,00:19:01,but then you let it see another monkey doing the same task and being given a grape then the first
00:19:01,00:19:05,monkey will start to slack off and it will do the job with less enthusiasm and we'll get a right
00:19:05,00:19:10,less of the time. It will care less. Fair enough. Why are you trying to drive these two monkeys apart
00:19:10,00:19:16,and make them hate each other by preferring one over the other or things? Bananas are weird though aren't
00:19:16,00:19:24,they? And what context? They're weird because whenever you crossbreed the subspecies they don't create
00:19:24,00:19:29,seeds. So that's why we've got this brilliant seedless banana but we're going to lose it. So people
00:19:29,00:19:35,are worried. The main banana that people ate was the grown Michelle banana until the 50s or
00:19:35,00:19:41,60s and then that was wiped out and now there's a panema disease that wiped out that banana has come
00:19:41,00:19:46,back to wipe out the only variety we have left. And so we're in serious trouble and scientists are
00:19:46,00:19:50,trying to breed a new banana to get around this and they can't get it to taste right. You know the
00:19:50,00:19:55,grown Michelle was even sweeter than the current one. Really? Yeah. You know like banana candies like
00:19:55,00:20:00,little sweets look like bananas and taste like bananas but actually when you think about it they
00:20:00,00:20:05,don't really taste like bananas do they? Well they taste like grown Michelle bananas. I think it grows.
00:20:05,00:20:11,No just way sweeter. Yeah. And people there's a theory that actually it's a myth that the reason
00:20:11,00:20:15,that they taste differently to bananas is because we made them when grown Michelle bananas were
00:20:15,00:20:20,around and we made them taste like those but actually we just made the candies taste like very sweet
00:20:20,00:20:25,bananas and it just happens to be the same. I wonder if we were in Melbourne Zoo and we were fed
00:20:25,00:20:31,those candy bananas. Yeah. Whether or not that would be more hurtful to us than an actual banana is
00:20:31,00:20:36,to monkeys. If that was all yeah. That would be bad yeah. Would it be worse do you think? Like I'm
00:20:36,00:20:40,trying to see the equivalent of how bad that is. Well effectively you're just eating sugar and
00:20:40,00:20:44,food coloring. Yeah. Sweetener. I mean how long do you think you could survive on just the diet
00:20:44,00:20:49,of those candy bananas a few years? No. Like for instance if you only eat rabbits you can't
00:20:49,00:20:54,last for more than a year. No rabbits. Yeah. Where are you in the scenario? You're in the desert
00:20:54,00:20:58,island and it's just you and two rabbits and you think I won't eat them for now. I'll let the
00:20:58,00:21:03,bait. There's loads of them. But by the time that happens you're fine but then you eat them and
00:21:03,00:21:08,"then there's something in them that you don't get enough of. Oh it's one of the vitamins, isn't it?"
00:21:08,00:21:12,It's one of the vitamins. It's A or D. Yeah bananas are good though. They've got almost everything
00:21:12,00:21:18,that you need in them for a while. So if you only ate bananas and rabbits. You want a fucking weird
00:21:18,00:21:23,idiot rabbit split. There wasn't very that I remember reading ones. Was this about Peter Andre?
00:21:23,00:21:32,Peter Andre collapsed after eating too many bananas because he was obviously very very
00:21:32,00:21:37,muscular chap when he was especially when he first started out he was known for being Mr.
00:21:37,00:21:42,Mussels. This is the rock star kind of anecdote I like. And he's maintained a good physique
00:21:42,00:21:48,but in his in his in his early days that was that was his selling USP. The selling point was
00:21:48,00:21:52,always. Yeah always you know any waterfall that was near by he'd be underneath it. We've all seen
00:21:52,00:21:56,the mysterious girl. Exactly. We've seen it. We know the skull. So how does it look to bananas?
00:21:56,00:22:02,So yeah before some sort of show that he was doing which you know would probably be you know
00:22:02,00:22:07,in a record shop or something not necessarily an actual stage show. Okay. I think it was like
00:22:07,00:22:12,some sort of in-store appearance. Peter Andre collapsed and the rumor had had it that he'd eaten
00:22:12,00:22:17,too many bananas because he ate like seven or eight bananas in a row just to keep his
00:22:17,00:22:23,potassium levels up because he was you know it felt or his dietician felt that he needed
00:22:23,00:22:30,this to maintain his stunning physique. And then I'm now getting into digression sketchy
00:22:30,00:22:36,deterioration. I then read a few years later that he you know he had collapsed but he was ill or
00:22:36,00:22:40,something blah blah blah but he was eating a very large amount of bananas at the time.
00:22:40,00:22:46,Yeah I think his rider his rider now says no bananas every day. Yeah managers what the fuck is this?
00:22:46,00:22:51,Keep me aware from the bananas. The bag check on the way into gigs is just for bananas.
00:22:51,00:22:55,Peter sees one of those he collapses on stage. I think that's true. But do you know who else
00:22:55,00:23:01,used to have loads of bananas? Gordon Brown. What's the one link between Gordon Brown and Peter Andre?
00:23:01,00:23:04,Gordon Brown used to have nine bananas every day. The brown has a very nice physique too.
00:23:05,00:23:12,Quite good. My bananas a day. He was trying to give up smoking. Now he started me think about
00:23:12,00:23:17,"smoking bananas. Not that I've ever done anything like that. But in the 60s, mellow yellow,"
00:23:17,00:23:23,the the Donovan song was people believed it to be about smoking bananas as an alternative to cannabis.
00:23:23,00:23:29,Yeah that's a very cheap alternative which yeah apparently has no effect. I see the big book of
00:23:29,00:23:38,Paul Smith banana pop. Where's my contract? Where's the book contract? I actually read about
00:23:38,00:23:44,the Donovan song and Donovan has since I believe done an interview where he said that that was the
00:23:44,00:23:48,story that came out in the myth at the time that it was to do with smoking the insides of bananas.
00:23:48,00:23:55,In fact inside the in the lyrics of the song he talks about an electric banana which was a vibrator
00:23:55,00:24:02,and mellow yellow supposedly is a vibrator. You know bananas skins. Are they slippy? They're
00:24:02,00:24:07,slippy. Yes they are super slippy. They've got a good natural lubricant on them. And actually if
00:24:07,00:24:12,you look up banana skin lubricant trying to find cool scientific stuff there is so much weird
00:24:12,00:24:16,sex advice out there about what to do with banana skins but that is not why I'm going to mention.
00:24:16,00:24:22,I banan slipping on a banana skin has been a comedy trope since the mid 19th century
00:24:23,00:24:30,and actually it was a genuine concern that it was a proper danger so this is a time when from the mid 1800s
00:24:30,00:24:35,then lots of bananas are suddenly being imported into America and I found a New York Times article
00:24:35,00:24:41,from the 1890s where the president of the New York police force declared war on the banana skin.
00:24:41,00:24:46,So he said he was really worried because he explained that the bad habits of banana skin
00:24:46,00:24:50,dwelling particularly on its tendency to toss people into the air and bring them down with
00:24:50,00:24:56,terrific force onto the hard pavement and he introduced a new sort of law in New York saying that
00:24:56,00:25:01,you get fined for dropping banana skins and that was president of the police force Teddy Roosevelt.
00:25:01,00:25:08,So that's where he got his start in life. Wow. I was going to be reading the round the same time.
00:25:08,00:25:12,No I wasn't reading that around the same time but I was reading about things that were happening.
00:25:12,00:25:16,This is really sketchy but I think there was groups of people who would go around
00:25:17,00:25:23,railway stations and they would deliberately kind of pretend to fall and they would drop banana skins
00:25:23,00:25:29,on the ground and say oh you didn't move that I'm going to sue you. That was a big early insurance
00:25:29,00:25:33,game. I think we've never mentioned it before but it's worth mentioning again. Sure.
00:25:33,00:25:38,And there were trained inspectors who were trained to ask loads of questions like
00:25:38,00:25:44,were there bananas for sale on the train? All these details that you could use to spot a fraudster.
00:25:44,00:25:47,Have we mentioned sliding Billy Watson before?
00:25:47,00:25:57,"No, but please. He was a famous board of a lot, huge deal, early 1900s and his sole gag was sliding"
00:25:57,00:26:03,"on stage on a banana skin. People were easily pleased. There was lots of laughing records,"
00:26:03,00:26:10,some of the first ever recorded discs that became popular and widely bought were of just
00:26:10,00:26:18,of people laughing. The laughing policeman was one of the most famous parts of that trend but it
00:26:18,00:26:23,was a total thing where people just loved hearing people laughing out of these new grammar forms.
00:26:23,00:26:28,People never heard records and so they didn't think let's put a song on it. They thought let's
00:26:28,00:26:34,record people laughing and they made millions. It was cool. The laughing policeman is a great song.
00:26:34,00:26:38,It's a classic. The laughing norm not so much have you heard that one?
00:26:38,00:26:43,"David Bowie. David Bowie's first, I think it's his first single maybe. The laughing norm."
00:26:43,00:26:46,"It was the best time to I love Ringo Star, wasn't it?"
00:26:46,00:26:51,Some of our most famous stars have had in our species beginnings.
00:26:51,00:27:00,"In Korea, this is exciting. They sell a one a day banana pack. So it's five bananas in underneath"
00:27:00,00:27:04,plastic and they're all ripened. One of them's really ripe. One of them's almost ripe. One of them's
00:27:04,00:27:08,not that ripe. One of them's not ripe at all and the other one's almost unripe.
00:27:08,00:27:12,"Wow. It's cheaper than every day. At the end of the day, they're completely ripe."
00:27:12,00:27:17,"Well, they've in Japan they have invented an edible banana peel. So you now just eat the banana."
00:27:17,00:27:21,This is a big thing. People keep saying it's really good for you. It's called the monkey banana.
00:27:21,00:27:25,It makes you healthy. It protects your heart. Curses in somnia and depression. Stop people
00:27:25,00:27:30,slipping over. Stop people slipping over. There's no evidence for anything except stopping people
00:27:30,00:27:35,"slipping over. It's your body, even if there are nutrients in there, which there may be,"
00:27:35,00:27:38,"your body won't be able to absorb them. And also, if you don't wash it really carefully,"
00:27:38,00:27:44,you'll probably get pesticide. So don't eat a banana peel. I can't believe I'm going to say this.
00:27:44,00:27:48,"Imagine if, do you think, because that feels like the early kind of modern comedy,"
00:27:48,00:27:52,if we got rid of banana peels or started eating them and comedy died.
00:27:52,00:27:57,"Oh, wow. I reckon it would. I reckon that would trigger the end of all comedy."
00:27:57,00:28:01,"If we lost the slapstick banana peel, man. That's the moment in history where the universe is when,"
00:28:01,00:28:05,"yeah, there's a universe out there where comedy doesn't happen. Yeah. Because we ate"
00:28:05,00:28:10,eight ore peels. All right. Wow. Or maybe we'll be that moment in history. I don't know.
00:28:10,00:28:13,Or maybe this podcast is that moment in history where comedy doesn't help.
00:28:13,00:28:21,"Okay, it is time for fact number three. And that is Chuzansky."
00:28:21,00:28:26,"Yeah, my fact this week is that Nobel Prize when a Barry Marshall has developed a belt that"
00:28:26,00:28:32,"senses stomach rumblings inspired by his son, who's a seismologist who makes devices that sense"
00:28:32,00:28:39,"vibrations on the ocean floor, which I just find so cool as a kind of really random crossover"
00:28:39,00:28:43,"to totally different industries. So he's just around the table with his son one day saying,"
00:28:43,00:28:47,I've got to look into this stomach rumbling thing. He's investigating IBS and he wants to know how to
00:28:47,00:28:52,"diagnose it quickly. And you know, his son just says, well, I've got this instrument. The"
00:28:52,00:28:57,senses vibrations on the floor of the sea. You want to try that. And he has and he's made this belt.
00:28:57,00:29:01,So should you just first say who Barry Marshall is because he's a bit of a hero isn't he?
00:29:01,00:29:07,He's a deal. He's Nobel prizes for an awesome reason. Yes. So he got a Nobel prize in 2005
00:29:07,00:29:11,"because he proved that stomach ulcers, which everyone needs to say was caused by stress."
00:29:11,00:29:15,And I think a lot of people kind of still do say that he approved their cause by bacteria.
00:29:15,00:29:21,"And he did that by swallowing a whole bunch of bacteria and giving himself a stomach ulcer,"
00:29:21,00:29:25,which I think we've said before and that proved that that did it. And that means he can cure stomach ulcers
00:29:25,00:29:30,with antibiotics. And then that has massively reduced stomach cancer in the Western world.
00:29:30,00:29:36,And he did it against the medical establishment really because you're not meant to self-experiment.
00:29:36,00:29:42,"And he was desperately trying to get experimented on subjects who had it, but the medical board said,"
00:29:42,00:29:46,"no, not possible. So he went home and he was like, he put it on some toast or something."
00:29:46,00:29:51,"It was like a broth wasn't it? It was against his wife as well who was very, very upset about it."
00:29:51,00:29:54,Really? And then he said he never told her because it was one of the occasions when it would be
00:29:54,00:29:59,"easier to get forgiveness than get permission. But she got really upset about it because she thought,"
00:29:59,00:30:04,"she believed him, of course, that it was a bacteria that caused it. And she thought that by"
00:30:04,00:30:08,"giving himself it, it would give it to the whole family and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Fair."
00:30:08,00:30:10,"But you can't, you don't kiss with your stomach."
00:30:11,00:30:19,Some sort of exotic practice. It's so interesting how everyone thought that bacteria
00:30:19,00:30:24,couldn't live in the stomach. So that's why it can't be a bacterial thing when you have a stomach also.
00:30:24,00:30:29,"But also, there was no incentive really to discover a cure because antacids,"
00:30:29,00:30:34,"you know, things which neutralize the acid in your stomach were very popular. And also,"
00:30:34,00:30:39,"you have to keep taking them for life. Yeah, and also they do kind of help quite a lot, don't they?"
00:30:39,00:30:43,"So it was almost like that, like you say, not that much incentive because the industry was huge,"
00:30:43,00:30:46,but also it was kind of doing quite a good job. And deals with the symptoms. It just doesn't deal with
00:30:46,00:30:52,"the ulcer. Yeah. Because at the start of the 20th century, 100% of mankind had this bacteria in"
00:30:52,00:30:56,the stomach. Wow. Wow. That's great. Yeah. It's impressive. He deserved it. He deserved the price.
00:30:56,00:31:01,"Okay. Can I just say he also developed this, he did this and he had to try it on a few patients."
00:31:01,00:31:06,"So it wasn't a complete shot in the dark, but he had to do it on himself. I can't remember exactly"
00:31:06,00:31:11,"why, but it was after six months of unsuccessfully trying to give piglets, stomach ulcers."
00:31:11,00:31:16,So maybe he's not a great dude after all. He only did it to the evil piglets.
00:31:16,00:31:26,"And the other thing is that Heliobacter Pylori, which is a bacteria, is kind of useful in the body."
00:31:26,00:31:31,So it modulates your immune system. And a lot of people think it stops your immune system from being
00:31:31,00:31:36,too hyper reactive. And perhaps and that this is really going out on a limb. Now that we don't have
00:31:36,00:31:41,"as much of it, you're more likely to get allergies and stuff like that. And IBS. Which is now trying to cure."
00:31:41,00:31:47,"So there is an idea of reintroducing Heliobacter Pylori. If you could somehow make it,"
00:31:47,00:31:51,"so it doesn't give you ulcers, then you can put it back in your body if you could kind of genetically"
00:31:51,00:31:58,"modify it. So he's now frantically digging up the recipe for that broth. So he's not trying to cure IBS,"
00:31:58,00:32:05,which is possibly caused by the thing he cured. What is cure for IBS going to give us? That's what I
00:32:05,00:32:10,"want to know. He keeps keeping himself in work. But IBS is a real problem, right? That feels a bit"
00:32:10,00:32:16,like stomach ulcers were in that no one really knows what's causing it. And it's very hard to diagnose.
00:32:16,00:32:22,And the diagnosis is quite invasive usually. And so what he's developed is this belt. And it records
00:32:22,00:32:27,"what he calls the creeks and undulations of the gut and recognizes the sonic signature of IBS,"
00:32:27,00:32:32,which it's so complicated because the gut's so long and so much is happening in it that the human
00:32:32,00:32:36,ear can't do that. You can't listen to someone's gut and know they've got IBS. But by showing a
00:32:36,00:32:42,"sort of robotic belt, former IBS sufferers and training it to recognize it, you can do that."
00:32:42,00:32:46,"And yeah, he's done that. And as he was inspired, first of all, by his son, who introduced him to the"
00:32:46,00:32:52,idea of these vibrations on the ocean floor. And then a colleague showed him a kind of shopper acoustic
00:32:52,00:32:57,device that he was using for detecting termites under houses. And he used the design of that for the belt.
00:32:57,00:33:03,"So he's using termites and seismology. Well, listen, seismology has given us quite a lot of"
00:33:03,00:33:10,"non-size-mology-based inventions. I think we have a lot to thank seismologists for. So for example,"
00:33:10,00:33:18,there was a guy called... How did I know you had an example? Andy Hilderbrand. He was a research
00:33:18,00:33:24,scientist in the oil industry. And he developed software for processing the data from reflection
00:33:24,00:33:29,seismology. So it was a method... I'm reading the sentence out basically from this article. A method
00:33:29,00:33:36,of estimating properties of Earth's subsurface using reflective seismic waves. So that was his job.
00:33:36,00:33:43,What he then invented off the back of that technology was auto-tuning for the music industry.
00:33:43,00:33:50,"So when you hear auto-tuning, it is from Andy Hilderbrand, who was a seismologist. That is very cool."
00:33:50,00:33:55,"And also, I can't remember his name, but it was a seismologist whose technology for predicting"
00:33:55,00:33:59,earthquakes was then used for predicting who's going to win the American presidential election.
00:33:59,00:34:04,"Oh, yeah. Nate Silver. Not Nate Silver. It's a guy who's been doing it. He's predicted the last"
00:34:04,00:34:09,like five presidents basically of the United States using this seismology technology.
00:34:09,00:34:15,"Well, it was quite a seismic event. This last election wasn't it, Andy? I feel queasy."
00:34:15,00:34:21,"I guess you could say it was a landslide, which is similar to an earthquake. It wasn't really,"
00:34:21,00:34:25,"because he didn't win the popular vote. That's true, yeah. But it wasn't. It's so interesting."
00:34:25,00:34:28,"Paul's not saying anything, but you can see him regretting coming out of his office."
00:34:28,00:34:33,Not the last two minutes. Let's talk about auto-tuning then. Do you use auto-tuning?
00:34:33,00:34:39,"I would never use auto-tuning. But that massively changed music, didn't it, auto-tuning?"
00:34:39,00:34:43,"For the better off, for the worse, that's the question. I don't know exactly what it is."
00:34:43,00:34:48,"Better if you're chair. Well, I've heard of chair. Well, chair used it in an inventive way."
00:34:48,00:34:52,"In brief, right? Yes. Just so, to go now, in beautiful way."
00:34:52,00:34:56,That's auto-tuning. Why does she need to use that? I just did it with my voice.
00:34:56,00:35:03,No one thought it was talented as you. I can't be expected to have your kind of range.
00:35:03,00:35:09,"That's fair. But yeah, I think it's now overused. It seems to be in a lot of"
00:35:09,00:35:15,"R&B and rap songs, when it doesn't necessarily need to be. Is it a bit rude to accuse someone"
00:35:15,00:35:21,"of using auto-tuning? Not these days, but yeah, it would have been. And I heard a few rumours about"
00:35:21,00:35:27,"auto-tune. Along the way, Peter Andre, please. Peter is of a higher colour than that."
00:35:27,00:35:34,"Well, you're not. No one could hit those notes in mysterious girls. I heard Gordon Brown uses"
00:35:34,00:35:40,"auto-tune. So who were the rumours about? Are you allowed to say on that? Well, no."
00:35:40,00:35:46,"When we were making our first record, there was a few rumours going around."
00:35:46,00:35:53,"I'll produce a poll at the time, said that there's somebody that he'd worked with."
00:35:53,00:36:00,"I won't say in kiss. In kiss, he was perhaps elaborating on some of who he wouldn't expect, is it?"
00:36:00,00:36:05,"No, somebody would expect somebody who wasn't very good at singing. Essentially,"
00:36:05,00:36:09,"and they went massive producer. Well, this is it. He's now Adele, and, you know, whoever he's"
00:36:09,00:36:13,"equal to. This is not just trying to get you to name people, it's working. It's Adele."
00:36:13,00:36:19,Adele can't really sing. Have you seen a live? It wasn't Adele. It must be obvious when people
00:36:19,00:36:23,"sing live, though, right? But this is the thing when, yeah, there are a few people who are"
00:36:23,00:36:29,"pretty ropey live, and in the studio, they are using the electronic help. So is there no way of"
00:36:29,00:36:34,"using, see, I really don't know about it, is there no way of slightly tweaking your voice live on stage,"
00:36:34,00:36:40,"as in, oh, the will be singing into your phone. No, well, this is it. There will be a way of doing"
00:36:40,00:36:45,"it live as well, because it's just an electronic feed going down into a mixer that then comes out of the"
00:36:45,00:36:50,"speakers. I've seen those fun toys that you can get, or you can make yourself sound like Darth Vader,"
00:36:50,00:36:56,"just by talking into that. Yeah, but you don't get Britney Spears sound, you'd like chew back at the"
00:36:56,00:37:01,"video, because they've got another wrong setting. Yeah, that's an order to cock up and it's worries."
00:37:01,00:37:08,"I think that would kickstarter career. I think she's did all right. Britney. Yeah, she's still massive"
00:37:08,00:37:13,in America. She's on X-Factor and stuff. She does Vegas. She does Vegas. That's the thing. That's
00:37:13,00:37:19,"the thing after people lose that sort of, you know, the number ones start becoming number 10s,"
00:37:19,00:37:24,or whatever. It feels like the graveyard's a lot of pop stars. She's just about 400 shows a year.
00:37:24,00:37:30,"But this is it. Yeah, then you success. So it's the graveyard slot critically. People will dismiss"
00:37:30,00:37:35,"you then, but obviously you're raking it in and it's true showbiz. Can I just say to the people of"
00:37:35,00:37:40,"Vegas, we're ready for that slot? We're ready. So some stuff about digestion. Yes, please. I was reading."
00:37:40,00:37:48,"I do know that 95% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut. So you know, we think of serotonin"
00:37:48,00:37:52,"as the, you know, the hormone that's produced by the brain and it makes us really happy. And if"
00:37:52,00:37:57,"you're an antidepressants, it helps you to release it. But 95% is produced in the gut. And as I just,"
00:37:57,00:38:02,I find actually this whole thing amazing because I don't think that medicine as a tool comes to terms
00:38:02,00:38:06,with how the brain is connected to the rest of the body. You basically have a second brain in your
00:38:06,00:38:10,"gut, don't you? You've got a second brain in your gut. And of course, it's interacting so much"
00:38:10,00:38:15,with how you feel. So you get butterflies in your stomach. That's you feeling nervous because
00:38:15,00:38:18,you've got this whole nervous system. And it's a completely independent nervous system. So it's
00:38:18,00:38:25,"the enteric nervous system. And they actually found something really recently, which is the vagus"
00:38:25,00:38:31,"nerve is the vague main nerve. No way. That was a nerve called the vagus nerve? Yeah, you know,"
00:38:31,00:38:37,it's the vagus nerve. It's got a Britney Spears claim. The heart rate down it. I thought it was
00:38:37,00:38:42,"compromised. I thought it was pronounced vagus. I've heard it both, actually. So I think it's fine both."
00:38:42,00:38:47,It's the vagus or the vagus nerve. And it's the main nerve that runs from your brain
00:38:47,00:38:51,to your organs basically carrying all the information there. So we think that we think of stuff in
00:38:51,00:38:55,our brain and then it's carried through the nerves to our various bits of our body to tell it what to do.
00:38:55,00:39:01,Scientists found that recently that 90% of the fibers that are in that nerve are actually
00:39:01,00:39:07,carrying information from the gut back to the brain. And so it's our gut is telling our brain what to do
00:39:07,00:39:12,"in a sense. I mean, this is like an amazing thing that scientists have just realised."
00:39:12,00:39:17,"That's so cool. Messages are being sent. No, I'm not so like because we've been saying that people"
00:39:17,00:39:21,"have a gut feeling for things for all all that time, but actually it turns out that that's a really"
00:39:21,00:39:29,"vagus. That's what I say. No, don't say a joke that means I'm going to cut this out."
00:39:29,00:39:36,"Just with the journey of how things are digested in the gut, there's a thing that we put in our"
00:39:36,00:39:41,"in our latest book, which is a new app that scientists are working on where you can track"
00:39:41,00:39:49,"via your app, the creation of a fart inside your body. So it follows the fart from its beginnings"
00:39:49,00:39:57,"all the way to the exit. And is that what you call your backside? Hey, nice exit."
00:39:57,00:40:04,"But yeah, so that's an app that's hopefully going to be available. Well, I'd like to have it."
00:40:04,00:40:08,"I'd just like to know when I need to leave a room, but like at the last minute,"
00:40:08,00:40:13,"well, it's near the exit. I can hang out here and tell them. And the idea of that is that"
00:40:13,00:40:20,"doctors might be able to use it to see what kind of foods cause gas and you know, it's not so"
00:40:20,00:40:26,"that you can time watching a film thinking, right, I've got 96 minutes so we can watch these films"
00:40:26,00:40:33,"before I do that. Sorry Andy, do you never fart during the movie? Sorry, I can't watch this movie"
00:40:33,00:40:37,"because it's a two hours lug and I've got one brewing and I need to, I can't watch this. I can't wait until"
00:40:37,00:40:41,"the intermission. Yeah, I think that's the reason. Well, maybe you have an intermission."
00:40:41,00:40:50,"Yeah, you could use it in an alternative fashion if you were like a schoolboy prankster."
00:40:50,00:40:58,"Here's one coming, I'm going to time it for the sort of the apex of this speech in assembly,"
00:40:58,00:41:02,which is what seemed to happen. There seemed to be some people at my school who were extremely
00:41:02,00:41:08,talented at breaking wind at the right time just to undercut what was going on in the school assembly.
00:41:08,00:41:14,"Andrew Bird, and he had a particular tone as well. You wouldn't name the auto-tuners,"
00:41:14,00:41:19,but you're crossing up Andrew Bird. I've heard that Andrew Bird auto-tunes as far as I'm saying.
00:41:19,00:41:26,Andrew Bird is unlikely to be at the next festival about to lynch me behind the poor. You're saying
00:41:26,00:41:31,he won't sue because he's not got music industry muscle behind him. Exactly. If he does come after
00:41:31,00:41:37,"you're so lynching, you'll hear it coming. Do you know something really interesting? So, you know"
00:41:37,00:41:42,"endoscopies where you, I guess, it's a way of looking into your insides basically by getting a bit"
00:41:42,00:41:49,"chewed down you and getting crumb, or up you. The first endoscopies, who do you think? You have"
00:41:49,00:41:57,to do the excess. The first-ever endoscopy where you have to shove something down through someone's
00:41:57,00:42:01,"mouth to try and look at their insides, who do you think it was tried on? It's not a specific person,"
00:42:01,00:42:09,"is it type of person? Oh, someone with a child. Because they have a shorter... Oh, yeah. Right. Is it"
00:42:09,00:42:16,"ace? Oh, I think I've worked it out and I know what it is. It's a side swallowing. Yeah. So, yeah,"
00:42:16,00:42:23,"this was an 1868 Adolf Kusmal made his patient who was a Swallow, a Swallow, a 47-centimeter chew,"
00:42:23,00:42:26,because obviously they've got those big furits. That's amazing. And it was used a bunch of times in
00:42:26,00:42:31,"the future. The first ECG ever in 1906 was down in the Swallow. They're very used to it. Eventually,"
00:42:31,00:42:38,they realised that maybe we shouldn't put the camera at the end of a Swallow. But they could do some
00:42:38,00:42:47,"surgery while they were in there. We should move on to the final fact. Just very quickly, Barry Marshall,"
00:42:47,00:42:54,"what's he doing now? Apart from his belt thing, he's also written a new book, comes out next year."
00:42:55,00:43:02,It's called How to Win a Nobel Prize. And it's a middle grade adventure about a girl who stumbles
00:43:02,00:43:07,"on a secret meeting of Nobel Prize winners, including Albert Einstein and Mary Curie. And she"
00:43:07,00:43:12,travels through time learning the secrets behind some of the world's most important scientific
00:43:12,00:43:16,"discoveries. That's awesome. That's good, that's nice. Middle grade, do you mean the sort of the school"
00:43:16,00:43:21,"years? I actually don't know what that means. I think so instead of like elementary school kids,"
00:43:21,00:43:26,"because the way you said it made it sound like it was a reasonable quality, but not great. I haven't"
00:43:26,00:43:33,"read it, so I don't know. It's all right, but stick to belts as you main job. That sounds horrible."
00:43:33,00:43:37,"It sounds like it's a way to try and convince kids that you're having fun, but actually you're just"
00:43:37,00:43:43,obviously learning what? I'd skype that. That's a whole job. I try to skype this every week.
00:43:47,00:43:52,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:43:52,00:43:57,one building that burned down in the Great Fire of London was a public toilet that could be used by
00:43:57,00:44:06,128 people at the same time. Same time. It's just as well. If you're looking at pluses for the
00:44:06,00:44:11,"Great Fire of London, there can't be many, but that might have been one of them. Some people say"
00:44:11,00:44:14,"about the Great Fire that it was a plus because they could really build those bits of London,"
00:44:14,00:44:20,don't they? I don't know. I think we don't have enough public toilets in the world and in the UK
00:44:20,00:44:24,definitely. I think one that could be used by 128 people would be quite a good thing. When you say
00:44:24,00:44:30,"they use it at the same time, it's not like a 3-2-1, everyone unloads. You could do it like that if"
00:44:30,00:44:36,"you want, but it's basically it had 128 seats. 64 for men and 64 for women, which is quite progressive"
00:44:36,00:44:42,"for the time, which you wouldn't get today, I'm sure. It would empty into the terms. It was on"
00:44:42,00:44:49,"cheap side in London. After the fire, it was replaced by another public toilet, which instead of"
00:44:49,00:44:56,"having 128 seats had 12. What I want to know is, does that mean that in the old one, everyone was"
00:44:56,00:44:59,really squished together or in the new one did people have loads and loads of space? I think the
00:44:59,00:45:07,"new one also had six flats on top of it. But it was between two rivers, wasn't it? Because they"
00:45:07,00:45:12,"needed a lot of water flowing through. Yeah, so it was between some two tributies of the Thames."
00:45:12,00:45:16,How did the fire burn it down with all that water flowing through? You would have thought that
00:45:16,00:45:22,"would be the perfect barrier. Yes, you would think that, but it wasn't. It was burned down the structure,"
00:45:22,00:45:27,"I think, like a lot of things did. It was called Wittington's Longhouse, and it was named after"
00:45:27,00:45:33,"Dick Wittington, because it was money that he left after being met that built it. And Dick Wittington,"
00:45:33,00:45:40,"this is for people overseas, I hadn't heard of him personally, not coming from here. He's"
00:45:40,00:45:44,Dick Wittington and his cat is a sort of famous story. It's a pantomime that's done a lot in this
00:45:44,00:45:49,"country. So he's a very known character who might not be known for his toilet. Well, most people in"
00:45:49,00:45:54,"Britain, I would say, would think that he was a fictional character, because it's light from a"
00:45:54,00:45:58,pantomime and stuff like that. But it turns out that he's real. He was a mayor of London quite a few
00:45:58,00:46:04,"times, and he didn't have a cat to my knowledge. I don't think he had a cat. But he left loads and"
00:46:04,00:46:10,loads of money behind and did all this great stuff about toilets and lots of really things that he
00:46:10,00:46:14,"built. And they think that because of all those great things that he built, that's why he became such a"
00:46:14,00:46:18,"hero in London, and that's why all the stories got written about him. Am I right in saying that Dick"
00:46:18,00:46:24,"Wittington itself, not being Richard Wittington, is a sort of inspired by character, as opposed to"
00:46:24,00:46:30,"it's meant to be literally the mayor. Well, in the story, he is the mayor, isn't he? Yeah, he becomes"
00:46:30,00:46:35,"aware of London at the end. I think he gets cold to be mayor, or something like that. He hears a voice say."
00:46:35,00:46:39,"He goes to London to make his fortunes, the streets are paved with gold, and then I think I usually"
00:46:39,00:46:44,fell asleep or insisted on leaving at that point in the pantomime. You miss the bit where it's paved
00:46:44,00:46:49,"with shit from his toilets. I also left the pantomime at that point, but that's only because I could feel"
00:46:49,00:47:00,"there was a fart on its way. So the Great Fire of London, I actually had my debunked myth, re-bunked,"
00:47:00,00:47:05,"reading about this. Okay, so what's the myth? Is this the one about people dying? Yeah, okay."
00:47:05,00:47:11,"So how many people died in that? I felt like four people died. Yeah, so I think most people think now"
00:47:11,00:47:15,"hardly anyone died four or six people died in the Great Fire of London. Actually, there was a"
00:47:15,00:47:19,historian who's written a book on it and done a lot of research on it who says loads of people
00:47:19,00:47:25,"probably died to start. Yeah, but the censuses were very bad, or the public records were very bad,"
00:47:25,00:47:31,"parish records, but there's evidence like the number of burials suddenly shot up. So they went up"
00:47:31,00:47:38,"by a third in the graveyard that was closest to it, and the average age at death doubled in that month,"
00:47:38,00:47:43,"which implies that older people are getting killed more easily, which makes sense if there's a bad"
00:47:43,00:47:48,"fire, young people going to scarpe, whereas older people are going to be a bit bugged. And basically,"
00:47:48,00:47:53,we think maybe that's not really really interesting. And lots of first-hand accounts say you talk about
00:47:53,00:47:57,"like bloody bodies and the street and the staff and once it was taken to France, which are probably"
00:47:57,00:48:01,"exaggerated, but at the same time, it's plausible that we don't have all the records. Wow. I mean,"
00:48:01,00:48:08,"we basically have to re-edit QI now. I heard is this a myth, and sorry for bringing a depressing"
00:48:08,00:48:14,"fact to the table, but as opposed to those people who just died. Well, yeah, more people died than"
00:48:14,00:48:19,"you think. No, that just feels more, I think, historical, this is a bit more recent. The fire"
00:48:19,00:48:26,"monument for the fire of monuments. Oh, the monument. There's a fact, which I don't know if it's"
00:48:26,00:48:31,"definitely true, is that they had to put a lot of netting and so forth around it, because more people,"
00:48:31,00:48:35,if we're going for the original stat of four people dying and the more people have died from
00:48:35,00:48:39,"jumping off there that was said to have died in the farmland. That was a stat definitely. Right, but"
00:48:39,00:48:47,now it seems like Anna has re-de-re-re-de-bunked. Have you guys heard of Porcelain Palace? No. This
00:48:47,00:48:55,"is in Chongqing, China, and this is the city Chongqing, and it is the world's largest public toilet"
00:48:55,00:49:03,complex in the world. It's at foreigners street amusement park. That's apparently what it's called.
00:49:04,00:49:09,"And it's designed to look, it's got a sort of ancient Egyptian art theme to the whole thing,"
00:49:09,00:49:15,"but it has a thousand toilets and urinals in it, so it is a palace of the toilet. Yeah, it's"
00:49:15,00:49:19,"largest in the world currently. Can all a thousand people go at the same time, I guess? I believe so, yeah."
00:49:19,00:49:26,"Yeah. The inventor of the first public toilets, the ones at the Great Exhibition. The first public"
00:49:26,00:49:31,"toilets in Britain. Sorry. Yep. That apart from the longhouse, which was also a public toilet. Yeah,"
00:49:31,00:49:37,"that's right, yeah. The first modern ones. Yeah, all right. Yeah, him, yeah. He was called George"
00:49:37,00:49:44,"Jennings, and he had 15 children. I have a theory that he may have developed the public toilet,"
00:49:44,00:49:49,"just so that he could go to the loo somewhere, because the bathroom was always busy, because he had"
00:49:49,00:49:53,"15 children. I don't know. It's not a strong theory. If you paid a penny, you got to go to the loo,"
00:49:53,00:50:00,"but you also got a towel, a comb, and a shoe shine. No. A shoe shine. Yeah. I don't know if it was all"
00:50:00,00:50:05,"while you were sitting on the loo, but you're being having a shoe shine. So you don't get a shoe shine,"
00:50:05,00:50:09,do you? Someone challenge your shoes. Exactly. Yeah. Do you get a comb? I don't think you
00:50:09,00:50:13,do. Someone just comb your hair. I think you get comb. I think someone comes your hair. That sounds
00:50:13,00:50:17,"like someone comes your hair. Or you get to use the comb, maybe. Maybe there's a communal comb."
00:50:17,00:50:20,"What a disturbing time to spend on the loo with someone towering you down, someone shining"
00:50:20,00:50:27,your shoes and someone combing your hair. You wouldn't be able to go. The first shewie was actually
00:50:27,00:50:32,"invented in 1898, or the first kind of one that I could find. A shewie is, I think women's"
00:50:32,00:50:37,owners use them in festivals. It's kind of like an upside down cone shaped thing that women can
00:50:37,00:50:43,"weave into and use it like a urinal. But also, yeah, so stand up to weave. Yeah. So you can stand up to"
00:50:43,00:50:49,"weave like men do. But it was invented in 1898, and it was called the urinet, and it was cheap,"
00:50:49,00:50:54,"it was more space efficient, and so a few local councils, especially quite a few in London,"
00:50:54,00:50:59,"installed them. But women didn't want to use them, because it was kind of improper. So there was one"
00:50:59,00:51:06,"important, but women used to flee and horror when they saw it apparently. Right, writing things."
00:51:06,00:51:11,"I'm sorry, because the modern shewie is something you carry around with you, and you use it like a"
00:51:11,00:51:19,"penis, not like a urinal. Yes. These ones. These ones are more of a urinal than a penis. So they"
00:51:19,00:51:23,"were installed, and there was a curtain that went around them, and they were much close together."
00:51:23,00:51:29,"Okay, I need to hold my mother's not listening to this. Hang on, is it like a urinal with a very long"
00:51:29,00:51:37,"sort of front bottom bit, as it were, and then wow, wow, that doesn't sound hygienic,"
00:51:37,00:51:46,or I think I would run in horror. So I looked up some other buildings that were in London at the time
00:51:46,00:51:50,"of the Great Fire. Oh, yeah. So one of the ones actually, so this is one that survived, but it's"
00:51:50,00:51:55,"just an incredible building that was in mid-17th century London. It was called None Search House,"
00:51:55,00:51:59,"and it was on London Bridge. So you know, London Bridge used to be lined with shops and buildings,"
00:51:59,00:52:05,"which I find incredible. Yeah, so bridge. None Search House was a Renaissance palace, four"
00:52:05,00:52:10,"stories high in the middle of the bridge. It was massive. You have to look up pictures of it,"
00:52:10,00:52:15,"so good. I'll try and put one up on my Twitter feed, so it just lurched over the tent, the whole"
00:52:15,00:52:19,"terms, you know. Sorry, you'll try to put one up on your Twitter feed. This is successfully built a"
00:52:19,00:52:26,"four-story house on London Bridge, and you will try it at all possible to rummage one on my Twitter."
00:52:26,00:52:29,"But life's a lot harder now, isn't it?"
00:52:29,00:52:32,Water slab.
00:52:32,00:52:43,"Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get in"
00:52:43,00:52:46,"contact with any of us about the things that we have said over the course of this podcast,"

00:53:22,00:53:27,the... And your new record out now? It is. It's officially out today. That's cool.
00:53:27,00:53:32,"It's called ""Diagrams,"" and yeah, I'll be playing a lot of shows at the end of November,"
00:53:32,00:53:36,so have a look from Glasgow down to London and somewhere in between.
00:53:36,00:53:41,Amazing. Yeah. We're going to be back again next week with another episode. We'll see you then.
00:53:41,00:53:50,Goodbye.
