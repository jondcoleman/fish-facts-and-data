00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's bonus compilation episode of no such thing as a fish,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.520
 some of the best bits that I couldn't quite fit in the edit of all the shows that we've done

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.880
 over the last three or four months. Yes, this is an extra special treat for all of you,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.040
 because you've listened so loyally for so long, you're getting this episode and you're getting it

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.080
 with no adverts. We're not going to ask you to order home delivered meals or delicious international

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.080
 beer or clothes perfectly sculpted to your figure. Anna, this is now an advert at the sticker.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.480
 It's so cool, I've done it to an advert, I can't help it. Well, there is one thing we are actually

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.360
 going to ask people to do because this boneless episode comes with one little tiny string attached

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.880
 to it and that's that it is for charity. This is raising money. This episode for a charity called

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.880
 the Care Workers Charity. We'll be telling you a bit more about them in a bit, but it's a fantastic

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.600
 and very worthy cause. And so your listening is being co-opted in the name of that course.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.240
 That's right. This episode is absolutely free. It is completely free. You don't have to donate if

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.640
 you don't want to, but if you do have a few quid to spare, we would really, really appreciate it.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.960
 Just to stress how really important it is that we're all giving money to charity at the moment,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.040
 it's obviously a time when a lot of charities need huge amounts of money because of COVID and it's

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.960
 coinciding with the time where people are not giving money to charity. So the charity sector has

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.680
 lost billions and billions of pounds over the last few months because of COVID because people are

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.400
 just really struggling and so there's no more vital time to be able to donate any money that you can

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:40.080
 spare. All you have to do is go to qi.com/donate or just giving.com/nstaf and either one will take you

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:58.640
 to the place you need. Okay, I'm with a podcast.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.640
 Sorry, just on ancient sausages. I was looking at who invented the hotdog, which is quite

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.560
 hard to find, but I found where the first sausages were supposedly invented. This is an article

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.440
 from BBC History and they said that the Emperor Nero had a cook called Gayas and in Roman times you

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.160
 would starve your pigs for one week before you slaughter them, but Gayas was watching over his

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.120
 kitchen and realised that one of his pigs had not been properly cleaned. So he stuck a knife into

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.800
 the belly of the pig to see if the roast was edible and out popped an intestine. Okay, and because

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.120
 the pig had been starved, it had puffed up because of the heat and Gayas explained, "I have discovered

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.480
 something of great importance." And it was the sausage. Well, cool. It's a great story. Don't believe

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.240
 that story. Well, no, it's history. BBC History. BBC History, mate. Well, no, it's an account.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.120
 Well, who made up the account? I think it's, I don't know who wrote it,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.480
 who wrote about Nero Day of Casio, someone like that. Oh, yeah, maybe, probably.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.400
 Wow. Yeah. So that was, because they had, they did have sausages, didn't they?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.400
 They did have sausages in Romans, yeah. Yeah. Who used to think it hasn't come from this great

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.000
 discovery of great importance? And when you do discover something like that, you're

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.200
 going to write about it. It seems weird to us these days. Why would you write about the first

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.680
 sausage? Back then, that's like the iPod coming out. Nero's on stage at the forum. Turtle neck,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:36.400
 the eye sausage. One group who are interested in earthworms is the RG.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.800
 The RG. You're appearing in the search group? The Brexitee... Jacob Rees Muggie group, yeah.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.280
 No, it's the earthworm research group who work in Britain. They're one of the main groups

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.400
 of earthworm researchers in the country. And ironically, considering they have a same name

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.680
 as the RG Brexitees, they mostly deal with overseas projects with people like Finland,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.560
 France, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and Spain. Wow. So for them, Brexite is really bad. This RG, yeah.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.160
 So it's like an ERG versus ERG debate right now. I want to see that fight. Yeah. Between Jacob

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.800
 Rees Muggie and this head of the earthworm research group. I'd back anyone who's on the other end

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.680
 against Jacob Rees Muggie. Although he does have that cane a lot of the time.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.280
 'Cause he's a pimp. Pimp's okay. So I don't think he carries a cane, does he?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.160
 I'm not very keen on a Victorian master. I think I'm accidentally thinking of a caricature

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.440
 of a Victorian gentleman, because that's how people portray him, aren't I?

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.240
 Or you're thinking of Wes Wally, who he does have a similar look to Barring the Clothes.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.680
 There's glasses. Yeah, he has a cane. Walks around with a cane. Yeah, he does. It's a walking stick,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.520
 yeah. That's a cane. Yeah. Why does Wes Wally have a cane? He's walking a lot. Yeah,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.880
 because he has to get to all the different parts of the page. Yeah. It's a walking stick,

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.880
 like someone up a mountain, not someone who... Oh, okay. He came from an old person, for example.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.720
 No, no, okay. Because he's middle-aged. Oh, I don't like that. Where's Wally?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.960
 Young to middle-aged. I think young. I mean, I am quite old. It's a young man's game.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.960
 Wally. There was a place I read about which was called

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.320
 Loudon County. I think I'm pronouncing that right. It's an America. And supposedly, so it's in

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.040
 Virginia, supposedly 70% of the world's online traffic passes through this one county.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.760
 Yeah, so they have all the storage units there. And so, yeah, this was an article that I was reading.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.120
 So it's the largest concentration, this article says, of computing power.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.840
 And according to Greenpeace in 2017, 1% of the electricity company that runs all of the electricity

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.560
 in this one place, only 1% of it is renewable sources. So it's incredibly unhealthy. So if we're

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.880
 talking about online carbon footprint... If I go to this town, can I find everyone's emails?

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.480
 Yeah, you're saying to me. But they're wishing through so fast. You need a net.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.520
 Oh, you need a net. Yeah. Is that what the net is? Yeah, that's what the net is.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.520
 Have you heard of eal houses? No. It's cool. There are two of these things in the UK, two only.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.160
 And it's where you build a house over a river, and you have slew skates, which are designed to

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.280
 trap eals. So they're built in the middle ages. And you can, and you just, you know, trap all the eals

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.680
 as they head down the river once they feel the call. They're quite good at getting past obstacles,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.680
 aren't they? So, you know, you've got to build a good gate. So they're really good slithering along

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.440
 the ground. And they can climb up dams and climb over them and stuff like that. And I think people

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.080
 when eals get obstructed by slightly too big dams, if you've got like a hoover situation,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.520
 then people have built little eal ladders. So you can knit together reeds and stuff and they can

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.800
 climb up high. That's very like snakes and ladders, isn't it, eals and ladders? Yeah. The snakes are

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:01.200
 climbing the ladders. Oh my god. The game has changed. I was watching the cartoon cars the other day,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.640
 you know, the Pixar. Yeah. So they're NASCAR cars in cars. And one of the things is that he goes into

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.720
 the wild and he gets lost at night because he doesn't have headlights. And I thought, okay, that's

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.840
 interesting. And I was reading into this. So NASCAR's don't have headlights for their cars. But when you

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:22.080
 look at them, they do, right? They're stickers. The headlights that you see on a NASCAR are stickers

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.120
 that are just put on there to look like they have real headlights. How do they light up? I don't think

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.320
 they, well, there's new technology where they do actually just have little beams that come out,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.960
 but they don't need. I mean, that's a headlight. No, but still the sticker. So it's still, yeah,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.600
 it's not a functioning headlight. Why? Why do they? Because presumably the races are at daytime or

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.600
 they're flood lit if they're later on in the day. So they don't need headlights to function in the race.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.640
 Exactly. Yeah. So why do they do it? It's all to do with the manufacturers. In getting it past,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.520
 they need the shape of the body to have the headlights spot. So apparently, it's to do with stock,

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.640
 but then they're not functional. So they just put stickers over the top. Because otherwise,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.600
 it wouldn't be identified as a car or something. Exactly. Yeah. Can I just check? In the film cars,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.920
 when the car goes into the wild, presumably he goes into the wild to the extent that there are

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.520
 well-tarmac surfaces in the wild. Yes. Okay, fine. So he just stays on roads, does he? He stays on

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:17.360
 roads. Yeah. No, he goes into the wild west of America. He goes off track. Yeah. But not literally

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.160
 off track. He goes literally off track in a sense of he goes on races in the sort of the dirty outback.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.080
 Okay. But there's always a track there. No? Yeah, sometimes when he goes off the track,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.960
 the dirty outback is a horrible phrase. Could we just vlog that? Could it probably yourself be referring to?

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:46.400
 The world record for cycling backwards is 333 kilometres in a day. And this is done by an Australian guy

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:54.880
 called Helinger. And he sits on top of his handlebars and faces backwards and then cycles forward. He

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.920
 cycles. The bike is going forward, but he's facing backwards. Yes. And he's sitting on his handlebars.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:06.080
 Yeah. Yeah. He said, I first started riding backwards when I was a teenager to impress the girls.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:15.920
 He's still single. Yeah. Ladies. He's married. He's married. Oh, great. That's so impressive. I mean,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:22.160
 where was he doing this? Was it on roads? It was on roads, yeah. Was it on the island of roads?

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.880
 It was in Australia on roads. Okay. Because they've got a lot of, I guess, quite quiet roads.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.600
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of long roads. Yeah. Dirty back passengers.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:41.520
 Do you know where you can make pie out of hot dogs and do you know the recipe?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.360
 Do you just, do you make the pastry and then put the whole hot dog in? Do you put the bread in the

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.840
 pastry? No, this is, I'm going to tell you the recipe and tell me when you know what joke I'm

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:57.760
 making. So the recipe is you drop frozen hot dogs onto a grid where the lines are further apart

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.680
 in length and the length of the hot dog. So that, you know, none of the lines are closer together

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.160
 than the length of the hot dog. I've got it. He's got it. It's James Harkin for the win.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.960
 What am I doing? It's you're working out the mathematical number pie. It's the mathematical

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.320
 number pie. If you don't want to do it the normal way, which is remembering that it's 3.14,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.400
 like we all know, you can, you do this. So it's really cool. So you basically toss a bunch of hot dogs,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:28.560
 let's say a hundred hot dogs onto this grid and then you multiply the dog length by the number of

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.760
 dogs tossed and then you times that by two. So that's on the top of the equation. Right. And then

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.600
 you divide that by the distance between the lines and the number of dogs that have crossed over the

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.600
 lines. Okay. And then you will get the answer to what pie is. That's how it was originally worked out

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:52.160
 as well, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. It was. Yeah. It was aerosophonies, wasn't it? It had a lot of hot dogs.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.000
 Yeah. Yeah. He did. He had cholesterol issues, but he was a great mathematician. People do know why I

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.400
 don't. I had limited time, but I still think that's really cool. Yeah. I found something at this weekend

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.280
 that was spooky. You know, Andy Murray, the tennis player, the objectively muttial famous Andy Murray.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:15.040
 I found out. So I found out that he and I as children both owned hamsters called whiskey.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.600
 Ah, really? Yeah. Really? That's an amazing fact. That is weird, isn't it? That was incredible.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.840
 Were you playing tennis before you knew he played tennis? Well, yeah, at school. Yeah, but not like not

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.400
 as a weekend kind of you had training and stuff. No, no, no. Okay. I'm just, that would have been a

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.480
 connection as well. You can't discount the tennis. I do play tennis. You play tennis. You play tennis.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.000
 You play tennis. The fact that you won. God, that's a slam. The fact that you won six one does not mean

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.480
 I do not play tennis. It just means. I just think it's playing in pretty fast and loose with the word

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:54.400
 play. Do you think there was just a hamster salesman going around? Not very good imagination for names.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:00.400
 Wait, you don't, you name your own hamster. You don't have the pet shop owner name your hamster tell you

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.240
 when they sell it. We don't know that though. We don't know that he wasn't very subtly brilliant.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.000
 You didn't name whiskey hamster. I went to big Larry's hamster in Poryl and Glasgow and

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:16.720
 in Dubai. You were told here's whiskey hamster. Of course I made it myself. Why did you call it whiskey?

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.440
 Because at that age you probably weren't drinking whiskey. Well, funny thing. No, it was because of

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.880
 the colour. Yeah, it was whiskey coloured. Okay. Yeah, and it's not my password for anything online

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:34.640
 guys, so nice try. The word alcatraz means "ganet" in Spanish, but when the island was named in 1775

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.920
 it actually meant pelicans. But the Spanish word for pelicans alcatraz actually came from the Arabic

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:49.040
 word for C. Eagle. Oh my god, I'm so confused. But basically the birdman of alcatraz is correct.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.400
 Not really because there weren't any birds there. He was the birdman of another prison. They just

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.080
 gave him that name. They kept the first bit of his name when he got there. I thought he kept birds

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.240
 in alcatraz. No, he kept birds in the previous prison. They didn't have birds for him on alcatraz.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.280
 What sounds like there are a lot of birds on alcatraz. So sorry, I'm coming to get you about this,

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.120
 the Spanish changed the meaning of their word for pelican to mean "ganet". When was this law part?

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:17.040
 Sometimes it wasn't a law. But it was sometimes between, I'm saying it's not a law,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.520
 I know it was a law, but it was sometimes between 1775 and the modern way. If you go, someone was

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:33.120
 like, you know Eagle, that now refers to a magpie. There are seaweed bladders. So there are three

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.280
 bits of a seaweed plant. There's the holdfast, which is basically the root, and then there's the

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.400
 stipe, which is the stem, and then there are the blades. So it's very all analogous to a land plant,

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.400
 but some of them have these air-filled bladders, and the purpose is to hold them upright

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.880
 so they get more sunlight, which I didn't know. But the really big ones, they can get up to six

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:56.800
 inches wide these bladders, which I looked it up, is as wide as a human bladder. Is it?

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:02.720
 Yeah. And are they looking at the potential transplants? That's a human bladder of full stretch.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.200
 Your bladder doesn't get much bigger than that. Bladders don't get bigger than this.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:15.440
 When they had the first cars, they were all hand-painted, and the paint wasn't very good,

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.640
 and so after every year all the paint will flake off your car, and so you had to take it

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:27.520
 back and get it repainted every single year. And it would take about 40 days to complete painting

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:34.960
 the whole car. 40 days. No, that is a garage ripping you out. There was because you had to paint

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.400
 it by hand, but then you had to let it dry and do another coat, and it took ages for the cars to dry.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.960
 Wow. Isn't that amazing? Because they had electricity at this point. You could get a hairdryer

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:52.720
 or something, couldn't you? Yeah, I suppose you could. Well, you know when you go through a car wash,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.120
 they'd dry it at the end, don't they? Yeah. But you'd wash off the paint in the process again

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:03.360
 to the dryer. Oh, god, that would be awful. You'd have to do all this again. That's why it took 40 days.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:10.160
 On the 39th, they're like, hang on, hang on. You don't get a lot of flammery these days.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.000
 Notice that? Yeah, flammery, the old-school jelly. So again, in the olden days, there was just a

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 greater variety of jelly. It was like apples. It was before, you know, we went mass-market. I always

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.720
 thought it was like bulamonj flammery, is it? It is. It's bubble and mongers flammery jelly, really,

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:31.280
 isn't it? And so flammery was extremely popular 17th and 19th century. So it's made by apparently

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.360
 steeping oatmeal in water overnight and then boiling the strain thing you've got in the morning,

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.040
 and you add sugar, and it eventually turns into a kind of wobbly thing. And if you're wealthy,

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.160
 you had to have a huge array of flammery molds because they'd present flammery in different shapes

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.880
 on their tables. And so, and it was really popular to have flammery disguised as proper food. So

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.480
 flammery eggs and bacon was quite a common thing. So there are lots of, you know, molds where you'd

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:02.080
 look like you were about to eat eggs and bacon. Classic. And then you play Frank. And it's flammery.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:08.560
 It's the best word. It's a great word, isn't it? And I wonder if that's where flammery comes from.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.960
 You know, when you'd say some like flammery, it sort of falls flattery. I think so. It must be.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.760
 But I wonder if it comes from the fact that it's false because flammery often disguised itself

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.960
 as these different delicious foods. Have you guys heard of frozen dead guy days?

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.000
 No, it doesn't sound like a thing. It's a real thing. This is an annual celebration that's held in

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.560
 the town of Netherland, Colorado. And it's basically in 1989, this is where the story begins,

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:40.240
 a man passed away. He was Norwegian and his grandson brought him over to America to have him frozen.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.160
 And so they had him on ice. They brought him over. And after a few years they moved to

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:50.320
 Netherland and they built along with his mother, this big in their house, basically a shed that could

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:57.120
 just keep him going and keep him frozen. And then the son got deported. The grandson got deported

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.280
 to the mum had to look after it. And the authorities saw what was going on in the house. And she

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:08.480
 didn't have a few things like electricity and so on. It was a bit illegal. They discovered she had

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.200
 one bit of electricity for that, but not for the rest of the house. Anyway, her house... I'm just

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:19.840
 going to turn the TV on. No! Okay, you can turn the TV off for a bit. But once his ankles are

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.040
 thought out, we have to put it back on. But basically the house was in violation of local laws of

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:30.080
 what you need a house to be in. So she was going to be kicked out. And then they discovered that

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.840
 she was keeping her father frozen in the back. And they said, Agno, this is very illegal. So they

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.160
 wanted to get him out. And as a result, it had a lot of Hu Ha from the community saying, no, we

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.400
 can't have him thought out. He'll die. This is... They want to keep him going. So it worked out in

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.800
 their favor. And this man is still there. He's been moved to a different bit of the town. But as a

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:54.240
 result, they celebrate every year, Frozen Dead Guy Day. And it's a thing... The last one was in 2019

00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.400
 that they had it. They have look-alike contests. They have... They have... They're being less and less

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:08.240
 flattering, presumably. They have... They have coffin races. And this is a thing where they build a fake

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.560
 coffin. There's an obstacle course. And they carry... It's teams of seven. And one of the seven is

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.760
 in the coffin. And they have to race around. They have frozen t-shirt competitions. There's a very

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.480
 cold area this place. They have ice cream that's made specifically for it, which has crushed

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:28.000
 Oreos and sour gummy worms inside. That's been a bit yummy. Bits are cool. Yeah, and it's been going on

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.800
 for all these years. So the last one was held March 8th to 10th 2019. And it looks as if they're going

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.360
 to keep going. So, when you're listening to this broadcast, you might have just missed it. Yeah,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.440
 exactly. Wow. I mean, do you think there's any moment where she's going to think, is this

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.400
 slightly tasteless what I've done now? If... And obviously, it's the biggest if ever, if he wakes up

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:52.080
 at some point. He will be a local hero. Yeah. Imagine that day. That's going to be so exciting.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.920
 Yeah, but he's going to wake up having passed away in Norway. Oh, he's going to wake up in Colorado

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:04.080
 with a language he probably doesn't speak with all these guys serving him ice creams. He's going to be

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:14.960
 weird. Do you want to know some Orkney language? Okay, teach you some. Boys, oh boys means unbelievable.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:20.080
 Boys, oh boys. Boys, oh boys. B-E-U-Y-S. So I think it's boys. Okay.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:29.120
 To dilder means to walk around aimlessly and slowly. Oh, yeah. I think it's a nice word that we

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:37.440
 can all take to just dildering around. And my favourite one is beer. The word beer means to complain

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:44.400
 on moan, which means it also means to wine. So the word beer means wine. Oh, that's very nice.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:53.760
 Extremely confusing in the plepro pubs I'm sure they have. So grizzly bears can do one thing that I

00:19:53.760 --> 00:20:00.240
 can't do. And that is user comb. They have been found using the comb using a comb, the only other

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:08.320
 species other than humans to do so. Cool. This was. They have bad peddlers going round their dens.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:16.960
 This was in the Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska. And they, there was someone called Volkadeca

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:24.480
 from the University of St. Andrews. And Volk have found this grizzly bear picking up a rock

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:30.160
 from the water, looking at it, sort of turning it over, putting it back, picking another one up,

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.920
 looking at that one. And then with that sort of combing his fur with it around his muzzle. And then

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.920
 he would put it down and he would pick it up and do it again. And then Volkadeca went to have a look at

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:45.040
 these rocks and found that they had barnacles on them and worked out that what the bear was doing

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.440
 was looking for the right one. And the fact that he picked up the first one and then threw it away

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.800
 again means that he can discriminate between what's a good comb and what's a bad comb, which basically

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.680
 shows that he understands the fact that it's a tool. That's so cool. Isn't that amazing? I don't

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:05.760
 think of any rocks as being a good comb. Do they have, do they have sort of prongs on them? Well,

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:13.040
 they have barnacles on them. Yeah, okay, no, that does. Yeah, it'll do the job. You're a bear, you don't

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:18.480
 care. Yeah. Well, you've got a meeting to be smart at or something. It is legal to eat a dog.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:24.160
 Yes. If it's not in all countries. True. But in this country, in the UK and in the USA, in 44

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.160
 states of the USA and here. You probably can't sell dog meat, can you? You can't sell it. But if

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:34.560
 it's your dog and you kill it humanely, you can do it. Yeah. People often associate South Korea

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:40.080
 don't they with eating dogs. And it is, there are no legal consequences for selling dog meat in

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:49.440
 South Korea, although it's officially classified as detestable. A lot of my behaviour is not illegal,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:58.000
 but it is clearly detestable. There was a survey of Worldwide Spur Banks to see how common

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.120
 various different traits are. And so, statistically, if you get sperm from a sperm bank,

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:08.000
 your donor is most likely to be a Christian accountant with brown hair, brown eyes and white skin.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:16.640
 And it's least likely to be a dark skinned jinjabadist. Not likely to be a 19-foot tall drawing.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:22.000
 So it's least likely to be a dark skinned jinjabadist with black eyes.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:33.680
 And they're very easy to sex, ohms, yeah, because they have translucent skin, so you can see the

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:39.920
 genitals through their skin. Wow. That's what just an aerial view you can see right through to the

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.880
 yeah, that's so great. Amazing. But they do, and the skin, this is so weird, so they're blind,

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.360
 which is, or they're nearly blind, which makes sense because they live in very, very dark

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.680
 case most of the time. But for the first four months, they do have eyes, and for the first four

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:59.040
 months of their life, their eyes are out on the outside, and then gradually skin grows over their eyes,

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.720
 meaning that they find it quite difficult to see. But thankfully, they can detect light with their

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:10.160
 skin, so it's kind of a happy story. Yeah, yeah. It's weird though, isn't it, to have functioning eyes

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.720
 that just get that they're overgrown? Yeah, they're overgrown by the thing that can also see.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.960
 Yeah, it's weird. It's not. What's the point? Yeah. Oh, I'll just say.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.280
 Well, there is no point James. Well, let's not look at this from the religious perspective.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:33.600
 Stop the podcast. Stop the podcast. Hi, everyone. We'd like to let you know that we are not sponsored

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:39.680
 by anyone, but we are asking you to donate to the care workers charity. Yes, so the care workers

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:45.520
 charity is a charity that exists to support care workers who are having a hell of a time right now,

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:52.080
 as you can imagine. So either very low paid anyway, over 43% of care workers are paid below the real

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.400
 living wage. And at the moment with COVID, a lot of them are having to take a lot of time off work

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.600
 and losing even that wage. And so the care workers charity is setting up a fund where they're giving

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.320
 grants to people who are really suffering. Yes, lots of care workers have lost their income as a

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.360
 result of the crisis. There are so many care workers in the UK, two million of them, and many of

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.960
 those guys are on a low income. So anything that can be done to alleviate that pressure at this time

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.600
 is greatly appreciated. That's right. The care workers there at the absolute front of the

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.400
 coronavirus crisis at the moment, they're looking after the most vulnerable and most susceptible

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.040
 people in society. And if there's anything you could do to help, we would really, really appreciate it.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:37.440
 And the thing that you can do specifically to help is you can go to qi.com/donate or just giving

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:44.000
 .com/nstaf, and you'll find the page where you can give money to this fantastic charity

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.080
 in exchange for listening to our weirdo facts. That's the deal. Is that a fair deal?

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.560
 Okay, on with the weirdo facts.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:25:01.920
 And another thing that you could get dotted art was HP sauce. That was originally only sold

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.640
 dotted art. No, if you wanted HP sauce in 1905, the only way you could get it was from a

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.840
 darts darts houseman. It was invented by Edwin Sanson Moore who had a darts darts darts vinegar

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:16.000
 and pickle company. So you just had to wait. You just had to wait. If the darts darts

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.200
 all guy came around yesterday and he suddenly needs it, it's like, you won't be back for another

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.120
 three months. If you make a big sandwich, you better make it at the right time. Did he,

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.600
 I just, that sounds terrifying. The HP sauce man coming down the street with his,

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.440
 did he have a like a backpack full of HP sauce? He just squirt it into your home.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.960
 What do you mean like a milkman does today? Why is that where your brain went with that?

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.880
 I don't understand. I'm just picturing him in a costume, which is the bottle of HP sauce.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.800
 And then he sort of leans his head forward and squeezes his slides into your house.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:56.800
 Disgusting. Disgusting. No, he didn't do that. No, you thought you were peddling license

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:05.520
 remote. You know how you're saying that 11 can mean like a bad car. You know the limon rally.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:13.440
 Yes. Have you heard of the lemon? No. So this is a real thing. It's in America.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:20.080
 And the rules are that you have to drive a car that is valued at less than $500. So you have to

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:26.160
 drive a really terrible car. And before you turn up, they look at all the cars and they put you into

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:32.480
 three categories. Either shit car, really shit car, or probably not going to finish the race car.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.360
 And the price is a better for the worst cars. So you get more dollars if you're driving a really,

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:44.480
 really shit car. And the way that they work it out that you can't cheat is because at the end of

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:51.280
 the race, according to the rules, they're allowed to purchase any vehicle for $500. So if you turn

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:57.200
 up with a Bugatti or something, then they by law have to be able to buy it off you for $500. That's

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.320
 price in their history. They've looked at it and gone, you know what, that's worth more than $500.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.120
 I want to buy it off you. That's so funny. Isn't that cool? That's great. Is that in America?

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:12.880
 In America, yeah. And there's a load of, I mean, it's a bit silly, but there's a load of rules. So

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.840
 if you kind of break some laws, you might have to get out of your car and run around the track

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.040
 singing, "I'm a little teapot." It's a bit of a silly thing, but it's kind of cool. Do you have to do

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:28.080
 the gestures as well? I think you do. You would have to. It's about on the song, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.120
 Does anyone have any more on the manchineal specifically? Well, what I can say is, so the manchineal

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:39.920
 belongs to a genus called euphobia. And there's a more famous plants that comes from that genus,

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.560
 and that is the poinsettia. So it's basically the same thing. And the Christmas thing, there's like

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:50.560
 red Christmas plants, and they're also a little bit kind of poisonous. There's a myth that they kill

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.160
 dogs, isn't there, and stuff like that, I think. They're not quite that poisonous, but they are quite

00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:00.400
 poisonous. And the reason I find this really interesting. The reason we have poinsettias at Christmas

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:07.360
 is because there was a family called the Eek family, ECKE. I don't know if that's how you pronounce it.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:14.080
 And they found a way to make the poinsettia bloom in the winter, because it's actually a summer plant.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.360
 And when they did that, they wanted to sell it, but they didn't know how to do this.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.880
 And so they sent it to loads of TV studios around Christmas time in the hope that the TV studios

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.560
 who just wanted to put something in the background will put this poinsettia in the background.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.600
 And it just so happened that this was just when color television had started. And so all the producers

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.000
 were like, well, look at this red plant. This is going to show up really well on the new color TV.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.960
 And so all of the TV shows around that time started putting poinsettias in their Christmas shows.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.320
 And then that's why today you'll might have these in your house at Christmas.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.040
 That's really cool. It's a mistletoe a bit poisonous as well.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:54.960
 Yeah. So we're just surrounding ourselves in poisons during the Christmas period.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.920
 Yeah. It's exciting. Just don't eat it. Don't eat mistletoe.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.440
 Yeah. And don't eat Holly as well. That's going to sting on the way down.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.160
 Yeah. On the way out.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.840
 Don't eat the plants. Don't eat my plant.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.400
 Okay, I get it. I get it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.000
 See the food. I actually did this once. So which thing? The miniaturization thing.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.440
 I'll explain better. At the end of university, sometimes they take a photo of all of you,

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.040
 you know, on your graduation day and your gowns and things.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.400
 Yeah. And they to get you to buy the photo of your whole year at university, they send you a tiny,

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:33.120
 like a two inch by three inch photo of your whole year at university.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.160
 And you can't really see yourself. You can't see who anyone is.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.800
 No, but it's just to encourage you to splat out on the main thing.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.800
 I just kept the miniaturization on and framed that.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.600
 Amazing.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.920
 My home. I've got a tiny photo of my whole year at university.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.960
 I can't tell where I am.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.120
 Do you have a memory of where you were on the day?

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.160
 No. I don't know. Not anymore. No, it's been too long.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.120
 So I'm in there. I'm in there though. That's the main thing.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.920
 Are you sure? Are you? It's what actually happened.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.760
 You didn't graduate and you said to your parents, oh, look, I'm in this picture.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.440
 That's me, the little blob in the car.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.440
 I'm wearing the same clothes. You really can't tell.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:15.920
 That's kind of like a caricature of some sort of de-kenzy and parsimonious, you know, stingy bastard.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.480
 Well, if you see that on the wall.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.440
 I've saved about 25 pounds by doing that. Thank you very much.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.760
 And 10 years later, when I can't see myself and my own graduation, it's worth it.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.080
 I can't ring up now and say, have you got that info?

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:35.520
 I'm willing to, I've decided I'm willing to buy it. I've made a decision.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.520
 Do you know that before they had bumper stickers?

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.000
 So bumper stickers were invented by this guy called Forest Gill.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.920
 And it was in the 50s, I think, late 50s.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.520
 But before that, drivers would have handmade placards that they tie to their cards with pieces of twine.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.200
 So if you wanted to say who you're going to vote for in the election,

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.760
 you would just get a placard and tie it to your car.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.920
 It's not cool. You just tie a bit of card to your car.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.760
 Really cool. I can't. I'm trying to figure out where you'd tie it.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.800
 Maybe onto those roof rack bars, if you've got those.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.320
 I think where your bumper is, maybe.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.360
 Yeah, it would be about this.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.200
 You would just have a small placard when you, the size of a sticker, almost.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.600
 How do you, what do you tie it around?

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.880
 The bumper.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.080
 I'm going to have to see, I forgot my card.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:23.760
 I saw this amazing tweet by this guy called Frank Paul, who's like a quizmer in the UK.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.200
 And he found this Wikipedia article about a movie called Okay Connery.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.640
 Have you heard about this?

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.120
 So this was like a spoof of James Bond made in Italy.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:40.480
 And the way it started is Neil Connery, who is Sean Connery's brother,

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.480
 was working as a plasterer in Scotland.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.120
 And he was sacked for losing his tools.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.360
 And then this got into the tab like newspaper.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.480
 This really has his all real.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.920
 Oh, I thought you meant they'd made all this up.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.320
 No, no, no, so this Neil Connery is real.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.760
 He was working as a plasterer.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.360
 He lost his tools and he got fired.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.800
 And so it was in all the newspapers that Sean Connery's brother's just been fired for losing his tools.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.000
 And when this guy who was making a movie,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.960
 almost a minute slow news day.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.840
 And then these people in Italy kind of heard about this.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.720
 And they saw him in interviews on the local news.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.800
 And he sounded just like Sean Connery.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.640
 And so they thought, why don't we make a movie with Neil Connery,

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.800
 where he's pretending to be James Bond.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.800
 And they made this movie called "Okay, Connery", which is apparently terrible.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.400
 Which is, yeah, why does it sound incredible?

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.600
 And apparently also it was filmed without any live sounds.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.400
 Neil Connery had appendicitis when they were filming it.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.920
 And it was really sick and he couldn't really speak properly.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.120
 So we got Sean in to dub it.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.920
 But we added all the voices in later in the film.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.720
 So everyone's licksinking and they added all the voices later on.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.400
 And apparently it's one of the worst films ever.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.000
 That sounds, that does sound amazing.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.160
 It's incredible.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.880
 I was looking on Reddit.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.880
 And there is a bit on Reddit called TIFU,

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.960
 which means today I fucked up.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.360
 And someone posted TIFU.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:15.760
 Today I fucked up by putting "I voted stickers on my nipples for the sake of getting in my husband's pants."

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.080
 It was painful to remove.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.400
 "Do not do this, no matter how sexy."

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:26.160
 Just goes into a load of details about how they got stuck on her nipples.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.160
 And she couldn't remove them, no matter what she did.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.480
 Oh, but it's so sexy!

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.720
 No, no matter how sexy it is, Anna, you mustn't do it.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.120
 I'm gonna do it, hurry that.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:42.240
 She said, "When I pulled on it, my nipple is stretched sideways, almost bringing me to tears."

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:42.880
 Oh gosh.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.680
 I said, weirdly, the thing I remember from a while ago, Reddit.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.760
 They've never done really any advertising,

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.360
 probably except for one thing, which is they spent $500.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.360
 And I think this is in the whole history of Reddit.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.920
 They spent $500 on promotional stickers.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.400
 Okay.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.320
 It's the only advertising they've ever done.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.640
 Okay, one put them sort of around.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.440
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.480
 Just some people's nipples.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.480
 And they're still there to this day.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.280
 So it's very well spent advertising money, actually.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.400
 If you want to get sperm from a bee, it's really difficult, right?

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.760
 Because they're quite small.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.960
 They don't make much sperm.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.080
 And presumably, if you aren't trying to force them out,

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.360
 would be it will try to sting you?

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.320
 Probably will.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.600
 Yeah, so what you do is you pick up your little drone bee,

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.080
 and then you squeeze its abdominal muscles

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.480
 to mimic a natural mating event.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.200
 Okay.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.600
 And then the pressure exposes the bee's penis.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.640
 Bee's penis.

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.640
 Bee's penis.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.440
 Yeah.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.520
 And a little speck of semen comes out.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.800
 And you have to do it loads of times,

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.280
 because obviously you need lots of semen, right?

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.160
 If you're going to use it, you don't just want one little speck

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.760
 and you need lots of specks.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.720
 But the problem is that just like in real life,

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.200
 if a drone has sex, it immediately dies.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.000
 And this is what happens to these bees as well.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.080
 They basically go to the sperm donor's bank

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.040
 and never come back.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.240
 Oh, no.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.440
 Oh, wow.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.000
 That's an even worse environment

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.680
 than the normal human donation places.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.040
 If you have to go into a room full of corpses of previous donors.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.160
 I'm sorry. So is this not what you're into?

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:22.160
 So I've read a whole thing about sort of

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.600
 toy logistics these days.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.000
 And it's a nightmare for toy shop owners

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.560
 who as soon as a craze comes in,

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.120
 they have to basically buy quick and sell quick.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.040
 And then they don't know what the next thing's going to be.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.080
 So you can't stock up.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.920
 You can't really pre-plan it.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.120
 So it's a real painful.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.800
 They have like a tie fair every year,

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.280
 don't they?

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.520
 Or they have a few of them where everyone says,

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.800
 this is going to be the next big thing.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.320
 This is going to be the next big thing.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.760
 Who knows what it's going to be.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.080
 It's like exciting, really.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:50.720
 Yeah.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.840
 But it's the opposite of what the beany baby people did.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.800
 Well, do you remember the deliberately restricted supply?

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.840
 Did that?

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.800
 Yeah.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.560
 That was our fidget spinner, really.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.440
 Wasn't it the beany baby?

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.160
 That was our phrase.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.160
 No, I was too old for that.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:04.560
 Oh, no.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.000
 You were the spinning top, obviously.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.360
 But I was the wheel of the stick.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.160
 Who used to run down those streets in Laikershire?

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.360
 Rolled it by wheel.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.160
 So they basically had loads of beany babies,

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.800
 but they said we're only going to sell this many of them

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.760
 so that they were tomorrow.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.960
 Yeah, they would risk it.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.320
 This toyship owner, she said that normally,

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.480
 toy sales reps come into your store.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.080
 And they try and sell you as they say,

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.760
 please buy as many units as you can.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.360
 The beany babies reps will come in.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.040
 And you'd say, please, I need a beany baby

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.240
 elephant to sell to my clients.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.440
 And they'd say, no.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.560
 And it was really.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.600
 Well, it was their way of, it was basically

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.720
 like the diamond cartel.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.400
 They were just driving up demand as much.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.840
 They couldn't, it really worked.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.920
 That's, that's balsy, isn't it?

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.400
 So clever.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.840
 It was the only days of kind of using technology

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.680
 to spy on these shopkeepers, basically,

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.280
 because the beany baby makers

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.560
 would keep exact records of precisely what beany babies

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.040
 they'd been selling and how well they'd been doing it.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.440
 And they would confiscate various beany babies

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.040
 from if they weren't doing it very well.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.280
 And they wouldn't let big shops like Toys or Us

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.360
 or Walmart stock them, because they didn't want to

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.960
 invalidate the brand.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.560
 And it sounded bizarre.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.160
 And the only way that you could get them

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.040
 was to call a sales rep and then have a conversation

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.200
 with the sales rep and sort of reveal secrets

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.280
 about what the kids in your shop were saying

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.640
 about what beany babies they liked.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.280
 Wow.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.280
 So they could get the inside scoop.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.240
 Wow.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.640
 It's no wonder you millennials are self-fucked up.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:38.240
 There was a 1904 carousel up for auction.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.600
 Very beautiful.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.720
 There was a park in Cleethorpe's selling it.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.320
 Pleasure Island, it was called.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.240
 And there were no bids.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.480
 And the reserve price was £180,000.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.160
 Because obviously it's a huge, you know,

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.080
 complicated, beautiful bit of machinery.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.920
 And then just before bidding clothes,

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.240
 there was one bid for £180,000.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.840
 And it was sold.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.280
 And the owners must have thought,

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.160
 "Oh, thank goodness we've managed to sell this carousel."

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.960
 And it turns out it was from a Lincoln Sherman

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.200
 who had been trying to close the window

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.720
 and accidentally pressed bid.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:16.480
 And he had legally bought it.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:21.680
 He was in the hole with fees for £245,000.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.560
 Oh no.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.120
 Is there no safety net for that kind?

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.400
 Well, as they pointed out,

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.320
 the bid button is in the middle of the screen,

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.320
 not the top corner where they hadn't put bid next to the X

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.080
 or anything like that.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.000
 Eventually, they let him off the hook

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.880
 and they did not force him to spend his entire life

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.440
 savings on a carousel.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.560
 I think that's fair enough.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.760
 Given that I get, you know,

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.160
 if I'm on the most irrelevant website and tried to leave it,

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.880
 it'll say, "Are you sure you want to leave this site?"

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.360
 I think in the very least, they should have that box pop up.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.560
 Yeah, are you sure you want to spend

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.720
 a quarter million pounds on the carousel?

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.200
 Actually, no.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.000
 So funny.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.840
 I was trying to find out how you fit

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.360
 that many clowns in a car.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.040
 It turns out it's very simple.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.760
 You just get a car and you remove everything.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.200
 Literally everything from it.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:14.000
 You know, seats and what else is in a car?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.880
 Ashtray.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.680
 The steering wheel.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.400
 Ashtray.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.600
 I think you keep the steering wheel.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.800
 You keep one or two things.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.800
 But then, the record,

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.800
 and you have to fortify the springs as well

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.800
 because it's normally a reasonably small car

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.920
 for comedy purposes.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.600
 And the record for the number of clowns in a car

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.880
 is 31 in a Citroen 2CV,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.080
 which is quite a small car.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.360
 Yeah, that is not socially distancing.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.320
 No.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.440
 It's the opposite.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:39.840
 No.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.680
 Were they children?

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.880
 Or were they?

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.840
 No, they were.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.160
 They were, I believe, human adult clowns.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.080
 It feels like that's too many.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.960
 As in, if I had to guess how many clowns

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.560
 you could get in a Citroen,

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.160
 I would have gone way under.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.120
 Like way, way, way under.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.520
 But that's, well, I think that's why it's a world record.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.320
 I think...

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.840
 No, I do see that, but it's...

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.160
 I would have thought that the world record

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.440
 would be just a little bit more

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.640
 than I could possibly imagine.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.880
 But this is a lot more than I could possibly imagine.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.840
 Freethin clowns.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.400
 Yeah.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.640
 Have you guys heard of the Great Corn Cobb fire?

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.240
 No.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.600
 Of 1958.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.440
 Oh, the 1950s, oh no.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.640
 Yeah, of course.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.440
 Yeah.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.200
 Okay, this was in Memphis, Tennessee.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.280
 And the Quakers, Quakers, Quaker Oats, the firm,

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.920
 they used corn cobs at the time to get a particular chemical.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.000
 And they had a stockpile at their plant

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.200
 of 70,000 tons of corn cobs, okay?

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.000
 Wow.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.800
 Imagine the size of that.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.920
 It was six stories high.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.040
 And some people noticed in 1958,

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.880
 oh, the pile of corn cobs is really smoldering a lot.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.000
 And it burst and deflamed.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 It spontaneously combusted because the heat

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.840
 had been generated inside it.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.200
 And even so, this huge massive corn cob fire,

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.120
 and even worse, as it burned,

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.680
 it formed a kind of shell over its surface.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.640
 It kind of crusted over with this chemical,

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.360
 which could not, which reflected the water back

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.960
 onto the firefighters, basically.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:09.040
 They had to use bulldozers to crash into this massive pile,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.040
 but just to inject the water

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.800
 through this weird surface that it formed.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.000
 Surringe it through.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.200
 Basically, yeah.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:15.920
 I know.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.440
 I want to see the TV show Chernobyl.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.480
 Very good show.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.240
 I want to see the sequel, which is about this,

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.440
 because it seems like it's almost as exciting, right?

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:25.920
 Cornobyl.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.440
 Corn cobble.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.480
 Corn cobble.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.360
 Corn cobble.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.080
 There you go.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.920
 It's good that you showed us your working for that joke.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.400
 Yeah.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.680
 Thanks.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.160
 I have a historical use of Lufa's,

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.560
 which may have changed the course of the Second World War.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.360
 Wow.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.160
 So, a Lufa was used in the Second World War

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.880
 to convince Churchill of a point, okay?

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.520
 So, he was in a boat in 1943.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.480
 He was sailing to America to discuss war strategy

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.840
 with President Roosevelt, right?

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.000
 And this was in the planning of D-Day,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.240
 and there was one thing they used in D-Day,

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.920
 which were called these mulberry harbors.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.320
 And they basically were large floating platforms

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.920
 that were slightly out at sea.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.760
 And if you had those out at sea,

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.320
 then in, you know, closer to shore,

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.520
 the waters would become.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.360
 So that was incredibly useful for landing troops,

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.320
 because it means you don't have to have

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.720
 choppy waters while you're trying to get troops on shore.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.880
 So, Churchill was in the bath on this ship in the Atlantic,

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.760
 and his scientific advisor, Professor John Bernal,

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.920
 was trying to teach him about these mulberry harbors,

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.560
 and he used a Lufa as an example.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.720
 He put some paper boats in Churchill's bath

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.520
 with Churchill in it, and then he stirred the water around,

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.880
 and he used a Lufa to say, "Look,

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.880
 this is, if we had a giant Lufa,

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.560
 this is how we protect our ships."

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.840
 And that was how the Lufa helped to win the war, basically.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.240
 Wow.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.920
 And that's why at D-Day,

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.760
 they also had those massive rubber ducks

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.040
 on either side of it as well.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.040
 (laughter)

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.560
 But I would hope as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.160
 we could have a bath in peace.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.680
 That people will come in and meet you.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.080
 No, Churchill was famous for it, wasn't he?

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:02.560
 Yeah.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.600
 Yeah.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.600
 It's interesting, because now, I think it would be,

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.920
 and like now, it's a charming eccentricity

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.760
 to look back on Churchill having a bath

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.440
 and having scientific advice on the bath.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.600
 But if we heard that Boris Johnson or Donald Trump

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.640
 by having meetings in the bath.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.480
 We would be completely unsurprised.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.800
 (laughter)

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.040
 You know drafts.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.400
 Yes.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.960
 Yeah, drafts, it turns out, has been solved.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.480
 Okay.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.080
 There is now, there is now a,

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.680
 there is now no point in playing draft

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.080
 because there is a correct way to play it.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:32.640
 Oh, no.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.440
 And this was worked out by a computer games expert

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.840
 called Jonathan Schaeffer, the University of Alberta.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:43.360
 He set a number of computers playing it.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.880
 At the peak of his work,

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.960
 there were 200 desktop computers,

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.880
 which he had playing drafts full-time

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.480
 to work out the combinations.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.120
 (laughter)

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.000
 Out of play.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:52.800
 Wow.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.520
 Imagine how annoying that would be

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.800
 if you were trying to get a computer

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.000
 at the University of Alberta.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.040
 (laughter)

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.680
 All of Jonathan's 200 machines were playing drafts.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.240
 (laughter)

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.160
 And it's not like you save your lives, is it?

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.280
 Well, you know, when he explains it

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.480
 why you can't use it.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.120
 (laughter)

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.640
 You're trying to solve drafts.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.320
 (laughter)

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.800
 But it turns out that there are 10 to the 20,

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.920
 sorry, there are 10 to the power

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.640
 of 20 different positions for the game.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.480
 Okay.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.520
 And even if there are fewer than 10 pieces

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.320
 on the board at the end,

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.360
 there are still 39 trillion end-game positions

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.560
 which are possible.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.800
 So there's quite a lot of numbers to craft.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.200
 So you say that it's solved, Andy,

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.120
 but unless you and I are playing

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.440
 and we both have 50 computers

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.960
 telling us what to do each time

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.040
 and we're willing to wait for about six hours

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.880
 between each move, then presumably.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.560
 (laughter)

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.000
 That's how I play all my games.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.120
 It's the game's oppression.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.760
 (laughter)

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.760
 Ewigs do have this really unfortunate,

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.880
 not predator, parasite, really,

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.240
 that I was reading about.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.720
 And it's the, I found this out

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.000
 because there's a guy called Ryan Herbison

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.960
 who's a researcher who collected 1,300 earwigs

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.760
 to investigate it, which I think it must be so weird.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.920
 He was just wandering along a beach collecting earwigs

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.640
 and he's looking out for these things called murmithids

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.160
 and they're just one of those parasites

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.360
 that takes over your brain.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.640
 We've talked about this kind of thing before,

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.480
 but I always find them incredible.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.880
 So he collected all these earwigs,

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.400
 opened up their brains and found murmithids inside lots of them.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.040
 And what they do is they make them hydro-taxic,

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.440
 as in they make them want to go to water,

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.120
 they want to go to get wet,

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.120
 or they make them act really erratically

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.400
 so they hop around until they see a pond and then jump in it.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.200
 And they can't swim, so they immediately drown.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.640
 And then that's perfect

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.840
 because these parasites' little babies are aquatic

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.440
 and so then they can swim.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.240
 Oh no.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.080
 They turn them into water lovers.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.520
 I just, I just find it amazing

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.680
 that these things exist that control the minds

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.880
 with so many animals.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.000
 Yeah.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.800
 Yeah, that's wicked.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.000
 They also do this really cool thing

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.720
 where they can stop predators

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.680
 from getting a taste for them and their family

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.920
 by once they're, when they're being eaten,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.920
 let's say, by a lizard.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.760
 They vomit inside them as they're being eaten.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.400
 So they vomit inside the lizard into the lizard's mouth

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.760
 and they release a smell which is like rotting flesh,

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.000
 which the lizard hates

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.320
 because I usually, when I think of animals,

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.360
 I just think they don't care about the taste of things, right?

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.360
 They just, it's about food.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.880
 It's all yucky.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.640
 Like, they don't have taste buds.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.600
 But apparently they don't have taste.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.440
 A whole series of weird revelations

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.920
 there about your preconceptions, but sure.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.880
 Why do you think a lizard would just eat whatever, right?

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.560
 But this will actively,

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.160
 once they release this vile-smelling toxic

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.000
 into the mouth of the lizard,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.080
 the lizard will not only spit them out,

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.600
 but it will spend time after it's going,

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.760
 and try to wipe away this thing from their mouth.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.840
 And the idea is that I'm not sure

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.600
 if the earwig will survive the one that's been chewed,

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.240
 or if that's, I think, it's more about passing on

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.520
 the distaste to never want to eat an earwig again

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.480
 for the future lizards, or that one lizard.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.880
 So sacrificing yourself for the sake of the clan,

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.160
 like Bruce Willis and Armageddon?

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.360
 Yes, exactly.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.320
 Yeah, it's a lot.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.040
 Oh, Anna, stop spoiling films for James.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:15.840
 I'm sorry.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.000
 Don't listen, James.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.880
 I wasn't, I wasn't.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.480
 That's, wow, that is amazing.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.360
 Do you know, Dan, you live with a dog at the moment?

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.040
 No, I'm not anymore.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:27.760
 Oh, really?

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.520
 Because I was going to say, when you give it dog food,

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.080
 do you just think, fuck it, eat any old shit?

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.200
 Doesn't have any taste buds.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.240
 I was thinking more like lizards, rather than,

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.840
 I don't think, like, when I feed my son,

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.520
 I think, hey, he's young, fuck it, he hasn't got taste buds yet.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.880
 It's more. He's got more.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.720
 Dan, he's got three times as many as you.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.040
 Well, I'll stop feeding him dog food now.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:50.880
 Hey, just while we're talking about Spain,

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.960
 Spain obviously has that big Christmas lottery,

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.680
 which is El Gordo, the fat one.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.440
 And it's the big, big prize.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.000
 Did you guys read that in 2011?

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.120
 It was won.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.280
 And it's, you know, people win it.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.080
 But this one town in Spain, called Sadeto,

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.800
 every single resident there,

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.600
 the 70 households won this lottery.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.560
 And the thing is, is that the way they do it is,

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.320
 sometimes these towns club together,

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.800
 and they buy this big, they buy the one lottery ticket.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.960
 And then they go around to each house,

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.280
 and they say, do you want to be a participant in this?

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.800
 So you get a participation ticket.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.000
 So this entire town did it of 70 households,

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.600
 which was over 200 people.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.960
 They all won the lottery except one guy,

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.360
 because they forgot to knock on his door.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.560
 Oh, wow.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.080
 Surely they shared it within.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.680
 They didn't, no, they didn't.

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.240
 And he, he had moved to the town,

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.600
 because he was in love with this girl.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.160
 It didn't work out, so he decided to stay.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.560
 So he was renovating in this new place,

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.040
 and the people who went around selling the tickets

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.920
 just didn't think to go and sell him a ticket.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.600
 So he remembers waking up on the day,

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.880
 and he's a cinematographer.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.880
 He does a lot of filming.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.880
 And everyone was on the streets running around.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.760
 He had no idea why.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.920
 They were in their socks running out of their face,

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.360
 because they'd all just heard the news.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.320
 And he filmed it all.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:09.360
 He filmed the joy, but behind that camera is the one man

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.080
 who didn't get any of the benefits from it.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.120
 That is fun.

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.720
 And they want a huge amount.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.960
 Like if you paid in lower amounts,

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.160
 the least that was earned by someone

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:23.840
 who got some money was around $100,000.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.840
 That was like the lowest on it.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:29.360
 So as a result, once the news came out,

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:33.280
 all of these business people descended on the town,

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.720
 trying to sell them B&W cars, business managers came in,

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.200
 and the whole town now, there's people on the way home

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.280
 having to hide as they leave the cafe,

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.840
 because they can see that really persistent bank manager

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.280
 sitting on his car looking from more residents to sign up.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.360
 So it's kind of turned into a hellhole for a lot of them.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.200
 So really, the one guy who didn't win

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.720
 is laughing at everyone else's faces,

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.640
 because he can just say to those hastlers,

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.160
 "Mate, I'm the one that didn't win it.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.040
 I've got nothing for you."

00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:00.480
 Just one more thing on hangovers.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.560
 I found a survey.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.440
 By, I think it was a rehab website,

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.520
 about, it was a survey of 1,000 drinkers

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.680
 about what they would do to avoid a hangover.

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.360
 Like, what sacrifices they would make

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.040
 to never have a hangover again.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:13.520
 Okay.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.080
 So I just want to run these party and see if you'd agree.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.200
 So a third of people said they would pay more for their drinks

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.640
 if it meant they would never have a hangover.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.400
 Yeah? Okay.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:22.960
 Yeah. Okay.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.160
 Depends on much more, but yeah.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:24.960
 If you can afford it.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:30.240
 Um, about a third said they would give up watching sports forever.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.400
 Oh gosh. No.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.440
 I'm finding the last few weeks quite hard.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.520
 So, um, probably wouldn't do that.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.000
 Okay.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.360
 It was, it was way more women than men

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.520
 said they would give up watching sports forever.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.840
 Um, they, so 2% of women said they would give up sex

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.040
 for the rest of their lives.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.440
 Um, 0% of men said they would give up sex forever

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.160
 to avoid a hangover.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.680
 Yeah, I understand that.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.040
 Some of them get a bit dark.

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.840
 So, um, sacrificing a stranger's life,

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.680
 um, 9% of men said yes, 9%.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:09.520
 Giving up a fingertip, 6% of men, 3% of women,

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.600
 allegedly, 6% of men,

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:15.280
 and 1% of women would kill their pets to avoid hangovers.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.080
 For the rest of your life.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.000
 If you've got pet crickets or something,

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.920
 then that actually is not so bad.

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.440
 Yeah.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.880
 I wouldn't give up crickets,

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.480
 but I would give up crickets.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.280
 Hey!

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:29.040
 Do you guys know the first reference to Hair of the Dog?

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.080
 That's really surprised by this.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.400
 No, um, the Bible.

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.160
 It's such an even pre-bible.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.440
 It's 400 BC.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.800
 And it's in a, um,

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.680
 recommendation by guy called Antiphanies,

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.240
 who was recommending basically homiopathic treatments,

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.840
 which is sort of what Hair of the Dog is.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.240
 It's sort of like a little bit of the thing that makes you ill.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.120
 Um, and he says take the hair,

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.920
 so this is translated from the Greek and made nice and poetic,

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.120
 but take the hair, it is well written of the Dog,

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.960
 by which your bitten, work off one wine with his brother,

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.480
 work off one labour with another.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.360
 Hmm.

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.680
 It works to an extent, actually, Hair of the Dog.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.200
 First of all, it obviously makes you feel better,

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.640
 because you're getting a bit drunk again,

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.480
 so we all know that kind of works.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.000
 But they think now it works,

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.080
 because there's something we've discussed before.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.320
 Dan, do you remember that fact you had where they cured that guy

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.160
 of alcohol poisoning by feeding him beer?

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:18.960
 Yeah, that's right.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.360
 And it's because of the methanol.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.560
 So all alcoholic drinks contain tiny amounts of methanol,

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.400
 and they think that might be a large part of what's making you feel bad with a hangover.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.600
 And if you drink more alcohol, then the ethanol in that,

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.880
 actually, is digested before the methanol,

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.640
 so the methanol stops making you feel bad.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.240
 So keep it up.

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:41.440
 Okay, so what was said?

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.600
 Is that our official advice?

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:48.720
 That's, um, yeah, please don't sue me when you get live a failure.

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:52.800
 I was looking up with some other museums in Croatia.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.480
 We've spoken before, I think, about the Museum of Broken Relationships.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.360
 That's quite a famous one, but I'd never seen this one.

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.400
 It's called Froggyland, and it's in Split.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.240
 And this is a collection of 507 stuffed frogs

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:14.000
 that were made by a very, very skilled taxidermist from Croatia called Ference Mere.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:20.240
 And he used a very clever system where he goes through the animal's mouth

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.000
 rather than cutting it open.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.920
 So you don't end up with any scars on the taxidermy animal.

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:31.360
 And then he got the frogs and he put them in sort of like settings.

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:35.760
 So, um, there's one in a blacksmith's shop, there's one in a carpenter's shop,

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.960
 there's one in a school, there's some in the circus,

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:43.280
 like lots of different modes of life just recreated with stuff.

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.360
 Frogs, so cool, wow.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.440
 It's funny because it feels like he might also be a candidate for the Museum of Broken Relationships.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:49.920
 To use.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:58.960
 But yeah, Froggyland, it gets 4.5 stars on TripAdvisor,

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.680
 lots of reviews, lots of good reviews.

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.200
 I only read the bad ones, of course.

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:07.200
 The frogs were very small and not very appealing.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:13.200
 Another person, this place is an abomination for frog lovers.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.320
 Don't go here.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.120
 If you love frogs like me, I love frogs.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.640
 You should have seen that coming, surely if you're a frog lover,

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.280
 going to a place full of dead frogs is what you're going to like.

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:28.400
 And another person said, okay, okay.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.280
 This guy gave a lot of time and effort to make these frogs.

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.240
 But still, it is weird and creepy.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.440
 Yeah.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:39.360
 But then the people who made the Museum replied with Anna's exact point.

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:44.320
 We don't understand why someone who has that kind of opinion would even decide to come in here.

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.160
 It's like you're doing it deliberately so you can complain, guys.

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.360
 We're not like dead frogs.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.960
 Don't go to the dead frogs Museum.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.560
 Anyway, it's in split.

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:59.040
 Do you think someone tested the temperature

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.840
 of Cleopatra's milk bath by dipping their elbow into it?

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:10.400
 Now, that is a joke about how you test the temperature of a baby's milk, isn't it?

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.280
 Oh no, it's how you test a baby's bath water, sorry.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.560
 How do you test the milk, though?

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.920
 Um, it's hard to get your elbow into the bottle, isn't it?

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.680
 Yeah, do you have it yourself?

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.120
 You try.

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.480
 I think you drip little bits from the bottle on the back of your hand, don't you?

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:24.960
 Like, maybe.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.800
 I think you just, simply, you just trust that the milk you're producing from your breasts

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.280
 is not by the boiling hot and freezing hot.

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:36.080
 That's, yeah.

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:39.600
 I mean, some mothers are like Yellowstone National Park, aren't they?

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.320
 There we go.

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.560
 120 degrees.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.280
 Can't be very damaging.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:54.000
 They had a sacred blades, which, and this is a slight content warning here, sacred obsidian blades,

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.280
 which the kings would use to cut their penises with.

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.320
 Oh, yeah, okay.

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.880
 Yeah, it's not, it's not so they could bleed them.

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.320
 Yeah, what were they doing?

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.880
 Which bet they cut, they're not cutting the whole thing off, are they?

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.920
 Not, they weren't cutting the whole thing off, great news, but they were cutting,

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.600
 I mean, it's all sensitive.

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.400
 It's all sensitive.

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.520
 No, they were just sort of, well, they did a bit on, on their full skins, yeah,

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.120
 but a bit on other parts of it.

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:19.760
 You know, the Victorians had special, like, mini sods that they used to cut a corn off

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.560
 corn on the cubs.

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.560
 It just doesn't matter.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:23.760
 I don't know what maybe you think of that.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:29.120
 And I think it was bleeding, wasn't it?

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.680
 As in, they used to sacrifice their blood.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:36.000
 So this is a ritual thing that they had to do is they would have to cut their tongues and ears

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.360
 and genitals and stuff.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.160
 And then pull us a blood out of them to give to the gods.

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.040
 I think I got that, yeah.

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:46.720
 They'd leave the blade somewhere, and so researchers have found a load of these obsidian blades,

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.440
 and it's very hard to tell which of the blades there were sacrificial, because as they put it,

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:56.320
 the degree of where imposed on a blade used only on one occasion to slice open a penis

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.200
 is very little indeed.

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.160
 The knife is much less damaged.

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:07.280
 So the researchers, again, had to have a go at this and they studied multiple blades.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.240
 Well, no, the scientists didn't cut their own cubs.

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.600
 They tried it on some chicken instead.

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.120
 They tried it on the people's cocks.

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.560
 And they studied multiple blades.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.280
 And they think that has given them a sign of which blades we use.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:26.080
 That's really interesting, because like exactly what you're saying, the way you work out

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.520
 how a blade was used is by looking at the dense in it, don't you?

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:32.320
 Like, and there was a research study about some Bronze Age swords,

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:35.840
 about whether they were purely decorative or whether they used in fighting,

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.480
 and they can tell by how they hit each other and how they dent.

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:43.680
 But if you're only using it for one after one thing of a penis and yeah,

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:44.960
 you're not going to get that information.

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:49.360
 Yeah, the wear and tear on the penis is definitely more, isn't it?

00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:51.040
 Yes.

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.200
 Down the knife.

00:57:53.200 --> 00:58:02.000
 Just to go back to their gods, some other fun gods, they were quite interflatulant and smelling.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.080
 Well, sorry, and this is a terrible joke that I'm just about to make.

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:15.200
 And see if we can put it in, but you say that the damage on the penis is worse.

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.480
 But then, of course, the penis might be other than the sword.

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.400
 Oh, wow.

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.240
 Oh, wow.

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.040
 That was so glad.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.360
 Was it so glad that it's wrong to you for that.

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.720
 I'm glad you got that.

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.680
 Definitely worth it.

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:31.440
 It's going in, isn't it?

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.720
 It's going in.

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.840
 I can't wait to hear it.

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.040
 We've got our end of section now, so sorry to look here when you got to say it.

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:46.240
 Okay, that's it.

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.680
 That's all of our facts.

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.760
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.120
 What does Dan usually say here?

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.520
 Oh, it doesn't matter because it's not a normal show.

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:58.160
 All we want to do is remind you that to give some money to the care workers' charity,

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.800
 they would really, really appreciate it if you could spare anything and so would we.

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:12.160
 And to donate, go to qi.com/donate or justgiving.com/nstaf.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.360
 Off with the show.

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.400
 I've always wanted to say that.

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.520
 I've never had a chance before.

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.960
 It feels like I can now dance away.

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.280
 Wow.

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.760
 If that doesn't make you want to donate to this charity, I don't know what will.

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:31.760
