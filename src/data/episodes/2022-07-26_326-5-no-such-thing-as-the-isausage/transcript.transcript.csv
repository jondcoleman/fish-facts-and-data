00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's bonus compilation episode of no such thing as a fish,"
00:00:06,00:00:11,some of the best bits that I couldn't quite fit in the edit of all the shows that we've done
00:00:11,00:00:16,"over the last three or four months. Yes, this is an extra special treat for all of you,"
00:00:16,00:00:21,"because you've listened so loyally for so long, you're getting this episode and you're getting it"
00:00:21,00:00:28,with no adverts. We're not going to ask you to order home delivered meals or delicious international
00:00:28,00:00:34,"beer or clothes perfectly sculpted to your figure. Anna, this is now an advert at the sticker."
00:00:34,00:00:38,"It's so cool, I've done it to an advert, I can't help it. Well, there is one thing we are actually"
00:00:38,00:00:43,going to ask people to do because this boneless episode comes with one little tiny string attached
00:00:43,00:00:48,to it and that's that it is for charity. This is raising money. This episode for a charity called
00:00:48,00:00:52,"the Care Workers Charity. We'll be telling you a bit more about them in a bit, but it's a fantastic"
00:00:52,00:00:57,and very worthy cause. And so your listening is being co-opted in the name of that course.
00:00:57,00:01:02,That's right. This episode is absolutely free. It is completely free. You don't have to donate if
00:01:02,00:01:06,"you don't want to, but if you do have a few quid to spare, we would really, really appreciate it."
00:01:06,00:01:10,"Just to stress how really important it is that we're all giving money to charity at the moment,"
00:01:10,00:01:17,it's obviously a time when a lot of charities need huge amounts of money because of COVID and it's
00:01:17,00:01:20,coinciding with the time where people are not giving money to charity. So the charity sector has
00:01:20,00:01:25,lost billions and billions of pounds over the last few months because of COVID because people are
00:01:25,00:01:30,just really struggling and so there's no more vital time to be able to donate any money that you can
00:01:30,00:01:40,spare. All you have to do is go to qi.com/donate or just giving.com/nstaf and either one will take you
00:01:40,00:01:58,"to the place you need. Okay, I'm with a podcast."
00:01:58,00:02:06,"Sorry, just on ancient sausages. I was looking at who invented the hotdog, which is quite"
00:02:06,00:02:12,"hard to find, but I found where the first sausages were supposedly invented. This is an article"
00:02:12,00:02:19,from BBC History and they said that the Emperor Nero had a cook called Gayas and in Roman times you
00:02:19,00:02:24,"would starve your pigs for one week before you slaughter them, but Gayas was watching over his"
00:02:24,00:02:29,kitchen and realised that one of his pigs had not been properly cleaned. So he stuck a knife into
00:02:29,00:02:34,"the belly of the pig to see if the roast was edible and out popped an intestine. Okay, and because"
00:02:34,00:02:41,"the pig had been starved, it had puffed up because of the heat and Gayas explained, ""I have discovered"
00:02:41,00:02:48,"something of great importance."" And it was the sausage. Well, cool. It's a great story. Don't believe"
00:02:48,00:02:56,"that story. Well, no, it's history. BBC History. BBC History, mate. Well, no, it's an account."
00:02:56,00:03:03,"Well, who made up the account? I think it's, I don't know who wrote it,"
00:03:03,00:03:06,"who wrote about Nero Day of Casio, someone like that. Oh, yeah, maybe, probably."
00:03:06,00:03:10,"Wow. Yeah. So that was, because they had, they did have sausages, didn't they?"
00:03:10,00:03:14,"They did have sausages in Romans, yeah. Yeah. Who used to think it hasn't come from this great"
00:03:14,00:03:18,"discovery of great importance? And when you do discover something like that, you're"
00:03:18,00:03:21,going to write about it. It seems weird to us these days. Why would you write about the first
00:03:21,00:03:27,"sausage? Back then, that's like the iPod coming out. Nero's on stage at the forum. Turtle neck,"
00:03:27,00:03:36,the eye sausage. One group who are interested in earthworms is the RG.
00:03:36,00:03:42,"The RG. You're appearing in the search group? The Brexitee... Jacob Rees Muggie group, yeah."
00:03:42,00:03:49,"No, it's the earthworm research group who work in Britain. They're one of the main groups"
00:03:49,00:03:54,"of earthworm researchers in the country. And ironically, considering they have a same name"
00:03:54,00:03:59,"as the RG Brexitees, they mostly deal with overseas projects with people like Finland,"
00:03:59,00:04:06,"France, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and Spain. Wow. So for them, Brexite is really bad. This RG, yeah."
00:04:06,00:04:14,So it's like an ERG versus ERG debate right now. I want to see that fight. Yeah. Between Jacob
00:04:14,00:04:18,Rees Muggie and this head of the earthworm research group. I'd back anyone who's on the other end
00:04:18,00:04:21,against Jacob Rees Muggie. Although he does have that cane a lot of the time.
00:04:23,00:04:31,"'Cause he's a pimp. Pimp's okay. So I don't think he carries a cane, does he?"
00:04:31,00:04:36,I'm not very keen on a Victorian master. I think I'm accidentally thinking of a caricature
00:04:36,00:04:39,"of a Victorian gentleman, because that's how people portray him, aren't I?"
00:04:39,00:04:44,"Or you're thinking of Wes Wally, who he does have a similar look to Barring the Clothes."
00:04:44,00:04:49,"There's glasses. Yeah, he has a cane. Walks around with a cane. Yeah, he does. It's a walking stick,"
00:04:49,00:04:55,"yeah. That's a cane. Yeah. Why does Wes Wally have a cane? He's walking a lot. Yeah,"
00:04:55,00:04:58,"because he has to get to all the different parts of the page. Yeah. It's a walking stick,"
00:04:58,00:05:04,"like someone up a mountain, not someone who... Oh, okay. He came from an old person, for example."
00:05:04,00:05:08,"No, no, okay. Because he's middle-aged. Oh, I don't like that. Where's Wally?"
00:05:08,00:05:12,"Young to middle-aged. I think young. I mean, I am quite old. It's a young man's game."
00:05:12,00:05:18,Wally. There was a place I read about which was called
00:05:18,00:05:24,"Loudon County. I think I'm pronouncing that right. It's an America. And supposedly, so it's in"
00:05:24,00:05:31,"Virginia, supposedly 70% of the world's online traffic passes through this one county."
00:05:31,00:05:37,"Yeah, so they have all the storage units there. And so, yeah, this was an article that I was reading."
00:05:37,00:05:41,"So it's the largest concentration, this article says, of computing power."
00:05:42,00:05:49,"And according to Greenpeace in 2017, 1% of the electricity company that runs all of the electricity"
00:05:49,00:05:56,"in this one place, only 1% of it is renewable sources. So it's incredibly unhealthy. So if we're"
00:05:56,00:06:00,"talking about online carbon footprint... If I go to this town, can I find everyone's emails?"
00:06:00,00:06:04,"Yeah, you're saying to me. But they're wishing through so fast. You need a net."
00:06:04,00:06:07,"Oh, you need a net. Yeah. Is that what the net is? Yeah, that's what the net is."
00:06:08,00:06:13,"Have you heard of eal houses? No. It's cool. There are two of these things in the UK, two only."
00:06:13,00:06:18,"And it's where you build a house over a river, and you have slew skates, which are designed to"
00:06:18,00:06:23,"trap eals. So they're built in the middle ages. And you can, and you just, you know, trap all the eals"
00:06:23,00:06:27,"as they head down the river once they feel the call. They're quite good at getting past obstacles,"
00:06:27,00:06:31,"aren't they? So, you know, you've got to build a good gate. So they're really good slithering along"
00:06:31,00:06:37,the ground. And they can climb up dams and climb over them and stuff like that. And I think people
00:06:37,00:06:42,"when eals get obstructed by slightly too big dams, if you've got like a hoover situation,"
00:06:42,00:06:47,then people have built little eal ladders. So you can knit together reeds and stuff and they can
00:06:47,00:06:52,"climb up high. That's very like snakes and ladders, isn't it, eals and ladders? Yeah. The snakes are"
00:06:52,00:07:01,"climbing the ladders. Oh my god. The game has changed. I was watching the cartoon cars the other day,"
00:07:01,00:07:06,"you know, the Pixar. Yeah. So they're NASCAR cars in cars. And one of the things is that he goes into"
00:07:06,00:07:10,"the wild and he gets lost at night because he doesn't have headlights. And I thought, okay, that's"
00:07:10,00:07:15,interesting. And I was reading into this. So NASCAR's don't have headlights for their cars. But when you
00:07:15,00:07:22,"look at them, they do, right? They're stickers. The headlights that you see on a NASCAR are stickers"
00:07:22,00:07:27,that are just put on there to look like they have real headlights. How do they light up? I don't think
00:07:27,00:07:30,"they, well, there's new technology where they do actually just have little beams that come out,"
00:07:30,00:07:34,"but they don't need. I mean, that's a headlight. No, but still the sticker. So it's still, yeah,"
00:07:34,00:07:39,it's not a functioning headlight. Why? Why do they? Because presumably the races are at daytime or
00:07:39,00:07:43,they're flood lit if they're later on in the day. So they don't need headlights to function in the race.
00:07:43,00:07:48,"Exactly. Yeah. So why do they do it? It's all to do with the manufacturers. In getting it past,"
00:07:48,00:07:53,"they need the shape of the body to have the headlights spot. So apparently, it's to do with stock,"
00:07:53,00:07:56,"but then they're not functional. So they just put stickers over the top. Because otherwise,"
00:07:56,00:08:01,"it wouldn't be identified as a car or something. Exactly. Yeah. Can I just check? In the film cars,"
00:08:01,00:08:05,"when the car goes into the wild, presumably he goes into the wild to the extent that there are"
00:08:05,00:08:11,"well-tarmac surfaces in the wild. Yes. Okay, fine. So he just stays on roads, does he? He stays on"
00:08:11,00:08:17,"roads. Yeah. No, he goes into the wild west of America. He goes off track. Yeah. But not literally"
00:08:17,00:08:22,off track. He goes literally off track in a sense of he goes on races in the sort of the dirty outback.
00:08:22,00:08:26,"Okay. But there's always a track there. No? Yeah, sometimes when he goes off the track,"
00:08:26,00:08:32,the dirty outback is a horrible phrase. Could we just vlog that? Could it probably yourself be referring to?
00:08:32,00:08:46,The world record for cycling backwards is 333 kilometres in a day. And this is done by an Australian guy
00:08:46,00:08:54,called Helinger. And he sits on top of his handlebars and faces backwards and then cycles forward. He
00:08:54,00:08:59,"cycles. The bike is going forward, but he's facing backwards. Yes. And he's sitting on his handlebars."
00:08:59,00:09:06,"Yeah. Yeah. He said, I first started riding backwards when I was a teenager to impress the girls."
00:09:06,00:09:15,"He's still single. Yeah. Ladies. He's married. He's married. Oh, great. That's so impressive. I mean,"
00:09:15,00:09:22,"where was he doing this? Was it on roads? It was on roads, yeah. Was it on the island of roads?"
00:09:24,00:09:28,"It was in Australia on roads. Okay. Because they've got a lot of, I guess, quite quiet roads."
00:09:28,00:09:33,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of long roads. Yeah. Dirty back passengers.
00:09:33,00:09:41,Do you know where you can make pie out of hot dogs and do you know the recipe?
00:09:41,00:09:45,"Do you just, do you make the pastry and then put the whole hot dog in? Do you put the bread in the"
00:09:45,00:09:49,"pastry? No, this is, I'm going to tell you the recipe and tell me when you know what joke I'm"
00:09:49,00:09:57,making. So the recipe is you drop frozen hot dogs onto a grid where the lines are further apart
00:09:57,00:10:01,"in length and the length of the hot dog. So that, you know, none of the lines are closer together"
00:10:01,00:10:06,than the length of the hot dog. I've got it. He's got it. It's James Harkin for the win.
00:10:06,00:10:10,What am I doing? It's you're working out the mathematical number pie. It's the mathematical
00:10:10,00:10:16,"number pie. If you don't want to do it the normal way, which is remembering that it's 3.14,"
00:10:16,00:10:22,"like we all know, you can, you do this. So it's really cool. So you basically toss a bunch of hot dogs,"
00:10:22,00:10:28,let's say a hundred hot dogs onto this grid and then you multiply the dog length by the number of
00:10:28,00:10:33,dogs tossed and then you times that by two. So that's on the top of the equation. Right. And then
00:10:33,00:10:39,you divide that by the distance between the lines and the number of dogs that have crossed over the
00:10:39,00:10:45,lines. Okay. And then you will get the answer to what pie is. That's how it was originally worked out
00:10:45,00:10:52,"as well, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. It was. Yeah. It was aerosophonies, wasn't it? It had a lot of hot dogs."
00:10:52,00:10:58,"Yeah. Yeah. He did. He had cholesterol issues, but he was a great mathematician. People do know why I"
00:10:58,00:11:04,"don't. I had limited time, but I still think that's really cool. Yeah. I found something at this weekend"
00:11:04,00:11:09,"that was spooky. You know, Andy Murray, the tennis player, the objectively muttial famous Andy Murray."
00:11:09,00:11:15,I found out. So I found out that he and I as children both owned hamsters called whiskey.
00:11:15,00:11:21,"Ah, really? Yeah. Really? That's an amazing fact. That is weird, isn't it? That was incredible."
00:11:21,00:11:27,"Were you playing tennis before you knew he played tennis? Well, yeah, at school. Yeah, but not like not"
00:11:27,00:11:32,"as a weekend kind of you had training and stuff. No, no, no. Okay. I'm just, that would have been a"
00:11:32,00:11:36,connection as well. You can't discount the tennis. I do play tennis. You play tennis. You play tennis.
00:11:36,00:11:40,"You play tennis. The fact that you won. God, that's a slam. The fact that you won six one does not mean"
00:11:40,00:11:44,I do not play tennis. It just means. I just think it's playing in pretty fast and loose with the word
00:11:44,00:11:54,play. Do you think there was just a hamster salesman going around? Not very good imagination for names.
00:11:54,00:12:00,"Wait, you don't, you name your own hamster. You don't have the pet shop owner name your hamster tell you"
00:12:00,00:12:04,when they sell it. We don't know that though. We don't know that he wasn't very subtly brilliant.
00:12:04,00:12:08,You didn't name whiskey hamster. I went to big Larry's hamster in Poryl and Glasgow and
00:12:08,00:12:16,in Dubai. You were told here's whiskey hamster. Of course I made it myself. Why did you call it whiskey?
00:12:16,00:12:21,"Because at that age you probably weren't drinking whiskey. Well, funny thing. No, it was because of"
00:12:21,00:12:26,"the colour. Yeah, it was whiskey coloured. Okay. Yeah, and it's not my password for anything online"
00:12:26,00:12:34,"guys, so nice try. The word alcatraz means ""ganet"" in Spanish, but when the island was named in 1775"
00:12:34,00:12:41,it actually meant pelicans. But the Spanish word for pelicans alcatraz actually came from the Arabic
00:12:41,00:12:49,"word for C. Eagle. Oh my god, I'm so confused. But basically the birdman of alcatraz is correct."
00:12:49,00:12:52,Not really because there weren't any birds there. He was the birdman of another prison. They just
00:12:52,00:12:56,gave him that name. They kept the first bit of his name when he got there. I thought he kept birds
00:12:56,00:13:00,"in alcatraz. No, he kept birds in the previous prison. They didn't have birds for him on alcatraz."
00:13:00,00:13:05,"What sounds like there are a lot of birds on alcatraz. So sorry, I'm coming to get you about this,"
00:13:05,00:13:11,"the Spanish changed the meaning of their word for pelican to mean ""ganet"". When was this law part?"
00:13:11,00:13:17,"Sometimes it wasn't a law. But it was sometimes between, I'm saying it's not a law,"
00:13:17,00:13:23,"I know it was a law, but it was sometimes between 1775 and the modern way. If you go, someone was"
00:13:23,00:13:33,"like, you know Eagle, that now refers to a magpie. There are seaweed bladders. So there are three"
00:13:33,00:13:37,"bits of a seaweed plant. There's the holdfast, which is basically the root, and then there's the"
00:13:37,00:13:42,"stipe, which is the stem, and then there are the blades. So it's very all analogous to a land plant,"
00:13:42,00:13:46,"but some of them have these air-filled bladders, and the purpose is to hold them upright"
00:13:46,00:13:50,"so they get more sunlight, which I didn't know. But the really big ones, they can get up to six"
00:13:50,00:13:56,"inches wide these bladders, which I looked it up, is as wide as a human bladder. Is it?"
00:13:56,00:14:02,Yeah. And are they looking at the potential transplants? That's a human bladder of full stretch.
00:14:02,00:14:07,Your bladder doesn't get much bigger than that. Bladders don't get bigger than this.
00:14:07,00:14:15,"When they had the first cars, they were all hand-painted, and the paint wasn't very good,"
00:14:15,00:14:20,"and so after every year all the paint will flake off your car, and so you had to take it"
00:14:20,00:14:27,back and get it repainted every single year. And it would take about 40 days to complete painting
00:14:27,00:14:34,"the whole car. 40 days. No, that is a garage ripping you out. There was because you had to paint"
00:14:34,00:14:40,"it by hand, but then you had to let it dry and do another coat, and it took ages for the cars to dry."
00:14:40,00:14:46,Wow. Isn't that amazing? Because they had electricity at this point. You could get a hairdryer
00:14:46,00:14:52,"or something, couldn't you? Yeah, I suppose you could. Well, you know when you go through a car wash,"
00:14:52,00:14:57,"they'd dry it at the end, don't they? Yeah. But you'd wash off the paint in the process again"
00:14:57,00:15:03,"to the dryer. Oh, god, that would be awful. You'd have to do all this again. That's why it took 40 days."
00:15:03,00:15:10,"On the 39th, they're like, hang on, hang on. You don't get a lot of flammery these days."
00:15:10,00:15:16,"Notice that? Yeah, flammery, the old-school jelly. So again, in the olden days, there was just a"
00:15:16,00:15:20,"greater variety of jelly. It was like apples. It was before, you know, we went mass-market. I always"
00:15:20,00:15:24,"thought it was like bulamonj flammery, is it? It is. It's bubble and mongers flammery jelly, really,"
00:15:24,00:15:31,isn't it? And so flammery was extremely popular 17th and 19th century. So it's made by apparently
00:15:31,00:15:35,"steeping oatmeal in water overnight and then boiling the strain thing you've got in the morning,"
00:15:35,00:15:41,"and you add sugar, and it eventually turns into a kind of wobbly thing. And if you're wealthy,"
00:15:41,00:15:46,you had to have a huge array of flammery molds because they'd present flammery in different shapes
00:15:46,00:15:50,"on their tables. And so, and it was really popular to have flammery disguised as proper food. So"
00:15:50,00:15:56,"flammery eggs and bacon was quite a common thing. So there are lots of, you know, molds where you'd"
00:15:56,00:16:02,look like you were about to eat eggs and bacon. Classic. And then you play Frank. And it's flammery.
00:16:02,00:16:08,"It's the best word. It's a great word, isn't it? And I wonder if that's where flammery comes from."
00:16:08,00:16:12,"You know, when you'd say some like flammery, it sort of falls flattery. I think so. It must be."
00:16:12,00:16:17,But I wonder if it comes from the fact that it's false because flammery often disguised itself
00:16:17,00:16:22,as these different delicious foods. Have you guys heard of frozen dead guy days?
00:16:22,00:16:28,"No, it doesn't sound like a thing. It's a real thing. This is an annual celebration that's held in"
00:16:28,00:16:34,"the town of Netherland, Colorado. And it's basically in 1989, this is where the story begins,"
00:16:34,00:16:40,a man passed away. He was Norwegian and his grandson brought him over to America to have him frozen.
00:16:40,00:16:44,And so they had him on ice. They brought him over. And after a few years they moved to
00:16:44,00:16:50,"Netherland and they built along with his mother, this big in their house, basically a shed that could"
00:16:50,00:16:57,just keep him going and keep him frozen. And then the son got deported. The grandson got deported
00:16:57,00:17:01,to the mum had to look after it. And the authorities saw what was going on in the house. And she
00:17:01,00:17:08,didn't have a few things like electricity and so on. It was a bit illegal. They discovered she had
00:17:08,00:17:13,"one bit of electricity for that, but not for the rest of the house. Anyway, her house... I'm just"
00:17:13,00:17:19,"going to turn the TV on. No! Okay, you can turn the TV off for a bit. But once his ankles are"
00:17:19,00:17:25,"thought out, we have to put it back on. But basically the house was in violation of local laws of"
00:17:25,00:17:30,what you need a house to be in. So she was going to be kicked out. And then they discovered that
00:17:30,00:17:35,"she was keeping her father frozen in the back. And they said, Agno, this is very illegal. So they"
00:17:35,00:17:40,"wanted to get him out. And as a result, it had a lot of Hu Ha from the community saying, no, we"
00:17:40,00:17:44,can't have him thought out. He'll die. This is... They want to keep him going. So it worked out in
00:17:44,00:17:48,their favor. And this man is still there. He's been moved to a different bit of the town. But as a
00:17:48,00:17:54,"result, they celebrate every year, Frozen Dead Guy Day. And it's a thing... The last one was in 2019"
00:17:54,00:18:00,that they had it. They have look-alike contests. They have... They have... They're being less and less
00:18:00,00:18:08,"flattering, presumably. They have... They have coffin races. And this is a thing where they build a fake"
00:18:08,00:18:12,coffin. There's an obstacle course. And they carry... It's teams of seven. And one of the seven is
00:18:12,00:18:17,in the coffin. And they have to race around. They have frozen t-shirt competitions. There's a very
00:18:17,00:18:22,"cold area this place. They have ice cream that's made specifically for it, which has crushed"
00:18:22,00:18:28,"Oreos and sour gummy worms inside. That's been a bit yummy. Bits are cool. Yeah, and it's been going on"
00:18:28,00:18:32,for all these years. So the last one was held March 8th to 10th 2019. And it looks as if they're going
00:18:32,00:18:37,"to keep going. So, when you're listening to this broadcast, you might have just missed it. Yeah,"
00:18:37,00:18:41,"exactly. Wow. I mean, do you think there's any moment where she's going to think, is this"
00:18:41,00:18:46,"slightly tasteless what I've done now? If... And obviously, it's the biggest if ever, if he wakes up"
00:18:46,00:18:52,at some point. He will be a local hero. Yeah. Imagine that day. That's going to be so exciting.
00:18:52,00:18:57,"Yeah, but he's going to wake up having passed away in Norway. Oh, he's going to wake up in Colorado"
00:18:57,00:19:04,with a language he probably doesn't speak with all these guys serving him ice creams. He's going to be
00:19:04,00:19:14,"weird. Do you want to know some Orkney language? Okay, teach you some. Boys, oh boys means unbelievable."
00:19:14,00:19:20,"Boys, oh boys. Boys, oh boys. B-E-U-Y-S. So I think it's boys. Okay."
00:19:21,00:19:29,"To dilder means to walk around aimlessly and slowly. Oh, yeah. I think it's a nice word that we"
00:19:29,00:19:37,can all take to just dildering around. And my favourite one is beer. The word beer means to complain
00:19:37,00:19:44,"on moan, which means it also means to wine. So the word beer means wine. Oh, that's very nice."
00:19:44,00:19:53,Extremely confusing in the plepro pubs I'm sure they have. So grizzly bears can do one thing that I
00:19:53,00:20:00,"can't do. And that is user comb. They have been found using the comb using a comb, the only other"
00:20:00,00:20:08,species other than humans to do so. Cool. This was. They have bad peddlers going round their dens.
00:20:10,00:20:16,"This was in the Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska. And they, there was someone called Volkadeca"
00:20:16,00:20:24,from the University of St. Andrews. And Volk have found this grizzly bear picking up a rock
00:20:24,00:20:30,"from the water, looking at it, sort of turning it over, putting it back, picking another one up,"
00:20:30,00:20:35,looking at that one. And then with that sort of combing his fur with it around his muzzle. And then
00:20:35,00:20:39,he would put it down and he would pick it up and do it again. And then Volkadeca went to have a look at
00:20:39,00:20:45,these rocks and found that they had barnacles on them and worked out that what the bear was doing
00:20:45,00:20:49,was looking for the right one. And the fact that he picked up the first one and then threw it away
00:20:49,00:20:54,"again means that he can discriminate between what's a good comb and what's a bad comb, which basically"
00:20:54,00:20:59,shows that he understands the fact that it's a tool. That's so cool. Isn't that amazing? I don't
00:20:59,00:21:05,"think of any rocks as being a good comb. Do they have, do they have sort of prongs on them? Well,"
00:21:05,00:21:13,"they have barnacles on them. Yeah, okay, no, that does. Yeah, it'll do the job. You're a bear, you don't"
00:21:13,00:21:18,"care. Yeah. Well, you've got a meeting to be smart at or something. It is legal to eat a dog."
00:21:18,00:21:24,"Yes. If it's not in all countries. True. But in this country, in the UK and in the USA, in 44"
00:21:24,00:21:28,"states of the USA and here. You probably can't sell dog meat, can you? You can't sell it. But if"
00:21:28,00:21:34,"it's your dog and you kill it humanely, you can do it. Yeah. People often associate South Korea"
00:21:34,00:21:40,"don't they with eating dogs. And it is, there are no legal consequences for selling dog meat in"
00:21:40,00:21:49,"South Korea, although it's officially classified as detestable. A lot of my behaviour is not illegal,"
00:21:49,00:21:58,but it is clearly detestable. There was a survey of Worldwide Spur Banks to see how common
00:21:58,00:22:03,"various different traits are. And so, statistically, if you get sperm from a sperm bank,"
00:22:03,00:22:08,"your donor is most likely to be a Christian accountant with brown hair, brown eyes and white skin."
00:22:08,00:22:16,And it's least likely to be a dark skinned jinjabadist. Not likely to be a 19-foot tall drawing.
00:22:16,00:22:22,So it's least likely to be a dark skinned jinjabadist with black eyes.
00:22:25,00:22:33,"And they're very easy to sex, ohms, yeah, because they have translucent skin, so you can see the"
00:22:33,00:22:39,genitals through their skin. Wow. That's what just an aerial view you can see right through to the
00:22:39,00:22:44,"yeah, that's so great. Amazing. But they do, and the skin, this is so weird, so they're blind,"
00:22:44,00:22:49,"which is, or they're nearly blind, which makes sense because they live in very, very dark"
00:22:49,00:22:53,"case most of the time. But for the first four months, they do have eyes, and for the first four"
00:22:53,00:22:59,"months of their life, their eyes are out on the outside, and then gradually skin grows over their eyes,"
00:22:59,00:23:04,"meaning that they find it quite difficult to see. But thankfully, they can detect light with their"
00:23:04,00:23:10,"skin, so it's kind of a happy story. Yeah, yeah. It's weird though, isn't it, to have functioning eyes"
00:23:10,00:23:14,"that just get that they're overgrown? Yeah, they're overgrown by the thing that can also see."
00:23:14,00:23:18,"Yeah, it's weird. It's not. What's the point? Yeah. Oh, I'll just say."
00:23:20,00:23:25,"Well, there is no point James. Well, let's not look at this from the religious perspective."
00:23:25,00:23:33,"Stop the podcast. Stop the podcast. Hi, everyone. We'd like to let you know that we are not sponsored"
00:23:33,00:23:39,"by anyone, but we are asking you to donate to the care workers charity. Yes, so the care workers"
00:23:39,00:23:45,"charity is a charity that exists to support care workers who are having a hell of a time right now,"
00:23:45,00:23:52,"as you can imagine. So either very low paid anyway, over 43% of care workers are paid below the real"
00:23:52,00:23:56,"living wage. And at the moment with COVID, a lot of them are having to take a lot of time off work"
00:23:56,00:24:01,and losing even that wage. And so the care workers charity is setting up a fund where they're giving
00:24:01,00:24:06,"grants to people who are really suffering. Yes, lots of care workers have lost their income as a"
00:24:06,00:24:11,"result of the crisis. There are so many care workers in the UK, two million of them, and many of"
00:24:11,00:24:16,those guys are on a low income. So anything that can be done to alleviate that pressure at this time
00:24:16,00:24:21,is greatly appreciated. That's right. The care workers there at the absolute front of the
00:24:21,00:24:26,"coronavirus crisis at the moment, they're looking after the most vulnerable and most susceptible"
00:24:26,00:24:31,"people in society. And if there's anything you could do to help, we would really, really appreciate it."
00:24:31,00:24:37,And the thing that you can do specifically to help is you can go to qi.com/donate or just giving
00:24:37,00:24:44,".com/nstaf, and you'll find the page where you can give money to this fantastic charity"
00:24:44,00:24:50,in exchange for listening to our weirdo facts. That's the deal. Is that a fair deal?
00:24:50,00:24:52,"Okay, on with the weirdo facts."
00:24:52,00:25:01,And another thing that you could get dotted art was HP sauce. That was originally only sold
00:25:01,00:25:06,"dotted art. No, if you wanted HP sauce in 1905, the only way you could get it was from a"
00:25:06,00:25:11,darts darts houseman. It was invented by Edwin Sanson Moore who had a darts darts darts vinegar
00:25:11,00:25:16,and pickle company. So you just had to wait. You just had to wait. If the darts darts
00:25:16,00:25:19,"all guy came around yesterday and he suddenly needs it, it's like, you won't be back for another"
00:25:19,00:25:23,"three months. If you make a big sandwich, you better make it at the right time. Did he,"
00:25:23,00:25:27,"I just, that sounds terrifying. The HP sauce man coming down the street with his,"
00:25:27,00:25:31,did he have a like a backpack full of HP sauce? He just squirt it into your home.
00:25:33,00:25:38,What do you mean like a milkman does today? Why is that where your brain went with that?
00:25:38,00:25:44,"I don't understand. I'm just picturing him in a costume, which is the bottle of HP sauce."
00:25:44,00:25:50,And then he sort of leans his head forward and squeezes his slides into your house.
00:25:50,00:25:56,"Disgusting. Disgusting. No, he didn't do that. No, you thought you were peddling license"
00:25:56,00:26:05,remote. You know how you're saying that 11 can mean like a bad car. You know the limon rally.
00:26:05,00:26:13,Yes. Have you heard of the lemon? No. So this is a real thing. It's in America.
00:26:13,00:26:20,And the rules are that you have to drive a car that is valued at less than $500. So you have to
00:26:20,00:26:26,"drive a really terrible car. And before you turn up, they look at all the cars and they put you into"
00:26:26,00:26:32,"three categories. Either shit car, really shit car, or probably not going to finish the race car."
00:26:32,00:26:37,"And the price is a better for the worst cars. So you get more dollars if you're driving a really,"
00:26:37,00:26:44,really shit car. And the way that they work it out that you can't cheat is because at the end of
00:26:44,00:26:51,"the race, according to the rules, they're allowed to purchase any vehicle for $500. So if you turn"
00:26:51,00:26:57,"up with a Bugatti or something, then they by law have to be able to buy it off you for $500. That's"
00:26:57,00:27:02,"price in their history. They've looked at it and gone, you know what, that's worth more than $500."
00:27:02,00:27:07,I want to buy it off you. That's so funny. Isn't that cool? That's great. Is that in America?
00:27:07,00:27:12,"In America, yeah. And there's a load of, I mean, it's a bit silly, but there's a load of rules. So"
00:27:12,00:27:17,"if you kind of break some laws, you might have to get out of your car and run around the track"
00:27:17,00:27:23,"singing, ""I'm a little teapot."" It's a bit of a silly thing, but it's kind of cool. Do you have to do"
00:27:23,00:27:28,"the gestures as well? I think you do. You would have to. It's about on the song, yeah. Yeah, you're right."
00:27:28,00:27:33,"Does anyone have any more on the manchineal specifically? Well, what I can say is, so the manchineal"
00:27:33,00:27:39,"belongs to a genus called euphobia. And there's a more famous plants that comes from that genus,"
00:27:39,00:27:44,"and that is the poinsettia. So it's basically the same thing. And the Christmas thing, there's like"
00:27:44,00:27:50,"red Christmas plants, and they're also a little bit kind of poisonous. There's a myth that they kill"
00:27:50,00:27:54,"dogs, isn't there, and stuff like that, I think. They're not quite that poisonous, but they are quite"
00:27:54,00:28:00,poisonous. And the reason I find this really interesting. The reason we have poinsettias at Christmas
00:28:00,00:28:07,"is because there was a family called the Eek family, ECKE. I don't know if that's how you pronounce it."
00:28:07,00:28:14,"And they found a way to make the poinsettia bloom in the winter, because it's actually a summer plant."
00:28:14,00:28:19,"And when they did that, they wanted to sell it, but they didn't know how to do this."
00:28:19,00:28:24,And so they sent it to loads of TV studios around Christmas time in the hope that the TV studios
00:28:24,00:28:28,who just wanted to put something in the background will put this poinsettia in the background.
00:28:28,00:28:33,And it just so happened that this was just when color television had started. And so all the producers
00:28:33,00:28:38,"were like, well, look at this red plant. This is going to show up really well on the new color TV."
00:28:38,00:28:42,And so all of the TV shows around that time started putting poinsettias in their Christmas shows.
00:28:42,00:28:46,And then that's why today you'll might have these in your house at Christmas.
00:28:46,00:28:49,That's really cool. It's a mistletoe a bit poisonous as well.
00:28:49,00:28:54,Yeah. So we're just surrounding ourselves in poisons during the Christmas period.
00:28:54,00:28:57,Yeah. It's exciting. Just don't eat it. Don't eat mistletoe.
00:28:57,00:29:01,Yeah. And don't eat Holly as well. That's going to sting on the way down.
00:29:01,00:29:02,Yeah. On the way out.
00:29:02,00:29:05,Don't eat the plants. Don't eat my plant.
00:29:05,00:29:08,"Okay, I get it. I get it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I won't do it again."
00:29:08,00:29:14,See the food. I actually did this once. So which thing? The miniaturization thing.
00:29:14,00:29:19,"I'll explain better. At the end of university, sometimes they take a photo of all of you,"
00:29:19,00:29:23,"you know, on your graduation day and your gowns and things."
00:29:23,00:29:28,"Yeah. And they to get you to buy the photo of your whole year at university, they send you a tiny,"
00:29:28,00:29:33,like a two inch by three inch photo of your whole year at university.
00:29:33,00:29:36,And you can't really see yourself. You can't see who anyone is.
00:29:36,00:29:38,"No, but it's just to encourage you to splat out on the main thing."
00:29:38,00:29:40,I just kept the miniaturization on and framed that.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Amazing.
00:29:41,00:29:45,My home. I've got a tiny photo of my whole year at university.
00:29:45,00:29:46,I can't tell where I am.
00:29:46,00:29:51,Do you have a memory of where you were on the day?
00:29:51,00:29:54,"No. I don't know. Not anymore. No, it's been too long."
00:29:54,00:29:57,So I'm in there. I'm in there though. That's the main thing.
00:29:57,00:29:59,Are you sure? Are you? It's what actually happened.
00:29:59,00:30:03,"You didn't graduate and you said to your parents, oh, look, I'm in this picture."
00:30:03,00:30:07,"That's me, the little blob in the car."
00:30:07,00:30:09,I'm wearing the same clothes. You really can't tell.
00:30:09,00:30:15,"That's kind of like a caricature of some sort of de-kenzy and parsimonious, you know, stingy bastard."
00:30:15,00:30:18,"Well, if you see that on the wall."
00:30:18,00:30:21,I've saved about 25 pounds by doing that. Thank you very much.
00:30:21,00:30:25,"And 10 years later, when I can't see myself and my own graduation, it's worth it."
00:30:25,00:30:28,"I can't ring up now and say, have you got that info?"
00:30:28,00:30:35,"I'm willing to, I've decided I'm willing to buy it. I've made a decision."
00:30:35,00:30:37,Do you know that before they had bumper stickers?
00:30:37,00:30:40,So bumper stickers were invented by this guy called Forest Gill.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"And it was in the 50s, I think, late 50s."
00:30:43,00:30:49,"But before that, drivers would have handmade placards that they tie to their cards with pieces of twine."
00:30:49,00:30:53,"So if you wanted to say who you're going to vote for in the election,"
00:30:53,00:30:55,you would just get a placard and tie it to your car.
00:30:55,00:30:57,It's not cool. You just tie a bit of card to your car.
00:30:57,00:30:59,Really cool. I can't. I'm trying to figure out where you'd tie it.
00:30:59,00:31:02,"Maybe onto those roof rack bars, if you've got those."
00:31:02,00:31:04,"I think where your bumper is, maybe."
00:31:04,00:31:05,"Yeah, it would be about this."
00:31:05,00:31:09,"You would just have a small placard when you, the size of a sticker, almost."
00:31:09,00:31:11,"How do you, what do you tie it around?"
00:31:11,00:31:12,The bumper.
00:31:12,00:31:16,"I'm going to have to see, I forgot my card."
00:31:16,00:31:23,"I saw this amazing tweet by this guy called Frank Paul, who's like a quizmer in the UK."
00:31:24,00:31:29,And he found this Wikipedia article about a movie called Okay Connery.
00:31:29,00:31:30,Have you heard about this?
00:31:30,00:31:35,So this was like a spoof of James Bond made in Italy.
00:31:35,00:31:40,"And the way it started is Neil Connery, who is Sean Connery's brother,"
00:31:40,00:31:42,was working as a plasterer in Scotland.
00:31:42,00:31:45,And he was sacked for losing his tools.
00:31:45,00:31:49,And then this got into the tab like newspaper.
00:31:49,00:31:50,This really has his all real.
00:31:50,00:31:51,"Oh, I thought you meant they'd made all this up."
00:31:51,00:31:54,"No, no, no, so this Neil Connery is real."
00:31:54,00:31:55,He was working as a plasterer.
00:31:55,00:31:57,He lost his tools and he got fired.
00:31:57,00:32:02,And so it was in all the newspapers that Sean Connery's brother's just been fired for losing his tools.
00:32:02,00:32:06,"And when this guy who was making a movie,"
00:32:06,00:32:08,almost a minute slow news day.
00:32:08,00:32:13,And then these people in Italy kind of heard about this.
00:32:13,00:32:16,And they saw him in interviews on the local news.
00:32:16,00:32:18,And he sounded just like Sean Connery.
00:32:18,00:32:22,"And so they thought, why don't we make a movie with Neil Connery,"
00:32:22,00:32:24,where he's pretending to be James Bond.
00:32:24,00:32:28,"And they made this movie called ""Okay, Connery"", which is apparently terrible."
00:32:28,00:32:32,"Which is, yeah, why does it sound incredible?"
00:32:32,00:32:37,And apparently also it was filmed without any live sounds.
00:32:37,00:32:40,Neil Connery had appendicitis when they were filming it.
00:32:40,00:32:43,And it was really sick and he couldn't really speak properly.
00:32:43,00:32:45,So we got Sean in to dub it.
00:32:45,00:32:49,But we added all the voices in later in the film.
00:32:49,00:32:52,So everyone's licksinking and they added all the voices later on.
00:32:52,00:32:54,And apparently it's one of the worst films ever.
00:32:54,00:32:56,"That sounds, that does sound amazing."
00:32:56,00:32:58,It's incredible.
00:32:58,00:33:00,I was looking on Reddit.
00:33:00,00:33:04,"And there is a bit on Reddit called TIFU,"
00:33:04,00:33:06,which means today I fucked up.
00:33:06,00:33:09,And someone posted TIFU.
00:33:09,00:33:15,"Today I fucked up by putting ""I voted stickers on my nipples for the sake of getting in my husband's pants."""
00:33:15,00:33:18,It was painful to remove.
00:33:18,00:33:20,"""Do not do this, no matter how sexy."""
00:33:20,00:33:26,Just goes into a load of details about how they got stuck on her nipples.
00:33:26,00:33:28,"And she couldn't remove them, no matter what she did."
00:33:28,00:33:30,"Oh, but it's so sexy!"
00:33:30,00:33:34,"No, no matter how sexy it is, Anna, you mustn't do it."
00:33:34,00:33:37,"I'm gonna do it, hurry that."
00:33:37,00:33:42,"She said, ""When I pulled on it, my nipple is stretched sideways, almost bringing me to tears."""
00:33:42,00:33:42,Oh gosh.
00:33:42,00:33:47,"I said, weirdly, the thing I remember from a while ago, Reddit."
00:33:47,00:33:49,"They've never done really any advertising,"
00:33:49,00:33:53,"probably except for one thing, which is they spent $500."
00:33:53,00:33:55,And I think this is in the whole history of Reddit.
00:33:55,00:33:57,They spent $500 on promotional stickers.
00:33:57,00:33:58,Okay.
00:33:58,00:34:00,It's the only advertising they've ever done.
00:34:00,00:34:02,"Okay, one put them sort of around."
00:34:02,00:34:03,"Yeah, I guess so."
00:34:03,00:34:04,Just some people's nipples.
00:34:04,00:34:06,And they're still there to this day.
00:34:06,00:34:09,"So it's very well spent advertising money, actually."
00:34:09,00:34:12,"If you want to get sperm from a bee, it's really difficult, right?"
00:34:12,00:34:13,Because they're quite small.
00:34:13,00:34:14,They don't make much sperm.
00:34:15,00:34:18,"And presumably, if you aren't trying to force them out,"
00:34:18,00:34:19,would be it will try to sting you?
00:34:19,00:34:20,Probably will.
00:34:20,00:34:23,"Yeah, so what you do is you pick up your little drone bee,"
00:34:23,00:34:26,and then you squeeze its abdominal muscles
00:34:26,00:34:28,to mimic a natural mating event.
00:34:28,00:34:29,Okay.
00:34:29,00:34:33,And then the pressure exposes the bee's penis.
00:34:33,00:34:34,Bee's penis.
00:34:34,00:34:36,Bee's penis.
00:34:36,00:34:37,Yeah.
00:34:37,00:34:39,And a little speck of semen comes out.
00:34:39,00:34:40,"And you have to do it loads of times,"
00:34:40,00:34:45,"because obviously you need lots of semen, right?"
00:34:45,00:34:48,"If you're going to use it, you don't just want one little speck"
00:34:48,00:34:49,and you need lots of specks.
00:34:49,00:34:52,"But the problem is that just like in real life,"
00:34:52,00:34:55,"if a drone has sex, it immediately dies."
00:34:55,00:34:58,And this is what happens to these bees as well.
00:34:58,00:35:02,They basically go to the sperm donor's bank
00:35:02,00:35:03,and never come back.
00:35:03,00:35:04,"Oh, no."
00:35:04,00:35:05,"Oh, wow."
00:35:05,00:35:08,That's an even worse environment
00:35:08,00:35:09,than the normal human donation places.
00:35:09,00:35:13,If you have to go into a room full of corpses of previous donors.
00:35:14,00:35:16,I'm sorry. So is this not what you're into?
00:35:16,00:35:22,So I've read a whole thing about sort of
00:35:22,00:35:23,toy logistics these days.
00:35:23,00:35:26,And it's a nightmare for toy shop owners
00:35:26,00:35:28,"who as soon as a craze comes in,"
00:35:28,00:35:31,they have to basically buy quick and sell quick.
00:35:31,00:35:33,And then they don't know what the next thing's going to be.
00:35:33,00:35:34,So you can't stock up.
00:35:34,00:35:35,You can't really pre-plan it.
00:35:35,00:35:39,So it's a real painful.
00:35:39,00:35:40,"They have like a tie fair every year,"
00:35:40,00:35:41,don't they?
00:35:41,00:35:43,"Or they have a few of them where everyone says,"
00:35:43,00:35:44,this is going to be the next big thing.
00:35:44,00:35:46,This is going to be the next big thing.
00:35:46,00:35:47,Who knows what it's going to be.
00:35:47,00:35:50,"It's like exciting, really."
00:35:50,00:35:50,Yeah.
00:35:50,00:35:53,But it's the opposite of what the beany baby people did.
00:35:53,00:35:54,"Oh, yeah."
00:35:54,00:35:56,"Well, do you remember the deliberately restricted supply?"
00:35:56,00:35:57,Did that?
00:35:57,00:35:58,Yeah.
00:35:58,00:36:00,"That was our fidget spinner, really."
00:36:00,00:36:01,Wasn't it the beany baby?
00:36:01,00:36:02,That was our phrase.
00:36:02,00:36:04,"No, I was too old for that."
00:36:04,00:36:04,"Oh, no."
00:36:04,00:36:06,"You were the spinning top, obviously."
00:36:06,00:36:09,But I was the wheel of the stick.
00:36:11,00:36:14,Who used to run down those streets in Laikershire?
00:36:14,00:36:15,Rolled it by wheel.
00:36:15,00:36:20,"So they basically had loads of beany babies,"
00:36:20,00:36:22,but they said we're only going to sell this many of them
00:36:22,00:36:23,so that they were tomorrow.
00:36:23,00:36:24,"Yeah, they would risk it."
00:36:24,00:36:28,"This toyship owner, she said that normally,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,toy sales reps come into your store.
00:36:30,00:36:32,"And they try and sell you as they say,"
00:36:32,00:36:33,please buy as many units as you can.
00:36:33,00:36:35,The beany babies reps will come in.
00:36:35,00:36:37,"And you'd say, please, I need a beany baby"
00:36:37,00:36:38,elephant to sell to my clients.
00:36:38,00:36:39,"And they'd say, no."
00:36:39,00:36:40,And it was really.
00:36:40,00:36:43,"Well, it was their way of, it was basically"
00:36:43,00:36:44,like the diamond cartel.
00:36:44,00:36:46,They were just driving up demand as much.
00:36:46,00:36:47,"They couldn't, it really worked."
00:36:47,00:36:49,"That's, that's balsy, isn't it?"
00:36:49,00:36:51,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:51,00:36:52,So clever.
00:36:52,00:36:53,It was the only days of kind of using technology
00:36:53,00:36:55,"to spy on these shopkeepers, basically,"
00:36:55,00:36:57,because the beany baby makers
00:36:57,00:37:00,would keep exact records of precisely what beany babies
00:37:00,00:37:03,they'd been selling and how well they'd been doing it.
00:37:03,00:37:05,And they would confiscate various beany babies
00:37:05,00:37:07,from if they weren't doing it very well.
00:37:07,00:37:09,And they wouldn't let big shops like Toys or Us
00:37:09,00:37:11,"or Walmart stock them, because they didn't want to"
00:37:11,00:37:12,invalidate the brand.
00:37:12,00:37:14,And it sounded bizarre.
00:37:14,00:37:16,And the only way that you could get them
00:37:16,00:37:19,was to call a sales rep and then have a conversation
00:37:19,00:37:21,with the sales rep and sort of reveal secrets
00:37:21,00:37:23,about what the kids in your shop were saying
00:37:23,00:37:24,about what beany babies they liked.
00:37:24,00:37:25,Wow.
00:37:25,00:37:27,So they could get the inside scoop.
00:37:27,00:37:28,Wow.
00:37:28,00:37:30,It's no wonder you millennials are self-fucked up.
00:37:30,00:37:38,There was a 1904 carousel up for auction.
00:37:38,00:37:39,Very beautiful.
00:37:39,00:37:42,There was a park in Cleethorpe's selling it.
00:37:42,00:37:44,"Pleasure Island, it was called."
00:37:44,00:37:46,And there were no bids.
00:37:46,00:37:48,"And the reserve price was £180,000."
00:37:48,00:37:50,"Because obviously it's a huge, you know,"
00:37:50,00:37:52,"complicated, beautiful bit of machinery."
00:37:52,00:37:53,"And then just before bidding clothes,"
00:37:53,00:37:58,"there was one bid for £180,000."
00:37:58,00:37:59,And it was sold.
00:37:59,00:38:01,"And the owners must have thought,"
00:38:01,00:38:04,"""Oh, thank goodness we've managed to sell this carousel."""
00:38:04,00:38:06,And it turns out it was from a Lincoln Sherman
00:38:06,00:38:09,who had been trying to close the window
00:38:09,00:38:10,and accidentally pressed bid.
00:38:10,00:38:16,And he had legally bought it.
00:38:16,00:38:21,"He was in the hole with fees for £245,000."
00:38:21,00:38:22,Oh no.
00:38:22,00:38:25,Is there no safety net for that kind?
00:38:25,00:38:28,"Well, as they pointed out,"
00:38:28,00:38:30,"the bid button is in the middle of the screen,"
00:38:30,00:38:34,not the top corner where they hadn't put bid next to the X
00:38:34,00:38:36,or anything like that.
00:38:36,00:38:38,"Eventually, they let him off the hook"
00:38:38,00:38:40,and they did not force him to spend his entire life
00:38:40,00:38:43,savings on a carousel.
00:38:43,00:38:44,I think that's fair enough.
00:38:44,00:38:45,"Given that I get, you know,"
00:38:45,00:38:48,"if I'm on the most irrelevant website and tried to leave it,"
00:38:48,00:38:50,"it'll say, ""Are you sure you want to leave this site?"""
00:38:50,00:38:53,"I think in the very least, they should have that box pop up."
00:38:53,00:38:54,"Yeah, are you sure you want to spend"
00:38:54,00:38:56,a quarter million pounds on the carousel?
00:38:56,00:38:59,"Actually, no."
00:38:59,00:39:00,So funny.
00:39:00,00:39:01,I was trying to find out how you fit
00:39:01,00:39:03,that many clowns in a car.
00:39:03,00:39:05,It turns out it's very simple.
00:39:05,00:39:07,You just get a car and you remove everything.
00:39:07,00:39:09,Literally everything from it.
00:39:09,00:39:14,"You know, seats and what else is in a car?"
00:39:14,00:39:14,Ashtray.
00:39:14,00:39:15,The steering wheel.
00:39:15,00:39:16,Ashtray.
00:39:16,00:39:17,I think you keep the steering wheel.
00:39:17,00:39:18,You keep one or two things.
00:39:18,00:39:20,"But then, the record,"
00:39:20,00:39:22,and you have to fortify the springs as well
00:39:22,00:39:24,because it's normally a reasonably small car
00:39:24,00:39:25,for comedy purposes.
00:39:25,00:39:29,And the record for the number of clowns in a car
00:39:29,00:39:32,"is 31 in a Citroen 2CV,"
00:39:32,00:39:34,which is quite a small car.
00:39:34,00:39:37,"Yeah, that is not socially distancing."
00:39:37,00:39:38,No.
00:39:38,00:39:39,It's the opposite.
00:39:39,00:39:39,No.
00:39:39,00:39:41,Were they children?
00:39:41,00:39:42,Or were they?
00:39:42,00:39:43,"No, they were."
00:39:43,00:39:46,"They were, I believe, human adult clowns."
00:39:46,00:39:48,It feels like that's too many.
00:39:48,00:39:50,"As in, if I had to guess how many clowns"
00:39:50,00:39:52,"you could get in a Citroen,"
00:39:52,00:39:54,I would have gone way under.
00:39:54,00:39:55,"Like way, way, way under."
00:39:55,00:39:57,"But that's, well, I think that's why it's a world record."
00:39:57,00:39:58,I think...
00:39:58,00:39:59,"No, I do see that, but it's..."
00:39:59,00:40:02,I would have thought that the world record
00:40:02,00:40:03,would be just a little bit more
00:40:03,00:40:04,than I could possibly imagine.
00:40:04,00:40:06,But this is a lot more than I could possibly imagine.
00:40:06,00:40:09,Freethin clowns.
00:40:09,00:40:10,Yeah.
00:40:10,00:40:12,Have you guys heard of the Great Corn Cobb fire?
00:40:12,00:40:14,No.
00:40:14,00:40:15,Of 1958.
00:40:15,00:40:17,"Oh, the 1950s, oh no."
00:40:17,00:40:18,"Yeah, of course."
00:40:18,00:40:19,Yeah.
00:40:19,00:40:21,"Okay, this was in Memphis, Tennessee."
00:40:21,00:40:25,"And the Quakers, Quakers, Quaker Oats, the firm,"
00:40:25,00:40:27,they used corn cobs at the time to get a particular chemical.
00:40:27,00:40:32,And they had a stockpile at their plant
00:40:32,00:40:35,"of 70,000 tons of corn cobs, okay?"
00:40:35,00:40:36,Wow.
00:40:36,00:40:36,Imagine the size of that.
00:40:36,00:40:37,It was six stories high.
00:40:37,00:40:41,"And some people noticed in 1958,"
00:40:41,00:40:44,"oh, the pile of corn cobs is really smoldering a lot."
00:40:44,00:40:46,And it burst and deflamed.
00:40:46,00:40:48,It spontaneously combusted because the heat
00:40:48,00:40:49,had been generated inside it.
00:40:49,00:40:53,"And even so, this huge massive corn cob fire,"
00:40:53,00:40:55,"and even worse, as it burned,"
00:40:55,00:40:57,it formed a kind of shell over its surface.
00:40:57,00:41:00,"It kind of crusted over with this chemical,"
00:41:00,00:41:03,"which could not, which reflected the water back"
00:41:03,00:41:04,"onto the firefighters, basically."
00:41:04,00:41:09,"They had to use bulldozers to crash into this massive pile,"
00:41:09,00:41:11,but just to inject the water
00:41:11,00:41:12,through this weird surface that it formed.
00:41:12,00:41:14,Surringe it through.
00:41:14,00:41:15,"Basically, yeah."
00:41:15,00:41:15,I know.
00:41:15,00:41:19,I want to see the TV show Chernobyl.
00:41:19,00:41:20,Very good show.
00:41:20,00:41:22,"I want to see the sequel, which is about this,"
00:41:22,00:41:25,"because it seems like it's almost as exciting, right?"
00:41:25,00:41:25,Cornobyl.
00:41:25,00:41:29,Corn cobble.
00:41:29,00:41:30,Corn cobble.
00:41:30,00:41:31,Corn cobble.
00:41:31,00:41:32,There you go.
00:41:32,00:41:35,It's good that you showed us your working for that joke.
00:41:35,00:41:36,Yeah.
00:41:36,00:41:37,Thanks.
00:41:37,00:41:40,"I have a historical use of Lufa's,"
00:41:40,00:41:42,which may have changed the course of the Second World War.
00:41:42,00:41:43,Wow.
00:41:43,00:41:46,"So, a Lufa was used in the Second World War"
00:41:46,00:41:48,"to convince Churchill of a point, okay?"
00:41:48,00:41:53,"So, he was in a boat in 1943."
00:41:53,00:41:56,He was sailing to America to discuss war strategy
00:41:56,00:41:57,"with President Roosevelt, right?"
00:41:57,00:42:00,"And this was in the planning of D-Day,"
00:42:00,00:42:02,"and there was one thing they used in D-Day,"
00:42:02,00:42:03,which were called these mulberry harbors.
00:42:03,00:42:06,And they basically were large floating platforms
00:42:06,00:42:07,that were slightly out at sea.
00:42:07,00:42:09,"And if you had those out at sea,"
00:42:09,00:42:12,"then in, you know, closer to shore,"
00:42:12,00:42:13,the waters would become.
00:42:13,00:42:15,"So that was incredibly useful for landing troops,"
00:42:15,00:42:16,because it means you don't have to have
00:42:16,00:42:18,choppy waters while you're trying to get troops on shore.
00:42:18,00:42:22,"So, Churchill was in the bath on this ship in the Atlantic,"
00:42:22,00:42:25,"and his scientific advisor, Professor John Bernal,"
00:42:25,00:42:27,"was trying to teach him about these mulberry harbors,"
00:42:27,00:42:30,and he used a Lufa as an example.
00:42:30,00:42:32,He put some paper boats in Churchill's bath
00:42:32,00:42:35,"with Churchill in it, and then he stirred the water around,"
00:42:35,00:42:36,"and he used a Lufa to say, ""Look,"
00:42:36,00:42:38,"this is, if we had a giant Lufa,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,"this is how we protect our ships."""
00:42:40,00:42:43,"And that was how the Lufa helped to win the war, basically."
00:42:43,00:42:44,Wow.
00:42:44,00:42:45,"And that's why at D-Day,"
00:42:45,00:42:47,they also had those massive rubber ducks
00:42:47,00:42:49,on either side of it as well.
00:42:49,00:42:51,(laughter)
00:42:53,00:42:56,"But I would hope as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,"
00:42:56,00:42:58,we could have a bath in peace.
00:42:58,00:42:59,That people will come in and meet you.
00:42:59,00:43:02,"No, Churchill was famous for it, wasn't he?"
00:43:02,00:43:02,Yeah.
00:43:02,00:43:03,Yeah.
00:43:03,00:43:05,"It's interesting, because now, I think it would be,"
00:43:05,00:43:07,"and like now, it's a charming eccentricity"
00:43:07,00:43:09,to look back on Churchill having a bath
00:43:09,00:43:11,and having scientific advice on the bath.
00:43:11,00:43:13,But if we heard that Boris Johnson or Donald Trump
00:43:13,00:43:14,by having meetings in the bath.
00:43:14,00:43:16,We would be completely unsurprised.
00:43:16,00:43:18,(laughter)
00:43:18,00:43:21,You know drafts.
00:43:21,00:43:22,Yes.
00:43:22,00:43:24,"Yeah, drafts, it turns out, has been solved."
00:43:24,00:43:26,Okay.
00:43:26,00:43:28,"There is now, there is now a,"
00:43:28,00:43:29,there is now no point in playing draft
00:43:29,00:43:32,because there is a correct way to play it.
00:43:32,00:43:32,"Oh, no."
00:43:32,00:43:35,And this was worked out by a computer games expert
00:43:35,00:43:37,"called Jonathan Schaeffer, the University of Alberta."
00:43:37,00:43:43,He set a number of computers playing it.
00:43:43,00:43:44,"At the peak of his work,"
00:43:44,00:43:46,"there were 200 desktop computers,"
00:43:46,00:43:48,which he had playing drafts full-time
00:43:48,00:43:50,to work out the combinations.
00:43:50,00:43:51,(laughter)
00:43:51,00:43:52,Out of play.
00:43:52,00:43:52,Wow.
00:43:52,00:43:55,Imagine how annoying that would be
00:43:55,00:43:56,if you were trying to get a computer
00:43:56,00:43:58,at the University of Alberta.
00:43:58,00:43:59,(laughter)
00:43:59,00:44:01,All of Jonathan's 200 machines were playing drafts.
00:44:01,00:44:04,(laughter)
00:44:04,00:44:06,"And it's not like you save your lives, is it?"
00:44:06,00:44:07,"Well, you know, when he explains it"
00:44:07,00:44:08,why you can't use it.
00:44:08,00:44:09,(laughter)
00:44:09,00:44:10,You're trying to solve drafts.
00:44:10,00:44:12,(laughter)
00:44:12,00:44:16,"But it turns out that there are 10 to the 20,"
00:44:16,00:44:17,"sorry, there are 10 to the power"
00:44:17,00:44:20,of 20 different positions for the game.
00:44:20,00:44:21,Okay.
00:44:21,00:44:23,And even if there are fewer than 10 pieces
00:44:23,00:44:24,"on the board at the end,"
00:44:24,00:44:27,there are still 39 trillion end-game positions
00:44:27,00:44:28,which are possible.
00:44:28,00:44:30,So there's quite a lot of numbers to craft.
00:44:30,00:44:31,"Yeah, exactly."
00:44:31,00:44:33,"So you say that it's solved, Andy,"
00:44:33,00:44:35,but unless you and I are playing
00:44:35,00:44:37,and we both have 50 computers
00:44:37,00:44:38,telling us what to do each time
00:44:38,00:44:41,and we're willing to wait for about six hours
00:44:41,00:44:42,"between each move, then presumably."
00:44:42,00:44:44,(laughter)
00:44:44,00:44:46,That's how I play all my games.
00:44:46,00:44:47,It's the game's oppression.
00:44:47,00:44:49,(laughter)
00:44:49,00:44:51,"Ewigs do have this really unfortunate,"
00:44:51,00:44:54,"not predator, parasite, really,"
00:44:54,00:44:56,that I was reading about.
00:44:56,00:44:58,"And it's the, I found this out"
00:44:58,00:45:00,because there's a guy called Ryan Herbison
00:45:00,00:45:02,"who's a researcher who collected 1,300 earwigs"
00:45:02,00:45:05,"to investigate it, which I think it must be so weird."
00:45:05,00:45:07,He was just wandering along a beach collecting earwigs
00:45:07,00:45:10,and he's looking out for these things called murmithids
00:45:10,00:45:12,and they're just one of those parasites
00:45:12,00:45:13,that takes over your brain.
00:45:13,00:45:14,"We've talked about this kind of thing before,"
00:45:14,00:45:16,but I always find them incredible.
00:45:16,00:45:18,"So he collected all these earwigs,"
00:45:18,00:45:22,opened up their brains and found murmithids inside lots of them.
00:45:22,00:45:25,"And what they do is they make them hydro-taxic,"
00:45:25,00:45:27,"as in they make them want to go to water,"
00:45:27,00:45:29,"they want to go to get wet,"
00:45:29,00:45:31,or they make them act really erratically
00:45:31,00:45:34,so they hop around until they see a pond and then jump in it.
00:45:34,00:45:37,"And they can't swim, so they immediately drown."
00:45:37,00:45:38,And then that's perfect
00:45:38,00:45:41,because these parasites' little babies are aquatic
00:45:41,00:45:43,and so then they can swim.
00:45:43,00:45:44,Oh no.
00:45:44,00:45:46,They turn them into water lovers.
00:45:46,00:45:47,"I just, I just find it amazing"
00:45:47,00:45:49,that these things exist that control the minds
00:45:49,00:45:50,with so many animals.
00:45:50,00:45:52,Yeah.
00:45:52,00:45:52,"Yeah, that's wicked."
00:45:52,00:45:54,They also do this really cool thing
00:45:54,00:45:56,where they can stop predators
00:45:56,00:45:59,from getting a taste for them and their family
00:45:59,00:46:01,"by once they're, when they're being eaten,"
00:46:01,00:46:03,"let's say, by a lizard."
00:46:03,00:46:07,They vomit inside them as they're being eaten.
00:46:07,00:46:10,So they vomit inside the lizard into the lizard's mouth
00:46:10,00:46:13,"and they release a smell which is like rotting flesh,"
00:46:13,00:46:16,which the lizard hates
00:46:16,00:46:18,"because I usually, when I think of animals,"
00:46:18,00:46:21,"I just think they don't care about the taste of things, right?"
00:46:21,00:46:23,"They just, it's about food."
00:46:23,00:46:24,It's all yucky.
00:46:24,00:46:26,"Like, they don't have taste buds."
00:46:26,00:46:29,But apparently they don't have taste.
00:46:29,00:46:31,A whole series of weird revelations
00:46:31,00:46:33,"there about your preconceptions, but sure."
00:46:33,00:46:36,"Why do you think a lizard would just eat whatever, right?"
00:46:36,00:46:38,"But this will actively,"
00:46:38,00:46:42,once they release this vile-smelling toxic
00:46:42,00:46:44,"into the mouth of the lizard,"
00:46:44,00:46:46,"the lizard will not only spit them out,"
00:46:46,00:46:47,"but it will spend time after it's going,"
00:46:47,00:46:51,and try to wipe away this thing from their mouth.
00:46:51,00:46:53,And the idea is that I'm not sure
00:46:53,00:46:57,"if the earwig will survive the one that's been chewed,"
00:46:57,00:47:00,"or if that's, I think, it's more about passing on"
00:47:00,00:47:03,the distaste to never want to eat an earwig again
00:47:03,00:47:06,"for the future lizards, or that one lizard."
00:47:06,00:47:08,"So sacrificing yourself for the sake of the clan,"
00:47:08,00:47:10,like Bruce Willis and Armageddon?
00:47:10,00:47:11,"Yes, exactly."
00:47:11,00:47:12,"Yeah, it's a lot."
00:47:12,00:47:15,"Oh, Anna, stop spoiling films for James."
00:47:15,00:47:15,I'm sorry.
00:47:15,00:47:18,"Don't listen, James."
00:47:18,00:47:18,"I wasn't, I wasn't."
00:47:18,00:47:22,"That's, wow, that is amazing."
00:47:22,00:47:25,"Do you know, Dan, you live with a dog at the moment?"
00:47:25,00:47:27,"No, I'm not anymore."
00:47:27,00:47:27,"Oh, really?"
00:47:27,00:47:29,"Because I was going to say, when you give it dog food,"
00:47:29,00:47:32,"do you just think, fuck it, eat any old shit?"
00:47:32,00:47:33,Doesn't have any taste buds.
00:47:33,00:47:36,"I was thinking more like lizards, rather than,"
00:47:36,00:47:37,"I don't think, like, when I feed my son,"
00:47:37,00:47:41,"I think, hey, he's young, fuck it, he hasn't got taste buds yet."
00:47:41,00:47:42,It's more. He's got more.
00:47:42,00:47:44,"Dan, he's got three times as many as you."
00:47:44,00:47:45,"Oh, yeah."
00:47:45,00:47:47,"Well, I'll stop feeding him dog food now."
00:47:47,00:47:50,"Hey, just while we're talking about Spain,"
00:47:50,00:47:52,"Spain obviously has that big Christmas lottery,"
00:47:52,00:47:55,"which is El Gordo, the fat one."
00:47:55,00:47:57,"And it's the big, big prize."
00:47:57,00:48:00,Did you guys read that in 2011?
00:48:00,00:48:01,It was won.
00:48:01,00:48:03,"And it's, you know, people win it."
00:48:03,00:48:06,"But this one town in Spain, called Sadeto,"
00:48:06,00:48:08,"every single resident there,"
00:48:08,00:48:11,the 70 households won this lottery.
00:48:11,00:48:14,"And the thing is, is that the way they do it is,"
00:48:14,00:48:16,"sometimes these towns club together,"
00:48:16,00:48:18,"and they buy this big, they buy the one lottery ticket."
00:48:18,00:48:20,"And then they go around to each house,"
00:48:20,00:48:23,"and they say, do you want to be a participant in this?"
00:48:23,00:48:24,So you get a participation ticket.
00:48:24,00:48:28,"So this entire town did it of 70 households,"
00:48:28,00:48:29,which was over 200 people.
00:48:29,00:48:32,"They all won the lottery except one guy,"
00:48:32,00:48:35,because they forgot to knock on his door.
00:48:35,00:48:36,"Oh, wow."
00:48:36,00:48:38,Surely they shared it within.
00:48:38,00:48:39,"They didn't, no, they didn't."
00:48:39,00:48:42,"And he, he had moved to the town,"
00:48:42,00:48:43,because he was in love with this girl.
00:48:43,00:48:46,"It didn't work out, so he decided to stay."
00:48:46,00:48:48,"So he was renovating in this new place,"
00:48:48,00:48:51,and the people who went around selling the tickets
00:48:51,00:48:53,just didn't think to go and sell him a ticket.
00:48:53,00:48:55,"So he remembers waking up on the day,"
00:48:55,00:48:56,and he's a cinematographer.
00:48:56,00:48:58,He does a lot of filming.
00:48:58,00:49:00,And everyone was on the streets running around.
00:49:00,00:49:01,He had no idea why.
00:49:01,00:49:03,"They were in their socks running out of their face,"
00:49:03,00:49:05,because they'd all just heard the news.
00:49:05,00:49:06,And he filmed it all.
00:49:06,00:49:09,"He filmed the joy, but behind that camera is the one man"
00:49:09,00:49:12,who didn't get any of the benefits from it.
00:49:12,00:49:13,That is fun.
00:49:13,00:49:14,And they want a huge amount.
00:49:14,00:49:16,"Like if you paid in lower amounts,"
00:49:16,00:49:20,the least that was earned by someone
00:49:20,00:49:23,"who got some money was around $100,000."
00:49:23,00:49:25,That was like the lowest on it.
00:49:25,00:49:29,"So as a result, once the news came out,"
00:49:29,00:49:33,"all of these business people descended on the town,"
00:49:33,00:49:36,"trying to sell them B&W cars, business managers came in,"
00:49:36,00:49:39,"and the whole town now, there's people on the way home"
00:49:39,00:49:41,"having to hide as they leave the cafe,"
00:49:41,00:49:43,because they can see that really persistent bank manager
00:49:43,00:49:47,sitting on his car looking from more residents to sign up.
00:49:47,00:49:49,So it's kind of turned into a hellhole for a lot of them.
00:49:49,00:49:51,"So really, the one guy who didn't win"
00:49:51,00:49:52,"is laughing at everyone else's faces,"
00:49:52,00:49:54,"because he can just say to those hastlers,"
00:49:54,00:49:56,"""Mate, I'm the one that didn't win it."
00:49:56,00:49:57,"I've got nothing for you."""
00:49:57,00:50:00,Just one more thing on hangovers.
00:50:00,00:50:02,I found a survey.
00:50:03,00:50:05,"By, I think it was a rehab website,"
00:50:05,00:50:07,"about, it was a survey of 1,000 drinkers"
00:50:07,00:50:09,about what they would do to avoid a hangover.
00:50:09,00:50:11,"Like, what sacrifices they would make"
00:50:11,00:50:13,to never have a hangover again.
00:50:13,00:50:13,Okay.
00:50:13,00:50:16,So I just want to run these party and see if you'd agree.
00:50:16,00:50:19,So a third of people said they would pay more for their drinks
00:50:19,00:50:20,if it meant they would never have a hangover.
00:50:20,00:50:22,Yeah? Okay.
00:50:22,00:50:22,Yeah. Okay.
00:50:22,00:50:24,"Depends on much more, but yeah."
00:50:24,00:50:24,If you can afford it.
00:50:24,00:50:30,"Um, about a third said they would give up watching sports forever."
00:50:30,00:50:32,Oh gosh. No.
00:50:32,00:50:35,I'm finding the last few weeks quite hard.
00:50:35,00:50:37,"So, um, probably wouldn't do that."
00:50:37,00:50:38,Okay.
00:50:38,00:50:41,"It was, it was way more women than men"
00:50:41,00:50:43,said they would give up watching sports forever.
00:50:43,00:50:47,"Um, they, so 2% of women said they would give up sex"
00:50:47,00:50:49,for the rest of their lives.
00:50:49,00:50:53,"Um, 0% of men said they would give up sex forever"
00:50:53,00:50:54,to avoid a hangover.
00:50:54,00:50:55,"Yeah, I understand that."
00:50:55,00:50:57,Some of them get a bit dark.
00:50:57,00:50:59,"So, um, sacrificing a stranger's life,"
00:51:00,00:51:03,"um, 9% of men said yes, 9%."
00:51:03,00:51:09,"Giving up a fingertip, 6% of men, 3% of women,"
00:51:09,00:51:11,"allegedly, 6% of men,"
00:51:11,00:51:15,and 1% of women would kill their pets to avoid hangovers.
00:51:15,00:51:16,For the rest of your life.
00:51:16,00:51:18,"If you've got pet crickets or something,"
00:51:18,00:51:19,then that actually is not so bad.
00:51:19,00:51:21,Yeah.
00:51:21,00:51:22,"I wouldn't give up crickets,"
00:51:22,00:51:24,but I would give up crickets.
00:51:24,00:51:25,Hey!
00:51:25,00:51:29,Do you guys know the first reference to Hair of the Dog?
00:51:29,00:51:30,That's really surprised by this.
00:51:30,00:51:32,"No, um, the Bible."
00:51:32,00:51:34,It's such an even pre-bible.
00:51:34,00:51:35,It's 400 BC.
00:51:35,00:51:38,"And it's in a, um,"
00:51:38,00:51:41,"recommendation by guy called Antiphanies,"
00:51:41,00:51:44,"who was recommending basically homiopathic treatments,"
00:51:44,00:51:45,which is sort of what Hair of the Dog is.
00:51:45,00:51:48,It's sort of like a little bit of the thing that makes you ill.
00:51:48,00:51:51,"Um, and he says take the hair,"
00:51:51,00:51:53,"so this is translated from the Greek and made nice and poetic,"
00:51:53,00:51:57,"but take the hair, it is well written of the Dog,"
00:51:57,00:52:00,"by which your bitten, work off one wine with his brother,"
00:52:00,00:52:02,work off one labour with another.
00:52:02,00:52:03,Hmm.
00:52:03,00:52:05,"It works to an extent, actually, Hair of the Dog."
00:52:05,00:52:07,"First of all, it obviously makes you feel better,"
00:52:07,00:52:08,"because you're getting a bit drunk again,"
00:52:08,00:52:10,so we all know that kind of works.
00:52:10,00:52:12,"But they think now it works,"
00:52:12,00:52:14,because there's something we've discussed before.
00:52:14,00:52:16,"Dan, do you remember that fact you had where they cured that guy"
00:52:16,00:52:18,of alcohol poisoning by feeding him beer?
00:52:18,00:52:18,"Yeah, that's right."
00:52:18,00:52:21,And it's because of the methanol.
00:52:21,00:52:24,"So all alcoholic drinks contain tiny amounts of methanol,"
00:52:24,00:52:28,and they think that might be a large part of what's making you feel bad with a hangover.
00:52:28,00:52:31,"And if you drink more alcohol, then the ethanol in that,"
00:52:31,00:52:34,"actually, is digested before the methanol,"
00:52:34,00:52:36,so the methanol stops making you feel bad.
00:52:36,00:52:38,So keep it up.
00:52:38,00:52:41,"Okay, so what was said?"
00:52:41,00:52:43,Is that our official advice?
00:52:43,00:52:48,"That's, um, yeah, please don't sue me when you get live a failure."
00:52:48,00:52:52,I was looking up with some other museums in Croatia.
00:52:54,00:52:58,"We've spoken before, I think, about the Museum of Broken Relationships."
00:52:58,00:53:01,"That's quite a famous one, but I'd never seen this one."
00:53:01,00:53:04,"It's called Froggyland, and it's in Split."
00:53:04,00:53:08,And this is a collection of 507 stuffed frogs
00:53:08,00:53:14,"that were made by a very, very skilled taxidermist from Croatia called Ference Mere."
00:53:14,00:53:20,And he used a very clever system where he goes through the animal's mouth
00:53:20,00:53:22,rather than cutting it open.
00:53:22,00:53:25,So you don't end up with any scars on the taxidermy animal.
00:53:25,00:53:31,And then he got the frogs and he put them in sort of like settings.
00:53:31,00:53:35,"So, um, there's one in a blacksmith's shop, there's one in a carpenter's shop,"
00:53:35,00:53:38,"there's one in a school, there's some in the circus,"
00:53:38,00:53:43,like lots of different modes of life just recreated with stuff.
00:53:43,00:53:45,"Frogs, so cool, wow."
00:53:45,00:53:49,It's funny because it feels like he might also be a candidate for the Museum of Broken Relationships.
00:53:49,00:53:49,To use.
00:53:49,00:53:58,"But yeah, Froggyland, it gets 4.5 stars on TripAdvisor,"
00:53:58,00:54:01,"lots of reviews, lots of good reviews."
00:54:01,00:54:03,"I only read the bad ones, of course."
00:54:03,00:54:07,The frogs were very small and not very appealing.
00:54:07,00:54:13,"Another person, this place is an abomination for frog lovers."
00:54:13,00:54:14,Don't go here.
00:54:14,00:54:17,"If you love frogs like me, I love frogs."
00:54:18,00:54:20,"You should have seen that coming, surely if you're a frog lover,"
00:54:20,00:54:23,going to a place full of dead frogs is what you're going to like.
00:54:23,00:54:28,"And another person said, okay, okay."
00:54:28,00:54:31,This guy gave a lot of time and effort to make these frogs.
00:54:31,00:54:34,"But still, it is weird and creepy."
00:54:34,00:54:35,Yeah.
00:54:35,00:54:39,But then the people who made the Museum replied with Anna's exact point.
00:54:39,00:54:44,We don't understand why someone who has that kind of opinion would even decide to come in here.
00:54:45,00:54:48,"It's like you're doing it deliberately so you can complain, guys."
00:54:48,00:54:49,We're not like dead frogs.
00:54:49,00:54:50,Don't go to the dead frogs Museum.
00:54:50,00:54:54,"Anyway, it's in split."
00:54:54,00:54:59,Do you think someone tested the temperature
00:54:59,00:55:01,of Cleopatra's milk bath by dipping their elbow into it?
00:55:01,00:55:10,"Now, that is a joke about how you test the temperature of a baby's milk, isn't it?"
00:55:10,00:55:13,"Oh no, it's how you test a baby's bath water, sorry."
00:55:13,00:55:14,"How do you test the milk, though?"
00:55:15,00:55:17,"Um, it's hard to get your elbow into the bottle, isn't it?"
00:55:17,00:55:19,"Yeah, do you have it yourself?"
00:55:19,00:55:21,You try.
00:55:21,00:55:24,"I think you drip little bits from the bottle on the back of your hand, don't you?"
00:55:24,00:55:24,"Like, maybe."
00:55:24,00:55:28,"I think you just, simply, you just trust that the milk you're producing from your breasts"
00:55:28,00:55:31,is not by the boiling hot and freezing hot.
00:55:31,00:55:36,"That's, yeah."
00:55:36,00:55:39,"I mean, some mothers are like Yellowstone National Park, aren't they?"
00:55:39,00:55:40,There we go.
00:55:40,00:55:42,120 degrees.
00:55:43,00:55:45,Can't be very damaging.
00:55:45,00:55:54,"They had a sacred blades, which, and this is a slight content warning here, sacred obsidian blades,"
00:55:54,00:55:57,which the kings would use to cut their penises with.
00:55:57,00:55:58,"Oh, yeah, okay."
00:55:58,00:56:00,"Yeah, it's not, it's not so they could bleed them."
00:56:00,00:56:02,"Yeah, what were they doing?"
00:56:02,00:56:04,"Which bet they cut, they're not cutting the whole thing off, are they?"
00:56:04,00:56:07,"Not, they weren't cutting the whole thing off, great news, but they were cutting,"
00:56:07,00:56:09,"I mean, it's all sensitive."
00:56:09,00:56:10,It's all sensitive.
00:56:10,00:56:13,"No, they were just sort of, well, they did a bit on, on their full skins, yeah,"
00:56:13,00:56:15,but a bit on other parts of it.
00:56:15,00:56:19,"You know, the Victorians had special, like, mini sods that they used to cut a corn off"
00:56:19,00:56:20,corn on the cubs.
00:56:20,00:56:22,It just doesn't matter.
00:56:22,00:56:23,I don't know what maybe you think of that.
00:56:23,00:56:29,"And I think it was bleeding, wasn't it?"
00:56:29,00:56:31,"As in, they used to sacrifice their blood."
00:56:31,00:56:36,So this is a ritual thing that they had to do is they would have to cut their tongues and ears
00:56:36,00:56:37,and genitals and stuff.
00:56:37,00:56:40,And then pull us a blood out of them to give to the gods.
00:56:40,00:56:41,"I think I got that, yeah."
00:56:41,00:56:46,"They'd leave the blade somewhere, and so researchers have found a load of these obsidian blades,"
00:56:46,00:56:51,"and it's very hard to tell which of the blades there were sacrificial, because as they put it,"
00:56:51,00:56:56,the degree of where imposed on a blade used only on one occasion to slice open a penis
00:56:56,00:56:57,is very little indeed.
00:56:57,00:57:00,The knife is much less damaged.
00:57:00,00:57:07,"So the researchers, again, had to have a go at this and they studied multiple blades."
00:57:07,00:57:10,"Well, no, the scientists didn't cut their own cubs."
00:57:11,00:57:13,They tried it on some chicken instead.
00:57:13,00:57:15,They tried it on the people's cocks.
00:57:15,00:57:18,And they studied multiple blades.
00:57:18,00:57:21,And they think that has given them a sign of which blades we use.
00:57:21,00:57:26,"That's really interesting, because like exactly what you're saying, the way you work out"
00:57:26,00:57:29,"how a blade was used is by looking at the dense in it, don't you?"
00:57:29,00:57:32,"Like, and there was a research study about some Bronze Age swords,"
00:57:32,00:57:35,"about whether they were purely decorative or whether they used in fighting,"
00:57:35,00:57:38,and they can tell by how they hit each other and how they dent.
00:57:39,00:57:43,"But if you're only using it for one after one thing of a penis and yeah,"
00:57:43,00:57:44,you're not going to get that information.
00:57:44,00:57:49,"Yeah, the wear and tear on the penis is definitely more, isn't it?"
00:57:49,00:57:51,Yes.
00:57:51,00:57:53,Down the knife.
00:57:53,00:58:02,"Just to go back to their gods, some other fun gods, they were quite interflatulant and smelling."
00:58:02,00:58:06,"Well, sorry, and this is a terrible joke that I'm just about to make."
00:58:07,00:58:15,"And see if we can put it in, but you say that the damage on the penis is worse."
00:58:15,00:58:18,"But then, of course, the penis might be other than the sword."
00:58:18,00:58:20,"Oh, wow."
00:58:20,00:58:22,"Oh, wow."
00:58:22,00:58:25,That was so glad.
00:58:25,00:58:27,Was it so glad that it's wrong to you for that.
00:58:27,00:58:28,I'm glad you got that.
00:58:28,00:58:29,Definitely worth it.
00:58:29,00:58:31,"It's going in, isn't it?"
00:58:31,00:58:32,It's going in.
00:58:32,00:58:33,I can't wait to hear it.
00:58:36,00:58:39,"We've got our end of section now, so sorry to look here when you got to say it."
00:58:39,00:58:46,"Okay, that's it."
00:58:46,00:58:47,That's all of our facts.
00:58:47,00:58:49,Thank you so much for listening.
00:58:49,00:58:51,What does Dan usually say here?
00:58:51,00:58:53,"Oh, it doesn't matter because it's not a normal show."
00:58:53,00:58:58,"All we want to do is remind you that to give some money to the care workers' charity,"
00:58:58,00:59:02,"they would really, really appreciate it if you could spare anything and so would we."
00:59:02,00:59:12,"And to donate, go to qi.com/donate or justgiving.com/nstaf."
00:59:12,00:59:13,Off with the show.
00:59:13,00:59:14,I've always wanted to say that.
00:59:14,00:59:15,I've never had a chance before.
00:59:15,00:59:16,It feels like I can now dance away.
00:59:16,00:59:17,Wow.
00:59:17,00:59:21,"If that doesn't make you want to donate to this charity, I don't know what will."
