00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's bonus compilation episode of no such thing as a fish,

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,520
 some of the best bits that I couldn't quite fit in the edit of all the shows that we've done

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,880
 over the last three or four months. Yes, this is an extra special treat for all of you,

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,040
 because you've listened so loyally for so long, you're getting this episode and you're getting it

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:28,080
 with no adverts. We're not going to ask you to order home delivered meals or delicious international

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,080
 beer or clothes perfectly sculpted to your figure. Anna, this is now an advert at the sticker.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,480
 It's so cool, I've done it to an advert, I can't help it. Well, there is one thing we are actually

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,360
 going to ask people to do because this boneless episode comes with one little tiny string attached

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,880
 to it and that's that it is for charity. This is raising money. This episode for a charity called

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,880
 the Care Workers Charity. We'll be telling you a bit more about them in a bit, but it's a fantastic

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,600
 and very worthy cause. And so your listening is being co-opted in the name of that course.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,240
 That's right. This episode is absolutely free. It is completely free. You don't have to donate if

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,640
 you don't want to, but if you do have a few quid to spare, we would really, really appreciate it.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,960
 Just to stress how really important it is that we're all giving money to charity at the moment,

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,040
 it's obviously a time when a lot of charities need huge amounts of money because of COVID and it's

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,960
 coinciding with the time where people are not giving money to charity. So the charity sector has

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,680
 lost billions and billions of pounds over the last few months because of COVID because people are

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,400
 just really struggling and so there's no more vital time to be able to donate any money that you can

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:40,080
 spare. All you have to do is go to qi.com/donate or just giving.com/nstaf and either one will take you

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:58,640
 to the place you need. Okay, I'm with a podcast.

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:06,640
 Sorry, just on ancient sausages. I was looking at who invented the hotdog, which is quite

22
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,560
 hard to find, but I found where the first sausages were supposedly invented. This is an article

23
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,440
 from BBC History and they said that the Emperor Nero had a cook called Gayas and in Roman times you

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,160
 would starve your pigs for one week before you slaughter them, but Gayas was watching over his

25
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,120
 kitchen and realised that one of his pigs had not been properly cleaned. So he stuck a knife into

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,800
 the belly of the pig to see if the roast was edible and out popped an intestine. Okay, and because

27
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,120
 the pig had been starved, it had puffed up because of the heat and Gayas explained, "I have discovered

28
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,480
 something of great importance." And it was the sausage. Well, cool. It's a great story. Don't believe

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:56,240
 that story. Well, no, it's history. BBC History. BBC History, mate. Well, no, it's an account.

30
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:03,120
 Well, who made up the account? I think it's, I don't know who wrote it,

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,480
 who wrote about Nero Day of Casio, someone like that. Oh, yeah, maybe, probably.

32
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,400
 Wow. Yeah. So that was, because they had, they did have sausages, didn't they?

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
 They did have sausages in Romans, yeah. Yeah. Who used to think it hasn't come from this great

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
 discovery of great importance? And when you do discover something like that, you're

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
 going to write about it. It seems weird to us these days. Why would you write about the first

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,680
 sausage? Back then, that's like the iPod coming out. Nero's on stage at the forum. Turtle neck,

37
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:36,400
 the eye sausage. One group who are interested in earthworms is the RG.

38
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,800
 The RG. You're appearing in the search group? The Brexitee... Jacob Rees Muggie group, yeah.

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,280
 No, it's the earthworm research group who work in Britain. They're one of the main groups

40
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,400
 of earthworm researchers in the country. And ironically, considering they have a same name

41
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,680
 as the RG Brexitees, they mostly deal with overseas projects with people like Finland,

42
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,560
 France, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and Spain. Wow. So for them, Brexite is really bad. This RG, yeah.

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:14,160
 So it's like an ERG versus ERG debate right now. I want to see that fight. Yeah. Between Jacob

44
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,800
 Rees Muggie and this head of the earthworm research group. I'd back anyone who's on the other end

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,680
 against Jacob Rees Muggie. Although he does have that cane a lot of the time.

46
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:31,280
 'Cause he's a pimp. Pimp's okay. So I don't think he carries a cane, does he?

47
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,160
 I'm not very keen on a Victorian master. I think I'm accidentally thinking of a caricature

48
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,440
 of a Victorian gentleman, because that's how people portray him, aren't I?

49
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,240
 Or you're thinking of Wes Wally, who he does have a similar look to Barring the Clothes.

50
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,680
 There's glasses. Yeah, he has a cane. Walks around with a cane. Yeah, he does. It's a walking stick,

51
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,520
 yeah. That's a cane. Yeah. Why does Wes Wally have a cane? He's walking a lot. Yeah,

52
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,880
 because he has to get to all the different parts of the page. Yeah. It's a walking stick,

53
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,880
 like someone up a mountain, not someone who... Oh, okay. He came from an old person, for example.

54
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,720
 No, no, okay. Because he's middle-aged. Oh, I don't like that. Where's Wally?

55
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,960
 Young to middle-aged. I think young. I mean, I am quite old. It's a young man's game.

56
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,960
 Wally. There was a place I read about which was called

57
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,320
 Loudon County. I think I'm pronouncing that right. It's an America. And supposedly, so it's in

58
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,040
 Virginia, supposedly 70% of the world's online traffic passes through this one county.

59
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,760
 Yeah, so they have all the storage units there. And so, yeah, this was an article that I was reading.

60
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,120
 So it's the largest concentration, this article says, of computing power.

61
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,840
 And according to Greenpeace in 2017, 1% of the electricity company that runs all of the electricity

62
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,560
 in this one place, only 1% of it is renewable sources. So it's incredibly unhealthy. So if we're

63
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,880
 talking about online carbon footprint... If I go to this town, can I find everyone's emails?

64
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,480
 Yeah, you're saying to me. But they're wishing through so fast. You need a net.

65
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,520
 Oh, you need a net. Yeah. Is that what the net is? Yeah, that's what the net is.

66
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,520
 Have you heard of eal houses? No. It's cool. There are two of these things in the UK, two only.

67
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,160
 And it's where you build a house over a river, and you have slew skates, which are designed to

68
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,280
 trap eals. So they're built in the middle ages. And you can, and you just, you know, trap all the eals

69
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,680
 as they head down the river once they feel the call. They're quite good at getting past obstacles,

70
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
 aren't they? So, you know, you've got to build a good gate. So they're really good slithering along

71
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,440
 the ground. And they can climb up dams and climb over them and stuff like that. And I think people

72
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,080
 when eals get obstructed by slightly too big dams, if you've got like a hoover situation,

73
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,520
 then people have built little eal ladders. So you can knit together reeds and stuff and they can

74
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,800
 climb up high. That's very like snakes and ladders, isn't it, eals and ladders? Yeah. The snakes are

75
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:01,200
 climbing the ladders. Oh my god. The game has changed. I was watching the cartoon cars the other day,

76
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,640
 you know, the Pixar. Yeah. So they're NASCAR cars in cars. And one of the things is that he goes into

77
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,720
 the wild and he gets lost at night because he doesn't have headlights. And I thought, okay, that's

78
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,840
 interesting. And I was reading into this. So NASCAR's don't have headlights for their cars. But when you

79
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,080
 look at them, they do, right? They're stickers. The headlights that you see on a NASCAR are stickers

80
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,120
 that are just put on there to look like they have real headlights. How do they light up? I don't think

81
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,320
 they, well, there's new technology where they do actually just have little beams that come out,

82
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,960
 but they don't need. I mean, that's a headlight. No, but still the sticker. So it's still, yeah,

83
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,600
 it's not a functioning headlight. Why? Why do they? Because presumably the races are at daytime or

84
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,600
 they're flood lit if they're later on in the day. So they don't need headlights to function in the race.

85
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,640
 Exactly. Yeah. So why do they do it? It's all to do with the manufacturers. In getting it past,

86
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,520
 they need the shape of the body to have the headlights spot. So apparently, it's to do with stock,

87
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,640
 but then they're not functional. So they just put stickers over the top. Because otherwise,

88
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,600
 it wouldn't be identified as a car or something. Exactly. Yeah. Can I just check? In the film cars,

89
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,920
 when the car goes into the wild, presumably he goes into the wild to the extent that there are

90
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,520
 well-tarmac surfaces in the wild. Yes. Okay, fine. So he just stays on roads, does he? He stays on

91
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,360
 roads. Yeah. No, he goes into the wild west of America. He goes off track. Yeah. But not literally

92
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,160
 off track. He goes literally off track in a sense of he goes on races in the sort of the dirty outback.

93
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,080
 Okay. But there's always a track there. No? Yeah, sometimes when he goes off the track,

94
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,960
 the dirty outback is a horrible phrase. Could we just vlog that? Could it probably yourself be referring to?

95
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:46,400
 The world record for cycling backwards is 333 kilometres in a day. And this is done by an Australian guy

96
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:54,880
 called Helinger. And he sits on top of his handlebars and faces backwards and then cycles forward. He

97
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,920
 cycles. The bike is going forward, but he's facing backwards. Yes. And he's sitting on his handlebars.

98
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,080
 Yeah. Yeah. He said, I first started riding backwards when I was a teenager to impress the girls.

99
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:15,920
 He's still single. Yeah. Ladies. He's married. He's married. Oh, great. That's so impressive. I mean,

100
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,160
 where was he doing this? Was it on roads? It was on roads, yeah. Was it on the island of roads?

101
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,880
 It was in Australia on roads. Okay. Because they've got a lot of, I guess, quite quiet roads.

102
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,600
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of long roads. Yeah. Dirty back passengers.

103
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:41,520
 Do you know where you can make pie out of hot dogs and do you know the recipe?

104
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,360
 Do you just, do you make the pastry and then put the whole hot dog in? Do you put the bread in the

105
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,840
 pastry? No, this is, I'm going to tell you the recipe and tell me when you know what joke I'm

106
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:57,760
 making. So the recipe is you drop frozen hot dogs onto a grid where the lines are further apart

107
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,680
 in length and the length of the hot dog. So that, you know, none of the lines are closer together

108
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,160
 than the length of the hot dog. I've got it. He's got it. It's James Harkin for the win.

109
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,960
 What am I doing? It's you're working out the mathematical number pie. It's the mathematical

110
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,320
 number pie. If you don't want to do it the normal way, which is remembering that it's 3.14,

111
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,400
 like we all know, you can, you do this. So it's really cool. So you basically toss a bunch of hot dogs,

112
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,560
 let's say a hundred hot dogs onto this grid and then you multiply the dog length by the number of

113
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,760
 dogs tossed and then you times that by two. So that's on the top of the equation. Right. And then

114
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,600
 you divide that by the distance between the lines and the number of dogs that have crossed over the

115
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,600
 lines. Okay. And then you will get the answer to what pie is. That's how it was originally worked out

116
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,160
 as well, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. It was. Yeah. It was aerosophonies, wasn't it? It had a lot of hot dogs.

117
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,000
 Yeah. Yeah. He did. He had cholesterol issues, but he was a great mathematician. People do know why I

118
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,400
 don't. I had limited time, but I still think that's really cool. Yeah. I found something at this weekend

119
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,280
 that was spooky. You know, Andy Murray, the tennis player, the objectively muttial famous Andy Murray.

120
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,040
 I found out. So I found out that he and I as children both owned hamsters called whiskey.

121
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,600
 Ah, really? Yeah. Really? That's an amazing fact. That is weird, isn't it? That was incredible.

122
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,840
 Were you playing tennis before you knew he played tennis? Well, yeah, at school. Yeah, but not like not

123
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,400
 as a weekend kind of you had training and stuff. No, no, no. Okay. I'm just, that would have been a

124
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,480
 connection as well. You can't discount the tennis. I do play tennis. You play tennis. You play tennis.

125
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,000
 You play tennis. The fact that you won. God, that's a slam. The fact that you won six one does not mean

126
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,480
 I do not play tennis. It just means. I just think it's playing in pretty fast and loose with the word

127
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:54,400
 play. Do you think there was just a hamster salesman going around? Not very good imagination for names.

128
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,400
 Wait, you don't, you name your own hamster. You don't have the pet shop owner name your hamster tell you

129
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,240
 when they sell it. We don't know that though. We don't know that he wasn't very subtly brilliant.

130
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,000
 You didn't name whiskey hamster. I went to big Larry's hamster in Poryl and Glasgow and

131
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:16,720
 in Dubai. You were told here's whiskey hamster. Of course I made it myself. Why did you call it whiskey?

132
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,440
 Because at that age you probably weren't drinking whiskey. Well, funny thing. No, it was because of

133
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,880
 the colour. Yeah, it was whiskey coloured. Okay. Yeah, and it's not my password for anything online

134
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,640
 guys, so nice try. The word alcatraz means "ganet" in Spanish, but when the island was named in 1775

135
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,920
 it actually meant pelicans. But the Spanish word for pelicans alcatraz actually came from the Arabic

136
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:49,040
 word for C. Eagle. Oh my god, I'm so confused. But basically the birdman of alcatraz is correct.

137
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,400
 Not really because there weren't any birds there. He was the birdman of another prison. They just

138
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,080
 gave him that name. They kept the first bit of his name when he got there. I thought he kept birds

139
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,240
 in alcatraz. No, he kept birds in the previous prison. They didn't have birds for him on alcatraz.

140
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,280
 What sounds like there are a lot of birds on alcatraz. So sorry, I'm coming to get you about this,

141
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:11,120
 the Spanish changed the meaning of their word for pelican to mean "ganet". When was this law part?

142
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,040
 Sometimes it wasn't a law. But it was sometimes between, I'm saying it's not a law,

143
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,520
 I know it was a law, but it was sometimes between 1775 and the modern way. If you go, someone was

144
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:33,120
 like, you know Eagle, that now refers to a magpie. There are seaweed bladders. So there are three

145
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,280
 bits of a seaweed plant. There's the holdfast, which is basically the root, and then there's the

146
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,400
 stipe, which is the stem, and then there are the blades. So it's very all analogous to a land plant,

147
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,400
 but some of them have these air-filled bladders, and the purpose is to hold them upright

148
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,880
 so they get more sunlight, which I didn't know. But the really big ones, they can get up to six

149
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,800
 inches wide these bladders, which I looked it up, is as wide as a human bladder. Is it?

150
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,720
 Yeah. And are they looking at the potential transplants? That's a human bladder of full stretch.

151
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,200
 Your bladder doesn't get much bigger than that. Bladders don't get bigger than this.

152
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:15,440
 When they had the first cars, they were all hand-painted, and the paint wasn't very good,

153
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,640
 and so after every year all the paint will flake off your car, and so you had to take it

154
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:27,520
 back and get it repainted every single year. And it would take about 40 days to complete painting

155
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:34,960
 the whole car. 40 days. No, that is a garage ripping you out. There was because you had to paint

156
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,400
 it by hand, but then you had to let it dry and do another coat, and it took ages for the cars to dry.

157
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,960
 Wow. Isn't that amazing? Because they had electricity at this point. You could get a hairdryer

158
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,720
 or something, couldn't you? Yeah, I suppose you could. Well, you know when you go through a car wash,

159
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,120
 they'd dry it at the end, don't they? Yeah. But you'd wash off the paint in the process again

160
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,360
 to the dryer. Oh, god, that would be awful. You'd have to do all this again. That's why it took 40 days.

161
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,160
 On the 39th, they're like, hang on, hang on. You don't get a lot of flammery these days.

162
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,000
 Notice that? Yeah, flammery, the old-school jelly. So again, in the olden days, there was just a

163
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 greater variety of jelly. It was like apples. It was before, you know, we went mass-market. I always

164
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,720
 thought it was like bulamonj flammery, is it? It is. It's bubble and mongers flammery jelly, really,

165
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,280
 isn't it? And so flammery was extremely popular 17th and 19th century. So it's made by apparently

166
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,360
 steeping oatmeal in water overnight and then boiling the strain thing you've got in the morning,

167
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,040
 and you add sugar, and it eventually turns into a kind of wobbly thing. And if you're wealthy,

168
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,160
 you had to have a huge array of flammery molds because they'd present flammery in different shapes

169
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,880
 on their tables. And so, and it was really popular to have flammery disguised as proper food. So

170
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,480
 flammery eggs and bacon was quite a common thing. So there are lots of, you know, molds where you'd

171
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,080
 look like you were about to eat eggs and bacon. Classic. And then you play Frank. And it's flammery.

172
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:08,560
 It's the best word. It's a great word, isn't it? And I wonder if that's where flammery comes from.

173
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,960
 You know, when you'd say some like flammery, it sort of falls flattery. I think so. It must be.

174
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,760
 But I wonder if it comes from the fact that it's false because flammery often disguised itself

175
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,960
 as these different delicious foods. Have you guys heard of frozen dead guy days?

176
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,000
 No, it doesn't sound like a thing. It's a real thing. This is an annual celebration that's held in

177
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,560
 the town of Netherland, Colorado. And it's basically in 1989, this is where the story begins,

178
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,240
 a man passed away. He was Norwegian and his grandson brought him over to America to have him frozen.

179
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,160
 And so they had him on ice. They brought him over. And after a few years they moved to

180
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,320
 Netherland and they built along with his mother, this big in their house, basically a shed that could

181
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:57,120
 just keep him going and keep him frozen. And then the son got deported. The grandson got deported

182
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,280
 to the mum had to look after it. And the authorities saw what was going on in the house. And she

183
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,480
 didn't have a few things like electricity and so on. It was a bit illegal. They discovered she had

184
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,200
 one bit of electricity for that, but not for the rest of the house. Anyway, her house... I'm just

185
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:19,840
 going to turn the TV on. No! Okay, you can turn the TV off for a bit. But once his ankles are

186
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,040
 thought out, we have to put it back on. But basically the house was in violation of local laws of

187
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,080
 what you need a house to be in. So she was going to be kicked out. And then they discovered that

188
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,840
 she was keeping her father frozen in the back. And they said, Agno, this is very illegal. So they

189
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,160
 wanted to get him out. And as a result, it had a lot of Hu Ha from the community saying, no, we

190
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,400
 can't have him thought out. He'll die. This is... They want to keep him going. So it worked out in

191
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,800
 their favor. And this man is still there. He's been moved to a different bit of the town. But as a

192
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,240
 result, they celebrate every year, Frozen Dead Guy Day. And it's a thing... The last one was in 2019

193
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,400
 that they had it. They have look-alike contests. They have... They have... They're being less and less

194
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:08,240
 flattering, presumably. They have... They have coffin races. And this is a thing where they build a fake

195
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,560
 coffin. There's an obstacle course. And they carry... It's teams of seven. And one of the seven is

196
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,760
 in the coffin. And they have to race around. They have frozen t-shirt competitions. There's a very

197
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,480
 cold area this place. They have ice cream that's made specifically for it, which has crushed

198
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,000
 Oreos and sour gummy worms inside. That's been a bit yummy. Bits are cool. Yeah, and it's been going on

199
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,800
 for all these years. So the last one was held March 8th to 10th 2019. And it looks as if they're going

200
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,360
 to keep going. So, when you're listening to this broadcast, you might have just missed it. Yeah,

201
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,440
 exactly. Wow. I mean, do you think there's any moment where she's going to think, is this

202
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,400
 slightly tasteless what I've done now? If... And obviously, it's the biggest if ever, if he wakes up

203
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,080
 at some point. He will be a local hero. Yeah. Imagine that day. That's going to be so exciting.

204
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,920
 Yeah, but he's going to wake up having passed away in Norway. Oh, he's going to wake up in Colorado

205
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:04,080
 with a language he probably doesn't speak with all these guys serving him ice creams. He's going to be

206
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:14,960
 weird. Do you want to know some Orkney language? Okay, teach you some. Boys, oh boys means unbelievable.

207
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,080
 Boys, oh boys. Boys, oh boys. B-E-U-Y-S. So I think it's boys. Okay.

208
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:29,120
 To dilder means to walk around aimlessly and slowly. Oh, yeah. I think it's a nice word that we

209
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:37,440
 can all take to just dildering around. And my favourite one is beer. The word beer means to complain

210
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,400
 on moan, which means it also means to wine. So the word beer means wine. Oh, that's very nice.

211
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:53,760
 Extremely confusing in the plepro pubs I'm sure they have. So grizzly bears can do one thing that I

212
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,240
 can't do. And that is user comb. They have been found using the comb using a comb, the only other

213
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:08,320
 species other than humans to do so. Cool. This was. They have bad peddlers going round their dens.

214
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,960
 This was in the Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska. And they, there was someone called Volkadeca

215
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:24,480
 from the University of St. Andrews. And Volk have found this grizzly bear picking up a rock

216
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,160
 from the water, looking at it, sort of turning it over, putting it back, picking another one up,

217
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,920
 looking at that one. And then with that sort of combing his fur with it around his muzzle. And then

218
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,920
 he would put it down and he would pick it up and do it again. And then Volkadeca went to have a look at

219
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,040
 these rocks and found that they had barnacles on them and worked out that what the bear was doing

220
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,440
 was looking for the right one. And the fact that he picked up the first one and then threw it away

221
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,800
 again means that he can discriminate between what's a good comb and what's a bad comb, which basically

222
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,680
 shows that he understands the fact that it's a tool. That's so cool. Isn't that amazing? I don't

223
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,760
 think of any rocks as being a good comb. Do they have, do they have sort of prongs on them? Well,

224
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:13,040
 they have barnacles on them. Yeah, okay, no, that does. Yeah, it'll do the job. You're a bear, you don't

225
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,480
 care. Yeah. Well, you've got a meeting to be smart at or something. It is legal to eat a dog.

226
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,160
 Yes. If it's not in all countries. True. But in this country, in the UK and in the USA, in 44

227
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,160
 states of the USA and here. You probably can't sell dog meat, can you? You can't sell it. But if

228
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:34,560
 it's your dog and you kill it humanely, you can do it. Yeah. People often associate South Korea

229
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:40,080
 don't they with eating dogs. And it is, there are no legal consequences for selling dog meat in

230
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:49,440
 South Korea, although it's officially classified as detestable. A lot of my behaviour is not illegal,

231
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:58,000
 but it is clearly detestable. There was a survey of Worldwide Spur Banks to see how common

232
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,120
 various different traits are. And so, statistically, if you get sperm from a sperm bank,

233
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,000
 your donor is most likely to be a Christian accountant with brown hair, brown eyes and white skin.

234
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,640
 And it's least likely to be a dark skinned jinjabadist. Not likely to be a 19-foot tall drawing.

235
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,000
 So it's least likely to be a dark skinned jinjabadist with black eyes.

236
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:33,680
 And they're very easy to sex, ohms, yeah, because they have translucent skin, so you can see the

237
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,920
 genitals through their skin. Wow. That's what just an aerial view you can see right through to the

238
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,880
 yeah, that's so great. Amazing. But they do, and the skin, this is so weird, so they're blind,

239
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,360
 which is, or they're nearly blind, which makes sense because they live in very, very dark

240
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,680
 case most of the time. But for the first four months, they do have eyes, and for the first four

241
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,040
 months of their life, their eyes are out on the outside, and then gradually skin grows over their eyes,

242
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,720
 meaning that they find it quite difficult to see. But thankfully, they can detect light with their

243
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,160
 skin, so it's kind of a happy story. Yeah, yeah. It's weird though, isn't it, to have functioning eyes

244
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,720
 that just get that they're overgrown? Yeah, they're overgrown by the thing that can also see.

245
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,960
 Yeah, it's weird. It's not. What's the point? Yeah. Oh, I'll just say.

246
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,280
 Well, there is no point James. Well, let's not look at this from the religious perspective.

247
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:33,600
 Stop the podcast. Stop the podcast. Hi, everyone. We'd like to let you know that we are not sponsored

248
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,680
 by anyone, but we are asking you to donate to the care workers charity. Yes, so the care workers

249
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,520
 charity is a charity that exists to support care workers who are having a hell of a time right now,

250
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,080
 as you can imagine. So either very low paid anyway, over 43% of care workers are paid below the real

251
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,400
 living wage. And at the moment with COVID, a lot of them are having to take a lot of time off work

252
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,600
 and losing even that wage. And so the care workers charity is setting up a fund where they're giving

253
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,320
 grants to people who are really suffering. Yes, lots of care workers have lost their income as a

254
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,360
 result of the crisis. There are so many care workers in the UK, two million of them, and many of

255
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,960
 those guys are on a low income. So anything that can be done to alleviate that pressure at this time

256
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,600
 is greatly appreciated. That's right. The care workers there at the absolute front of the

257
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,400
 coronavirus crisis at the moment, they're looking after the most vulnerable and most susceptible

258
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,040
 people in society. And if there's anything you could do to help, we would really, really appreciate it.

259
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:37,440
 And the thing that you can do specifically to help is you can go to qi.com/donate or just giving

260
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:44,000
 .com/nstaf, and you'll find the page where you can give money to this fantastic charity

261
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,080
 in exchange for listening to our weirdo facts. That's the deal. Is that a fair deal?

262
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,560
 Okay, on with the weirdo facts.

263
00:24:52,560 --> 00:25:01,920
 And another thing that you could get dotted art was HP sauce. That was originally only sold

264
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,640
 dotted art. No, if you wanted HP sauce in 1905, the only way you could get it was from a

265
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,840
 darts darts houseman. It was invented by Edwin Sanson Moore who had a darts darts darts vinegar

266
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,000
 and pickle company. So you just had to wait. You just had to wait. If the darts darts

267
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
 all guy came around yesterday and he suddenly needs it, it's like, you won't be back for another

268
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,120
 three months. If you make a big sandwich, you better make it at the right time. Did he,

269
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,600
 I just, that sounds terrifying. The HP sauce man coming down the street with his,

270
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,440
 did he have a like a backpack full of HP sauce? He just squirt it into your home.

271
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,960
 What do you mean like a milkman does today? Why is that where your brain went with that?

272
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,880
 I don't understand. I'm just picturing him in a costume, which is the bottle of HP sauce.

273
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,800
 And then he sort of leans his head forward and squeezes his slides into your house.

274
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,800
 Disgusting. Disgusting. No, he didn't do that. No, you thought you were peddling license

275
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:05,520
 remote. You know how you're saying that 11 can mean like a bad car. You know the limon rally.

276
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:13,440
 Yes. Have you heard of the lemon? No. So this is a real thing. It's in America.

277
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,080
 And the rules are that you have to drive a car that is valued at less than $500. So you have to

278
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,160
 drive a really terrible car. And before you turn up, they look at all the cars and they put you into

279
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:32,480
 three categories. Either shit car, really shit car, or probably not going to finish the race car.

280
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,360
 And the price is a better for the worst cars. So you get more dollars if you're driving a really,

281
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:44,480
 really shit car. And the way that they work it out that you can't cheat is because at the end of

282
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,280
 the race, according to the rules, they're allowed to purchase any vehicle for $500. So if you turn

283
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:57,200
 up with a Bugatti or something, then they by law have to be able to buy it off you for $500. That's

284
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,320
 price in their history. They've looked at it and gone, you know what, that's worth more than $500.

285
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,120
 I want to buy it off you. That's so funny. Isn't that cool? That's great. Is that in America?

286
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,880
 In America, yeah. And there's a load of, I mean, it's a bit silly, but there's a load of rules. So

287
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,840
 if you kind of break some laws, you might have to get out of your car and run around the track

288
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,040
 singing, "I'm a little teapot." It's a bit of a silly thing, but it's kind of cool. Do you have to do

289
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,080
 the gestures as well? I think you do. You would have to. It's about on the song, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

290
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,120
 Does anyone have any more on the manchineal specifically? Well, what I can say is, so the manchineal

291
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,920
 belongs to a genus called euphobia. And there's a more famous plants that comes from that genus,

292
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,560
 and that is the poinsettia. So it's basically the same thing. And the Christmas thing, there's like

293
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:50,560
 red Christmas plants, and they're also a little bit kind of poisonous. There's a myth that they kill

294
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,160
 dogs, isn't there, and stuff like that, I think. They're not quite that poisonous, but they are quite

295
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:00,400
 poisonous. And the reason I find this really interesting. The reason we have poinsettias at Christmas

296
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:07,360
 is because there was a family called the Eek family, ECKE. I don't know if that's how you pronounce it.

297
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:14,080
 And they found a way to make the poinsettia bloom in the winter, because it's actually a summer plant.

298
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,360
 And when they did that, they wanted to sell it, but they didn't know how to do this.

299
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,880
 And so they sent it to loads of TV studios around Christmas time in the hope that the TV studios

300
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,560
 who just wanted to put something in the background will put this poinsettia in the background.

301
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,600
 And it just so happened that this was just when color television had started. And so all the producers

302
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,000
 were like, well, look at this red plant. This is going to show up really well on the new color TV.

303
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,960
 And so all of the TV shows around that time started putting poinsettias in their Christmas shows.

304
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,320
 And then that's why today you'll might have these in your house at Christmas.

305
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,040
 That's really cool. It's a mistletoe a bit poisonous as well.

306
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,960
 Yeah. So we're just surrounding ourselves in poisons during the Christmas period.

307
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,920
 Yeah. It's exciting. Just don't eat it. Don't eat mistletoe.

308
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,440
 Yeah. And don't eat Holly as well. That's going to sting on the way down.

309
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,160
 Yeah. On the way out.

310
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,840
 Don't eat the plants. Don't eat my plant.

311
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,400
 Okay, I get it. I get it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

312
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,000
 See the food. I actually did this once. So which thing? The miniaturization thing.

313
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,440
 I'll explain better. At the end of university, sometimes they take a photo of all of you,

314
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,040
 you know, on your graduation day and your gowns and things.

315
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,400
 Yeah. And they to get you to buy the photo of your whole year at university, they send you a tiny,

316
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,120
 like a two inch by three inch photo of your whole year at university.

317
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,160
 And you can't really see yourself. You can't see who anyone is.

318
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,800
 No, but it's just to encourage you to splat out on the main thing.

319
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
 I just kept the miniaturization on and framed that.

320
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,600
 Amazing.

321
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,920
 My home. I've got a tiny photo of my whole year at university.

322
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,960
 I can't tell where I am.

323
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,120
 Do you have a memory of where you were on the day?

324
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,160
 No. I don't know. Not anymore. No, it's been too long.

325
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,120
 So I'm in there. I'm in there though. That's the main thing.

326
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,920
 Are you sure? Are you? It's what actually happened.

327
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,760
 You didn't graduate and you said to your parents, oh, look, I'm in this picture.

328
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,440
 That's me, the little blob in the car.

329
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
 I'm wearing the same clothes. You really can't tell.

330
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,920
 That's kind of like a caricature of some sort of de-kenzy and parsimonious, you know, stingy bastard.

331
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,480
 Well, if you see that on the wall.

332
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,440
 I've saved about 25 pounds by doing that. Thank you very much.

333
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,760
 And 10 years later, when I can't see myself and my own graduation, it's worth it.

334
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,080
 I can't ring up now and say, have you got that info?

335
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:35,520
 I'm willing to, I've decided I'm willing to buy it. I've made a decision.

336
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
 Do you know that before they had bumper stickers?

337
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,000
 So bumper stickers were invented by this guy called Forest Gill.

338
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,920
 And it was in the 50s, I think, late 50s.

339
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,520
 But before that, drivers would have handmade placards that they tie to their cards with pieces of twine.

340
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,200
 So if you wanted to say who you're going to vote for in the election,

341
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,760
 you would just get a placard and tie it to your car.

342
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,920
 It's not cool. You just tie a bit of card to your car.

343
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,760
 Really cool. I can't. I'm trying to figure out where you'd tie it.

344
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,800
 Maybe onto those roof rack bars, if you've got those.

345
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,320
 I think where your bumper is, maybe.

346
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,360
 Yeah, it would be about this.

347
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,200
 You would just have a small placard when you, the size of a sticker, almost.

348
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,600
 How do you, what do you tie it around?

349
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,880
 The bumper.

350
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,080
 I'm going to have to see, I forgot my card.

351
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:23,760
 I saw this amazing tweet by this guy called Frank Paul, who's like a quizmer in the UK.

352
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,200
 And he found this Wikipedia article about a movie called Okay Connery.

353
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,640
 Have you heard about this?

354
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,120
 So this was like a spoof of James Bond made in Italy.

355
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,480
 And the way it started is Neil Connery, who is Sean Connery's brother,

356
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
 was working as a plasterer in Scotland.

357
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,120
 And he was sacked for losing his tools.

358
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,360
 And then this got into the tab like newspaper.

359
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,480
 This really has his all real.

360
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,920
 Oh, I thought you meant they'd made all this up.

361
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,320
 No, no, no, so this Neil Connery is real.

362
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,760
 He was working as a plasterer.

363
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,360
 He lost his tools and he got fired.

364
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,800
 And so it was in all the newspapers that Sean Connery's brother's just been fired for losing his tools.

365
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,000
 And when this guy who was making a movie,

366
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,960
 almost a minute slow news day.

367
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,840
 And then these people in Italy kind of heard about this.

368
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,720
 And they saw him in interviews on the local news.

369
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,800
 And he sounded just like Sean Connery.

370
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,640
 And so they thought, why don't we make a movie with Neil Connery,

371
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,800
 where he's pretending to be James Bond.

372
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,800
 And they made this movie called "Okay, Connery", which is apparently terrible.

373
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,400
 Which is, yeah, why does it sound incredible?

374
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,600
 And apparently also it was filmed without any live sounds.

375
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,400
 Neil Connery had appendicitis when they were filming it.

376
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,920
 And it was really sick and he couldn't really speak properly.

377
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,120
 So we got Sean in to dub it.

378
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,920
 But we added all the voices in later in the film.

379
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,720
 So everyone's licksinking and they added all the voices later on.

380
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,400
 And apparently it's one of the worst films ever.

381
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,000
 That sounds, that does sound amazing.

382
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,160
 It's incredible.

383
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,880
 I was looking on Reddit.

384
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,880
 And there is a bit on Reddit called TIFU,

385
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,960
 which means today I fucked up.

386
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,360
 And someone posted TIFU.

387
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:15,760
 Today I fucked up by putting "I voted stickers on my nipples for the sake of getting in my husband's pants."

388
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,080
 It was painful to remove.

389
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,400
 "Do not do this, no matter how sexy."

390
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:26,160
 Just goes into a load of details about how they got stuck on her nipples.

391
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
 And she couldn't remove them, no matter what she did.

392
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,480
 Oh, but it's so sexy!

393
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,720
 No, no matter how sexy it is, Anna, you mustn't do it.

394
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,120
 I'm gonna do it, hurry that.

395
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,240
 She said, "When I pulled on it, my nipple is stretched sideways, almost bringing me to tears."

396
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,880
 Oh gosh.

397
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,680
 I said, weirdly, the thing I remember from a while ago, Reddit.

398
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,760
 They've never done really any advertising,

399
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,360
 probably except for one thing, which is they spent $500.

400
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
 And I think this is in the whole history of Reddit.

401
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,920
 They spent $500 on promotional stickers.

402
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,400
 Okay.

403
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,320
 It's the only advertising they've ever done.

404
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,640
 Okay, one put them sort of around.

405
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,440
 Yeah, I guess so.

406
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,480
 Just some people's nipples.

407
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
 And they're still there to this day.

408
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,280
 So it's very well spent advertising money, actually.

409
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,400
 If you want to get sperm from a bee, it's really difficult, right?

410
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,760
 Because they're quite small.

411
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,960
 They don't make much sperm.

412
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,080
 And presumably, if you aren't trying to force them out,

413
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,360
 would be it will try to sting you?

414
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,320
 Probably will.

415
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,600
 Yeah, so what you do is you pick up your little drone bee,

416
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,080
 and then you squeeze its abdominal muscles

417
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,480
 to mimic a natural mating event.

418
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,200
 Okay.

419
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,600
 And then the pressure exposes the bee's penis.

420
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,640
 Bee's penis.

421
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
 Bee's penis.

422
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,440
 Yeah.

423
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,520
 And a little speck of semen comes out.

424
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,800
 And you have to do it loads of times,

425
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,280
 because obviously you need lots of semen, right?

426
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,160
 If you're going to use it, you don't just want one little speck

427
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,760
 and you need lots of specks.

428
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,720
 But the problem is that just like in real life,

429
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,200
 if a drone has sex, it immediately dies.

430
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,000
 And this is what happens to these bees as well.

431
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,080
 They basically go to the sperm donor's bank

432
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,040
 and never come back.

433
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,240
 Oh, no.

434
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,440
 Oh, wow.

435
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,000
 That's an even worse environment

436
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,680
 than the normal human donation places.

437
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,040
 If you have to go into a room full of corpses of previous donors.

438
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,160
 I'm sorry. So is this not what you're into?

439
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,160
 So I've read a whole thing about sort of

440
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,600
 toy logistics these days.

441
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,000
 And it's a nightmare for toy shop owners

442
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,560
 who as soon as a craze comes in,

443
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,120
 they have to basically buy quick and sell quick.

444
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,040
 And then they don't know what the next thing's going to be.

445
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,080
 So you can't stock up.

446
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,920
 You can't really pre-plan it.

447
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,120
 So it's a real painful.

448
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,800
 They have like a tie fair every year,

449
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,280
 don't they?

450
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,520
 Or they have a few of them where everyone says,

451
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,800
 this is going to be the next big thing.

452
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,320
 This is going to be the next big thing.

453
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,760
 Who knows what it's going to be.

454
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,080
 It's like exciting, really.

455
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,720
 Yeah.

456
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,840
 But it's the opposite of what the beany baby people did.

457
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,240
 Oh, yeah.

458
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,800
 Well, do you remember the deliberately restricted supply?

459
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,840
 Did that?

460
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,800
 Yeah.

461
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,560
 That was our fidget spinner, really.

462
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,440
 Wasn't it the beany baby?

463
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,160
 That was our phrase.

464
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
 No, I was too old for that.

465
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,560
 Oh, no.

466
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,000
 You were the spinning top, obviously.

467
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,360
 But I was the wheel of the stick.

468
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,160
 Who used to run down those streets in Laikershire?

469
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,360
 Rolled it by wheel.

470
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,160
 So they basically had loads of beany babies,

471
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,800
 but they said we're only going to sell this many of them

472
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,760
 so that they were tomorrow.

473
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,960
 Yeah, they would risk it.

474
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,320
 This toyship owner, she said that normally,

475
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,480
 toy sales reps come into your store.

476
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,080
 And they try and sell you as they say,

477
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,760
 please buy as many units as you can.

478
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,360
 The beany babies reps will come in.

479
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,040
 And you'd say, please, I need a beany baby

480
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,240
 elephant to sell to my clients.

481
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,440
 And they'd say, no.

482
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,560
 And it was really.

483
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,600
 Well, it was their way of, it was basically

484
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,720
 like the diamond cartel.

485
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,400
 They were just driving up demand as much.

486
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,840
 They couldn't, it really worked.

487
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,920
 That's, that's balsy, isn't it?

488
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

489
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,400
 So clever.

490
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,840
 It was the only days of kind of using technology

491
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,680
 to spy on these shopkeepers, basically,

492
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,280
 because the beany baby makers

493
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,560
 would keep exact records of precisely what beany babies

494
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,040
 they'd been selling and how well they'd been doing it.

495
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,440
 And they would confiscate various beany babies

496
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,040
 from if they weren't doing it very well.

497
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,280
 And they wouldn't let big shops like Toys or Us

498
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,360
 or Walmart stock them, because they didn't want to

499
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,960
 invalidate the brand.

500
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,560
 And it sounded bizarre.

501
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,160
 And the only way that you could get them

502
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,040
 was to call a sales rep and then have a conversation

503
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,200
 with the sales rep and sort of reveal secrets

504
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,280
 about what the kids in your shop were saying

505
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,640
 about what beany babies they liked.

506
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,280
 Wow.

507
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
 So they could get the inside scoop.

508
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,240
 Wow.

509
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,640
 It's no wonder you millennials are self-fucked up.

510
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:38,240
 There was a 1904 carousel up for auction.

511
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,600
 Very beautiful.

512
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,720
 There was a park in Cleethorpe's selling it.

513
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,320
 Pleasure Island, it was called.

514
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,240
 And there were no bids.

515
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,480
 And the reserve price was £180,000.

516
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,160
 Because obviously it's a huge, you know,

517
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,080
 complicated, beautiful bit of machinery.

518
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,920
 And then just before bidding clothes,

519
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,240
 there was one bid for £180,000.

520
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,840
 And it was sold.

521
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,280
 And the owners must have thought,

522
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,160
 "Oh, thank goodness we've managed to sell this carousel."

523
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,960
 And it turns out it was from a Lincoln Sherman

524
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,200
 who had been trying to close the window

525
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,720
 and accidentally pressed bid.

526
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:16,480
 And he had legally bought it.

527
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,680
 He was in the hole with fees for £245,000.

528
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,560
 Oh no.

529
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,120
 Is there no safety net for that kind?

530
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,400
 Well, as they pointed out,

531
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,320
 the bid button is in the middle of the screen,

532
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,320
 not the top corner where they hadn't put bid next to the X

533
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,080
 or anything like that.

534
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,000
 Eventually, they let him off the hook

535
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,880
 and they did not force him to spend his entire life

536
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,440
 savings on a carousel.

537
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,560
 I think that's fair enough.

538
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,760
 Given that I get, you know,

539
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,160
 if I'm on the most irrelevant website and tried to leave it,

540
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,880
 it'll say, "Are you sure you want to leave this site?"

541
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,360
 I think in the very least, they should have that box pop up.

542
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,560
 Yeah, are you sure you want to spend

543
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
 a quarter million pounds on the carousel?

544
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,200
 Actually, no.

545
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,000
 So funny.

546
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,840
 I was trying to find out how you fit

547
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,360
 that many clowns in a car.

548
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,040
 It turns out it's very simple.

549
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,760
 You just get a car and you remove everything.

550
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,200
 Literally everything from it.

551
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,000
 You know, seats and what else is in a car?

552
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
 Ashtray.

553
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,680
 The steering wheel.

554
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,400
 Ashtray.

555
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,600
 I think you keep the steering wheel.

556
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,800
 You keep one or two things.

557
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
 But then, the record,

558
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
 and you have to fortify the springs as well

559
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
 because it's normally a reasonably small car

560
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,920
 for comedy purposes.

561
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,600
 And the record for the number of clowns in a car

562
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,880
 is 31 in a Citroen 2CV,

563
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,080
 which is quite a small car.

564
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,360
 Yeah, that is not socially distancing.

565
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,320
 No.

566
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,440
 It's the opposite.

567
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:39,840
 No.

568
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,680
 Were they children?

569
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,880
 Or were they?

570
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,840
 No, they were.

571
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,160
 They were, I believe, human adult clowns.

572
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,080
 It feels like that's too many.

573
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,960
 As in, if I had to guess how many clowns

574
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,560
 you could get in a Citroen,

575
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,160
 I would have gone way under.

576
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,120
 Like way, way, way under.

577
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,520
 But that's, well, I think that's why it's a world record.

578
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,320
 I think...

579
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,840
 No, I do see that, but it's...

580
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,160
 I would have thought that the world record

581
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,440
 would be just a little bit more

582
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,640
 than I could possibly imagine.

583
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,880
 But this is a lot more than I could possibly imagine.

584
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,840
 Freethin clowns.

585
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,400
 Yeah.

586
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,640
 Have you guys heard of the Great Corn Cobb fire?

587
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,240
 No.

588
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,600
 Of 1958.

589
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,440
 Oh, the 1950s, oh no.

590
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,640
 Yeah, of course.

591
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,440
 Yeah.

592
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,200
 Okay, this was in Memphis, Tennessee.

593
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,280
 And the Quakers, Quakers, Quaker Oats, the firm,

594
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,920
 they used corn cobs at the time to get a particular chemical.

595
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,000
 And they had a stockpile at their plant

596
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,200
 of 70,000 tons of corn cobs, okay?

597
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,000
 Wow.

598
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,800
 Imagine the size of that.

599
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,920
 It was six stories high.

600
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,040
 And some people noticed in 1958,

601
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,880
 oh, the pile of corn cobs is really smoldering a lot.

602
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,000
 And it burst and deflamed.

603
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 It spontaneously combusted because the heat

604
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,840
 had been generated inside it.

605
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,200
 And even so, this huge massive corn cob fire,

606
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,120
 and even worse, as it burned,

607
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,680
 it formed a kind of shell over its surface.

608
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,640
 It kind of crusted over with this chemical,

609
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,360
 which could not, which reflected the water back

610
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,960
 onto the firefighters, basically.

611
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,040
 They had to use bulldozers to crash into this massive pile,

612
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
 but just to inject the water

613
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,800
 through this weird surface that it formed.

614
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,000
 Surringe it through.

615
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,200
 Basically, yeah.

616
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,920
 I know.

617
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,440
 I want to see the TV show Chernobyl.

618
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,480
 Very good show.

619
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,240
 I want to see the sequel, which is about this,

620
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,440
 because it seems like it's almost as exciting, right?

621
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:25,920
 Cornobyl.

622
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,440
 Corn cobble.

623
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,480
 Corn cobble.

624
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,360
 Corn cobble.

625
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,080
 There you go.

626
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,920
 It's good that you showed us your working for that joke.

627
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,400
 Yeah.

628
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,680
 Thanks.

629
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,160
 I have a historical use of Lufa's,

630
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,560
 which may have changed the course of the Second World War.

631
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,360
 Wow.

632
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,160
 So, a Lufa was used in the Second World War

633
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,880
 to convince Churchill of a point, okay?

634
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,520
 So, he was in a boat in 1943.

635
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,480
 He was sailing to America to discuss war strategy

636
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,840
 with President Roosevelt, right?

637
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,000
 And this was in the planning of D-Day,

638
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,240
 and there was one thing they used in D-Day,

639
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,920
 which were called these mulberry harbors.

640
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,320
 And they basically were large floating platforms

641
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,920
 that were slightly out at sea.

642
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,760
 And if you had those out at sea,

643
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,320
 then in, you know, closer to shore,

644
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,520
 the waters would become.

645
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,360
 So that was incredibly useful for landing troops,

646
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,320
 because it means you don't have to have

647
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,720
 choppy waters while you're trying to get troops on shore.

648
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,880
 So, Churchill was in the bath on this ship in the Atlantic,

649
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,760
 and his scientific advisor, Professor John Bernal,

650
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,920
 was trying to teach him about these mulberry harbors,

651
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,560
 and he used a Lufa as an example.

652
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,720
 He put some paper boats in Churchill's bath

653
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,520
 with Churchill in it, and then he stirred the water around,

654
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,880
 and he used a Lufa to say, "Look,

655
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
 this is, if we had a giant Lufa,

656
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,560
 this is how we protect our ships."

657
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,840
 And that was how the Lufa helped to win the war, basically.

658
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,240
 Wow.

659
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,920
 And that's why at D-Day,

660
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,760
 they also had those massive rubber ducks

661
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,040
 on either side of it as well.

662
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
 (laughter)

663
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,560
 But I would hope as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,

664
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,160
 we could have a bath in peace.

665
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,680
 That people will come in and meet you.

666
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,080
 No, Churchill was famous for it, wasn't he?

667
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,560
 Yeah.

668
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,600
 Yeah.

669
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,600
 It's interesting, because now, I think it would be,

670
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,920
 and like now, it's a charming eccentricity

671
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,760
 to look back on Churchill having a bath

672
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,440
 and having scientific advice on the bath.

673
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,600
 But if we heard that Boris Johnson or Donald Trump

674
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,640
 by having meetings in the bath.

675
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,480
 We would be completely unsurprised.

676
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,800
 (laughter)

677
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,040
 You know drafts.

678
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,400
 Yes.

679
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,960
 Yeah, drafts, it turns out, has been solved.

680
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,480
 Okay.

681
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,080
 There is now, there is now a,

682
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,680
 there is now no point in playing draft

683
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,080
 because there is a correct way to play it.

684
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,640
 Oh, no.

685
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,440
 And this was worked out by a computer games expert

686
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,840
 called Jonathan Schaeffer, the University of Alberta.

687
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:43,360
 He set a number of computers playing it.

688
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,880
 At the peak of his work,

689
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,960
 there were 200 desktop computers,

690
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,880
 which he had playing drafts full-time

691
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,480
 to work out the combinations.

692
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,120
 (laughter)

693
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,000
 Out of play.

694
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,800
 Wow.

695
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,520
 Imagine how annoying that would be

696
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,800
 if you were trying to get a computer

697
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,000
 at the University of Alberta.

698
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,040
 (laughter)

699
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,680
 All of Jonathan's 200 machines were playing drafts.

700
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,240
 (laughter)

701
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,160
 And it's not like you save your lives, is it?

702
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,280
 Well, you know, when he explains it

703
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,480
 why you can't use it.

704
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,120
 (laughter)

705
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,640
 You're trying to solve drafts.

706
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,320
 (laughter)

707
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,800
 But it turns out that there are 10 to the 20,

708
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,920
 sorry, there are 10 to the power

709
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,640
 of 20 different positions for the game.

710
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,480
 Okay.

711
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,520
 And even if there are fewer than 10 pieces

712
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,320
 on the board at the end,

713
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,360
 there are still 39 trillion end-game positions

714
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,560
 which are possible.

715
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,800
 So there's quite a lot of numbers to craft.

716
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,600
 Yeah, exactly.

717
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,200
 So you say that it's solved, Andy,

718
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,120
 but unless you and I are playing

719
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,440
 and we both have 50 computers

720
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,960
 telling us what to do each time

721
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,040
 and we're willing to wait for about six hours

722
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,880
 between each move, then presumably.

723
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,560
 (laughter)

724
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,000
 That's how I play all my games.

725
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,120
 It's the game's oppression.

726
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,760
 (laughter)

727
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,760
 Ewigs do have this really unfortunate,

728
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,880
 not predator, parasite, really,

729
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,240
 that I was reading about.

730
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,720
 And it's the, I found this out

731
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,000
 because there's a guy called Ryan Herbison

732
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,960
 who's a researcher who collected 1,300 earwigs

733
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,760
 to investigate it, which I think it must be so weird.

734
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,920
 He was just wandering along a beach collecting earwigs

735
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,640
 and he's looking out for these things called murmithids

736
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,160
 and they're just one of those parasites

737
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,360
 that takes over your brain.

738
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,640
 We've talked about this kind of thing before,

739
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,480
 but I always find them incredible.

740
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,880
 So he collected all these earwigs,

741
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,400
 opened up their brains and found murmithids inside lots of them.

742
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,040
 And what they do is they make them hydro-taxic,

743
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,440
 as in they make them want to go to water,

744
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,120
 they want to go to get wet,

745
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,120
 or they make them act really erratically

746
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,400
 so they hop around until they see a pond and then jump in it.

747
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,200
 And they can't swim, so they immediately drown.

748
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,640
 And then that's perfect

749
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,840
 because these parasites' little babies are aquatic

750
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,440
 and so then they can swim.

751
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,240
 Oh no.

752
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,080
 They turn them into water lovers.

753
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,520
 I just, I just find it amazing

754
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,680
 that these things exist that control the minds

755
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,880
 with so many animals.

756
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,000
 Yeah.

757
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,800
 Yeah, that's wicked.

758
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,000
 They also do this really cool thing

759
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,720
 where they can stop predators

760
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,680
 from getting a taste for them and their family

761
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,920
 by once they're, when they're being eaten,

762
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
 let's say, by a lizard.

763
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,760
 They vomit inside them as they're being eaten.

764
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,400
 So they vomit inside the lizard into the lizard's mouth

765
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,760
 and they release a smell which is like rotting flesh,

766
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,000
 which the lizard hates

767
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,320
 because I usually, when I think of animals,

768
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,360
 I just think they don't care about the taste of things, right?

769
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,360
 They just, it's about food.

770
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,880
 It's all yucky.

771
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,640
 Like, they don't have taste buds.

772
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,600
 But apparently they don't have taste.

773
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,440
 A whole series of weird revelations

774
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,920
 there about your preconceptions, but sure.

775
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,880
 Why do you think a lizard would just eat whatever, right?

776
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,560
 But this will actively,

777
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,160
 once they release this vile-smelling toxic

778
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,000
 into the mouth of the lizard,

779
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,080
 the lizard will not only spit them out,

780
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,600
 but it will spend time after it's going,

781
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,760
 and try to wipe away this thing from their mouth.

782
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,840
 And the idea is that I'm not sure

783
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,600
 if the earwig will survive the one that's been chewed,

784
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,240
 or if that's, I think, it's more about passing on

785
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,520
 the distaste to never want to eat an earwig again

786
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,480
 for the future lizards, or that one lizard.

787
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,880
 So sacrificing yourself for the sake of the clan,

788
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,160
 like Bruce Willis and Armageddon?

789
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,360
 Yes, exactly.

790
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,320
 Yeah, it's a lot.

791
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,040
 Oh, Anna, stop spoiling films for James.

792
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:15,840
 I'm sorry.

793
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,000
 Don't listen, James.

794
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,880
 I wasn't, I wasn't.

795
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,480
 That's, wow, that is amazing.

796
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,360
 Do you know, Dan, you live with a dog at the moment?

797
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,040
 No, I'm not anymore.

798
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,760
 Oh, really?

799
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,520
 Because I was going to say, when you give it dog food,

800
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,080
 do you just think, fuck it, eat any old shit?

801
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,200
 Doesn't have any taste buds.

802
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,240
 I was thinking more like lizards, rather than,

803
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,840
 I don't think, like, when I feed my son,

804
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,520
 I think, hey, he's young, fuck it, he hasn't got taste buds yet.

805
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,880
 It's more. He's got more.

806
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,720
 Dan, he's got three times as many as you.

807
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,680
 Oh, yeah.

808
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,040
 Well, I'll stop feeding him dog food now.

809
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,880
 Hey, just while we're talking about Spain,

810
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,960
 Spain obviously has that big Christmas lottery,

811
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,680
 which is El Gordo, the fat one.

812
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,440
 And it's the big, big prize.

813
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,000
 Did you guys read that in 2011?

814
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,120
 It was won.

815
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,280
 And it's, you know, people win it.

816
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,080
 But this one town in Spain, called Sadeto,

817
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,800
 every single resident there,

818
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,600
 the 70 households won this lottery.

819
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,560
 And the thing is, is that the way they do it is,

820
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,320
 sometimes these towns club together,

821
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,800
 and they buy this big, they buy the one lottery ticket.

822
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,960
 And then they go around to each house,

823
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,280
 and they say, do you want to be a participant in this?

824
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,800
 So you get a participation ticket.

825
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,000
 So this entire town did it of 70 households,

826
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,600
 which was over 200 people.

827
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,960
 They all won the lottery except one guy,

828
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,360
 because they forgot to knock on his door.

829
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,560
 Oh, wow.

830
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,080
 Surely they shared it within.

831
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,680
 They didn't, no, they didn't.

832
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,240
 And he, he had moved to the town,

833
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,600
 because he was in love with this girl.

834
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,160
 It didn't work out, so he decided to stay.

835
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,560
 So he was renovating in this new place,

836
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,040
 and the people who went around selling the tickets

837
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,920
 just didn't think to go and sell him a ticket.

838
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,600
 So he remembers waking up on the day,

839
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,880
 and he's a cinematographer.

840
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,880
 He does a lot of filming.

841
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,880
 And everyone was on the streets running around.

842
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,760
 He had no idea why.

843
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,920
 They were in their socks running out of their face,

844
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,360
 because they'd all just heard the news.

845
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,320
 And he filmed it all.

846
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,360
 He filmed the joy, but behind that camera is the one man

847
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,080
 who didn't get any of the benefits from it.

848
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,120
 That is fun.

849
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,720
 And they want a huge amount.

850
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,960
 Like if you paid in lower amounts,

851
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,160
 the least that was earned by someone

852
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,840
 who got some money was around $100,000.

853
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,840
 That was like the lowest on it.

854
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,360
 So as a result, once the news came out,

855
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,280
 all of these business people descended on the town,

856
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,720
 trying to sell them B&W cars, business managers came in,

857
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,200
 and the whole town now, there's people on the way home

858
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,280
 having to hide as they leave the cafe,

859
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,840
 because they can see that really persistent bank manager

860
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,280
 sitting on his car looking from more residents to sign up.

861
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,360
 So it's kind of turned into a hellhole for a lot of them.

862
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,200
 So really, the one guy who didn't win

863
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,720
 is laughing at everyone else's faces,

864
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,640
 because he can just say to those hastlers,

865
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,160
 "Mate, I'm the one that didn't win it.

866
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,040
 I've got nothing for you."

867
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,480
 Just one more thing on hangovers.

868
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,560
 I found a survey.

869
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,440
 By, I think it was a rehab website,

870
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,520
 about, it was a survey of 1,000 drinkers

871
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,680
 about what they would do to avoid a hangover.

872
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,360
 Like, what sacrifices they would make

873
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,040
 to never have a hangover again.

874
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,520
 Okay.

875
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,080
 So I just want to run these party and see if you'd agree.

876
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,200
 So a third of people said they would pay more for their drinks

877
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,640
 if it meant they would never have a hangover.

878
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,400
 Yeah? Okay.

879
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:22,960
 Yeah. Okay.

880
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,160
 Depends on much more, but yeah.

881
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:24,960
 If you can afford it.

882
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,240
 Um, about a third said they would give up watching sports forever.

883
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,400
 Oh gosh. No.

884
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,440
 I'm finding the last few weeks quite hard.

885
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,520
 So, um, probably wouldn't do that.

886
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,000
 Okay.

887
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,360
 It was, it was way more women than men

888
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,520
 said they would give up watching sports forever.

889
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,840
 Um, they, so 2% of women said they would give up sex

890
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,040
 for the rest of their lives.

891
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,440
 Um, 0% of men said they would give up sex forever

892
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,160
 to avoid a hangover.

893
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,680
 Yeah, I understand that.

894
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,040
 Some of them get a bit dark.

895
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,840
 So, um, sacrificing a stranger's life,

896
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,680
 um, 9% of men said yes, 9%.

897
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,520
 Giving up a fingertip, 6% of men, 3% of women,

898
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,600
 allegedly, 6% of men,

899
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,280
 and 1% of women would kill their pets to avoid hangovers.

900
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,080
 For the rest of your life.

901
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,000
 If you've got pet crickets or something,

902
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,920
 then that actually is not so bad.

903
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,440
 Yeah.

904
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,880
 I wouldn't give up crickets,

905
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,480
 but I would give up crickets.

906
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,280
 Hey!

907
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,040
 Do you guys know the first reference to Hair of the Dog?

908
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,080
 That's really surprised by this.

909
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,400
 No, um, the Bible.

910
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,160
 It's such an even pre-bible.

911
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,440
 It's 400 BC.

912
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,800
 And it's in a, um,

913
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,680
 recommendation by guy called Antiphanies,

914
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,240
 who was recommending basically homiopathic treatments,

915
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,840
 which is sort of what Hair of the Dog is.

916
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,240
 It's sort of like a little bit of the thing that makes you ill.

917
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,120
 Um, and he says take the hair,

918
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,920
 so this is translated from the Greek and made nice and poetic,

919
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,120
 but take the hair, it is well written of the Dog,

920
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,960
 by which your bitten, work off one wine with his brother,

921
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,480
 work off one labour with another.

922
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,360
 Hmm.

923
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,680
 It works to an extent, actually, Hair of the Dog.

924
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,200
 First of all, it obviously makes you feel better,

925
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,640
 because you're getting a bit drunk again,

926
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,480
 so we all know that kind of works.

927
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,000
 But they think now it works,

928
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,080
 because there's something we've discussed before.

929
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,320
 Dan, do you remember that fact you had where they cured that guy

930
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,160
 of alcohol poisoning by feeding him beer?

931
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,960
 Yeah, that's right.

932
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,360
 And it's because of the methanol.

933
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,560
 So all alcoholic drinks contain tiny amounts of methanol,

934
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,400
 and they think that might be a large part of what's making you feel bad with a hangover.

935
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,600
 And if you drink more alcohol, then the ethanol in that,

936
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,880
 actually, is digested before the methanol,

937
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,640
 so the methanol stops making you feel bad.

938
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,240
 So keep it up.

939
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,440
 Okay, so what was said?

940
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,600
 Is that our official advice?

941
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,720
 That's, um, yeah, please don't sue me when you get live a failure.

942
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,800
 I was looking up with some other museums in Croatia.

943
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,480
 We've spoken before, I think, about the Museum of Broken Relationships.

944
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,360
 That's quite a famous one, but I'd never seen this one.

945
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,400
 It's called Froggyland, and it's in Split.

946
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,240
 And this is a collection of 507 stuffed frogs

947
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:14,000
 that were made by a very, very skilled taxidermist from Croatia called Ference Mere.

948
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,240
 And he used a very clever system where he goes through the animal's mouth

949
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,000
 rather than cutting it open.

950
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,920
 So you don't end up with any scars on the taxidermy animal.

951
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,360
 And then he got the frogs and he put them in sort of like settings.

952
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,760
 So, um, there's one in a blacksmith's shop, there's one in a carpenter's shop,

953
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,960
 there's one in a school, there's some in the circus,

954
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,280
 like lots of different modes of life just recreated with stuff.

955
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,360
 Frogs, so cool, wow.

956
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,440
 It's funny because it feels like he might also be a candidate for the Museum of Broken Relationships.

957
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:49,920
 To use.

958
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:58,960
 But yeah, Froggyland, it gets 4.5 stars on TripAdvisor,

959
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,680
 lots of reviews, lots of good reviews.

960
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,200
 I only read the bad ones, of course.

961
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,200
 The frogs were very small and not very appealing.

962
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:13,200
 Another person, this place is an abomination for frog lovers.

963
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,320
 Don't go here.

964
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,120
 If you love frogs like me, I love frogs.

965
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,640
 You should have seen that coming, surely if you're a frog lover,

966
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,280
 going to a place full of dead frogs is what you're going to like.

967
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,400
 And another person said, okay, okay.

968
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,280
 This guy gave a lot of time and effort to make these frogs.

969
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,240
 But still, it is weird and creepy.

970
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,440
 Yeah.

971
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,360
 But then the people who made the Museum replied with Anna's exact point.

972
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:44,320
 We don't understand why someone who has that kind of opinion would even decide to come in here.

973
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,160
 It's like you're doing it deliberately so you can complain, guys.

974
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,360
 We're not like dead frogs.

975
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,960
 Don't go to the dead frogs Museum.

976
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,560
 Anyway, it's in split.

977
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,040
 Do you think someone tested the temperature

978
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,840
 of Cleopatra's milk bath by dipping their elbow into it?

979
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:10,400
 Now, that is a joke about how you test the temperature of a baby's milk, isn't it?

980
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,280
 Oh no, it's how you test a baby's bath water, sorry.

981
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,560
 How do you test the milk, though?

982
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,920
 Um, it's hard to get your elbow into the bottle, isn't it?

983
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,680
 Yeah, do you have it yourself?

984
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,120
 You try.

985
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,480
 I think you drip little bits from the bottle on the back of your hand, don't you?

986
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:24,960
 Like, maybe.

987
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,800
 I think you just, simply, you just trust that the milk you're producing from your breasts

988
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,280
 is not by the boiling hot and freezing hot.

989
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,080
 That's, yeah.

990
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,600
 I mean, some mothers are like Yellowstone National Park, aren't they?

991
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,320
 There we go.

992
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,560
 120 degrees.

993
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,280
 Can't be very damaging.

994
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:54,000
 They had a sacred blades, which, and this is a slight content warning here, sacred obsidian blades,

995
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,280
 which the kings would use to cut their penises with.

996
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,320
 Oh, yeah, okay.

997
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,880
 Yeah, it's not, it's not so they could bleed them.

998
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,320
 Yeah, what were they doing?

999
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,880
 Which bet they cut, they're not cutting the whole thing off, are they?

1000
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,920
 Not, they weren't cutting the whole thing off, great news, but they were cutting,

1001
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,600
 I mean, it's all sensitive.

1002
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,400
 It's all sensitive.

1003
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,520
 No, they were just sort of, well, they did a bit on, on their full skins, yeah,

1004
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,120
 but a bit on other parts of it.

1005
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,760
 You know, the Victorians had special, like, mini sods that they used to cut a corn off

1006
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,560
 corn on the cubs.

1007
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,560
 It just doesn't matter.

1008
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,760
 I don't know what maybe you think of that.

1009
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,120
 And I think it was bleeding, wasn't it?

1010
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,680
 As in, they used to sacrifice their blood.

1011
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,000
 So this is a ritual thing that they had to do is they would have to cut their tongues and ears

1012
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,360
 and genitals and stuff.

1013
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,160
 And then pull us a blood out of them to give to the gods.

1014
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,040
 I think I got that, yeah.

1015
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,720
 They'd leave the blade somewhere, and so researchers have found a load of these obsidian blades,

1016
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,440
 and it's very hard to tell which of the blades there were sacrificial, because as they put it,

1017
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,320
 the degree of where imposed on a blade used only on one occasion to slice open a penis

1018
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,200
 is very little indeed.

1019
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,160
 The knife is much less damaged.

1020
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:07,280
 So the researchers, again, had to have a go at this and they studied multiple blades.

1021
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,240
 Well, no, the scientists didn't cut their own cubs.

1022
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,600
 They tried it on some chicken instead.

1023
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,120
 They tried it on the people's cocks.

1024
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,560
 And they studied multiple blades.

1025
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,280
 And they think that has given them a sign of which blades we use.

1026
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,080
 That's really interesting, because like exactly what you're saying, the way you work out

1027
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,520
 how a blade was used is by looking at the dense in it, don't you?

1028
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,320
 Like, and there was a research study about some Bronze Age swords,

1029
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,840
 about whether they were purely decorative or whether they used in fighting,

1030
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,480
 and they can tell by how they hit each other and how they dent.

1031
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,680
 But if you're only using it for one after one thing of a penis and yeah,

1032
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,960
 you're not going to get that information.

1033
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:49,360
 Yeah, the wear and tear on the penis is definitely more, isn't it?

1034
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,040
 Yes.

1035
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,200
 Down the knife.

1036
00:57:53,200 --> 00:58:02,000
 Just to go back to their gods, some other fun gods, they were quite interflatulant and smelling.

1037
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,080
 Well, sorry, and this is a terrible joke that I'm just about to make.

1038
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:15,200
 And see if we can put it in, but you say that the damage on the penis is worse.

1039
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,480
 But then, of course, the penis might be other than the sword.

1040
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,400
 Oh, wow.

1041
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,240
 Oh, wow.

1042
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,040
 That was so glad.

1043
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,360
 Was it so glad that it's wrong to you for that.

1044
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,720
 I'm glad you got that.

1045
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,680
 Definitely worth it.

1046
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,440
 It's going in, isn't it?

1047
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,720
 It's going in.

1048
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,840
 I can't wait to hear it.

1049
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,040
 We've got our end of section now, so sorry to look here when you got to say it.

1050
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:46,240
 Okay, that's it.

1051
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,680
 That's all of our facts.

1052
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,760
 Thank you so much for listening.

1053
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,120
 What does Dan usually say here?

1054
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,520
 Oh, it doesn't matter because it's not a normal show.

1055
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,160
 All we want to do is remind you that to give some money to the care workers' charity,

1056
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,800
 they would really, really appreciate it if you could spare anything and so would we.

1057
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:12,160
 And to donate, go to qi.com/donate or justgiving.com/nstaf.

1058
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,360
 Off with the show.

1059
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,400
 I've always wanted to say that.

1060
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,520
 I've never had a chance before.

1061
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,960
 It feels like I can now dance away.

1062
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,280
 Wow.

1063
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,760
 If that doesn't make you want to donate to this charity, I don't know what will.

1064
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:31,760
