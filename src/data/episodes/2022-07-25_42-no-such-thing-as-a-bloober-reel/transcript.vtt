00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.740
 [incomprehensible music]

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.000
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.320
 I'm sitting with the three regular elves, it's Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.080
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.960
 the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.600
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.820
 My fact this week is that Franz Kafka once convinced his entire family that Einstein's

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.080
 theory of relativity was going to cure his tuberculosis.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.080
 How was that going to work?

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.920
 It's a good question, I can't exactly tell you, but I can tell you how it was claimed

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.920
 it was going to work.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.400
 I'm not sure I understand it, but essentially, the plan was that you would take a cruise,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.800
 according to this spoof article that he sent to his family, you take a cruise heading

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.840
 east in the direction of the Earth's rotation and this would enlarge your body and that would

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.720
 close the cavities and your lungs that were causing these problems and by enlarging your

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.680
 body and gaining weight by taking this easterly cruise, then you'd be queued and he actually

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.320
 said that there was a company in Prague that was fitting out hospital ships specifically

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.320
 for this purpose.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.600
 Oh, unfortunately, I think the holes would get bigger as well.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.280
 That is one of the many flaws in the claim.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.280
 Is it in superman way?

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.280
 He flies around the world and slows down the rotation.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.600
 No, he turns it backwards, he spins the world backwards, which reverses time, which stops

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.480
 from his from lowest lane, from dying in a car crash.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.480
 That would work either way.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.080
 But would it also turn back the thing he had just saved because he saves the world first

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.880
 and then he has to turn the Earth backwards to save the girl, but it would also undo his

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.360
 own saving of the world in the first one, so he'd be in exactly the same.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.160
 And that's similar to the fact that I've wondered if when you sail back westward, is that going

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.200
 to, I mean, is your TB going to return?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.680
 Do you then have to stay in China?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.040
 Does everyone with TB have to end up in China?

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.160
 I think we keep traveling east, you're all right.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.240
 Okay, you have to keep going forever and ever.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.960
 Do we know their reaction, the family's reaction, when you were doing it as a joke?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.800
 They were really devastated, yeah.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.960
 That's not usually how good jokes end there.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.000
 That's how good parts of jokes always end, so someone being very upset, joke fail.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 But Katka was amazing, wasn't it?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.800
 Katka is the most hilarious character.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.560
 He wrote letters obsessively all the time, which is great, so we've got this, and I think

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.800
 as most people know, he hardly had anything published in his life.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.480
 I think he published 450 pages of work in his life, and on his deathbed.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.960
 And some officers was, wasn't it?

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.960
 Yeah, some officers was.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.960
 A few stories.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.400
 A few stories, the trial wasn't, and then on his death, he said to his publisher, wrote him

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.160
 that famous letter saying, "Make sure you burn everything I've written."

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.320
 And obviously, instead of doing that, it was all published.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.640
 Yeah, so his publisher was called Max Brod, and Max Brod kept all of his papers, and then

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.400
 was in a really weird, sort of, Menager Toire relationship with a woman called Esther Hoffer

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.600
 and her husband Otto.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.160
 And when he died, he gave all of his, all of Kafka's papers to Esther Hoffer, who then gave

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.800
 them to her daughter, and her daughter now lives in an apartment full of cats with all

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.640
 of Kafka's papers in the corner, and basically, they think they're all going to just get demolished

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.640
 by cat pee.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.640
 Wow.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.640
 And we'll never be able to read them.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.640
 So, everyone wants to get these Kafka papers so that we can read these amazing stories,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.840
 and she's like, "No, they're mine, and my cats are going to pee on them."

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.840
 Is that why, because I think the British Library, or maybe the Bodleian, is keeps claiming that

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.480
 they actually have the right to them, and there's some ambiguity in what Kafka said.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.320
 Yeah, everyone keeps trying to get them.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.320
 Yeah.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.600
 And everyone also keeps trying to get rid of the cats.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.840
 And so, they keep going in the council, and saying, "No, we're going to take these cats."

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.960
 And every time they take, like, 20 cats away, another 20, a ride.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.600
 They just keep coming from like an ultimate cutlery.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600
 They just love Kafka.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 Kafka, ask.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.600
 Never mind.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600
 Let's go.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 Okay.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.920
 So, the whole burning, all of your work, post your death.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.920
 Why?

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.160
 I think because, so it's actually estimated that he burned 90% of what he wrote during his

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160
 life, Kafka.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.320
 So, he only had 10% of what he wrote, but he was real perfectionist, and he hated himself.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.800
 He was really self-loathing, so I think he thought that nothing that he ever wrote

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.800
 was good enough.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.800
 Yeah.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.560
 And, I mean, I guess maybe some of it's quite revealing, like, he wrote this letter to his father.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.800
 He went on holiday for two weeks, intending to write, and he ended up spending the entire

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.600
 two weeks writing a letter to his father, this incredibly long letter, about everything

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.920
 his father had done wrong, and his father sounds like a terrible person.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.000
 So, it was accusing him of, say, of doing stuff like his father would say, "No one's allowed

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.160
 to speak at the table.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
 The table is for eating."

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.560
 But his father would, incessantly speak at the table, "No one's allowed to swear, but

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.840
 his father had the foulest mouth of anyone he knew."

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.840
 Wow.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.800
 And he wrote him, they spent two weeks writing this letter that he never sent him.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.080
 Another letter that he wrote that I quite like is he wrote a 16-page letter asking for

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.840
 a promotion when he worked at the Workers Accident and Insurance Company.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.920
 The thing about his father and the dinner table, Kafka liked to have the Diet Call Fletcherism,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.920
 you know, everyone.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.120
 So, that's where you just keep chewing and chewing and chewing.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.120
 Every mouthful, 100 times.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.120
 Yeah, until it goes.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.280
 Yeah, until, until basically there's nothing left in your mouth and it all turns into

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.280
 motion.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.280
 What's the point of doing that?

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.600
 By having larger things in your body, it makes you put them all white, whereas if you chew

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.200
 it all, it makes it go through your body.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.320
 Because it'll be more broken down, won't it, by your saliva?

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320
 Yeah.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.040
 So, they used to, for instance, they used to have dinner parties like Fletcherism, dinner

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.560
 parties where they would have a timer, so everyone would have a mouthful, and they would

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.840
 have like a one-minute timer, and everyone would pat you, chew, chew, chew, chew.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.840
 And then they'd be like, Ding!

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.160
 Okay, next mouthful, and then you do that.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160
 Wow.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.160
 Come to party.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.160
 Yes.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.160
 7pm on the fourth.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
 Carriage is 9pm on the 12th.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.800
 Fletcher was really cool, actually.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.600
 He thought that by doing his particular style of diet, that you would only defecate once

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.520
 every two weeks, and he said that it would smell like warm biscuits.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.800
 And also, apparently, carried around a sample of his own feces around to illustrate the

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800
 wonder.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.800
 Wow.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:16.360
 He also got really into mullers, he was into fads because he was really self-conscious about

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360
 his weight.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.120
 He was afraid of his own reflection because he thought he hated the fact that he was so ugly,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120
 but he actually wasn't.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.300
 But he got really into mullers exercise fad, which was, I think, probably the first real big

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.440
 exercise fad, this guy called Muller, telling you that exercise you should do every day.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.440
 It was like naked exercise.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.160
 That was the naked exercise, so he always appeared in a loincloth and said people should

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.160
 just wear this at all.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.400
 And he would go skiing in some merits in a loincloth and stuff.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.600
 People were a bit skeptical about how beneficial this was to anyone's health, but he got ready,

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.080
 he was devoted to that.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.080
 That's fantastic.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.080
 Yeah.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.440
 I was looking into, sort of, just famous authors in their quirky ways of writing.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.440
 Yeah.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.880
 So Kafka, obviously, just going from massively long letters.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.200
 It's really enjoyable to find out that everyone doesn't find writing as easy as you assume

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.200
 that they did.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.120
 Some of the biggest authors, so Victor Hugo, he was so bad at writing and concentrating

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.200
 and needing to be in that, you know, you always have that.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.400
 Oh, I need to get out of the room and do something more important.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.960
 He used to lock away all of his clothes, the void temptation of going outside.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.960
 Oh, wow.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.960
 Yeah, yes.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.440
 He often had a chauffeur who he'd give the clothes to, and said, "No account, give me these

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.840
 clothes until I've done my work."

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.040
 And he did eventually start wearing a shirt.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.280
 I think people would walk in and be like, "Oh, was that a Greek writer who shaved half of

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.440
 his head?"

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.680
 And the idea was that he would be too embarrassed to go out in public, and so he would stay in

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.680
 and write.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.680
 Can't remember who that was.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.680
 Wow.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.680
 Wow.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.680
 It's so nice.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.680
 These are all universally bad ideas.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.680
 Yeah.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.680
 It's the interesting thing for these great writers.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.680
 Yeah, because if you can't resist this temptation, you end up wandering streets stark naked

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.960
 with half a head of hair, and you're in an asylum.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.160
 But the half of the hair head of hair is okay, because if you were desperate enough, you

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.800
 could just make sure that you were facing one direction wherever you are.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.240
 As long as you kept that spot, no one would know.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.620
 And just on writing practices, I didn't know this about T.S. Eliot, who similarly to Kafka

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.160
 left in strut, he didn't want his life written by anyone.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.720
 He left in strut because there should be no official biography of him.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.080
 And I think Peter Accroyd's just written one, but he basically wasn't allowed access to

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.400
 any of T.S. Eliot's private letters or any of his life, so it's quite difficult.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.400
 Made it up.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.400
 Yeah, I think he just made it all up.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.400
 So maybe this is made up.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.240
 But no, T.S. Eliot used to put very pale green makeup on his face, and nobody knows

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.240
 why.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.240
 So pale green makeup.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.240
 People have speculated it was to look like a corpse, although I don't know why he'd want

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.240
 to do that.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.240
 Maybe it was just a fashion thing.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.240
 T.S. Eliot, who's he?

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.240
 The green face guy.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.280
 Maybe he was just always insanely jealous.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.280
 Maybe it was that.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.280
 Oh yeah, just constantly.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.280
 What are his poems like?

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.280
 I haven't read it.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.280
 Are they just like…

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.280
 She's with him again.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.280
 Yeah.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.280
 Yep.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.520
 Do you see the green cat in Bulgaria this week, who's in the news?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520
 No.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.520
 Yeah.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520
 There's a green cat in Bulgaria.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.920
 It's like bright green, and everyone's like, well, how on earth could it be a bright

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920
 green cat?

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.200
 Is it like some kind of science experiment gone wrong or something?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.520
 Apparently, it's like sleeping in the top of green paint.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.520
 Right.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.480
 How long did it take them to work that out?

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480
 Not so long.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480
 Yeah, okay.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.480
 Vector Hugo.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480
 Yeah.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480
 I think this is right.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.280
 He kept a detail, an extremely detailed diary of all the women he's slept with.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.280
 Did he?

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.280
 Yeah.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.280
 But it was extremely detailed.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.280
 It was like a spreadsheet with lots of different columns and lots of different…

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.960
 That's kind of a woman's worst nightmare.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.200
 It's like the curator at the Natural History Museum.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200
 He does that, doesn't he?

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200
 Every spoke.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200
 No, did we speak?

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.520
 Did we talk about this on the podcast?

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:40.880
 He used to collect, after every sexual conquest, a single hair of pubic hair.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.880
 What?

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880
 Yeah, after…

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.240
 So we should specify, this is not the current curator at the point where he's doing that.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240
 No, no, no.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.240
 He just said the curator, dad.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.240
 No, just want to avoid any potential.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.240
 Oh, no, I'm illegal.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.960
 He's the one that we've spoken about before.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.960
 He was a curator.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.960
 I can't remember his name.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.400
 He used to collect just one sprig.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.440
 I seem to remember sprig of pubic hair, being the word used.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.480
 And he would file them in color and date, and he did a proper curators job on it.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.600
 So they were going through all his files after he died, and they came across this kind of

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600
 collection of pubic hair.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.600
 Can you visit that at the Natural History Museum?

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.600
 It's not just play in the way with the…

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600
 It's real shame.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600
 It should be, though, yeah.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600
 It should.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.600
 That's very distressing.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.360
 Other writers in their weird writing habits, there was a writer who was huge American novelist

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.440
 that sort of early 1900s, Thomas Clayton Wolf, who always used to write on a refrigerator

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.160
 because he was so tall, which just seems like he's rubbing in people's faces.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.640
 What was the little magnet letters?

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.640
 Yeah.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.720
 Took him a little time taking the novel out, the ages, yeah.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.120
 Imagine sending it to the publishers as well.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.080
 There were 300 fridges outside.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.080
 Yeah.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.080
 Kids rearranging it.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.080
 Yeah.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:55.240
 This novel just seems to say, "bum, bum, we..."

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.760
 Just going back to Kafka, if we can.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.760
 Yes.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.200
 So there was a biography of Kafka written a couple of years ago by a guy called James Hors,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.400
 and he caused controversy because he wanted to talk about the pornography that Kafka had.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.840
 And apparently he was saying that Kafka was into hardcore porn, including images of

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.760
 Hedgehog style creatures performing Felatio.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.080
 Hedgehog style creatures.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.560
 Yeah, so like creatures that look a bit like a Hedgehog, but like pocketbines maybe.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.560
 Oh, okay.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.560
 I'll just say pocketbines.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.560
 I don't know.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.960
 I think they're like half human, half hedgehog things.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.040
 So he was a furry, isn't that what a furry is?

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.040
 Yeah.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.040
 Kind of.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.040
 I'm not sure he dressed up as them.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.040
 Okay.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.360
 But then the German scholars then said, "Well, this is obviously rubbish.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:46.280
 Author in Britain is just a prude and these hedgehog kind of things are just not pornography

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.280
 at all.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.280
 They're just high art."

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.280
 Yeah.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.840
 And he said that comparing those illustrations to hardcore porn is like comparing a poem

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.120
 by Henrik Heiner with an advertising slogan form at Donald's.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.040
 So basically, this isn't hardcore.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.320
 You should see our hardcore.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.320
 Yeah.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.320
 Coming to the back room.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.320
 I'll show you something.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.320
 Yeah.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.080
 Since we're on the subject, I was reading a book about the history of London and it's

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.480
 sort of London and vice, basically, and it had titles for 19th century pornography, which

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.800
 were quite something.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.160
 So the spreeish spouter or flashcoves slap up reciter.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.280
 I mean, that is a good title, you know.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.360
 The jolly companion and the story of a dildo.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.040
 It sounds like it could almost be a girl's name.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.040
 You'd see it on the shelf.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.040
 I think, "Ah, the maiden of dildo."

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.400
 Well, it might have been the story of a dildo, as in the story of Alan Dildo.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.320
 Yeah, that's exactly.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:47.240
 So I spoke about on a previous podcast just on this subject about monster erotica, you

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.240
 guys remember?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.160
 So it's an amazing, I spent the weekend looking more into it.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:58.960
 I've downloaded number, but the interesting thing was, they're all on kiddo, you can get them.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.120
 There's this whole world of monster erotica, and you would figure that who the hell's

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.120
 reading this?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.120
 No one's reading it.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120
 Cass was reading it.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.120
 Cass was reading it.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.120
 Um, it turns out some of the authors are making up to $30,000 a month, if this is an effort

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:18.240
 in a cyber saying how I earn $30,000 a month working from home, that's, it's a con.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.240
 Okay.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.520
 Clearly, the whole 30,000 is coming out of Dan's bank account.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.760
 Um, Kafka used to laugh uncontrollably at his own jokes, which is weird.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.760
 Indeed.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.040
 Another thing which I think he would have found funny, because he had a really morbid sense

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.520
 of humour, hence the, um, a spoof letter to his family convincing that he wasn't going to

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.880
 die, which I don't know if I mentioned this, but he did die of TB, quite young, um, shortly

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:47.800
 after sending them that spoof article, um, was that while he was writing the hunger artist,

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.720
 which was a story about starvation, he was writing that as he was dying of TB and during

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.640
 the writing of that about someone who can't eat his throat closed up and he stopped me

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.280
 able to eat anything.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.680
 So it's sort of like his body was trying to give him the visceral experience of what

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.680
 he was writing about.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:08.480
 Well, I used my first job as interviewing, um, women with acid reflux, um, for a market

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.880
 research company.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.360
 And after four days of doing that, my boss and I, both doing the same interviews, we'd both

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.920
 got the symptoms of acid reflux on the same night, coincidences and knives.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:23.080
 One more thing about letters, um, Gordon Brown apparently liked to write letters to people

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:30.320
 in the X Factor, and he, he wrote basically for a few years while he, I think it was Wally's

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.320
 Prime Minister.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.680
 He would write to people and say, oh, I thought you were very good.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.680
 I thought.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.680
 Remember this?

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.680
 Yeah.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.320
 He wrote to one guy, Daniel Evans, a 38-year-old swimming pool cleaner and said, on a personal

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.280
 note, can I say that the next time Simon says you are only supported by the over 60s, you

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.960
 can tell him I disagree.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.960
 He was 57.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.960
 Wow.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.760
 Thanks, Gordon, really helping my case.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.760
 Yeah.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.920
 Was he really big, like a massive fan?

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.920
 Apparently.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.960
 No, it sounds like some kind of sad political stunt that his peers, stupid PR advisors, told

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.320
 him to do along with smiling like a maniac in order to encourage himself with people, doesn't

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320
 it?

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.320
 Yeah.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.320
 I would like to think it was real.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.880
 Oh, I've got one more thing about the writing process.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.880
 Well, yeah.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.880
 Okay.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:18.200
 So, uh, there's a, an inventor who James, it turns out, has met, uh, called Dr. Yoshiro Nakumatsu,

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200
 which is--

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.200
 Yeah, I met him.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.200
 Yep.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200
 So you've met him.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.800
 He, okay, so he's responsible for a 3,300 inventions, according to him, James.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.400
 It might be the most prolific inventor of all time.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.400
 Yeah.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.660
 And he's in the floppy disk.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:37.760
 He had many of his greatest ideas when he was close to drowning, all right?

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:43.840
 And when you say many, it means that, obviously, this is a guy who shouldn't be in a pool.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:51.720
 And so basically, he, uh, he also invented scooper apparatus, so he realized that, uh, in

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.520
 order to have good ideas, or at least what works for him, is that he needs to be at the bottom

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.960
 of a pool simulating the idea that he's about to drown.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:05.540
 And he had developed a, uh, one of his inventions, a non-dewater notepad, uh, so he'd start

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.440
 jawning ideas down as he was on the brink of death and then swim back to the surface and

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.640
 come out and go, "Flock me desk, morons!"

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:19.120
 Okay, time for the fact number two, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.280
 My fact this week is that dead geckos still stick to walls.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.800
 It's just pleasing, isn't it?

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.400
 It's just a nice fact, um, and this was tested by a team of scientists who stuck a gecko,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.080
 what, they didn't stick a gecko on all, they just let it climb up one.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.840
 And then kill them and kill this.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.840
 Did they really?

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.840
 That's how they did it?

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.480
 Yeah, it was, um, it was induced death rather than waiting for the gecko to die of natural

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.840
 causes, which would, to be fair, have slowed the experiment down a great deal.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.200
 Um, so it's, it's really interesting.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.880
 How come you don't see loads of dead geckos on the walls all the time and they're not

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.360
 filling up all the walls?

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.360
 You do.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.360
 This is a wall paper you see, that's actually real.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:01.120
 Lizard wallpapers that, yeah, you know, yeah, very fashionable, um, well, it lasts not forever,

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.920
 it lasts until a while after they die, at least half an hour after they die, they can still

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.920
 be there.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.920
 A question.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:12.520
 You know how we've been, because Andre Geim, uh, who is a professor, he, um, he came up

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.280
 with, uh, the idea of a crafty, yeah, Nobel Prize winner for graphing, uh, it's going

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.280
 to change the world.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.160
 He does these pride in idea experiments.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.680
 One of the things that he's invented in which he's trying to make better is, uh, a glove,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.920
 which acts like a gecko, it's called, um, gecko tape, I believe you can climb up a wall.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.600
 The only issue that they have with it is that unlike a gecko, it kind of, the little hairs,

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.920
 which is what they are using.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.040
 So spider hairs and gecko hairs, that's the kind of technology that they're trying to harness.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.720
 Uh, it clogs up and so you start slipping and you start going down.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.080
 My question is, get a big enough gecko.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:51.560
 Why can't you create a glove where a live gecko is on the actual end of the glove and you climb

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.520
 a wall with four geckos with four geckos attached to your hands and your feet?

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.520
 There's no reason.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.520
 There's no reason at all.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.520
 Has anyone tried?

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.520
 You're a reethical reason.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.520
 Well, hang on.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.520
 They're, they're baking them.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.520
 Well, hang on.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.200
 Climb walls and killing them while we don't know.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.920
 We're ready in dubious territory.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.160
 That's what scientific purposes not spider man purposes.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.160
 Um, would help.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.160
 This would be from military.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160
 All right.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.880
 We should say how they can do it in the first place.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.160
 So, um, it's very, very clever.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.040
 Every square millimeter of a geckos foot contains 14,000 little hair like structures.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:26.880
 Um, and as they climb up the wall, they basically pushed these into contact with the wall and

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.520
 they use something called the Vanderwiles force, which is so cool.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.400
 It basically disrupts the balance of electrons and protons in atoms.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.520
 So the hair, as it's pushed towards the wall, it pushes all the electrons of the first

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.840
 atom of the wall to one end, right?

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.120
 So it pushes them to the other end.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.680
 So that atom is next to the one next to it.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.360
 And it repels all the electrons to the other one because like forces repel.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.800
 That means that you've got an atom, uh, with all electrons at one end and an atom with all

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.800
 protons at one end and they then are attracted to each other and stick together.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.800
 Yeah.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.200
 That in microcosm is how the gecko climbs up walls.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.200
 Wow.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.440
 And they can sport 20 times their own weight.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.640
 I think they inspire, uh, they've inspired a kind of superglue, the way it works.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.200
 Um, they've designed superglue based on that.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:17.800
 Uh, there's another, there is a type of superglue that's based on that and the thing that muscles

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.800
 use.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.560
 So muscles will attach to rocks using a kind of, um, like, uh, cement and they've mixed that

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.320
 kind of cement technology with the Vanderwiles technology of the geckos and they've got a

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.920
 new adhesive called, um, it's called gecko or something like that, which is like supposed

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.360
 to be a super duper amazing, yeah, but also works underwater.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.440
 So it could be used for, you know, like, um, elaster plus that won't go fall off in the bath

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440
 and stuff like that.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.440
 That would be very handy.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.440
 That would be really useful.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.440
 Yeah.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440
 How many of they haven't got on that yet?

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.480
 But I don't think the elaster plus industry would allow it.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480
 No.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.440
 They make their money from people constantly losing them with the bath, but a new one out.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.000
 So it's like a conspiracy theory.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.960
 Yeah, you're going up against big plaster there.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.960
 Yeah.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.960
 I wonder if there's a technology that we've not yet harnessed in the, you know, when you,

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.120
 uh, lick, uh, icicle, you try to stick to it.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.120
 Yeah.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.120
 Yeah.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.960
 Very good sticky little thing that we haven't really harnessed.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.800
 Do you think it's like 20 times your own weight?

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.800
 Do you think you could hang off?

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.480
 Have you seen Dom and Dom or when they're trying to, I have, yeah, I don't know if that they

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.000
 did a lot of scientific research.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.600
 There's about five people trying to pull Jeff Daniel's tongue off that.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.600
 Okay.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600
 It's really cool.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600
 Again.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.600
 Yeah.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.600
 That wall is very cold.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.600
 Put your tongue in it.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.600
 We'll kill you and we'll see if you see.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.600
 Good work.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.600
 On geckos.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.360
 There was, did you guys remember that woman earlier on this year who claimed she'd given birth

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.360
 to a gecko?

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.360
 Oh, yes.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.360
 Yeah.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.360
 In Indonesia.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.920
 Um, and her and a midwife, uh, both reported it.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.720
 She thought she was going to give birth to a child and when it came out, turned out that, uh,

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.080
 it was a lizard coated in mucus and blood apparently slithered out of the birth canal.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.840
 And I don't know why the midwife had to help with that.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.680
 Because it was quite easy.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680
 Yeah.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.680
 Of course.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.680
 Yeah.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:07.420
 But then they became the target of this witch hunt in Indonesia because she was accused of

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.420
 witchcraft.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.420
 The idea of witch hunt.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.420
 Yeah.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.420
 So why would you make that hoax?

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.000
 Why would you pretend you'd give birth to a lizard?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.760
 It must be like the Kafka joke.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.280
 She thought this is going to go down a tree and then it got revealed.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.120
 Actually, that kind of backfired.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.120
 Yeah.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.600
 Geckos lick their own eyes to keep them, they don't, they can't blink.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.600
 Yeah.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.600
 So they just go around licking their own eyes.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.600
 Do you know that?

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.740
 Eyelids, they've got a sort of clear film over their eyes, but they don't have movable

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.540
 eyelids, I believe.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.540
 All right.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.540
 You have three eyelids done.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.240
 I've always thought it looks a bit weird.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.240
 What would you mean?

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.240
 Three eyelids on each eye.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.240
 Do I?

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.440
 So the one that goes down, one goes up and you have another little one.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.680
 There's a little kind of flap of pink in the corner of your eye and that used is what

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.120
 used to be your third eyelid and now it's only a little tiny flap.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.640
 That's very coincidental because Geckos have three eyes.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.640
 Do they?

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.400
 Third eye, which is a little light sensing.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.400
 A pinial one.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.400
 Yeah, pinial eye.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.400
 Try to think of how to describe it, really.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.400
 What does pinial mean?

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.400
 Okay.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:13.160
 So basically it is, they are cells which will, they will scent light and they're outgrowls

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.280
 of the pinial gland, which is in the top of your head.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.720
 I think the idea is that they can then scent the change in light above them.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.600
 So if any kind of predators come from above, then they'll be able to scent them.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.840
 I think that's right.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.840
 Yeah.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.760
 And they've done tests on people where, and I don't think this is a pinial thing, but where

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.840
 completely blind people can tell whether a light is on or not.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.040
 Do they hear someone click the switch?

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040
 No.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.280
 There's a type of gecko called the Morish gecko and they change.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.680
 They are delicious.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.320
 They change colour.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.920
 If you put them on a surface, but unlike a chameleon, they change colour to be the same

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.920
 colour as a surface.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.520
 Are they genuinely camouflage themselves?

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.960
 These geckos say you put them on a yellow surface, they'll turn yellow.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.760
 But if you blindfold them, they'll still turn yellow because it's not their eyes that

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.880
 are getting their senses, it's some kind of light senses in the skin that are doing it.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880
 That's amazing.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.600
 So if you put the blindfold around their kind of stomachs, then they won't be able to

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.040
 see it and they won't be able to change it.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.440
 That's not a blindfold though, is it?

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.440
 It's a...

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.440
 Stomach fold?

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.760
 Stomach fold, yeah.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.760
 Can they do patterns?

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.760
 I...

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.840
 Can you put them on a picture of Marilyn Monroe and have like that appear on a gecko?

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.840
 Very sexy gecko.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:31.200
 You're fulfilling a long-standing fantasy of dance here, which has a gecko look like Marilyn

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200
 Monroe.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200
 Yeah.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.200
 It's a monster.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.000
 Very much the Kafka of the office.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.600
 There was a gecko discovered in 1877, a British lieutenant colonel called R.H. Bedham

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:49.480
 found it in India and then it disappeared and we just rediscovered it 135 years later.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.480
 We stumbled back upon it.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.480
 Same one.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.920
 The J.Pore ground gecko, very old, very bored, not any company for a long time.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.080
 I missed the colonel.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.080
 Okay.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.120
 Can I tell you something about adhesion?

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.120
 Yeah.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.120
 I think you will like.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.120
 Okay.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.640
 This is in 2008, a campaigner against a third runway ad Heathrow attempted to glue himself

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.840
 to Gordon Brown at a Downing Street reception.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.840
 And he's called dangloss.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.400
 That'd be terrible because you'd have to spend the whole Saturday night watching

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.280
 the next factory.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.040
 So he was about to receive an award from the Prime Minister for his campaigning work and

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:28.080
 then he stuck out his super glued hand and touched the Prime Minister's sleeve.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.200
 And Downing Street later said there was no stickiness of any significance.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.760
 But the amazing thing is he'd smuggle this in in his pants.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.680
 And he said afterwards, I just glued myself to him and after 20 seconds he tore my hand

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680
 off.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.680
 It really hurt.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.680
 He tore his hand off.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.760
 He's a tough man.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.760
 Wow.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.640
 He had to give a couple of tugs before it came away.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.920
 He was just grinning about it.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.080
 He didn't seem to take me seriously.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.040
 Later on, he was allowed to stay at number 10 for 40 minutes after this happened.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.040
 Wow.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.680
 And when he left the building, I'm quoting from the BBC article about it here.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.120
 He tried to glue himself to the gates of Downing Street but was prevented from doing so

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.720
 by a police officer.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.720
 I didn't have much glue left by that point, he said.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.720
 OK, time for fact number three.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.240
 And that is James.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:26.440
 OK, my fact this week is that the active ingredient in the first ever homeopathy treatment

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.960
 was the blood of Thomas Beckett.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.200
 Wow.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.600
 So this basically when Thomas Beckett died, he was basically a saint straight away as

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.160
 soon as he died and everyone thought he was great.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.960
 And they had his blood as a relic.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.440
 But they only had a small amount of his blood so the way that they could give it to lots

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.520
 of different people was to put a tiny drop in enormous vat of water and then take bits

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.280
 of that water and give it to people and it supposedly would be able to cure everything.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.400
 Which as far as I'm concerned is pretty much homeopathy.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.400
 I agree.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.400
 Yeah.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:03.040
 And it's supposedly just a few years after he died from the time that they started doing

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.640
 it to a few years after he hit something like 703 miracles, supposedly.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.640
 Yeah.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.400
 But that was over the whole, I think it was over a 10 year period.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:18.000
 And in just one year, a couple of years later, 100,000 people visited the, it's quite a

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 low hit rate.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 It's quite a low hit rate.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.200
 But I found another report saying that it was you know, you would drink the water, this

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.240
 homeopathic water that James mentioned.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.360
 And also there were cases where reported in which it was used for the magical detection

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.760
 of thieves and even for extinguishing fires.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.800
 Which is the same as that.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.640
 It's a miracle.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.640
 The holy water.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.640
 Cut out this fire.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.440
 I was thirsty before and now I am not thirsty.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.360
 I was dirty before.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.600
 I was too hot before this magical substance.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.720
 Can I tell you about these just really quickly about those monks?

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.720
 Yeah, please.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.360
 So one of them was called William of Canterbury of the two monks who was writing down the

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.360
 things.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.360
 Because this was in Canterbury.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.360
 That's where he died, right?

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.360
 That's where he was buried anyway.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.320
 Because he was the Archbishop and he was killed.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.880
 And that's part of Canterbury tales as well.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.880
 He is the journey.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.120
 Oh, to visit the end point is Thomas a Beckett.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.120
 Right.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.280
 Well, Thomas Beckett, not a Beckett, right?

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.280
 That is a myth.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.800
 Thomas Beckett is a later edition.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.800
 He never really had the a.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.000
 It was the same with a Dildo.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.360
 If he was called Dildo, if he was on Twitter these days, he would be at Thomas Beckett.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.360
 Yep.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.040
 I always feel sorry for having the second in the Thomas Beckett incident.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.040
 Because he said, didn't he famously, well, people claim that he said, "Will no one rid me

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.840
 of this turbulent priest or some other phrase like that?"

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.480
 And that is the kind of thing you say when you're slightly pissed off with somebody and

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.240
 what you're not asking your friends to do is actually go and brutally murder them.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.240
 Yeah.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.240
 I wonder if they came back.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.240
 Well, we did it.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.240
 He's like, you did what?

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.240
 Did what?

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.240
 Yeah.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.240
 Oh, my God, guys.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.080
 Simon Sharma reckons that that's not the right one.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.080
 No, I know.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.360
 That's a really neat phrase.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:05.560
 And the biographer at the time, Edward Grimm, wrote in Latin, and the translation is, what

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:09.400
 miserable drones and traitors have I nourished and brought up in my household who let their

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.760
 Lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a lone-born cleric, which is not catchy.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.160
 But actually, there's no way of, he's not saying they're going kill him, is he?

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160
 No.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160
 Although he is.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.160
 No.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.160
 It's even more ambiguous.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.520
 But he is actively saying that his, like, the people who work for him have a responsibility

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.520
 to go and seek vengeance.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.520
 That's true.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.720
 He's saying, you're crap because you're lessing yourself.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.720
 Exactly.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.640
 And I bet he'd, they got told off of doing it.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.640
 It's one of those bosses, just never happy.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.880
 One of them had to come fight on the crusades for 14 years to say sorry.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.880
 Yeah.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.880
 Just to say sorry.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880
 Yeah.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.880
 Oh, wow.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.280
 Well, Henry was, I think, whipped by 80 monks.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.280
 Yeah.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.280
 He asked for that, didn't he?

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.960
 He requested it, not that he was asking for it.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:50.960
 Yeah.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.800
 He was like, he wanted to be penitent, so he asked to be whipped by these monks.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.800
 Wow.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.120
 And they just said, sure, that's not weird.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.120
 We'll do it.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.480
 It was more common at the time, yeah, to, uh, to be request for monks to whip you.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480
 Yeah.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.280
 What if you were, yeah.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.720
 You make it sound weird now.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.280
 One thing I read a really peculiar thing about him, peculiar to me, but then clearly I find

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:18.800
 things like being whipped by 80 monks peculiar, so maybe this is a very normal thing.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:24.920
 I read that on his death, the monks at Canterbury discovered that he wore a hair shirt and it was

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.720
 infested with lice, these were under his vestments.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.880
 What's a hair shirt?

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.640
 That is a special shirt made of very coarse animal hair that you put on under your normal

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.600
 clothes, and it scourges and irritates you and it spurs you to keep you.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.160
 Oh, so it was, it wasn't like a nice comfort thing?

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.160
 No.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.160
 It was.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.160
 Do you know where those?

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.560
 What do you wear when you go to be whipped by 80 monks?

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.120
 Thomas Beckett was voted the second worst Britain of the last thousand years.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.200
 And a poll by BBC History magazine.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.200
 Who came first?

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.200
 Jack the Ripper.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.120
 Wow, so that's quite harsh considering that he wasn't really a murderer.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.080
 Because I knew that everyone loved him as well.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.080
 Yeah, at the time.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080
 He wasn't a murderer.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.080
 No.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.080
 There are lots of other murderers.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.080
 I'm surprised by Jack the Ripper.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.080
 What?

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.080
 He was surprised by Jack the Ripper.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.080
 He voted the worst Britain.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.080
 Yeah.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.080
 The worst of all time.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.080
 Of all time.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.080
 Who would you go for?

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.080
 I don't know, but like Jeremy Logson.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.080
 There are.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.640
 As a theory, he got his name Beckett from Beck, which means Beak, because he had quite a prominent

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.200
 nose and that was maybe a family trait and that's where his family had got the surname

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.200
 from.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200
 It's just a theory.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.200
 Really?

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.200
 That isn't a humanism, a bit Thomas Beakie.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.320
 When he was killed, he'd just got back from a six-year, I was going to say a six-year holiday.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.160
 He'd actually been axiled in fearing his life.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.160
 But still.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.800
 That's how he was marketing it to his friends.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.760
 So he was away for six-year because he was in fear of his life?

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.760
 Yeah, he was.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.760
 He was right.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.760
 When he literally arrived back, he was killed.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:55.120
 He came back under an amnesty, because he had had a huge power struggle with the king.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.240
 And then he got back under an agreement and it was all going to be fine.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.960
 And then he started excommunicating a load of people who he'd specifically agreed he

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.040
 wouldn't or the king had asked him not to.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.040
 Okay.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040
 So that was the reason.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.040
 That he was killed.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.040
 Back on your word.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.400
 On Hommieopathy, the guy who came up with it, so and called it Hommieopathy, came with

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.720
 the original theory for it, who was Hanuman.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.200
 He thought that coffee was the thing that caused, he went there a phase of the thing that

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.680
 coffee caused huge numbers of diseases.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.680
 And he said the thing that was wrong with coffee and the reason you know it's bad is because

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.760
 coffee drinking makes everything pleasurable.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.120
 And you know that in life, you're supposed to suffer as well as experience pleasure.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.720
 And you sort of get drunk on coffee and you enjoy everything too much.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.120
 And that's not how it's supposed to be.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.920
 So he says, even in the corporal functions, which in a natural state of health are accompanied

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.760
 by rude and almost painful sensations, now operate with an astonishing facility and even

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.400
 with a species of pleasure.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.480
 What is he referring to when he took that corporal?

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.360
 It sounds a lot like he's referring to the fact that you've suddenly got chronic diarrhea

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.360
 as soon as you have a coffee.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.720
 And it sounds to me like he was just a constipated man.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.720
 It sounds like he's got IBS.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.720
 Yeah, it does, isn't it?

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.400
 Company by rude and painful sensations.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.400
 Yeah, it's IBS.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.400
 Yeah.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.400
 Good diagnosis.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.600
 So George Sick received Hommieopathy treatment when he was trying to get his speech

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.600
 right.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.520
 So in the King's speech, he had that, but it wasn't in the movie.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.520
 So what did he have?

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.120
 What did they give him a ground up word diluted heavily?

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.120
 How did he?

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:22.760
 Just a very short word, yeah, with lots of silence.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:29.160
 It was a medicine called hypericum and he was so appreciative of it that he named a race

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.160
 horse after it.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.160
 Yeah.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.160
 So quite appreciative.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.160
 Yeah.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.000
 To name a child after it.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.800
 King Hypericum, probably best.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.800
 I saw it.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:47.440
 I was looking on a forum about just, I guess, these kind of miracle relics that are out there.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:53.400
 And someone was asking an interesting question, which is they used to, these relics used to

00:32:53.400 --> 00:33:00.760
 sort of perform or give miracles quite a sort of large volume in the early days.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:06.800
 And the question was, as time passes, do relics perform less miracles just because like the

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:12.400
 Gecko on the wall after half an hour or four lot of has it got a period of, exactly, does

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.800
 it have the ability to do it for so long?

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.520
 And everyone obviously said no on the forum, but yeah, I just like that as a question.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.320
 I like, do they run out of steam?

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.320
 Do they run out of steam?

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.320
 Yeah.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.240
 Well, because I love, this is my favorite thing about this part of history is with these

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.240
 kind of relics.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.640
 It does sound like everyone was a superhero back then and we've lost the ability to be

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:39.680
 superheroes. I found a thing that James posted on QI, the forums years ago, I found it this

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.680
 week.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.680
 This is really funny.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.480
 So this is someone super power from back in the day.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:51.920
 The Times reported that Sonora Anna Morano, the luminous woman of Perano, she suffered

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.520
 from asthma.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:34:00.000
 And as a result of the asthma, admitted a blue glow from her breasts as she slept.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Many doctors came to witness the phenomenon, yeah, of course they did, yeah.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.920
 But apparently, I'm not sure if there's ever an answer to why she had, it's not super power.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.680
 Are we counting that as a superhero?

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.400
 Well, I mean, you know, you know, what purpose is that set of luminous breast woman?

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:21.280
 What if you lost in the, she paled up with Tia Celia in his green face, they go, you know,

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.280
 join a circus?

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.040
 If that's the Times, I guess that's not as old as I thought it was.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.280
 No, it's quite, I remember that, I don't remember it happening.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.320
 I wasn't posing as a doctor or anything.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.640
 No, but I remember reading about it.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.040
 I think I read it in 40 and Times, actually.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.640
 So it must have been only 10, in the last 10 years.

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640
 Yeah.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.640
 Yeah.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.640
 I'm not sure how real it was.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.640
 Blue boobs.

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.640
 Just say.

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.640
 Bloobs for short.

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.200
 Blue burial is after they finished filming a film, they just superimposed blue breasts onto

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.200
 everyone.

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:54.200
 Okay, time for our final factor to show.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:01.000
 And that is my fact, and my fact this week is that in 2013, a group of people attempted

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.360
 to crowdfund London's first ever UFO museum.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.000
 They needed a million dollars, but unfortunately, after 30 days of pushing and trying to raise

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.400
 money, they only managed to get $370.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:16.600
 I mean, a million in 30 days is very ambitious, but also that is what, that's $10 a day they

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.600
 managed to raise.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.920
 It's almost like the kind of people who are putting this together have unrealistic ideas,

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.240
 based in reality.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.880
 They only got four pledges, really, from people, and someone, it felt like one of them was

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.880
 their mum.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.600
 It was like, you know, like, when you set up this thing and it's like, oh, please support

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.600
 my thing.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.600
 Yeah.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.600
 Always your parents come in first.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.600
 Yeah.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.600
 Yeah.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.400
 So, but I mean, it looked really interesting.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.880
 What was going to be in the UFO museum?

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.680
 Well, I think it was going to be UK based UFO stuff, of which there is tons.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:50.800
 The biggest ever sighting of UFO, like a big UFO incident, was in the UK.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.520
 Yeah, but I mean, get the actual saucer, did we?

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.000
 We don't have the UFOs.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.120
 Is it just a lot of mad people telling anecdotes sort of stuck in rooms in the museum, saying?

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.720
 I saw this really scary thing in the sky.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.720
 Yeah.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.240
 What would be really great is that you go in and you don't see anything and you come in

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.880
 and you go, we saw nothing in there.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.920
 And then they say, yeah, there's the men in black at the end who wipe your memory.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:17.120
 That's a really cheap way of making a brilliant idea.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.520
 So, there is a, there's not a UFO museum that I can find in existence, but you know what

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.520
 I assume about.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.520
 Are there UFO museums?

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.520
 Roswell.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.520
 It's one in Roswell.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.520
 Roswell.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.520
 Roswell one.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.520
 What's in there?

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.560
 It's all, I guess, I'll put like a dummy of an alien and that will become as famous as what

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.960
 could be the real alien because enough people have seen it.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.960
 Yeah.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.960
 That's what they do.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.960
 So, there's a cryptozoology museum in Maine.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.960
 And it seems like they do the same thing.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.080
 They just keep making models of made up animals and then saying, isn't this amazing?

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.920
 This is what a Yeti would look like if it was a thing.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.920
 Yeah.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.940
 But it does sound quite cool, the International Cryptozoology Museum in Portland.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:58.760
 They've got thousands of exhibits and like bits that are claiming to be bits of Barnum's

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.760
 Fiji Mermaid.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.840
 I kind of want to test you on whether you know what all these made up words are.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.840
 Okay.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.840
 So, they're the Mermaid.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.840
 Yeah.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.840
 They're the Mermaid.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.840
 You can see a few of them in the British Museum.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.840
 So, these are the...

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.840
 It's one at the Hanuman, I think.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.840
 Yeah.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.840
 So, these are the ones, it's a half monkey, half fish.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840
 So, together.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.840
 Yeah.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.600
 They're just inside on the right hand side of the British Museum.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600
 Yeah.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.600
 I think we've talked about them before.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.600
 Yeah.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.800
 We've talked about them in relation to P.T. Barnum, who had a load of them.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.200
 One of his other tricks was he said, "I have a cherry-colored cat in this bag."

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.080
 And it was just sleeping in some cherry paint.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.680
 No, it was just a black cat.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.400
 And he said, "Some cherries are black."

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.400
 That's a good one.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.360
 I kissed a girl by the barn made in the British Museum.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.360
 Sorry?

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.360
 Just for a minute.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.360
 It's just the worst Katy Perry song I've ever heard.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.360
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360
 Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.360
 So, Dan, do you know what this is?

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.360
 The...

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.640
 So, this museum contains, like, loads of hair samples of, like, the abominable snowman and

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.360
 around a pendeck and Yahweh.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.360
 It's not a single pew from each one.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.360
 I think it is.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.360
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.360
 Ha, ha.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.960
 Um, and there's also a letter from the actor Jimmy Stewart, who's one of my favourite actors.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.560
 So, this does point to me if it's true.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.360
 A letter from the actor Jimmy Stewart is on display as he is linked to the pangbok Yeti

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.360
 hand mystery.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.360
 That hand.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.360
 Who are?

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.360
 How is Jimmy Stewart linked to that?

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.360
 There was a hand which supposedly belonged to Yeti.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:37.360
 But yeah, he was very obsessed with Yetis and he managed to get his hand on this hand.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360
 On the hand.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360
 Yeah.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.360
 There was a review of this museum.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.960
 And the guy said, quite frankly, we have more creepy things in my living room than they

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.360
 have in this museum.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.360
 And then he gave it five stars.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.360
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:55.440
 Another museum in America, the Cockroach Hall of Fame Museum, which is in Plano, Texas.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.880
 This was a guy called Michael Bowden, who was an exterminator.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.840
 And he has dead Cockroaches dressed as celebrities.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.040
 Have you got any examples?

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:14.120
 Yes, Ross Perroach and David Letterroach, too.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.560
 I think he's also got a Liberochi, isn't he?

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.400
 And it's a little gold capes in a tiny piano.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:26.880
 So this guy's experience with the bizarre, I'm reading here, began in the 1980s when he held

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:31.320
 a contest to find the biggest Cockroach in Dallas.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.960
 He later travelled the country judging Cockroach fashion contests as a promotional stunt for

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.240
 an insecticide company.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.080
 Well, you wouldn't do it as anything else, would you?

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.880
 It's a serious investigation.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.320
 I like the way that he's had that job, and he's turned it into something awesome, like

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.320
 a museum.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.120
 About the insecticide company's a knotted, he sort of went a bit off-peast.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.120
 That's very funny.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.240
 Daniel, I have a question for you.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.160
 What shape was the first ever flying saucer?

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.160
 Ooh.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.040
 There's a clue in the word saucer.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.920
 So it was round like a saucer?

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.920
 No.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.920
 Ah.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.920
 The trick, too.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.920
 What they're trying.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.280
 The word saucer, why it was called flying saucer, was because it skipped across the sky like

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.280
 a saucer.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.280
 Like, if you were a skimming saucer, that's why it got called that.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.800
 It was actually, um, crescent-shaped, like a boomerang.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.800
 Oh, really?

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800
 Yeah.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.160
 Is that why we can't keep them, because they always go back to where they came from?

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.160
 Oh, yes.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.920
 Why they're on the UFOs in the museum.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.520
 So do we know anything about the people who started this?

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.240
 Are they the genuine believers in alien UFOs?

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.240
 Yeah.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.960
 We'll give you the basic blurb, if they wrote.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:41.360
 Our team includes people of soundbind who wanted to go to a UFO museum one day close to home

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.040
 in Paris, London, and Berlin, and realized that they had to travel thousands of miles to

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.280
 visit such a place.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.800
 When you have to start off something by saying, "Where have soundbind?"

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.800
 Yeah, obviously.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.800
 It's like...

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:57.040
 And I think they think soundbind means they have voices in their head.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.400
 We already have access to material from a former UFO museum, but to open a new place

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:06.200
 today that would look modern, one would need much more material and to purchase new equipment.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.920
 We've even found a few perfect locations to rent in London, but there are many other issues

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.920
 to solve first.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:16.680
 We need your support to do more research, produce more information boards, mannequins, videos,

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.240
 pictures, computers, etc.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.520
 We truly believe this is a unique, exciting project that would attract a lot of people and

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.160
 we need your help and support to make this become a reality.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.720
 That was their basic blurb.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.720
 See.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.720
 No mention of what would be in there.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.720
 Have you had a kick-end?

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.720
 No.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:38.320
 It's a side-project to Kickstarter, which a man has set up, which is all the projects on Kickstarter

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.800
 which have made nothing.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.800
 Okay.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:51.320
 And they include the book "So Long Constipation", the toilet book.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.160
 Anyone who doesn't have two or more easily possible bowel movements a day will benefit from

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.160
 reading So Long Constipation.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:02.200
 Do you see those adverts for Anti-Constipation Medicine which say "Instant overnight relief"?

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.200
 No.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.200
 Really doesn't sound like London.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.080
 You might want to clean your sheets in the morning.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.040
 Total immediate relief.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.640
 Wherever you are.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.440
 Uncontrollable relief.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.440
 Everywhere.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.440
 Yeah.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.440
 Sorry.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.280
 So Long Constipation didn't get a single note, nothing.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.360
 Do you know what else didn't get a single pledge?

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:26.120
 Is someone called Henrietta needed to raise $6,000 to fund her comedy show called "Please

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.120
 Love Me"?

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.120
 Oh my God.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.120
 Nothing.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120
 Foodie.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.120
 Zero.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.240
 If you're at the Henrietta, we love you.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:37.200
 Another quite good idea that I might have donated to was the little eats.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200
 Did you read that?

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:44.200
 Which was a guy who invented a food that is dog food and human food.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.200
 Which, if you have a dog, there was-

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.200
 You can eat dog food, can't you?

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.920
 Yeah, and dogs can eat human food.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.920
 I don't know.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.200
 Can you eat dog food without really hating it?

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.200
 Yeah.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.200
 No, probably not.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.000
 It's probably not tasty, but I think you can eat it.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 Yeah.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 I remember the thing about a supermarket-

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.760
 Yeah, it was a fact that I'm going to get the numbers wrong, but it's something like there

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:09.240
 is enough food in a supermarket for a single person to stay alive for 56 years, and it's

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:12.680
 something like 67 years if you're willing to eat dog food.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.680
 Oh yeah.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.680
 Yeah.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.920
 I eat the dog food early on, because you don't want your last year to be the worst year.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.960
 You'd save for the harrow bars.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:21.960
 Yeah.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:22.960
 Yeah.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:23.960
 That's a really good idea.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.960
 Yeah.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.200
 You get saved after like five years.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.240
 Why did you eat the dog food for you?

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.240
 Yeah.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.400
 That'd be psychologically a lot of questions, kind of.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.400
 Yeah.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.080
 Can I just take it back to museums for a second?

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.080
 Yeah.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.040
 Because I just did a search on the sort of weird museums of the world, and there's so many

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.040
 great ones.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.720
 I don't know why they exist, but I'm so glad that they do.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.560
 The Giant Shoe Museum.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.240
 It's- I don't know if you count it as a museum.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.200
 It's a single exhibit wall.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.200
 Like a shoe.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.880
 No, it says here that to see the museum's collections, visitors must drop quarters into

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:03.440
 a coin box and then look through stereoscope viewing slots that reveal views of a variety of

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.080
 giant shoes, including size 37.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.080
 Wow.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.080
 That's American size though.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.080
 Wow.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:13.560
 Yeah, but that was worn by the world's tallest man and the world's largest collection of giant

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.560
 shoes, which is-

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.400
 The world's tallest ever man, William Wadlow.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.400
 Yeah.

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.400
 Was he called?

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.400
 No, Robert Wadlow.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.400
 Yeah.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.400
 He was a shoe salesman.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.400
 That was his job.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.720
 He had to get really, really big shoes because they didn't make them that size.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.080
 He went to the company and they said, "Yeah, show you can have them for free if you go around

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.080
 and sell them."

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.080
 And he did.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.920
 But why would anyone else want to buy a size 37 shoes?

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:37.160
 It was an example of what great worksmanship you have because you make such a big one and then

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.160
 show that you can make little ones as well.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.160
 Oh, okay.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.160
 That's very cool.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.360
 So, Minnesota's Science Museum has the content of a former museum inside it, which was

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:51.840
 called the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices, including the Prostate Gland Warmer,

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.840
 the Vibratory Chair, and the Recto Rotor.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.320
 You just picked three at random, though.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.800
 France has four museums devoted to foie gras.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.800
 Wow.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.720
 I mean, they didn't want more than the first one, actually, but the people behind the museum

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.000
 just kept stuffing them down their throats.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Are you?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 That was pretty laden.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 Okay.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 That's it.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 That's all of our facts.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Thanks so much for listening.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.480
