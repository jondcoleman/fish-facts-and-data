00:00:10,00:00:15,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:15,00:00:18,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:18,00:00:19,My name is Dan Shriver.
00:00:19,00:00:23,"I'm sitting with the three regular elves, it's Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski"
00:00:23,00:00:27,"and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from"
00:00:27,00:00:29,"the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:29,00:00:34,"Starting with you, Chazinski."
00:00:34,00:00:39,My fact this week is that Franz Kafka once convinced his entire family that Einstein's
00:00:39,00:00:43,theory of relativity was going to cure his tuberculosis.
00:00:43,00:00:45,How was that going to work?
00:00:45,00:00:49,"It's a good question, I can't exactly tell you, but I can tell you how it was claimed"
00:00:49,00:00:50,it was going to work.
00:00:50,00:00:55,"I'm not sure I understand it, but essentially, the plan was that you would take a cruise,"
00:00:55,00:00:59,"according to this spoof article that he sent to his family, you take a cruise heading"
00:00:59,00:01:05,east in the direction of the Earth's rotation and this would enlarge your body and that would
00:01:05,00:01:10,close the cavities and your lungs that were causing these problems and by enlarging your
00:01:10,00:01:15,"body and gaining weight by taking this easterly cruise, then you'd be queued and he actually"
00:01:15,00:01:20,said that there was a company in Prague that was fitting out hospital ships specifically
00:01:20,00:01:21,for this purpose.
00:01:21,00:01:24,"Oh, unfortunately, I think the holes would get bigger as well."
00:01:24,00:01:28,That is one of the many flaws in the claim.
00:01:28,00:01:29,Is it in superman way?
00:01:29,00:01:32,He flies around the world and slows down the rotation.
00:01:32,00:01:38,"No, he turns it backwards, he spins the world backwards, which reverses time, which stops"
00:01:38,00:01:42,"from his from lowest lane, from dying in a car crash."
00:01:42,00:01:43,That would work either way.
00:01:43,00:01:47,But would it also turn back the thing he had just saved because he saves the world first
00:01:47,00:01:51,"and then he has to turn the Earth backwards to save the girl, but it would also undo his"
00:01:51,00:01:55,"own saving of the world in the first one, so he'd be in exactly the same."
00:01:55,00:02:00,"And that's similar to the fact that I've wondered if when you sail back westward, is that going"
00:02:00,00:02:02,"to, I mean, is your TB going to return?"
00:02:02,00:02:03,Do you then have to stay in China?
00:02:03,00:02:06,Does everyone with TB have to end up in China?
00:02:06,00:02:08,"I think we keep traveling east, you're all right."
00:02:08,00:02:10,"Okay, you have to keep going forever and ever."
00:02:10,00:02:13,"Do we know their reaction, the family's reaction, when you were doing it as a joke?"
00:02:13,00:02:15,"They were really devastated, yeah."
00:02:15,00:02:17,That's not usually how good jokes end there.
00:02:17,00:02:23,"That's how good parts of jokes always end, so someone being very upset, joke fail."
00:02:23,00:02:25,"But Katka was amazing, wasn't it?"
00:02:25,00:02:26,Katka is the most hilarious character.
00:02:26,00:02:30,"He wrote letters obsessively all the time, which is great, so we've got this, and I think"
00:02:30,00:02:33,"as most people know, he hardly had anything published in his life."
00:02:33,00:02:37,"I think he published 450 pages of work in his life, and on his deathbed."
00:02:37,00:02:38,"And some officers was, wasn't it?"
00:02:38,00:02:39,"Yeah, some officers was."
00:02:39,00:02:40,A few stories.
00:02:40,00:02:44,"A few stories, the trial wasn't, and then on his death, he said to his publisher, wrote him"
00:02:44,00:02:48,"that famous letter saying, ""Make sure you burn everything I've written."""
00:02:48,00:02:51,"And obviously, instead of doing that, it was all published."
00:02:51,00:02:57,"Yeah, so his publisher was called Max Brod, and Max Brod kept all of his papers, and then"
00:02:57,00:03:03,"was in a really weird, sort of, Menager Toire relationship with a woman called Esther Hoffer"
00:03:03,00:03:05,and her husband Otto.
00:03:05,00:03:12,"And when he died, he gave all of his, all of Kafka's papers to Esther Hoffer, who then gave"
00:03:12,00:03:17,"them to her daughter, and her daughter now lives in an apartment full of cats with all"
00:03:17,00:03:23,"of Kafka's papers in the corner, and basically, they think they're all going to just get demolished"
00:03:23,00:03:24,by cat pee.
00:03:24,00:03:25,Wow.
00:03:25,00:03:26,And we'll never be able to read them.
00:03:26,00:03:30,"So, everyone wants to get these Kafka papers so that we can read these amazing stories,"
00:03:30,00:03:33,"and she's like, ""No, they're mine, and my cats are going to pee on them."""
00:03:33,00:03:38,"Is that why, because I think the British Library, or maybe the Bodleian, is keeps claiming that"
00:03:38,00:03:42,"they actually have the right to them, and there's some ambiguity in what Kafka said."
00:03:42,00:03:44,"Yeah, everyone keeps trying to get them."
00:03:44,00:03:45,Yeah.
00:03:45,00:03:46,And everyone also keeps trying to get rid of the cats.
00:03:46,00:03:49,"And so, they keep going in the council, and saying, ""No, we're going to take these cats."""
00:03:49,00:03:52,"And every time they take, like, 20 cats away, another 20, a ride."
00:03:52,00:03:55,They just keep coming from like an ultimate cutlery.
00:03:55,00:03:56,They just love Kafka.
00:03:56,00:03:57,"Kafka, ask."
00:03:57,00:03:58,Never mind.
00:03:58,00:03:59,Let's go.
00:03:59,00:04:00,Okay.
00:04:00,00:04:03,"So, the whole burning, all of your work, post your death."
00:04:03,00:04:04,Why?
00:04:04,00:04:09,"I think because, so it's actually estimated that he burned 90% of what he wrote during his"
00:04:09,00:04:10,"life, Kafka."
00:04:10,00:04:13,"So, he only had 10% of what he wrote, but he was real perfectionist, and he hated himself."
00:04:13,00:04:15,"He was really self-loathing, so I think he thought that nothing that he ever wrote"
00:04:15,00:04:16,was good enough.
00:04:16,00:04:17,Yeah.
00:04:17,00:04:21,"And, I mean, I guess maybe some of it's quite revealing, like, he wrote this letter to his father."
00:04:21,00:04:24,"He went on holiday for two weeks, intending to write, and he ended up spending the entire"
00:04:24,00:04:28,"two weeks writing a letter to his father, this incredibly long letter, about everything"
00:04:28,00:04:31,"his father had done wrong, and his father sounds like a terrible person."
00:04:31,00:04:36,"So, it was accusing him of, say, of doing stuff like his father would say, ""No one's allowed"
00:04:36,00:04:37,to speak at the table.
00:04:37,00:04:38,"The table is for eating."""
00:04:38,00:04:41,"But his father would, incessantly speak at the table, ""No one's allowed to swear, but"
00:04:41,00:04:43,"his father had the foulest mouth of anyone he knew."""
00:04:43,00:04:44,Wow.
00:04:44,00:04:49,"And he wrote him, they spent two weeks writing this letter that he never sent him."
00:04:49,00:04:55,Another letter that he wrote that I quite like is he wrote a 16-page letter asking for
00:04:55,00:05:00,a promotion when he worked at the Workers Accident and Insurance Company.
00:05:00,00:05:06,"The thing about his father and the dinner table, Kafka liked to have the Diet Call Fletcherism,"
00:05:06,00:05:07,"you know, everyone."
00:05:07,00:05:10,"So, that's where you just keep chewing and chewing and chewing."
00:05:10,00:05:11,"Every mouthful, 100 times."
00:05:11,00:05:12,"Yeah, until it goes."
00:05:12,00:05:16,"Yeah, until, until basically there's nothing left in your mouth and it all turns into"
00:05:16,00:05:17,motion.
00:05:17,00:05:18,What's the point of doing that?
00:05:18,00:05:21,"By having larger things in your body, it makes you put them all white, whereas if you chew"
00:05:21,00:05:23,"it all, it makes it go through your body."
00:05:23,00:05:26,"Because it'll be more broken down, won't it, by your saliva?"
00:05:26,00:05:27,Yeah.
00:05:27,00:05:30,"So, they used to, for instance, they used to have dinner parties like Fletcherism, dinner"
00:05:30,00:05:34,"parties where they would have a timer, so everyone would have a mouthful, and they would"
00:05:34,00:05:37,"have like a one-minute timer, and everyone would pat you, chew, chew, chew, chew."
00:05:37,00:05:38,"And then they'd be like, Ding!"
00:05:38,00:05:41,"Okay, next mouthful, and then you do that."
00:05:41,00:05:42,Wow.
00:05:42,00:05:43,Come to party.
00:05:43,00:05:44,Yes.
00:05:44,00:05:45,7pm on the fourth.
00:05:45,00:05:48,Carriage is 9pm on the 12th.
00:05:48,00:05:49,"Fletcher was really cool, actually."
00:05:49,00:05:55,"He thought that by doing his particular style of diet, that you would only defecate once"
00:05:55,00:06:01,"every two weeks, and he said that it would smell like warm biscuits."
00:06:01,00:06:05,"And also, apparently, carried around a sample of his own feces around to illustrate the"
00:06:05,00:06:06,wonder.
00:06:06,00:06:07,Wow.
00:06:07,00:06:16,"He also got really into mullers, he was into fads because he was really self-conscious about"
00:06:16,00:06:17,his weight.
00:06:17,00:06:21,"He was afraid of his own reflection because he thought he hated the fact that he was so ugly,"
00:06:21,00:06:22,but he actually wasn't.
00:06:22,00:06:28,"But he got really into mullers exercise fad, which was, I think, probably the first real big"
00:06:28,00:06:32,"exercise fad, this guy called Muller, telling you that exercise you should do every day."
00:06:32,00:06:33,It was like naked exercise.
00:06:33,00:06:37,"That was the naked exercise, so he always appeared in a loincloth and said people should"
00:06:37,00:06:38,just wear this at all.
00:06:38,00:06:40,And he would go skiing in some merits in a loincloth and stuff.
00:06:40,00:06:45,"People were a bit skeptical about how beneficial this was to anyone's health, but he got ready,"
00:06:45,00:06:47,he was devoted to that.
00:06:47,00:06:48,That's fantastic.
00:06:48,00:06:49,Yeah.
00:06:49,00:06:53,"I was looking into, sort of, just famous authors in their quirky ways of writing."
00:06:53,00:06:54,Yeah.
00:06:54,00:06:55,"So Kafka, obviously, just going from massively long letters."
00:06:55,00:07:00,It's really enjoyable to find out that everyone doesn't find writing as easy as you assume
00:07:00,00:07:01,that they did.
00:07:01,00:07:07,"Some of the biggest authors, so Victor Hugo, he was so bad at writing and concentrating"
00:07:07,00:07:09,"and needing to be in that, you know, you always have that."
00:07:09,00:07:11,"Oh, I need to get out of the room and do something more important."
00:07:11,00:07:15,"He used to lock away all of his clothes, the void temptation of going outside."
00:07:15,00:07:16,"Oh, wow."
00:07:16,00:07:17,"Yeah, yes."
00:07:17,00:07:21,"He often had a chauffeur who he'd give the clothes to, and said, ""No account, give me these"
00:07:21,00:07:24,"clothes until I've done my work."""
00:07:24,00:07:27,And he did eventually start wearing a shirt.
00:07:27,00:07:32,"I think people would walk in and be like, ""Oh, was that a Greek writer who shaved half of"
00:07:32,00:07:33,"his head?"""
00:07:33,00:07:37,"And the idea was that he would be too embarrassed to go out in public, and so he would stay in"
00:07:37,00:07:38,and write.
00:07:38,00:07:39,Can't remember who that was.
00:07:39,00:07:40,Wow.
00:07:40,00:07:41,Wow.
00:07:41,00:07:42,It's so nice.
00:07:42,00:07:43,These are all universally bad ideas.
00:07:43,00:07:44,Yeah.
00:07:44,00:07:45,It's the interesting thing for these great writers.
00:07:45,00:07:48,"Yeah, because if you can't resist this temptation, you end up wandering streets stark naked"
00:07:48,00:07:50,"with half a head of hair, and you're in an asylum."
00:07:50,00:07:54,"But the half of the hair head of hair is okay, because if you were desperate enough, you"
00:07:54,00:07:57,could just make sure that you were facing one direction wherever you are.
00:07:57,00:08:00,"As long as you kept that spot, no one would know."
00:08:00,00:08:05,"And just on writing practices, I didn't know this about T.S. Eliot, who similarly to Kafka"
00:08:05,00:08:08,"left in strut, he didn't want his life written by anyone."
00:08:08,00:08:10,He left in strut because there should be no official biography of him.
00:08:10,00:08:15,"And I think Peter Accroyd's just written one, but he basically wasn't allowed access to"
00:08:15,00:08:19,"any of T.S. Eliot's private letters or any of his life, so it's quite difficult."
00:08:19,00:08:20,Made it up.
00:08:20,00:08:21,"Yeah, I think he just made it all up."
00:08:21,00:08:22,So maybe this is made up.
00:08:22,00:08:28,"But no, T.S. Eliot used to put very pale green makeup on his face, and nobody knows"
00:08:28,00:08:29,why.
00:08:29,00:08:30,So pale green makeup.
00:08:30,00:08:33,"People have speculated it was to look like a corpse, although I don't know why he'd want"
00:08:33,00:08:34,to do that.
00:08:34,00:08:35,Maybe it was just a fashion thing.
00:08:35,00:08:37,"T.S. Eliot, who's he?"
00:08:37,00:08:38,The green face guy.
00:08:38,00:08:42,Maybe he was just always insanely jealous.
00:08:42,00:08:43,Maybe it was that.
00:08:43,00:08:44,"Oh yeah, just constantly."
00:08:44,00:08:45,What are his poems like?
00:08:45,00:08:46,I haven't read it.
00:08:46,00:08:47,Are they just like…
00:08:47,00:08:48,She's with him again.
00:08:48,00:08:49,Yeah.
00:08:49,00:08:50,Yep.
00:08:50,00:08:53,"Do you see the green cat in Bulgaria this week, who's in the news?"
00:08:53,00:08:54,No.
00:08:54,00:08:55,Yeah.
00:08:55,00:08:56,There's a green cat in Bulgaria.
00:08:56,00:08:58,"It's like bright green, and everyone's like, well, how on earth could it be a bright"
00:08:58,00:08:59,green cat?
00:08:59,00:09:03,Is it like some kind of science experiment gone wrong or something?
00:09:03,00:09:06,"Apparently, it's like sleeping in the top of green paint."
00:09:06,00:09:07,Right.
00:09:07,00:09:11,How long did it take them to work that out?
00:09:11,00:09:12,Not so long.
00:09:12,00:09:13,"Yeah, okay."
00:09:13,00:09:14,Vector Hugo.
00:09:14,00:09:15,Yeah.
00:09:15,00:09:16,I think this is right.
00:09:16,00:09:19,"He kept a detail, an extremely detailed diary of all the women he's slept with."
00:09:19,00:09:20,Did he?
00:09:20,00:09:21,Yeah.
00:09:21,00:09:22,But it was extremely detailed.
00:09:22,00:09:24,It was like a spreadsheet with lots of different columns and lots of different…
00:09:24,00:09:26,That's kind of a woman's worst nightmare.
00:09:26,00:09:30,It's like the curator at the Natural History Museum.
00:09:30,00:09:31,"He does that, doesn't he?"
00:09:31,00:09:32,Every spoke.
00:09:32,00:09:33,"No, did we speak?"
00:09:33,00:09:34,Did we talk about this on the podcast?
00:09:34,00:09:40,"He used to collect, after every sexual conquest, a single hair of pubic hair."
00:09:40,00:09:41,What?
00:09:41,00:09:42,"Yeah, after…"
00:09:42,00:09:46,"So we should specify, this is not the current curator at the point where he's doing that."
00:09:46,00:09:47,"No, no, no."
00:09:47,00:09:48,"He just said the curator, dad."
00:09:48,00:09:49,"No, just want to avoid any potential."
00:09:49,00:09:50,"Oh, no, I'm illegal."
00:09:50,00:09:51,He's the one that we've spoken about before.
00:09:51,00:09:52,He was a curator.
00:09:52,00:09:53,I can't remember his name.
00:09:53,00:09:57,He used to collect just one sprig.
00:09:57,00:10:02,"I seem to remember sprig of pubic hair, being the word used."
00:10:02,00:10:07,"And he would file them in color and date, and he did a proper curators job on it."
00:10:07,00:10:12,"So they were going through all his files after he died, and they came across this kind of"
00:10:12,00:10:13,collection of pubic hair.
00:10:13,00:10:14,Can you visit that at the Natural History Museum?
00:10:14,00:10:16,It's not just play in the way with the…
00:10:16,00:10:17,It's real shame.
00:10:17,00:10:18,"It should be, though, yeah."
00:10:18,00:10:19,It should.
00:10:19,00:10:20,That's very distressing.
00:10:20,00:10:25,"Other writers in their weird writing habits, there was a writer who was huge American novelist"
00:10:25,00:10:31,"that sort of early 1900s, Thomas Clayton Wolf, who always used to write on a refrigerator"
00:10:31,00:10:35,"because he was so tall, which just seems like he's rubbing in people's faces."
00:10:35,00:10:36,What was the little magnet letters?
00:10:36,00:10:37,Yeah.
00:10:37,00:10:39,"Took him a little time taking the novel out, the ages, yeah."
00:10:39,00:10:42,Imagine sending it to the publishers as well.
00:10:42,00:10:44,There were 300 fridges outside.
00:10:44,00:10:45,Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:47,Kids rearranging it.
00:10:47,00:10:48,Yeah.
00:10:48,00:10:55,"This novel just seems to say, ""bum, bum, we..."""
00:10:55,00:10:57,"Just going back to Kafka, if we can."
00:10:57,00:10:58,Yes.
00:10:58,00:11:03,"So there was a biography of Kafka written a couple of years ago by a guy called James Hors,"
00:11:03,00:11:09,and he caused controversy because he wanted to talk about the pornography that Kafka had.
00:11:09,00:11:13,"And apparently he was saying that Kafka was into hardcore porn, including images of"
00:11:13,00:11:17,Hedgehog style creatures performing Felatio.
00:11:17,00:11:19,Hedgehog style creatures.
00:11:19,00:11:22,"Yeah, so like creatures that look a bit like a Hedgehog, but like pocketbines maybe."
00:11:22,00:11:23,"Oh, okay."
00:11:23,00:11:24,I'll just say pocketbines.
00:11:24,00:11:25,I don't know.
00:11:25,00:11:27,"I think they're like half human, half hedgehog things."
00:11:27,00:11:31,"So he was a furry, isn't that what a furry is?"
00:11:31,00:11:32,Yeah.
00:11:32,00:11:33,Kind of.
00:11:33,00:11:34,I'm not sure he dressed up as them.
00:11:34,00:11:35,Okay.
00:11:35,00:11:40,"But then the German scholars then said, ""Well, this is obviously rubbish."
00:11:40,00:11:46,Author in Britain is just a prude and these hedgehog kind of things are just not pornography
00:11:46,00:11:47,at all.
00:11:47,00:11:48,"They're just high art."""
00:11:48,00:11:49,Yeah.
00:11:49,00:11:53,And he said that comparing those illustrations to hardcore porn is like comparing a poem
00:11:53,00:11:58,by Henrik Heiner with an advertising slogan form at Donald's.
00:11:58,00:12:00,"So basically, this isn't hardcore."
00:12:00,00:12:02,You should see our hardcore.
00:12:02,00:12:03,Yeah.
00:12:03,00:12:04,Coming to the back room.
00:12:04,00:12:05,I'll show you something.
00:12:05,00:12:06,Yeah.
00:12:06,00:12:10,"Since we're on the subject, I was reading a book about the history of London and it's"
00:12:10,00:12:15,"sort of London and vice, basically, and it had titles for 19th century pornography, which"
00:12:15,00:12:16,were quite something.
00:12:16,00:12:21,So the spreeish spouter or flashcoves slap up reciter.
00:12:21,00:12:24,"I mean, that is a good title, you know."
00:12:24,00:12:29,The jolly companion and the story of a dildo.
00:12:29,00:12:32,It sounds like it could almost be a girl's name.
00:12:32,00:12:33,You'd see it on the shelf.
00:12:33,00:12:35,"I think, ""Ah, the maiden of dildo."""
00:12:35,00:12:38,"Well, it might have been the story of a dildo, as in the story of Alan Dildo."
00:12:38,00:12:40,"Yeah, that's exactly."
00:12:40,00:12:47,"So I spoke about on a previous podcast just on this subject about monster erotica, you"
00:12:47,00:12:48,guys remember?
00:12:48,00:12:52,"So it's an amazing, I spent the weekend looking more into it."
00:12:52,00:12:58,"I've downloaded number, but the interesting thing was, they're all on kiddo, you can get them."
00:12:58,00:13:03,"There's this whole world of monster erotica, and you would figure that who the hell's"
00:13:03,00:13:04,reading this?
00:13:04,00:13:05,No one's reading it.
00:13:05,00:13:06,Cass was reading it.
00:13:06,00:13:07,Cass was reading it.
00:13:07,00:13:12,"Um, it turns out some of the authors are making up to $30,000 a month, if this is an effort"
00:13:12,00:13:18,"in a cyber saying how I earn $30,000 a month working from home, that's, it's a con."
00:13:18,00:13:19,Okay.
00:13:19,00:13:23,"Clearly, the whole 30,000 is coming out of Dan's bank account."
00:13:23,00:13:28,"Um, Kafka used to laugh uncontrollably at his own jokes, which is weird."
00:13:28,00:13:29,Indeed.
00:13:29,00:13:33,"Another thing which I think he would have found funny, because he had a really morbid sense"
00:13:33,00:13:37,"of humour, hence the, um, a spoof letter to his family convincing that he wasn't going to"
00:13:37,00:13:41,"die, which I don't know if I mentioned this, but he did die of TB, quite young, um, shortly"
00:13:41,00:13:47,"after sending them that spoof article, um, was that while he was writing the hunger artist,"
00:13:47,00:13:51,"which was a story about starvation, he was writing that as he was dying of TB and during"
00:13:51,00:13:54,the writing of that about someone who can't eat his throat closed up and he stopped me
00:13:54,00:13:56,able to eat anything.
00:13:56,00:13:59,So it's sort of like his body was trying to give him the visceral experience of what
00:13:59,00:14:00,he was writing about.
00:14:00,00:14:08,"Well, I used my first job as interviewing, um, women with acid reflux, um, for a market"
00:14:08,00:14:09,research company.
00:14:09,00:14:13,"And after four days of doing that, my boss and I, both doing the same interviews, we'd both"
00:14:13,00:14:16,"got the symptoms of acid reflux on the same night, coincidences and knives."
00:14:16,00:14:23,"One more thing about letters, um, Gordon Brown apparently liked to write letters to people"
00:14:23,00:14:30,"in the X Factor, and he, he wrote basically for a few years while he, I think it was Wally's"
00:14:30,00:14:31,Prime Minister.
00:14:31,00:14:33,"He would write to people and say, oh, I thought you were very good."
00:14:33,00:14:34,I thought.
00:14:34,00:14:35,Remember this?
00:14:35,00:14:36,Yeah.
00:14:36,00:14:41,"He wrote to one guy, Daniel Evans, a 38-year-old swimming pool cleaner and said, on a personal"
00:14:41,00:14:46,"note, can I say that the next time Simon says you are only supported by the over 60s, you"
00:14:46,00:14:47,can tell him I disagree.
00:14:47,00:14:48,He was 57.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Wow.
00:14:49,00:14:52,"Thanks, Gordon, really helping my case."
00:14:52,00:14:53,Yeah.
00:14:53,00:14:54,"Was he really big, like a massive fan?"
00:14:54,00:14:55,Apparently.
00:14:55,00:14:59,"No, it sounds like some kind of sad political stunt that his peers, stupid PR advisors, told"
00:14:59,00:15:04,"him to do along with smiling like a maniac in order to encourage himself with people, doesn't"
00:15:04,00:15:05,it?
00:15:05,00:15:06,Yeah.
00:15:06,00:15:07,I would like to think it was real.
00:15:07,00:15:08,"Oh, I've got one more thing about the writing process."
00:15:08,00:15:09,"Well, yeah."
00:15:09,00:15:10,Okay.
00:15:10,00:15:18,"So, uh, there's a, an inventor who James, it turns out, has met, uh, called Dr. Yoshiro Nakumatsu,"
00:15:18,00:15:19,which is--
00:15:19,00:15:20,"Yeah, I met him."
00:15:20,00:15:21,Yep.
00:15:21,00:15:22,So you've met him.
00:15:22,00:15:24,"He, okay, so he's responsible for a 3,300 inventions, according to him, James."
00:15:24,00:15:27,It might be the most prolific inventor of all time.
00:15:27,00:15:28,Yeah.
00:15:28,00:15:30,And he's in the floppy disk.
00:15:30,00:15:37,"He had many of his greatest ideas when he was close to drowning, all right?"
00:15:37,00:15:43,"And when you say many, it means that, obviously, this is a guy who shouldn't be in a pool."
00:15:43,00:15:51,"And so basically, he, uh, he also invented scooper apparatus, so he realized that, uh, in"
00:15:51,00:15:56,"order to have good ideas, or at least what works for him, is that he needs to be at the bottom"
00:15:56,00:15:59,of a pool simulating the idea that he's about to drown.
00:15:59,00:16:05,"And he had developed a, uh, one of his inventions, a non-dewater notepad, uh, so he'd start"
00:16:05,00:16:09,jawning ideas down as he was on the brink of death and then swim back to the surface and
00:16:09,00:16:12,"come out and go, ""Flock me desk, morons!"""
00:16:12,00:16:19,"Okay, time for the fact number two, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:16:19,00:16:22,My fact this week is that dead geckos still stick to walls.
00:16:22,00:16:24,"It's just pleasing, isn't it?"
00:16:24,00:16:29,"It's just a nice fact, um, and this was tested by a team of scientists who stuck a gecko,"
00:16:29,00:16:32,"what, they didn't stick a gecko on all, they just let it climb up one."
00:16:32,00:16:33,And then kill them and kill this.
00:16:33,00:16:34,Did they really?
00:16:34,00:16:35,That's how they did it?
00:16:35,00:16:39,"Yeah, it was, um, it was induced death rather than waiting for the gecko to die of natural"
00:16:39,00:16:43,"causes, which would, to be fair, have slowed the experiment down a great deal."
00:16:43,00:16:46,"Um, so it's, it's really interesting."
00:16:46,00:16:49,How come you don't see loads of dead geckos on the walls all the time and they're not
00:16:49,00:16:51,filling up all the walls?
00:16:51,00:16:52,You do.
00:16:52,00:16:55,"This is a wall paper you see, that's actually real."
00:16:55,00:17:01,"Lizard wallpapers that, yeah, you know, yeah, very fashionable, um, well, it lasts not forever,"
00:17:01,00:17:04,"it lasts until a while after they die, at least half an hour after they die, they can still"
00:17:04,00:17:05,be there.
00:17:05,00:17:06,A question.
00:17:06,00:17:12,"You know how we've been, because Andre Geim, uh, who is a professor, he, um, he came up"
00:17:12,00:17:17,"with, uh, the idea of a crafty, yeah, Nobel Prize winner for graphing, uh, it's going"
00:17:17,00:17:18,to change the world.
00:17:18,00:17:20,He does these pride in idea experiments.
00:17:20,00:17:24,"One of the things that he's invented in which he's trying to make better is, uh, a glove,"
00:17:24,00:17:29,"which acts like a gecko, it's called, um, gecko tape, I believe you can climb up a wall."
00:17:29,00:17:34,"The only issue that they have with it is that unlike a gecko, it kind of, the little hairs,"
00:17:34,00:17:35,which is what they are using.
00:17:35,00:17:40,"So spider hairs and gecko hairs, that's the kind of technology that they're trying to harness."
00:17:40,00:17:43,"Uh, it clogs up and so you start slipping and you start going down."
00:17:43,00:17:46,"My question is, get a big enough gecko."
00:17:46,00:17:51,Why can't you create a glove where a live gecko is on the actual end of the glove and you climb
00:17:51,00:17:55,a wall with four geckos with four geckos attached to your hands and your feet?
00:17:55,00:17:56,There's no reason.
00:17:56,00:17:57,There's no reason at all.
00:17:57,00:17:58,Has anyone tried?
00:17:58,00:17:59,You're a reethical reason.
00:17:59,00:18:00,"Well, hang on."
00:18:00,00:18:01,"They're, they're baking them."
00:18:01,00:18:02,"Well, hang on."
00:18:02,00:18:04,Climb walls and killing them while we don't know.
00:18:04,00:18:05,We're ready in dubious territory.
00:18:05,00:18:09,That's what scientific purposes not spider man purposes.
00:18:09,00:18:10,"Um, would help."
00:18:10,00:18:11,This would be from military.
00:18:11,00:18:12,All right.
00:18:12,00:18:13,We should say how they can do it in the first place.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"So, um, it's very, very clever."
00:18:16,00:18:21,"Every square millimeter of a geckos foot contains 14,000 little hair like structures."
00:18:21,00:18:26,"Um, and as they climb up the wall, they basically pushed these into contact with the wall and"
00:18:26,00:18:30,"they use something called the Vanderwiles force, which is so cool."
00:18:30,00:18:34,It basically disrupts the balance of electrons and protons in atoms.
00:18:34,00:18:39,"So the hair, as it's pushed towards the wall, it pushes all the electrons of the first"
00:18:39,00:18:41,"atom of the wall to one end, right?"
00:18:41,00:18:43,So it pushes them to the other end.
00:18:43,00:18:45,So that atom is next to the one next to it.
00:18:45,00:18:50,And it repels all the electrons to the other one because like forces repel.
00:18:50,00:18:55,"That means that you've got an atom, uh, with all electrons at one end and an atom with all"
00:18:55,00:18:59,protons at one end and they then are attracted to each other and stick together.
00:18:59,00:19:00,Yeah.
00:19:00,00:19:03,That in microcosm is how the gecko climbs up walls.
00:19:03,00:19:04,Wow.
00:19:04,00:19:05,And they can sport 20 times their own weight.
00:19:05,00:19:09,"I think they inspire, uh, they've inspired a kind of superglue, the way it works."
00:19:09,00:19:12,"Um, they've designed superglue based on that."
00:19:12,00:19:17,"Uh, there's another, there is a type of superglue that's based on that and the thing that muscles"
00:19:17,00:19:18,use.
00:19:18,00:19:24,"So muscles will attach to rocks using a kind of, um, like, uh, cement and they've mixed that"
00:19:24,00:19:29,kind of cement technology with the Vanderwiles technology of the geckos and they've got a
00:19:29,00:19:33,"new adhesive called, um, it's called gecko or something like that, which is like supposed"
00:19:33,00:19:37,"to be a super duper amazing, yeah, but also works underwater."
00:19:37,00:19:42,"So it could be used for, you know, like, um, elaster plus that won't go fall off in the bath"
00:19:42,00:19:43,and stuff like that.
00:19:43,00:19:44,That would be very handy.
00:19:44,00:19:45,That would be really useful.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Yeah.
00:19:46,00:19:47,How many of they haven't got on that yet?
00:19:47,00:19:49,But I don't think the elaster plus industry would allow it.
00:19:49,00:19:50,No.
00:19:50,00:19:53,"They make their money from people constantly losing them with the bath, but a new one out."
00:19:53,00:19:55,So it's like a conspiracy theory.
00:19:55,00:19:56,"Yeah, you're going up against big plaster there."
00:19:56,00:19:57,Yeah.
00:19:57,00:20:02,"I wonder if there's a technology that we've not yet harnessed in the, you know, when you,"
00:20:02,00:20:06,"uh, lick, uh, icicle, you try to stick to it."
00:20:06,00:20:07,Yeah.
00:20:07,00:20:08,Yeah.
00:20:08,00:20:10,Very good sticky little thing that we haven't really harnessed.
00:20:10,00:20:12,Do you think it's like 20 times your own weight?
00:20:12,00:20:13,Do you think you could hang off?
00:20:13,00:20:17,"Have you seen Dom and Dom or when they're trying to, I have, yeah, I don't know if that they"
00:20:17,00:20:19,did a lot of scientific research.
00:20:19,00:20:22,There's about five people trying to pull Jeff Daniel's tongue off that.
00:20:22,00:20:23,Okay.
00:20:23,00:20:24,It's really cool.
00:20:24,00:20:25,Again.
00:20:25,00:20:26,Yeah.
00:20:26,00:20:27,That wall is very cold.
00:20:27,00:20:28,Put your tongue in it.
00:20:28,00:20:32,We'll kill you and we'll see if you see.
00:20:32,00:20:33,Good work.
00:20:33,00:20:34,On geckos.
00:20:34,00:20:38,"There was, did you guys remember that woman earlier on this year who claimed she'd given birth"
00:20:38,00:20:39,to a gecko?
00:20:39,00:20:40,"Oh, yes."
00:20:40,00:20:41,Yeah.
00:20:41,00:20:42,In Indonesia.
00:20:42,00:20:44,"Um, and her and a midwife, uh, both reported it."
00:20:44,00:20:48,"She thought she was going to give birth to a child and when it came out, turned out that, uh,"
00:20:48,00:20:53,it was a lizard coated in mucus and blood apparently slithered out of the birth canal.
00:20:53,00:20:55,And I don't know why the midwife had to help with that.
00:20:55,00:20:57,Because it was quite easy.
00:20:57,00:20:58,Yeah.
00:20:58,00:20:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:59,00:21:00,Of course.
00:21:00,00:21:01,Yeah.
00:21:01,00:21:07,But then they became the target of this witch hunt in Indonesia because she was accused of
00:21:07,00:21:08,witchcraft.
00:21:08,00:21:09,The idea of witch hunt.
00:21:09,00:21:10,Yeah.
00:21:10,00:21:11,So why would you make that hoax?
00:21:11,00:21:13,Why would you pretend you'd give birth to a lizard?
00:21:13,00:21:14,It must be like the Kafka joke.
00:21:14,00:21:18,She thought this is going to go down a tree and then it got revealed.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"Actually, that kind of backfired."
00:21:20,00:21:21,Yeah.
00:21:21,00:21:24,"Geckos lick their own eyes to keep them, they don't, they can't blink."
00:21:24,00:21:25,Yeah.
00:21:25,00:21:26,So they just go around licking their own eyes.
00:21:26,00:21:27,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:27,00:21:28,Do you know that?
00:21:28,00:21:33,"Eyelids, they've got a sort of clear film over their eyes, but they don't have movable"
00:21:33,00:21:35,"eyelids, I believe."
00:21:35,00:21:36,All right.
00:21:36,00:21:37,You have three eyelids done.
00:21:37,00:21:39,I've always thought it looks a bit weird.
00:21:39,00:21:40,What would you mean?
00:21:40,00:21:41,Three eyelids on each eye.
00:21:41,00:21:42,Do I?
00:21:42,00:21:45,"So the one that goes down, one goes up and you have another little one."
00:21:45,00:21:49,There's a little kind of flap of pink in the corner of your eye and that used is what
00:21:49,00:21:53,used to be your third eyelid and now it's only a little tiny flap.
00:21:53,00:21:55,That's very coincidental because Geckos have three eyes.
00:21:55,00:21:56,Do they?
00:21:56,00:21:59,"Third eye, which is a little light sensing."
00:21:59,00:22:00,A pinial one.
00:22:00,00:22:01,"Yeah, pinial eye."
00:22:01,00:22:03,"Try to think of how to describe it, really."
00:22:03,00:22:04,What does pinial mean?
00:22:04,00:22:05,Okay.
00:22:05,00:22:13,"So basically it is, they are cells which will, they will scent light and they're outgrowls"
00:22:13,00:22:16,"of the pinial gland, which is in the top of your head."
00:22:16,00:22:20,I think the idea is that they can then scent the change in light above them.
00:22:20,00:22:24,"So if any kind of predators come from above, then they'll be able to scent them."
00:22:24,00:22:25,I think that's right.
00:22:25,00:22:26,Yeah.
00:22:26,00:22:29,"And they've done tests on people where, and I don't think this is a pinial thing, but where"
00:22:29,00:22:33,completely blind people can tell whether a light is on or not.
00:22:33,00:22:36,Do they hear someone click the switch?
00:22:36,00:22:37,No.
00:22:37,00:22:41,There's a type of gecko called the Morish gecko and they change.
00:22:41,00:22:44,They are delicious.
00:22:44,00:22:46,They change colour.
00:22:46,00:22:49,"If you put them on a surface, but unlike a chameleon, they change colour to be the same"
00:22:49,00:22:50,colour as a surface.
00:22:50,00:22:52,Are they genuinely camouflage themselves?
00:22:52,00:22:53,"Yeah, exactly."
00:22:53,00:22:57,"These geckos say you put them on a yellow surface, they'll turn yellow."
00:22:57,00:23:02,"But if you blindfold them, they'll still turn yellow because it's not their eyes that"
00:23:02,00:23:07,"are getting their senses, it's some kind of light senses in the skin that are doing it."
00:23:07,00:23:08,That's amazing.
00:23:08,00:23:12,"So if you put the blindfold around their kind of stomachs, then they won't be able to"
00:23:12,00:23:14,see it and they won't be able to change it.
00:23:14,00:23:15,"That's not a blindfold though, is it?"
00:23:15,00:23:16,It's a...
00:23:16,00:23:17,Stomach fold?
00:23:17,00:23:18,"Stomach fold, yeah."
00:23:18,00:23:19,Can they do patterns?
00:23:19,00:23:20,I...
00:23:20,00:23:24,Can you put them on a picture of Marilyn Monroe and have like that appear on a gecko?
00:23:24,00:23:25,Very sexy gecko.
00:23:25,00:23:31,"You're fulfilling a long-standing fantasy of dance here, which has a gecko look like Marilyn"
00:23:31,00:23:32,Monroe.
00:23:32,00:23:33,Yeah.
00:23:33,00:23:34,It's a monster.
00:23:34,00:23:36,Very much the Kafka of the office.
00:23:36,00:23:42,"There was a gecko discovered in 1877, a British lieutenant colonel called R.H. Bedham"
00:23:42,00:23:49,found it in India and then it disappeared and we just rediscovered it 135 years later.
00:23:49,00:23:50,We stumbled back upon it.
00:23:50,00:23:51,Same one.
00:23:51,00:23:56,"The J.Pore ground gecko, very old, very bored, not any company for a long time."
00:23:56,00:23:59,I missed the colonel.
00:23:59,00:24:00,Okay.
00:24:00,00:24:02,Can I tell you something about adhesion?
00:24:02,00:24:03,Yeah.
00:24:03,00:24:04,I think you will like.
00:24:04,00:24:05,Okay.
00:24:05,00:24:08,"This is in 2008, a campaigner against a third runway ad Heathrow attempted to glue himself"
00:24:08,00:24:10,to Gordon Brown at a Downing Street reception.
00:24:10,00:24:13,And he's called dangloss.
00:24:13,00:24:16,That'd be terrible because you'd have to spend the whole Saturday night watching
00:24:16,00:24:20,the next factory.
00:24:20,00:24:24,So he was about to receive an award from the Prime Minister for his campaigning work and
00:24:24,00:24:28,then he stuck out his super glued hand and touched the Prime Minister's sleeve.
00:24:28,00:24:33,And Downing Street later said there was no stickiness of any significance.
00:24:33,00:24:36,But the amazing thing is he'd smuggle this in in his pants.
00:24:36,00:24:40,"And he said afterwards, I just glued myself to him and after 20 seconds he tore my hand"
00:24:40,00:24:41,off.
00:24:41,00:24:42,It really hurt.
00:24:42,00:24:43,He tore his hand off.
00:24:43,00:24:47,He's a tough man.
00:24:47,00:24:48,Wow.
00:24:48,00:24:52,He had to give a couple of tugs before it came away.
00:24:52,00:24:53,He was just grinning about it.
00:24:53,00:24:59,He didn't seem to take me seriously.
00:24:59,00:25:03,"Later on, he was allowed to stay at number 10 for 40 minutes after this happened."
00:25:03,00:25:04,Wow.
00:25:04,00:25:06,"And when he left the building, I'm quoting from the BBC article about it here."
00:25:06,00:25:10,He tried to glue himself to the gates of Downing Street but was prevented from doing so
00:25:10,00:25:11,by a police officer.
00:25:11,00:25:15,"I didn't have much glue left by that point, he said."
00:25:15,00:25:18,"OK, time for fact number three."
00:25:18,00:25:20,And that is James.
00:25:20,00:25:26,"OK, my fact this week is that the active ingredient in the first ever homeopathy treatment"
00:25:26,00:25:28,was the blood of Thomas Beckett.
00:25:28,00:25:30,Wow.
00:25:30,00:25:34,"So this basically when Thomas Beckett died, he was basically a saint straight away as"
00:25:34,00:25:37,soon as he died and everyone thought he was great.
00:25:37,00:25:38,And they had his blood as a relic.
00:25:38,00:25:43,But they only had a small amount of his blood so the way that they could give it to lots
00:25:43,00:25:48,of different people was to put a tiny drop in enormous vat of water and then take bits
00:25:48,00:25:52,of that water and give it to people and it supposedly would be able to cure everything.
00:25:52,00:25:54,Which as far as I'm concerned is pretty much homeopathy.
00:25:54,00:25:55,I agree.
00:25:55,00:25:56,Yeah.
00:25:56,00:26:03,And it's supposedly just a few years after he died from the time that they started doing
00:26:03,00:26:07,"it to a few years after he hit something like 703 miracles, supposedly."
00:26:07,00:26:08,Yeah.
00:26:08,00:26:12,"But that was over the whole, I think it was over a 10 year period."
00:26:12,00:26:18,"And in just one year, a couple of years later, 100,000 people visited the, it's quite a"
00:26:18,00:26:19,low hit rate.
00:26:19,00:26:20,It's quite a low hit rate.
00:26:20,00:26:23,"But I found another report saying that it was you know, you would drink the water, this"
00:26:23,00:26:26,homeopathic water that James mentioned.
00:26:26,00:26:30,And also there were cases where reported in which it was used for the magical detection
00:26:30,00:26:33,of thieves and even for extinguishing fires.
00:26:33,00:26:35,Which is the same as that.
00:26:35,00:26:39,"Yeah, exactly."
00:26:39,00:26:40,It's a miracle.
00:26:40,00:26:41,The holy water.
00:26:41,00:26:42,Cut out this fire.
00:26:42,00:26:45,I was thirsty before and now I am not thirsty.
00:26:45,00:26:47,I was dirty before.
00:26:47,00:26:52,I was too hot before this magical substance.
00:26:52,00:26:54,Can I tell you about these just really quickly about those monks?
00:26:54,00:26:55,"Yeah, please."
00:26:55,00:26:59,So one of them was called William of Canterbury of the two monks who was writing down the
00:26:59,00:27:00,things.
00:27:00,00:27:01,Because this was in Canterbury.
00:27:01,00:27:02,"That's where he died, right?"
00:27:02,00:27:03,That's where he was buried anyway.
00:27:03,00:27:05,Because he was the Archbishop and he was killed.
00:27:05,00:27:07,And that's part of Canterbury tales as well.
00:27:07,00:27:08,He is the journey.
00:27:08,00:27:13,"Oh, to visit the end point is Thomas a Beckett."
00:27:13,00:27:14,Right.
00:27:14,00:27:16,"Well, Thomas Beckett, not a Beckett, right?"
00:27:16,00:27:17,That is a myth.
00:27:17,00:27:18,Thomas Beckett is a later edition.
00:27:18,00:27:19,He never really had the a.
00:27:19,00:27:22,It was the same with a Dildo.
00:27:22,00:27:28,"If he was called Dildo, if he was on Twitter these days, he would be at Thomas Beckett."
00:27:28,00:27:29,Yep.
00:27:29,00:27:32,I always feel sorry for having the second in the Thomas Beckett incident.
00:27:32,00:27:36,"Because he said, didn't he famously, well, people claim that he said, ""Will no one rid me"
00:27:36,00:27:39,"of this turbulent priest or some other phrase like that?"""
00:27:39,00:27:42,And that is the kind of thing you say when you're slightly pissed off with somebody and
00:27:42,00:27:46,what you're not asking your friends to do is actually go and brutally murder them.
00:27:46,00:27:47,Yeah.
00:27:47,00:27:48,I wonder if they came back.
00:27:48,00:27:49,"Well, we did it."
00:27:49,00:27:50,"He's like, you did what?"
00:27:50,00:27:51,Did what?
00:27:51,00:27:52,Yeah.
00:27:52,00:27:53,"Oh, my God, guys."
00:27:53,00:27:57,Simon Sharma reckons that that's not the right one.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"No, I know."
00:27:58,00:27:59,That's a really neat phrase.
00:27:59,00:28:05,"And the biographer at the time, Edward Grimm, wrote in Latin, and the translation is, what"
00:28:05,00:28:09,miserable drones and traitors have I nourished and brought up in my household who let their
00:28:09,00:28:13,"Lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a lone-born cleric, which is not catchy."
00:28:13,00:28:18,"But actually, there's no way of, he's not saying they're going kill him, is he?"
00:28:18,00:28:19,No.
00:28:19,00:28:20,Although he is.
00:28:20,00:28:21,No.
00:28:21,00:28:22,It's even more ambiguous.
00:28:22,00:28:26,"But he is actively saying that his, like, the people who work for him have a responsibility"
00:28:26,00:28:27,to go and seek vengeance.
00:28:27,00:28:28,That's true.
00:28:28,00:28:30,"He's saying, you're crap because you're lessing yourself."
00:28:30,00:28:31,Exactly.
00:28:31,00:28:33,"And I bet he'd, they got told off of doing it."
00:28:33,00:28:35,"It's one of those bosses, just never happy."
00:28:35,00:28:38,One of them had to come fight on the crusades for 14 years to say sorry.
00:28:38,00:28:39,Yeah.
00:28:39,00:28:40,Just to say sorry.
00:28:40,00:28:41,Yeah.
00:28:41,00:28:42,"Oh, wow."
00:28:42,00:28:45,"Well, Henry was, I think, whipped by 80 monks."
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:47,"He asked for that, didn't he?"
00:28:47,00:28:49,"He requested it, not that he was asking for it."
00:28:49,00:28:50,Yeah.
00:28:50,00:28:54,"He was like, he wanted to be penitent, so he asked to be whipped by these monks."
00:28:54,00:28:55,Wow.
00:28:55,00:28:58,"And they just said, sure, that's not weird."
00:28:58,00:28:59,We'll do it.
00:28:59,00:29:03,"It was more common at the time, yeah, to, uh, to be request for monks to whip you."
00:29:03,00:29:04,Yeah.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"What if you were, yeah."
00:29:06,00:29:08,You make it sound weird now.
00:29:08,00:29:13,"One thing I read a really peculiar thing about him, peculiar to me, but then clearly I find"
00:29:13,00:29:18,"things like being whipped by 80 monks peculiar, so maybe this is a very normal thing."
00:29:18,00:29:24,"I read that on his death, the monks at Canterbury discovered that he wore a hair shirt and it was"
00:29:24,00:29:28,"infested with lice, these were under his vestments."
00:29:28,00:29:29,What's a hair shirt?
00:29:29,00:29:33,That is a special shirt made of very coarse animal hair that you put on under your normal
00:29:33,00:29:37,"clothes, and it scourges and irritates you and it spurs you to keep you."
00:29:37,00:29:40,"Oh, so it was, it wasn't like a nice comfort thing?"
00:29:40,00:29:41,No.
00:29:41,00:29:42,It was.
00:29:42,00:29:44,Do you know where those?
00:29:44,00:29:48,What do you wear when you go to be whipped by 80 monks?
00:29:48,00:29:52,Thomas Beckett was voted the second worst Britain of the last thousand years.
00:29:52,00:29:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:53,00:29:56,And a poll by BBC History magazine.
00:29:56,00:29:58,Who came first?
00:29:58,00:29:59,Jack the Ripper.
00:29:59,00:30:03,"Wow, so that's quite harsh considering that he wasn't really a murderer."
00:30:03,00:30:05,Because I knew that everyone loved him as well.
00:30:05,00:30:06,"Yeah, at the time."
00:30:06,00:30:07,He wasn't a murderer.
00:30:07,00:30:08,No.
00:30:08,00:30:09,There are lots of other murderers.
00:30:09,00:30:10,I'm surprised by Jack the Ripper.
00:30:10,00:30:11,What?
00:30:11,00:30:12,He was surprised by Jack the Ripper.
00:30:12,00:30:13,He voted the worst Britain.
00:30:13,00:30:14,Yeah.
00:30:14,00:30:15,The worst of all time.
00:30:15,00:30:16,Of all time.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Who would you go for?
00:30:17,00:30:18,"I don't know, but like Jeremy Logson."
00:30:18,00:30:19,There are.
00:30:19,00:30:23,"As a theory, he got his name Beckett from Beck, which means Beak, because he had quite a prominent"
00:30:23,00:30:27,nose and that was maybe a family trait and that's where his family had got the surname
00:30:27,00:30:28,from.
00:30:28,00:30:29,It's just a theory.
00:30:29,00:30:30,Really?
00:30:30,00:30:31,"That isn't a humanism, a bit Thomas Beakie."
00:30:31,00:30:35,"When he was killed, he'd just got back from a six-year, I was going to say a six-year holiday."
00:30:35,00:30:39,He'd actually been axiled in fearing his life.
00:30:39,00:30:40,But still.
00:30:40,00:30:42,That's how he was marketing it to his friends.
00:30:42,00:30:45,So he was away for six-year because he was in fear of his life?
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Yeah, he was."
00:30:46,00:30:47,He was right.
00:30:47,00:30:50,"When he literally arrived back, he was killed."
00:30:50,00:30:55,"He came back under an amnesty, because he had had a huge power struggle with the king."
00:30:55,00:30:58,And then he got back under an agreement and it was all going to be fine.
00:30:58,00:31:02,And then he started excommunicating a load of people who he'd specifically agreed he
00:31:02,00:31:05,wouldn't or the king had asked him not to.
00:31:05,00:31:06,Okay.
00:31:06,00:31:07,So that was the reason.
00:31:07,00:31:08,That he was killed.
00:31:08,00:31:09,Back on your word.
00:31:09,00:31:13,"On Hommieopathy, the guy who came up with it, so and called it Hommieopathy, came with"
00:31:13,00:31:16,"the original theory for it, who was Hanuman."
00:31:16,00:31:20,"He thought that coffee was the thing that caused, he went there a phase of the thing that"
00:31:20,00:31:22,coffee caused huge numbers of diseases.
00:31:22,00:31:25,And he said the thing that was wrong with coffee and the reason you know it's bad is because
00:31:25,00:31:27,coffee drinking makes everything pleasurable.
00:31:27,00:31:32,"And you know that in life, you're supposed to suffer as well as experience pleasure."
00:31:32,00:31:35,And you sort of get drunk on coffee and you enjoy everything too much.
00:31:35,00:31:37,And that's not how it's supposed to be.
00:31:37,00:31:41,"So he says, even in the corporal functions, which in a natural state of health are accompanied"
00:31:41,00:31:46,"by rude and almost painful sensations, now operate with an astonishing facility and even"
00:31:46,00:31:48,with a species of pleasure.
00:31:48,00:31:50,What is he referring to when he took that corporal?
00:31:50,00:31:53,It sounds a lot like he's referring to the fact that you've suddenly got chronic diarrhea
00:31:53,00:31:54,as soon as you have a coffee.
00:31:54,00:31:56,And it sounds to me like he was just a constipated man.
00:31:56,00:31:57,It sounds like he's got IBS.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"Yeah, it does, isn't it?"
00:31:59,00:32:01,Company by rude and painful sensations.
00:32:01,00:32:02,"Yeah, it's IBS."
00:32:02,00:32:03,Yeah.
00:32:03,00:32:04,Good diagnosis.
00:32:04,00:32:09,So George Sick received Hommieopathy treatment when he was trying to get his speech
00:32:09,00:32:10,right.
00:32:10,00:32:13,"So in the King's speech, he had that, but it wasn't in the movie."
00:32:13,00:32:14,So what did he have?
00:32:14,00:32:17,What did they give him a ground up word diluted heavily?
00:32:17,00:32:18,How did he?
00:32:18,00:32:22,"Just a very short word, yeah, with lots of silence."
00:32:22,00:32:29,It was a medicine called hypericum and he was so appreciative of it that he named a race
00:32:29,00:32:30,horse after it.
00:32:30,00:32:31,Yeah.
00:32:31,00:32:32,So quite appreciative.
00:32:32,00:32:33,Yeah.
00:32:33,00:32:36,To name a child after it.
00:32:36,00:32:39,"King Hypericum, probably best."
00:32:39,00:32:40,I saw it.
00:32:40,00:32:47,"I was looking on a forum about just, I guess, these kind of miracle relics that are out there."
00:32:47,00:32:53,"And someone was asking an interesting question, which is they used to, these relics used to"
00:32:53,00:33:00,sort of perform or give miracles quite a sort of large volume in the early days.
00:33:00,00:33:06,"And the question was, as time passes, do relics perform less miracles just because like the"
00:33:06,00:33:12,"Gecko on the wall after half an hour or four lot of has it got a period of, exactly, does"
00:33:12,00:33:14,it have the ability to do it for so long?
00:33:14,00:33:19,"And everyone obviously said no on the forum, but yeah, I just like that as a question."
00:33:19,00:33:21,"I like, do they run out of steam?"
00:33:21,00:33:22,Do they run out of steam?
00:33:22,00:33:23,Yeah.
00:33:23,00:33:27,"Well, because I love, this is my favorite thing about this part of history is with these"
00:33:27,00:33:28,kind of relics.
00:33:28,00:33:32,It does sound like everyone was a superhero back then and we've lost the ability to be
00:33:32,00:33:39,"superheroes. I found a thing that James posted on QI, the forums years ago, I found it this"
00:33:39,00:33:40,week.
00:33:40,00:33:41,This is really funny.
00:33:41,00:33:45,So this is someone super power from back in the day.
00:33:45,00:33:51,"The Times reported that Sonora Anna Morano, the luminous woman of Perano, she suffered"
00:33:51,00:33:53,from asthma.
00:33:53,00:34:00,"And as a result of the asthma, admitted a blue glow from her breasts as she slept."
00:34:00,00:34:05,"Many doctors came to witness the phenomenon, yeah, of course they did, yeah."
00:34:05,00:34:09,"But apparently, I'm not sure if there's ever an answer to why she had, it's not super power."
00:34:09,00:34:11,Are we counting that as a superhero?
00:34:11,00:34:15,"Well, I mean, you know, you know, what purpose is that set of luminous breast woman?"
00:34:15,00:34:21,"What if you lost in the, she paled up with Tia Celia in his green face, they go, you know,"
00:34:21,00:34:22,join a circus?
00:34:22,00:34:25,"If that's the Times, I guess that's not as old as I thought it was."
00:34:25,00:34:28,"No, it's quite, I remember that, I don't remember it happening."
00:34:28,00:34:31,I wasn't posing as a doctor or anything.
00:34:31,00:34:32,"No, but I remember reading about it."
00:34:32,00:34:35,"I think I read it in 40 and Times, actually."
00:34:35,00:34:37,"So it must have been only 10, in the last 10 years."
00:34:37,00:34:38,Yeah.
00:34:38,00:34:39,Yeah.
00:34:39,00:34:40,I'm not sure how real it was.
00:34:40,00:34:41,Blue boobs.
00:34:41,00:34:42,Just say.
00:34:42,00:34:44,Bloobs for short.
00:34:44,00:34:48,"Blue burial is after they finished filming a film, they just superimposed blue breasts onto"
00:34:48,00:34:49,everyone.
00:34:49,00:34:54,"Okay, time for our final factor to show."
00:34:54,00:35:01,"And that is my fact, and my fact this week is that in 2013, a group of people attempted"
00:35:01,00:35:04,to crowdfund London's first ever UFO museum.
00:35:04,00:35:09,"They needed a million dollars, but unfortunately, after 30 days of pushing and trying to raise"
00:35:09,00:35:11,"money, they only managed to get $370."
00:35:11,00:35:16,"I mean, a million in 30 days is very ambitious, but also that is what, that's $10 a day they"
00:35:16,00:35:17,managed to raise.
00:35:17,00:35:21,"It's almost like the kind of people who are putting this together have unrealistic ideas,"
00:35:21,00:35:24,based in reality.
00:35:24,00:35:28,"They only got four pledges, really, from people, and someone, it felt like one of them was"
00:35:28,00:35:29,their mum.
00:35:29,00:35:32,"It was like, you know, like, when you set up this thing and it's like, oh, please support"
00:35:32,00:35:33,my thing.
00:35:33,00:35:34,Yeah.
00:35:34,00:35:35,Always your parents come in first.
00:35:35,00:35:36,Yeah.
00:35:36,00:35:37,Yeah.
00:35:37,00:35:39,"So, but I mean, it looked really interesting."
00:35:39,00:35:41,What was going to be in the UFO museum?
00:35:41,00:35:45,"Well, I think it was going to be UK based UFO stuff, of which there is tons."
00:35:45,00:35:50,"The biggest ever sighting of UFO, like a big UFO incident, was in the UK."
00:35:50,00:35:53,"Yeah, but I mean, get the actual saucer, did we?"
00:35:53,00:35:55,We don't have the UFOs.
00:35:55,00:36:00,"Is it just a lot of mad people telling anecdotes sort of stuck in rooms in the museum, saying?"
00:36:00,00:36:02,I saw this really scary thing in the sky.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Yeah.
00:36:03,00:36:07,What would be really great is that you go in and you don't see anything and you come in
00:36:07,00:36:08,"and you go, we saw nothing in there."
00:36:08,00:36:12,"And then they say, yeah, there's the men in black at the end who wipe your memory."
00:36:12,00:36:17,That's a really cheap way of making a brilliant idea.
00:36:17,00:36:22,"So, there is a, there's not a UFO museum that I can find in existence, but you know what"
00:36:22,00:36:23,I assume about.
00:36:23,00:36:24,Are there UFO museums?
00:36:24,00:36:25,Roswell.
00:36:25,00:36:26,It's one in Roswell.
00:36:26,00:36:27,Roswell.
00:36:27,00:36:28,Roswell one.
00:36:28,00:36:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:29,00:36:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:30,00:36:31,What's in there?
00:36:31,00:36:35,"It's all, I guess, I'll put like a dummy of an alien and that will become as famous as what"
00:36:35,00:36:37,could be the real alien because enough people have seen it.
00:36:37,00:36:38,Yeah.
00:36:38,00:36:39,That's what they do.
00:36:39,00:36:40,"So, there's a cryptozoology museum in Maine."
00:36:40,00:36:41,And it seems like they do the same thing.
00:36:41,00:36:46,"They just keep making models of made up animals and then saying, isn't this amazing?"
00:36:46,00:36:48,This is what a Yeti would look like if it was a thing.
00:36:48,00:36:49,Yeah.
00:36:49,00:36:53,"But it does sound quite cool, the International Cryptozoology Museum in Portland."
00:36:53,00:36:58,They've got thousands of exhibits and like bits that are claiming to be bits of Barnum's
00:36:58,00:36:59,Fiji Mermaid.
00:36:59,00:37:02,I kind of want to test you on whether you know what all these made up words are.
00:37:02,00:37:03,Okay.
00:37:03,00:37:04,"So, they're the Mermaid."
00:37:04,00:37:05,Yeah.
00:37:05,00:37:06,They're the Mermaid.
00:37:06,00:37:07,You can see a few of them in the British Museum.
00:37:07,00:37:08,"So, these are the..."
00:37:08,00:37:09,"It's one at the Hanuman, I think."
00:37:09,00:37:10,Yeah.
00:37:10,00:37:11,"So, these are the ones, it's a half monkey, half fish."
00:37:11,00:37:12,"So, together."
00:37:12,00:37:13,Yeah.
00:37:13,00:37:16,They're just inside on the right hand side of the British Museum.
00:37:16,00:37:17,Yeah.
00:37:17,00:37:18,I think we've talked about them before.
00:37:18,00:37:19,Yeah.
00:37:19,00:37:22,"We've talked about them in relation to P.T. Barnum, who had a load of them."
00:37:22,00:37:27,"One of his other tricks was he said, ""I have a cherry-colored cat in this bag."""
00:37:27,00:37:30,And it was just sleeping in some cherry paint.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"No, it was just a black cat."
00:37:32,00:37:37,"And he said, ""Some cherries are black."""
00:37:37,00:37:39,That's a good one.
00:37:39,00:37:42,I kissed a girl by the barn made in the British Museum.
00:37:42,00:37:43,Sorry?
00:37:43,00:37:44,Just for a minute.
00:37:44,00:37:46,It's just the worst Katy Perry song I've ever heard.
00:37:46,00:37:47,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
00:37:47,00:37:48,"Ha, ha, ha, ha."
00:37:48,00:37:49,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:37:49,00:37:50,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:37:50,00:37:51,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:37:51,00:37:52,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:37:52,00:37:53,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:37:53,00:37:54,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:37:54,00:37:55,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:37:55,00:37:56,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:37:56,00:37:57,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:37:57,00:37:58,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:37:58,00:37:59,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:37:59,00:38:00,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:38:00,00:38:02,"So, Dan, do you know what this is?"
00:38:02,00:38:03,The...
00:38:03,00:38:07,"So, this museum contains, like, loads of hair samples of, like, the abominable snowman and"
00:38:07,00:38:09,around a pendeck and Yahweh.
00:38:09,00:38:11,It's not a single pew from each one.
00:38:11,00:38:12,I think it is.
00:38:12,00:38:13,"Ha, ha, ha."
00:38:13,00:38:14,"Ha, ha."
00:38:14,00:38:18,"Um, and there's also a letter from the actor Jimmy Stewart, who's one of my favourite actors."
00:38:18,00:38:20,"So, this does point to me if it's true."
00:38:20,00:38:25,A letter from the actor Jimmy Stewart is on display as he is linked to the pangbok Yeti
00:38:25,00:38:26,hand mystery.
00:38:26,00:38:27,That hand.
00:38:27,00:38:28,Who are?
00:38:28,00:38:29,How is Jimmy Stewart linked to that?
00:38:29,00:38:31,There was a hand which supposedly belonged to Yeti.
00:38:31,00:38:37,"But yeah, he was very obsessed with Yetis and he managed to get his hand on this hand."
00:38:37,00:38:38,On the hand.
00:38:38,00:38:39,Yeah.
00:38:39,00:38:40,There was a review of this museum.
00:38:40,00:38:43,"And the guy said, quite frankly, we have more creepy things in my living room than they"
00:38:43,00:38:45,have in this museum.
00:38:45,00:38:47,And then he gave it five stars.
00:38:47,00:38:49,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
00:38:49,00:38:55,"Another museum in America, the Cockroach Hall of Fame Museum, which is in Plano, Texas."
00:38:55,00:39:00,"This was a guy called Michael Bowden, who was an exterminator."
00:39:00,00:39:05,And he has dead Cockroaches dressed as celebrities.
00:39:05,00:39:08,Have you got any examples?
00:39:08,00:39:14,"Yes, Ross Perroach and David Letterroach, too."
00:39:14,00:39:16,"I think he's also got a Liberochi, isn't he?"
00:39:16,00:39:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:17,00:39:21,And it's a little gold capes in a tiny piano.
00:39:21,00:39:26,"So this guy's experience with the bizarre, I'm reading here, began in the 1980s when he held"
00:39:26,00:39:31,a contest to find the biggest Cockroach in Dallas.
00:39:31,00:39:36,He later travelled the country judging Cockroach fashion contests as a promotional stunt for
00:39:36,00:39:39,an insecticide company.
00:39:39,00:39:41,"Well, you wouldn't do it as anything else, would you?"
00:39:41,00:39:42,It's a serious investigation.
00:39:42,00:39:46,"I like the way that he's had that job, and he's turned it into something awesome, like"
00:39:46,00:39:47,a museum.
00:39:47,00:39:50,"About the insecticide company's a knotted, he sort of went a bit off-peast."
00:39:50,00:39:52,That's very funny.
00:39:52,00:39:54,"Daniel, I have a question for you."
00:39:54,00:39:57,What shape was the first ever flying saucer?
00:39:57,00:39:58,Ooh.
00:39:58,00:40:00,There's a clue in the word saucer.
00:40:00,00:40:01,So it was round like a saucer?
00:40:01,00:40:02,No.
00:40:02,00:40:03,Ah.
00:40:03,00:40:04,"The trick, too."
00:40:04,00:40:05,What they're trying.
00:40:05,00:40:10,"The word saucer, why it was called flying saucer, was because it skipped across the sky like"
00:40:10,00:40:11,a saucer.
00:40:11,00:40:14,"Like, if you were a skimming saucer, that's why it got called that."
00:40:14,00:40:17,"It was actually, um, crescent-shaped, like a boomerang."
00:40:17,00:40:18,"Oh, really?"
00:40:18,00:40:19,Yeah.
00:40:19,00:40:23,"Is that why we can't keep them, because they always go back to where they came from?"
00:40:23,00:40:24,"Oh, yes."
00:40:24,00:40:26,Why they're on the UFOs in the museum.
00:40:26,00:40:29,So do we know anything about the people who started this?
00:40:29,00:40:33,Are they the genuine believers in alien UFOs?
00:40:33,00:40:34,Yeah.
00:40:34,00:40:35,"We'll give you the basic blurb, if they wrote."
00:40:35,00:40:41,Our team includes people of soundbind who wanted to go to a UFO museum one day close to home
00:40:41,00:40:45,"in Paris, London, and Berlin, and realized that they had to travel thousands of miles to"
00:40:45,00:40:46,visit such a place.
00:40:46,00:40:49,"When you have to start off something by saying, ""Where have soundbind?"""
00:40:49,00:40:50,"Yeah, obviously."
00:40:50,00:40:51,It's like...
00:40:51,00:40:57,And I think they think soundbind means they have voices in their head.
00:40:57,00:41:01,"We already have access to material from a former UFO museum, but to open a new place"
00:41:01,00:41:06,"today that would look modern, one would need much more material and to purchase new equipment."
00:41:06,00:41:09,"We've even found a few perfect locations to rent in London, but there are many other issues"
00:41:09,00:41:10,to solve first.
00:41:10,00:41:16,"We need your support to do more research, produce more information boards, mannequins, videos,"
00:41:16,00:41:19,"pictures, computers, etc."
00:41:19,00:41:22,"We truly believe this is a unique, exciting project that would attract a lot of people and"
00:41:22,00:41:25,we need your help and support to make this become a reality.
00:41:25,00:41:26,That was their basic blurb.
00:41:26,00:41:27,See.
00:41:27,00:41:29,No mention of what would be in there.
00:41:29,00:41:31,Have you had a kick-end?
00:41:31,00:41:32,No.
00:41:32,00:41:38,"It's a side-project to Kickstarter, which a man has set up, which is all the projects on Kickstarter"
00:41:38,00:41:40,which have made nothing.
00:41:40,00:41:41,Okay.
00:41:41,00:41:51,"And they include the book ""So Long Constipation"", the toilet book."
00:41:51,00:41:55,Anyone who doesn't have two or more easily possible bowel movements a day will benefit from
00:41:55,00:41:56,reading So Long Constipation.
00:41:56,00:42:02,"Do you see those adverts for Anti-Constipation Medicine which say ""Instant overnight relief""?"
00:42:02,00:42:03,No.
00:42:03,00:42:04,Really doesn't sound like London.
00:42:04,00:42:07,You might want to clean your sheets in the morning.
00:42:07,00:42:09,Total immediate relief.
00:42:09,00:42:10,Wherever you are.
00:42:10,00:42:12,Uncontrollable relief.
00:42:12,00:42:13,Everywhere.
00:42:13,00:42:14,Yeah.
00:42:14,00:42:15,Sorry.
00:42:15,00:42:18,"So Long Constipation didn't get a single note, nothing."
00:42:18,00:42:20,Do you know what else didn't get a single pledge?
00:42:20,00:42:26,"Is someone called Henrietta needed to raise $6,000 to fund her comedy show called ""Please"
00:42:26,00:42:27,"Love Me""?"
00:42:27,00:42:28,Oh my God.
00:42:28,00:42:29,Nothing.
00:42:29,00:42:30,Foodie.
00:42:30,00:42:31,Zero.
00:42:31,00:42:33,"If you're at the Henrietta, we love you."
00:42:33,00:42:37,Another quite good idea that I might have donated to was the little eats.
00:42:37,00:42:38,Did you read that?
00:42:38,00:42:44,Which was a guy who invented a food that is dog food and human food.
00:42:44,00:42:46,"Which, if you have a dog, there was-"
00:42:46,00:42:47,"You can eat dog food, can't you?"
00:42:47,00:42:48,"Yeah, and dogs can eat human food."
00:42:48,00:42:49,I don't know.
00:42:49,00:42:52,Can you eat dog food without really hating it?
00:42:52,00:42:53,Yeah.
00:42:53,00:42:54,"No, probably not."
00:42:54,00:42:56,"It's probably not tasty, but I think you can eat it."
00:42:56,00:42:57,Yeah.
00:42:57,00:42:58,I remember the thing about a supermarket-
00:42:58,00:43:02,"Yeah, it was a fact that I'm going to get the numbers wrong, but it's something like there"
00:43:02,00:43:09,"is enough food in a supermarket for a single person to stay alive for 56 years, and it's"
00:43:09,00:43:12,something like 67 years if you're willing to eat dog food.
00:43:12,00:43:13,Oh yeah.
00:43:13,00:43:14,Yeah.
00:43:14,00:43:18,"I eat the dog food early on, because you don't want your last year to be the worst year."
00:43:18,00:43:20,You'd save for the harrow bars.
00:43:20,00:43:21,Yeah.
00:43:21,00:43:22,Yeah.
00:43:22,00:43:23,That's a really good idea.
00:43:23,00:43:24,Yeah.
00:43:24,00:43:27,You get saved after like five years.
00:43:27,00:43:29,Why did you eat the dog food for you?
00:43:29,00:43:30,Yeah.
00:43:30,00:43:32,"That'd be psychologically a lot of questions, kind of."
00:43:32,00:43:33,Yeah.
00:43:33,00:43:36,Can I just take it back to museums for a second?
00:43:36,00:43:37,Yeah.
00:43:37,00:43:41,"Because I just did a search on the sort of weird museums of the world, and there's so many"
00:43:41,00:43:42,great ones.
00:43:42,00:43:44,"I don't know why they exist, but I'm so glad that they do."
00:43:44,00:43:48,The Giant Shoe Museum.
00:43:48,00:43:50,It's- I don't know if you count it as a museum.
00:43:50,00:43:52,It's a single exhibit wall.
00:43:52,00:43:53,Like a shoe.
00:43:53,00:43:57,"No, it says here that to see the museum's collections, visitors must drop quarters into"
00:43:57,00:44:03,a coin box and then look through stereoscope viewing slots that reveal views of a variety of
00:44:03,00:44:07,"giant shoes, including size 37."
00:44:07,00:44:08,Wow.
00:44:08,00:44:09,That's American size though.
00:44:09,00:44:10,Wow.
00:44:10,00:44:13,"Yeah, but that was worn by the world's tallest man and the world's largest collection of giant"
00:44:13,00:44:14,"shoes, which is-"
00:44:14,00:44:16,"The world's tallest ever man, William Wadlow."
00:44:16,00:44:17,Yeah.
00:44:17,00:44:18,Was he called?
00:44:18,00:44:19,"No, Robert Wadlow."
00:44:19,00:44:20,Yeah.
00:44:20,00:44:21,He was a shoe salesman.
00:44:21,00:44:22,That was his job.
00:44:22,00:44:25,"He had to get really, really big shoes because they didn't make them that size."
00:44:25,00:44:29,"He went to the company and they said, ""Yeah, show you can have them for free if you go around"
00:44:29,00:44:30,"and sell them."""
00:44:30,00:44:31,And he did.
00:44:31,00:44:32,But why would anyone else want to buy a size 37 shoes?
00:44:32,00:44:37,It was an example of what great worksmanship you have because you make such a big one and then
00:44:37,00:44:39,show that you can make little ones as well.
00:44:39,00:44:40,"Oh, okay."
00:44:40,00:44:41,That's very cool.
00:44:41,00:44:45,"So, Minnesota's Science Museum has the content of a former museum inside it, which was"
00:44:45,00:44:51,"called the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices, including the Prostate Gland Warmer,"
00:44:51,00:44:53,"the Vibratory Chair, and the Recto Rotor."
00:44:53,00:44:58,"You just picked three at random, though."
00:44:58,00:45:00,France has four museums devoted to foie gras.
00:45:00,00:45:01,Wow.
00:45:01,00:45:05,"I mean, they didn't want more than the first one, actually, but the people behind the museum"
00:45:05,00:45:09,just kept stuffing them down their throats.
00:45:09,00:45:10,Are you?
00:45:10,00:45:12,That was pretty laden.
00:45:12,00:45:13,Okay.
00:45:13,00:45:14,That's it.
