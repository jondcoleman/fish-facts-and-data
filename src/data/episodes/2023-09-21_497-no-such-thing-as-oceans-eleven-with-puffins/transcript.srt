00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of No Singers of Fish. This is another live show

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,760
 which was recorded at the Soho Theatre in London and who is our special guest today?

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,760
 Well if you were a podcast fan, if you were a fan of amazing books, if you were a fan

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,560
 of the TV show Horrible Histories then you'll know who I'm talking about. Our guest was

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,840
 the historian Greg Jenner. So like I say, Greg first came to prominence I suppose as

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,960
 the historical consultant on Horrible Histories but he has since become a nerdy superstar

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,080
 at his own right thanks to his podcast Your Dead To Me which you definitely, I'm sure

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,160
 you've heard it but if you haven't heard it you definitely should check that out but

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,920
 he also has written lots of books, the latest of which are called Ask A Historian and Dead

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,920
 Famous and Unexpected History of Celebrity and the very exciting thing about those if

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,720
 you are super quick off the blocks is that at the moment they are both 99p on e-book

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,240
 for the rest of September. He also has an illustrated kids book called You Are History

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,040
 and that is out in hardback and audiobook as well. Look, just go to the place where

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,120
 you buy your books, e-books and audiobooks and search for Greg Jenner and you will not

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,080
 be disappointed and I hope you will also not be disappointed with this week's podcast

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,160
 so let's just get on with it. On with the podcast.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:44,800
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:53,480
 week coming to you live from the Soho Theatre in London. My name is Jan Shriver, I am sitting

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,740
 here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Greg Jenner and once again we have gathered

20
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,640
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

21
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,600
 order, here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is my fact this week. My fact

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,400
 is when Virginia's Barter Theatre first opened in 1933, it paid playwrights their royalties

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,880
 exclusively in ham except for George Bernard Shaw who was a vegetarian and managed to

24
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:31,280
 negotiate his payment to be in spinach. Superb. Yeah, this is an amazing thing that happened

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,440
 during the Great Depression in America and this guy who was an actor, he was a very young

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,840
 actor at the time called Robert Porterfield, he found all these actors were out of work,

27
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,600
 the theatres weren't running because no one could afford to go to the theatres but then

28
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,920
 he also noticed that there were a lot of farmers who had a lot of produce that they weren't

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,080
 able to shift so he thought what if I set up a bartering theatre whereby you could trade

30
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:00,320
 ham for hamlet, that would be the system right? So you could come in and you could then give

31
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,480
 any kind of produce that you wanted and that would get you a ticket and the bartering system

32
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,500
 worked very much like how bartering does, you know, you negotiate as you're doing it. More

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:20,560
 like bartering. Oh. Very good, very good. Yeah, so it would be, it was good Andy. Don't

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,800
 let everyone tell you differently. Yeah, so the system, yeah, God yeah. The stories are

35
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,680
 great because people have written about how this, you know, a lot of these playwrights

36
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,720
 so when George Bernard Shaw was first asked, he said, I'm not really into it and then

37
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:45,120
 Pygmalion came out and he said, oh yes, Pygmalion, Pygmalion. Should have been Spinachmalion.

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
 Should have been, yeah. So all the stories that he collected over the years, people got

39
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,960
 interviews out of him and it's really fun so there would be examples of say a farmer

40
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,320
 who would bring his cow to the theatre and he'd say how much milk to get in to see the

41
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,520
 play and they would tell him and then he'd go to the side and milk the cow to the amount

42
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,640
 that they said, hand over the bucket and then he would start to go in and in the anecdote

43
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,520
 his wife was with him and they said, you're not going to get your wife to come in as well

44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,200
 and he said, she can milk her own ticket. I was wondering how they did change at the

45
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,080
 theatre because I thought you were saying- Oh, so you hadn't done your hum and you got

46
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,880
 a little bit of bacon back. Yeah, kind of. I mean, you could have a pig which was worth

47
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,440
 ten tickets. Wow. So I think if you traded a whole pig maybe you got like a season pass.

48
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,320
 Yeah. That kind of thing. But they accepted, all sorts of, it wasn't just farm produce,

49
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,400
 they accepted toothpaste, snakes and underwear as well. Which is good if you don't have a

50
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,760
 pig so you can get a pig. With the toothpaste for the snakes. Do they have teeth? They have

51
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,200
 teeth, right? They've got fangs. They've got fangs, man. Yeah. Can you brush a snake's

52
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:59,700
 teeth? Sorry. Actually, you can milk a snake's teeth. Hello, great point. One ticket. There

53
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,320
 was all sorts of weird, like there was a boy who said that he had some jam or some kind

54
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,520
 of substance in a jar turned out to be mud so people were trying to counterfeit their

55
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,440
 way in there as well. There was someone who did Brig a pig saying, I'll pay with my pig

56
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,680
 but then the pig got loose and all the actors had to chase their money down the street. And

57
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,600
 weirdly, there was a jail that was directly underneath the barter theater. So while they

58
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,960
 were doing the plays, there was always this slight concern that one of the jailmates would

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,840
 break free and sort of come onto stage and murder everyone. So there was added conflict,

60
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,720
 you know. Yeah. It sounds like it was an amazing place. And one of the things was a guy came

61
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,400
 in, he was a mountaineer and he said, I don't have any food, but I make coffins. Do you all

62
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,840
 want a coffin? And they said, no, we're fine. He said, well, I make canes as well. And he

63
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,680
 made so many canes that apparently every major actor in Broadway was seen walking around

64
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,080
 with one of these canes because he just kept making them and kept going to more and more

65
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,200
 shows. That's cool. I mean, to me, I know I am an ex-accountant, but it does sound like

66
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,960
 a massive tax dodge. Oh yeah. Like bartering is all well and good as long as you pay the

67
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,920
 tax on the actual amount of the thing that you're bartering with. How much tax? One slice

68
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,320
 of bacon? Well, you know, 20% of your pig. Oh, whatever. That's the thing. Like, there's

69
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,880
 that old story of Picasso. Do you remember he was in a cafe? I mean, I don't think this

70
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,400
 is true, but he was in... It is true. Is it true? Yeah, my mum's got one. Wow. So Picasso...

71
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,160
 I think I know where you're going with it. Picasso used to buy his meals by doing a tiny

72
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,400
 little doodle because it'd be worth more than the meal. He did thousands. They're, they're

73
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,120
 now valueless. Really? Is that what Gary Linnika has been doing in all restaurants? In the

74
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,880
 restaurants. All in the restaurants in the UK have a signed photo of Gary Linnika. Yeah,

75
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,960
 yeah. Like everyone, and you can see it, like, I was young, Gary was here. Oh, Gary was

76
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,300
 here quite recently. That's what he's doing. I imagine that is what he's doing. That probably

77
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,280
 is what he's doing. He's probably getting free food. Well, I don't want to do a smudge

78
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,160
 Gary Linnika. I don't mind. We don't know. The thing is, though, with Picasso, right?

79
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,360
 So the story goes, one of the story goes that he did this doodle and they said, well, Mr.

80
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,360
 Picasso, will you sign it? And he said, well, I want to pay for lunch. I don't want to pay

81
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:18,620
 for the entire establishment. That's the story. But the thing is... What a wanker. I don't

82
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,680
 think anyone's saying that Picasso wasn't a wanker. Yeah. Of all the artists, I think

83
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,480
 Picasso is very high in the wanker index. Okay. But the thing is, like, if you're an artist

84
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,560
 and you draw something and you're in a cafe and they give you some food, there are tax

85
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,040
 implications of that. And really, it is against the law to do that. The only way they could

86
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,240
 get around it is if Picasso, instead of just having lunch, if it was a business lunch and

87
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,120
 if the people in the cafe were going to put the picture up on the wall so that everyone

88
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,280
 in the cafe can enjoy it, so technically it's decoration, then they're both business expenses,

89
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,760
 they're both tax deductible. That's fine. Why do you think accountants have such a reputation

90
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:06,480
 for that? Thank God James isn't at all these historical moments where Picasso lands an

91
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,840
 absolute zingo and he's going, "Well, actually, the tax implications of that are..." Could

92
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,600
 he do a smaller drawing to be the tax? No. Yeah, he could. In fact, I believe in some

93
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,400
 places in America sometimes they have accepted artwork as tax payment from artists who couldn't

94
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,080
 afford to pay their tax and have done that. So that is possible in theory. I can't believe

95
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,160
 we're accepting this fact given how much shit I took many episodes ago when I said that

96
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,080
 if Mozart was on the street and he was passing someone who asked him for some money, a beggar,

97
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,000
 a homeless person was asking for some money, that he would say, "I have no money but here,

98
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,320
 let me write you some music." And he would be like, "Raskebidaga doody." And give it

99
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,120
 to them. And then they would take that and they would... Do what? Sell it. What would

100
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,200
 you do with your Picasso? You can sell it for a lot of money. No, you can't. No, you

101
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,160
 can't because my mum has one and you can't do anything about it. Has your mum been trying

102
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:03,240
 to sell it? Yeah, it's not worth anything. I'll buy it. All right. I'll buy the on-site

103
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,680
 Picasso that we know is definitely him, yeah. Also, how do you verify that the music is

104
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:15,640
 by Mozart when it's just one bar of music? Because it sounds like ABBA. Right. Barter...

105
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,800
 Barter is a weird thing, isn't it? Because there's a lot of debate about barter. I definitely

106
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,840
 thought it's a thing before money. So the baker makes some bread and he goes to the

107
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,800
 butcher and the butcher... And the butcher has some meat and between them they have a

108
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,360
 sandwich. Well, they swap. They have two sandwiches. Exactly. You end up with two sandwiches and

109
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,800
 everyone's happy. But of course, what if the butcher doesn't want any bread, the baker

110
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,840
 starves to death? Nightmare. So you need money. That's the basic, and I say very basic premise.

111
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,120
 But this is the weird thing about barter. There's no... I don't think there's any... Actually,

112
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,640
 it seems like money produces barter systems. Like after the fall of the Roman Empire, people

113
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,320
 resorted to barter because there wasn't a stable currency anymore. There doesn't seem to be

114
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,640
 any good evidence of a proper barter society where someone says, "I'll give you these grapes

115
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:12,280
 if you give me that cloth." It just doesn't seem to be any evidence for that. Correct. Oh,

116
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:20,960
 shit. One evidence that I found in a short look. I mean, money's fascinating, right?

117
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,160
 So coins are really new. In terms of the history of the world, coins are... They're like 2,700

118
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,120
 years old, give or take. They're really, really new. So you've got these sort of enormous

119
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,200
 societies in the Bronze Age. The Egyptians don't have money. Oh, really? The Sumerians,

120
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,960
 the Babylonians, the Akkadians don't have money. Really? And the first coin has got

121
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,440
 a little lion face. It's very cute and it's ancient Greek. And I think at the city, I

122
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,080
 think it was maybe Liddy, I can't remember, but it's like 2,700 BCE. So prior to that,

123
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,040
 you have economic structures and you've got kings and you've got people with power and

124
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,760
 you have got distribution of wealth of a sort, but it's not cash. And even in the 8th, 9th,

125
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,400
 10th centuries, you get these coin hordes, Viking coin hordes buried in the ground. And

126
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,080
 you're never entirely sure to what extent they are someone going, "I'm going to put

127
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,560
 that in the ground and come back for it later," or it's someone's nicked it or someone has

128
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,680
 been killed in battle or... We're never quite sure because the money's not in circulation.

129
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,960
 So the history of money is really interesting because there's a lot of stuff we don't know,

130
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,800
 but obviously, Barter must have been part of that equation. It's certainly in the Stone

131
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,480
 Age, no? You're going to tell me there's no bartering in the Stone Age.

132
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,680
 I'm not going to say anything. You're going to do that. Go on, do it.

133
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,040
 Yeah, sort it, why not? Straight from nothing to Bitcoin, that's what I'm saying. We're

134
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,120
 dead. But you are right that definitely when society breaks down or when there's problems

135
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,720
 in society, we do resort to Barter. That's definitely true, right? So in Russia in the

136
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,120
 90s, there's a lot of it going on. So there was not much, certainly in the late 90s, not

137
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,640
 much demand for rubles. If you got any rubles, you just want to swap them for US dollars.

138
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,360
 That's pretty much all you'd ever do with them. And so when companies ran out of cash

139
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,960
 to pay their workers, the workers would often just accept whatever you're making, you would

140
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,240
 take some of them home and then you'd be able to swap that for dollars. There's no point

141
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,800
 having the rubles in between. And so there was like Siberian workers who were paid in

142
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,680
 coffins, as we were saying before. There was a Volggrad factory where all the workers were

143
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,420
 paid in bras. And then there was another factory in Volggrad called Aktauba, and they made

144
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:33,960
 navigation equipment. But then they'd recently diversified into making dildos. And the workers

145
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,700
 decided, well, we're not going to get paid otherwise. So we'll just accept the dildos

146
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:45,440
 as payment. And this is in the economist guys. This is happening. And so they got all these

147
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,180
 dildos and then went to the local sex shops to try and sell them and get some US dollars.

148
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,640
 But it turned out that just around the same time, the world had moved on to electronic

149
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,000
 vibrators. And the dildos were virtually worthless.

150
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,240
 Oh, so navigation to dildos. Yeah, I was like, how did they diversify from that? Like,

151
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:19,780
 yeah, so it's what from compass to compass is. Wow. Yeah, I sextant. You had sex. Wow,

152
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,300
 is there a heartwarming end to the story where they all use the dildos to build a new there's

153
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,340
 no heartwarming ending to any story that begins in Russia in 1999.

154
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,020
 Okay. Do you remember the story of that guy who bought up a huge bulk amount of copies

155
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,920
 of Lance Armstrong's book? It's all about the bike. And then it's not the bike. Did

156
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,840
 you do two books? Did he? No, you're not about the bike. It's not about the bike, which

157
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:49,160
 turned out to be about the drugs. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, this guy suddenly had a warehouse

158
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,560
 full of these books and no one was buying them because this guy was an untouched celebrity

159
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,680
 all of a sudden before. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was like just before is like did the deal

160
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,700
 and suddenly like news headline. Lance Armstrong. So was he sort of bulk ordering them in the

161
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,300
 hope of then selling them and I think like they were remaindered and he thought I'll

162
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,900
 buy them and I can do a trade of them somehow. Yeah, here's a place that does have butter.

163
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:17,180
 This is good zoos operate a barter system with each other even today because you need

164
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,940
 a permit to buy and sell endangered animals. But in America, zoos are allowed to barter

165
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,400
 the creatures. So in 2014, there was an aquarium in Boston that needed some fish and North

166
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,120
 Carolina's aquarium had some of those fish. And North Carolina wanted jellyfish and sniped

167
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
 fish in exchange for the fish that they were going to give to Boston. But the Boston people

168
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,360
 didn't have sniped fish. So Boston had to. Is this a riddle? Hang on Greg, hang on. So

169
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,680
 they had to get some Japanese sniped fish, swap them for some lump fish that they did

170
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,080
 have in Boston. Then they sent North Carolina those. But they can't be on the craft at the

171
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,340
 same time as the fox. Yeah. And the fox is in a submarine. Yeah. And that's it. The zookeeper

172
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,940
 was the mother. That's it. That's really cool. And it's because in the olden days,

173
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,300
 if you had a zoo, you just send someone off and say, I'd like two pandas, please. Yeah.

174
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,340
 I'm going to be an explorer and they just go and get you two pandas, but you can't really

175
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:17,980
 do that anymore. No. There was one because of Brexit. There was one aquarium that swapped

176
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:24,520
 800 mackerel for a dozen puffins. Does that feel like a good deal for you? I'd love a

177
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,920
 dozen puffins. Yeah. I feel like a dozen puffins is exactly the right number of puffins. I

178
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,680
 feel like that's that's a bank job. It's like Ocean's Eleven. But puffins. I genuinely think

179
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,040
 if your mother put up that Picasso, you could trade that for 11 puffins. Picasso is a dove,

180
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,120
 dove of peace. So it could actually we could swap a dove of peace for 12 puffins and then

181
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:54,520
 I could hit a bank and take on a casino. Are you also the 13th puffin in the costume?

182
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,940
 I'm George Clooney puffin. Yeah, nice. And then we'll have Brad Pitt puffin, Matt Damon

183
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,820
 puffin and other puffins. I've forgotten who else is in the film. Gently. Is he in

184
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,300
 the film? I don't know. Sorry, how did your mom come by this picture at the Picasso? Did

185
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,340
 you buy it? No, she was gifted, I think, because it's not value and it's just got it's not

186
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:17,400
 enough value to be worth anything. So it's a gift you give someone in return for like,

187
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,440
 oh, thanks. That was really nice. Here's a big asset. James, are there any tax implications

188
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,360
 to Greg's mom receiving this? Price was welcome. If she got them as part of her job, yes, there

189
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:38,680
 would be. Alright, she's a French teacher. Where do we stand on that? Je ne sais pas.

190
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,620
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Greg. My fact is complex, so I'm apologizing

191
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,500
 in advance for it. But my fact is this, at different times in history, Mondays have been

192
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,940
 considered the first day of the week, the second, the third and the seventh. Wow. And

193
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:05,420
 what is it now? Right. So we've got six hours. Yeah. Now it's officially internationally

194
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,080
 it's the first day of the week, the International Standards Committee or whatever they call

195
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,080
 the day. Because I was always taught at school that it's Sunday is the first day of the week.

196
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,440
 Yeah. So in the religious Christian Mondays, the second day of the week now, it used to

197
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,160
 be the third day of the week because in the Jewish calendar, it was the third day, Sabbath

198
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,160
 and Saturday, Sunday, and then Monday became the third. But then when you get Christianity

199
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,160
 becoming dominant in Rome in the sort of second and third centuries, they move Sabbath from

200
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,200
 Saturday to Sunday. And so Monday becomes the second day. But the really tricky thing about

201
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,620
 it is that the Industrial Revolution gives us Mondays as we know them, the Garfield one,

202
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,500
 the Monday. The Garfield Monday that he hates. There's a lot of great philosophers who do

203
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:54,060
 Mondays, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, Bob Geldof, Garfield. So our Mondays is an economic Monday.

204
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,260
 Our Monday is the post-Industrial Revolution, where you get the invention of a brand new

205
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,300
 temporal structure called the weekend. The weekend is a new thing, it's about a hundred

206
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:11,200
 years old. And so Mondays get redefined. But in ancient astronomy, Mondays are wrong. So

207
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,320
 the days of the week should be, according to astronomy, it should be Saturday, Thursday,

208
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:27,040
 Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday. Poor Craig David. He'd be so good to a park

209
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:33,040
 on Monday, met her for the first time Tuesday. What's happening? So that's the order that

210
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,180
 astronomically the planet should be in. And we've got this really lovely ancient book we

211
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,340
 don't have, we've got the title of, by Plutarch. And the title is literally, "Why is the days

212
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,060
 of the week ordered wrongly?" It's the kind of thing you Google at 3 a.m. and you're like,

213
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,280
 "What? Tuesdays?" So Dio Cassius wrote a thing saying, "What's happened here is it's

214
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,440
 because there's 168 hours in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, which the Romans are

215
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,300
 very keen on. Each hour gets assigned to a god. The first hour goes to the god and that

216
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,980
 god gets that day named after them. The second hour, the next god, third, fourth, fifth,

217
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,900
 sixth, seventh, and then you're back to the first god again. By the time you get to the

218
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:14,460
 25th hour, you're on to the second god. So the day gets named after him. And so you end

219
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,980
 up with the days being in the wrong order. So our Mondays are wrong and the Romans are

220
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,820
 like, "Oh, no. We'll just have to live with it." And we have. We've lived with it ever

221
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,360
 since. That's amazing. That is incredible. I've got a fact about Tuesday. Is it Thursday,

222
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,920
 Tuesday, or Saturday, Tuesday? I'm going to go for my Tuesday, which is tomorrow, yeah.

223
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,600
 So we're doing this on a Monday, we should say, for the audience listening at home. So

224
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 this is cool. This happened last year. The 22nd of February, 2022, was a Tuesday. Yeah,

225
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:54,520
 which means it was Tuesday. It was Tuesday. It was Tuesday. It was Tuesday. It was Tuesday.

226
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,580
 It was Tuesday. That's nice. That's the end of the fact. Monday's caused lightning.

227
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:05,700
 It was a good thing. Well, it's not a good thing actually. It's just a thing. So it's

228
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:12,980
 because of car exhaust. So more people commute on Mondays. So scientists counted lightning

229
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,720
 strikes in the USA for a decade and worked out where they fall, where the distribution

230
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,200
 is. So this is particularly in southeastern states in the USA. And lightning strikes rock

231
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,840
 it because there's a bit more pollution in the air. The air is moisture. There are low

232
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,360
 line clouds. That creates the perfect conditions for lightning. So yeah, for hundreds of miles,

233
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,520
 you get more lightning on a Monday. That's really interesting. I've got a Wednesday

234
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,800
 fact. No. Go on. Is this your Wednesday? It's my Wednesday. Yeah. It's a day after tomorrow.

235
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,660
 We're recording this on a Monday. It's worth knowing. According to one study, the best

236
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:55,660
 time to tweet or X is to... Oh, no. Oh, my God. No, no. Look at you staying in with Elon.

237
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:03,380
 You creep. Apparently, if you want to get maximum impact, it's 5pm on a Wednesday is when you

238
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,140
 should send that tweet. Really? Yeah. They've just scanned through where most have engagement

239
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,260
 and so on. And apparently that's supposed to be wrong. Pump day. Is that... I mean, that

240
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,220
 doesn't feel... What's happening at 5pm on a Wednesday? They just found engagement was

241
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,140
 higher. That's wrong. I don't like that stat. I reckon it's because people aren't really

242
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,380
 trying as hard because it's not Monday anymore. Right. But you also haven't left early because

243
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,500
 it's not Friday. It's just like the perfect time. So you're stuck in the office. Yeah.

244
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,200
 You're looking your phone. It's 5pm and you're out that door. I reckon. Are you got any Thursday

245
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:40,380
 facts done? I do. There's a theory that the universe was created last Thursday. It's called

246
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,740
 last Thursdayism. And the idea is that... And it's very hard to just prove this. Was this

247
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,860
 fact three weeks old in which case the universe hasn't been created yet until this week? No,

248
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,240
 is it always last Thursday? It's always last Thursday. The idea is that every memory that

249
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,940
 you have, everything that's on our planet, everything has been set to seem like it's

250
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,680
 been here for millions and billions of years in the case of the age of the universe. So

251
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:10,120
 last Thursdayism says it's impossible to deny the theory that it's infallible as a fact

252
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,080
 because it's impossible to find a glitch in. Right. Well, what if I put something in a box

253
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,680
 last Thursday and then I open the box today? Your theory falls over. No, it doesn't because

254
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:24,400
 your memory as you put it last Thursday. Yeah, but I know I did. I wrote a label. I labeled

255
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,340
 it Thursday. No, I labeled it Wednesday. I can't believe, Andy, that you found the

256
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,180
 hole in the bearing. Wow. How come Andy's underpants that say Thursday on them are still

257
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:43,460
 in the wash? Yeah. I got a fact about Fridays. Oh, yeah. You want to hear that? Do you know

258
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,220
 Dress Down Friday? Dress Down Friday, yeah. Do you know who invented that or why it was

259
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:55,040
 invented? Military thing. It's a military thing. Yeah? Yeah. Like every Friday, you

260
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,400
 don't have to wear your uniform. Yeah, you start in the city, but you're wearing a Hawaiian

261
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,360
 shirt. Yeah, exactly. It's fun. It's good for morale. It's bad for camouflage, but it'll

262
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,180
 be fun. Yeah. Well, I gave you a clue there. It was invented by people who made Hawaiian

263
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:17,000
 shirts to sell more Hawaiian shirts. Really? Really? This was in the '60s. Yeah, it was

264
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,860
 a company called, it was the Hawaiian fashion guild, actually. They came up with the idea

265
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:27,620
 of Aloha Fridays, where everyone would wear a Hawaiian shirt into work, and then it just

266
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,500
 took off, and now we have people just wearing jeans on Friday. Wow. But do the people who

267
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,580
 work at the Hawaiian fashion guild have to go in in a three-piece suit on a Friday?

268
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,040
 Just while we were talking about military on Fridays as well, there's a thing on Japanese

269
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,420
 Navy ships and submarines that they have curry every night on Friday nights, because

270
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,300
 on a ship, you might lose the track of the days, and that's a way of them going, "Oh,

271
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,620
 it's Friday. We're having curry." It's a thing on the menu that allows for them to remember.

272
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:58,080
 It's a nice idea. Yeah, because you do lose track. And on a Saturday, you feel like, you

273
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,840
 know? Yeah. No, that's, no, that's, I do have a Saturday fact, if that's what you're

274
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,800
 edging to do. But it's absolutely not that. Okay, go on. Let's hear your Saturday fact.

275
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:15,080
 My Saturday fact is that on U.S. ships and submarines, they will have burgers for dinner

276
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,640
 just so they remember what day it is, so that they know. And that's because so you can

277
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,180
 lose track when you're on a ship or a submarine, they will have burgers and they're like, "Ah,

278
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:30,620
 Saturday." Yeah, I feel like I'm losing track now. Yeah. Mondays, this is a study from 2006.

279
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,700
 But Mondays, most of us apparently are tired and depressed on a Monday. And work that requires

280
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,740
 emotional involvement or flair should be avoided. Or flair. I'm afraid so. Oh, wow. It's best

281
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:47,920
 to be alone. Our lines of communication mentally are largely closed, and communication with

282
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,080
 each other is also poorer on a Monday. So that's why we did this kick on a Monday, wasn't it?

283
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,800
 I think maybe we're proving it. Very quickly, because I just thought, suddenly remember,

284
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:03,760
 Fridays are obviously Freyja. So these are the Germanic gods, right? So Saturday is Saturn,

285
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,120
 is the only one of the days of the week that's named after a Roman god. All the others are

286
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,540
 Monday, Sunday, and then Germanic gods. Who's Freyja? Freyja, she's Anglo-Saxon and Norse

287
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:19,860
 goddess, very powerful, very cool. Thursday's Thor, or Thunor, Wednesday's Woden. But the

288
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:26,740
 Romans called Venus the planet, not Venus. They called it Lucifer. Just suddenly, it

289
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,580
 occurs to me, and the Greeks called it Phosphorus, like Giver. So it suddenly reminded me that

290
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,820
 Friday is named after Venus, Aphrodite. But they didn't call the planet Venus. They called

291
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,240
 it Lucifer. So they would see Lucifer in the sky and go, "There he is." Oh, that's great.

292
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,520
 It's quite a scary name. Although they didn't call it Lucifer, they'd call it Leukeph, Latin.

293
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:54,420
 Leukeph. Leukeph. That's awesome. Go on, Dan, tell us your Sunday fact. So on Sundays,

294
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:00,960
 in order for US Navy ships and submarines to know what day it is, they have steak, because

295
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,880
 you can lose track of time when you're on ship. So they will have steak on a Sunday,

296
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,620
 and they're like, "Ah, it's a Sunday." We're recording this on a Monday, by the way. We're

297
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,940
 going to have to move on to our next fact in one sec. Should we go for it?

298
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,420
 I can give you a quick Sunday fact. Obviously, Sunday trading was a thing. There were certain

299
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,060
 things you were allowed to sell on Sundays, certain things you weren't. And so if you're

300
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,460
 a shopkeeper, you're allowed to sell food for horses, because they were working animals,

301
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,060
 but you weren't allowed to sell food for dogs, because it was a pet often. This is in Hansard

302
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,120
 in 1968. They were discussing this. And apparently, the reason that they wanted to change the

303
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,000
 rules is because it was such nonsense that a man could go into a shop and say, "I have

304
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,800
 a pony who only eats dog biscuits." Can I have some dog biscuits for my pony? And they

305
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,480
 had to give him the biscuits. And that's when they thought, "Maybe we need to change our

306
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,880
 rules a little bit." That's so good. That's amazing.

307
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:05,880
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is that the first electric

308
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,400
 cars were taken away each night and delivered back to your door fully charged in the morning.

309
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,860
 So they were like, "Choose outside hotel rooms." Basically, we put them out, some takes

310
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,820
 them away, polishes them. Is that what happens?

311
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,820
 Sorry, what?

312
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,780
 Hang on, what? I tell you what, we stay at travel lodges.

313
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,780
 Yeah, yeah.

314
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,780
 Where have you gone, Tar?

315
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
 Where are you staying?

316
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,780
 Yeah.

317
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,780
 What are you talking about?

318
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,780
 That's a thing.

319
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,800
 I'm distracted from the main point of the - but that doesn't happen in hotels. You put

320
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,260
 your shoes outside the room and then they - like, if you want them polished, you don't

321
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,000
 have to - what?

322
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Do you leave a note on them?

323
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 No!

324
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Say, "Please."

325
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 It's red, it's understood.

326
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Is it?

327
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 You don't need to leave a note.

328
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,640
 I feel like the hotels where I stay in, they would just get stolen.

329
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
 Yeah.

330
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,680
 Well, just by round of chews, has anyone heard of that in here?

331
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,760
 OK, a few people who here hasn't heard of it.

332
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,460
 Not enough for - OK, can I really take my fact?

333
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,460
 Yeah.

334
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,460
 The fact is fine, it was the following.

335
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,580
 The first electric cars were taken away each night and delivered to your door, fully charged

336
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,900
 for the morning. A unique occurrence.

337
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,620
 When are we talking first electric cars?

338
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,980
 So early, early days, not the - so like late 19th, early 20th century. This is from an

339
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,420
 interview with the head of Ford. I was listening to a podcast the other day with - which was

340
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,360
 interviewed - he's called Jim Farley. And he was talking about the firm Detroit Electric,

341
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:30,020
 who they made early cars. Like loads of the early cars when combustion engines were just

342
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:36,080
 starting were electric. And the electric ones, they were kind of marketed at - they were

343
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
 marketed at women, basically.

344
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
 Yeah.

345
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,760
 The idea was they're a bit dainty here. You don't have to hand crank them to start because

346
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,080
 that's quite like a - it's quite a physical -

347
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,580
 It's the smell of petrol fuel.

348
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,920
 The smell was particularly a big part.

349
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,260
 Yeah, petrol stains and it's all - like it's very - yeah. And also Wikipedia claims they

350
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,820
 were sold to women drivers and physicians.

351
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,820
 No idea why.

352
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,900
 Well, I think the idea was if you needed to go and save someone's life really quickly

353
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,620
 because they were sick, you wouldn't have to do all the cranking. You just go straight

354
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,620
 away.

355
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,940
 That's good. Okay. Okay, that tracks then. Yeah. And they had the system with the doors

356
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,220
 where they didn't have the charging capacity in your home, obviously, because most houses

357
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,180
 weren't even on the electric at that point. And they sound like mad cars. They were operated

358
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,240
 by - this is incredible - from the back seat.

359
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
 So amazing.

360
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
 Yeah, this is incredible.

361
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,480
 From the back seat, they had a rear-facing front seat so you could face your passengers.

362
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
 Oh, great.

363
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,280
 You could put your passengers in the front seat facing backwards to you. You can chat to

364
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,760
 them as you drive. But you can't see the road. And they also - and they had - instead of

365
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,600
 a steering wheel, boring, they had a tiller.

366
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
 Yeah.

367
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,920
 Because that was nice and - it was nice and calm. It was like having a lovely sailboat

368
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
 or something.

369
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
 What's a tiller?

370
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
 Like a rudder, basically.

371
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
 Oh, on the back of the boat.

372
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

373
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
 So it was quite ridiculous.

374
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
 Wow.

375
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,760
 I know. So you have to - backwards, from the back seat of the car, unable to see the road

376
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
 ahead of you.

377
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
 Yeah.

378
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
 So weird that it didn't catch on.

379
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,740
 The tiller thing is amazing. So Ben's invented the steering wheel in the 1890s.

380
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
 Ben's and Jerry's.

381
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,740
 Yeah.

382
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,740
 Ben's and Jerry's.

383
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:08,080
 But Americans just stuck with this tiller the whole time. And there was a journalist

384
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:15,080
 writing around the time who said, "Few have adopted that foreign freak, the steering wheel.

385
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,520
 A car with a wheel would be a nerve wracker of the worst kind."

386
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,000
 Imagine that, a steering wheel. It's amazing.

387
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,480
 So it came back to your house fully charged and we're talking not lithium-ion batteries,

388
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,560
 we're talking what, lead-acid?

389
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,640
 No, very - yeah, I don't know exactly what the batteries were in these.

390
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
 How do you charge it?

391
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,920
 For sure, they were acid batteries, I'm pretty sure.

392
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
 Yeah, okay.

393
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,680
 But I think what would happen most of the time is they would replace the battery.

394
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
 Yeah.

395
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,520
 And then the battery would go back somewhere else to be charged, which might take time,

396
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
 I don't know.

397
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,960
 Yeah, it was a lot of these places, which I think would be really cool now as someone

398
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,960
 with an electric car. I'd love to just, instead of plug in, they just take the battery out

399
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,240
 and put another one back in and you go straight away.

400
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
 Oh, that's a cool idea.

401
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
 Yeah.

402
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
 It's not changing horses.

403
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,720
 Well, that's actually the reason they did it, because people were used to changing horses.

404
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,440
 And this was kind of the obvious way of doing it.

405
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,080
 Well, it's what, like, you get up in the morning, you look outside your door, you get your nice

406
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,080
 polished shoes, go down, you take a fresh horse.

407
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,720
 Someone has recharged your shoes. Rechargeable batteries were invented in 1859.

408
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
 Wow.

409
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
 So it's quite early, right?

410
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
 Yeah.

411
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,080
 So that's Gaston Plontet who invents them, and that's quite exciting.

412
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,880
 But that's already 20-odd years after the first electric car. It's really amazing how

413
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,240
 early they were, because we now look at electric cars and we kind of go like, oh, you know,

414
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
 Elon Musk.

415
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,000
 But like the electric car is like so much more established than fuel and petrol.

416
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Yeah.

417
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Yeah.

418
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And for a long time.

419
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 But for 20 years, they couldn't recharge the batteries.

420
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 That's the thing.

421
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Yeah, the battery, finished it.

422
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Yeah.

423
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Like, bang.

424
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Throw the car away.

425
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Yeah, exactly.

426
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Well, yeah, I mean, you just chuck it and you get a new one.

427
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 The guy I like is, have you heard of Sibrande Strating?

428
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 No.

429
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 No?

430
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 No?

431
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 He's Dutch guy.

432
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,600
 He's not, he sort of deserves more or renown.

433
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,000
 He's quite cool.

434
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,160
 And he possibly invented the first electric car that's like decent, and we know about.

435
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,640
 There's a Scotsman who, called Robert Anderson, who may be invented one in the 1830s, but we

436
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
 don't know much about it.

437
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,400
 But Sibrande Strating, who lived in Groningen, he was a Dutch chemistry professor.

438
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,000
 And in 1835, he makes an electric car that weighs about three kilos.

439
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,200
 It's a tricycle.

440
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,800
 He can carry about 1.5 kilos, which is a guinea pig.

441
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
 I don't know.

442
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
 It's not great, is it?

443
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,360
 It can go for 20 minutes.

444
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,880
 And it's 1835, nearly 200 years ago.

445
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,680
 And this thing is already electrified.

446
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,920
 But he's very cool because he also, he spoke 13 languages.

447
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,960
 He built early electric light bulbs 50 years before Edison.

448
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,160
 He fought a pandemic.

449
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,620
 There was a malaria outbreak in Groningen, and he built a small chlorine factory to

450
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,560
 create disinfectant for the people.

451
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,520
 And he built an electric boat.

452
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,840
 So this one sort of chemistry professor in the mid-1830s was just sort of going, "Yeah,

453
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
 I'll do a bit of this, a bit of that, a bit of this."

454
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
 But yeah, electric car.

455
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
 So cool.

456
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
 Why don't we know his name?

457
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,920
 I think he's sort of been slightly forgotten.

458
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:59,120
 And I discovered a PhD thesis by a Dutch historian who's been trying to like, just get back to

459
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
 the basics because it's really fascinating.

460
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,360
 And I've got a picture of the car here.

461
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
 You can't...

462
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
 I've got a picture of it.

463
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,360

 I've got a picture of it.

566
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
 I've got a picture of it.

567
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
 I've got a picture of it.

568
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
 I've got a picture of it.

569
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
 I've got a picture of it.

570
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
 I've got a picture of it.

571
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
 I've got a picture of it.

572
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
 The electricity meant that the electric car failed.

573
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
 Oh, no.

574
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
 Dramatic irony.

575
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
 Yes.

576
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,360
 I mean, dramatic irony up the wazoo.

577
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
 That's insane.

578
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
 Yeah.

579
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
 And there was another thing, the muffler.

580
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
 The muffler was invented, which made petrol cars quieter.

581
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
 Yeah.

582
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
 Oh, because, yeah, that was a big issue, right?

583
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,360
 And they got cheaper and cheaper.

584
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
 But it's also the discovery of oil, right?

585
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,360
 Yeah, the discovery of oil was a minor third element.

586
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
 It's hugely revolutionised.

587
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,360
 Because, I mean, Edison is talking to Ford, I think.

588
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,360
 They're having conversations about whether to go big

589
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,360
 and produce electric cars on mass.

590
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
 Because at this point, you know,

591
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,360
 so London got electric tube trains in 1890.

592
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
 It got electric trams in 1901.

593
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,360
 And it got electric buses called electrode buses in 1907.

594
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,360
 And they were powered by batteries.

595
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,360
 So if you go on YouTube, there's footage of, like,

596
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,360
 Leicester Square or Piccadilly Circus in, like, 1908 or something.

597
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
 There are electric buses pootling around.

598
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
 Crazy.

599
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
 We were saying we did a show about suffragettes recently,

600
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
 but you do see these images where suffragettes

601
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,360
 are on electric scooters.

602
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
 Yeah.

603
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
 And, I mean, it's basically London today.

604
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
 Popping a wheelie.

605
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
 Yeah, exactly.

606
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,360
 How they were getting to, you know, throw bricks at parliament

607
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,360
 and stuff via electric scooter, which is mad.

608
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,360
 And one of the big things, I guess, is that there was so much resistance,

609
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,360
 not only from members of the public

610
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,360
 who might not have thought that this was a useful thing,

611
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
 but by the rail workers as well.

612
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,360
 Because trains were, you know, everyone would be out of the job

613
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,360
 if suddenly these electric cars worked.

614
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,360
 So early cars were being hit by a whole group and whole industry,

615
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,360
 because they just thought, "No way, we don't want to."

616
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,360
 My favourite electric car from this era is called the Electro Bat.

617
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
 Oh, yeah.

618
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
 1894.

619
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,360
 I feel like Batman in an electric car,

620
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,360
 but like a really cute pootling 15-mile-an-hour one.

621
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,360
 That's a Chris Nolan movie I want to see.

622
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,360
 In order to defeat fear, you must become fear,

623
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,360
 but only at 15 miles an hour.

624
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,360
 In America, this is in the '50s now,

625
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,360
 they used to do mass car blessings.

626
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
 If you got a car, you used to go to the church

627
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,360
 and have your car blessed just for, you know, good karma, basically.

628
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,360
 I'm mixing my religions there, but yeah.

629
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
 Oh, nice.

630
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,360
 Oh, oh, shit!

631
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,360
 Oh, wow!

632
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
 You cool.

633
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,360
 You stealth-punned yourself.

634
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,360
 Wow, that was cool.

635
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:11,360
 Care to come back into the room, Mr. Shriver?

636
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,360
 I'm just doing my victory lap, Andy.

637
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,360
 I'm sorry.

638
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
 So, yeah, so you would take it to church

639
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
 and you would have it blessed by a priest.

640
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,360
 Is it like a drive-through?

641
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
 No, but they did have en masse.

642
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,360
 En masse?

643
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
 Oh, fuck!

644
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:33,360
 I am on fire!

645
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,360
 I feel like if I put my shoes on you, they're going to recharge.

646
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,360
 What puns coming next?

647
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
 No one knows.

648
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
 I'm too nervous.

649
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,360
 I'm going to start trying to think of one, and I should just say it.

650
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
 Stay in that state.

651
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,360
 I'll stay in the zone, yeah.

652
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,360
 Okay, so, yeah, so they would do mass blessings and so on,

653
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
 and it would be thousands.

654
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,360
 Yeah, pretty cool, hey.

655
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:01,360
 We do need to move on in a second.

656
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,360
 In 2010, Renault in France were sued

657
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,360
 for trying to call their new electric car the Zoe.

658
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
 Can you guess why?

659
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
 The Zoe.

660
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
 Okay, so was it by another person called Zoe,

661
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,360
 who didn't want to be Zoe Wanamaker?

662
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,360
 It was, well, it was by two married couples

663
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,360
 who both had daughters named Zoe Renault.

664
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,360
 Their surname was Renault, it's just a name, you know.

665
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,360
 And so they said, "Our children's lives will be irreversibly damaged

666
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,360
 if you call your new car the Renault Zoe."

667
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,360
 And they basically brought a case saying first names are for humans,

668
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,360
 not for cars.

669
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,360
 So French.

670
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,360
 And then...

671
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
 But listen to this.

672
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
 This is from the reporting of the time, right?

673
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,360
 The lawyer also argued that all of France's thousands of Zoe's

674
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,360
 could be affected with playground teasing,

675
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
 and, as they grow older,

676
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,360
 comments in bars such as, "Can I see your airbags?"

677
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:02,360
 Or, "Can I shine your bumper?"

678
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,360
 Case was rejected flat out of hand.

679
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,360
 LAUGHTER

680
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:15,360
 I do need to move this on to our final fact.

681
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,360
 It is time for our final fact of the show,

682
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,360
 and that is James.

683
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,360
 OK, my fact this week is that in 1908,

684
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,360
 the New York Times reported on a dog in France

685
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,360
 that was deliberately knocking children into the sen

686
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,360
 before rescuing them and claiming a reward.

687
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,360
 So, yeah, this is a thing that happened.

688
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,360
 It was in the New York Times that the headline was,

689
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,360
 "Dog, a fake hero."

690
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,360
 And they said that he was doing it to win beef steaks.

691
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,360
 And, yeah, basically a child had fallen into the river,

692
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
 and he'd gone and saved the child,

693
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
 and they'd given him a big old steak,

694
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,360
 and he thought, "Well, I could do it a bit more of that."

695
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,360
 And sure enough, over the next few days,

696
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,360
 more and more children started falling in the sen.

697
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,360
 And the same dog kept saving them.

698
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,360
 That's amazing. Isn't it cool?

699
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
 That's incredible, isn't it?

700
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
 How long did the scam go before people went hanging on us?

701
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,360
 It was only a few times.

702
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
 The newspaper article said it wasn't too long

703
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,360
 before the jig was up, so, yeah.

704
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,360
 But, actually, this isn't the first dog who's done this.

705
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,360
 I found an article in The Spectator from 1885

706
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,360
 about a dog in Lake Ontario

707
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,360
 who had pulled a boy out of Lake Ontario,

708
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,360
 and they'd taken him, and they said he went to a confectioner's

709
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,360
 and had a variety of cakes and other sweets.

710
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
 I'm not sure if dogs were allowed to eat cakes

711
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
 and other sweets, but they did anyway.

712
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
 But, yeah, sure enough,

713
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,360
 he started pushing kids into the lake.

714
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
 Wow.

715
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
 It's such a good example of unintended consequences.

716
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
 It's brilliant, isn't it?

717
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,360
 I was looking into life-saving dogs,

718
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,360
 and I found a report.

719
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
 This is from 2009, right?

720
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,360
 That Italy had 300 life-saving dogs

721
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,360
 that were stationed at beaches.

722
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,360
 Okay, I'm just going to tell you what it said, right?

723
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,360
 And then we can get into it,

724
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,360
 because the vice president of the training school

725
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,360
 was a woman called Donna Pascuali,

726
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,360
 and she said, I'm quoting here,

727
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,360
 "The dogs learned to tow their instructors out to sea,

728
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,360
 "so they had the medical strengths

729
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,360
 "to give attention to drowning swimmers."

730
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,360
 Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

731
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,360
 Does it? Well, if you don't have a boat,

732
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,360
 if you don't have a boat... Okay, that's the if.

733
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,360
 That's the big if. Yeah.

734
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,360
 Because why can't you just have a boat?

735
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,360
 But, okay...

736
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,360
 They spent all the money on dogs.

737
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,360
 Exactly. She says...

738
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,360
 Okay, okay, Dan, that's...

739
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,360
 Okay, so maybe you don't have a boat on any of the 300 beaches

740
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,360
 where you stationed the dogs. Yeah.

741
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,360
 Here's what Ms Pascuali said.

742
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,360
 "The dogs are incredibly strong.

743
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,360
 "Our record is one dog towing 40 people at the same time."

744
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,360
 What? Oh, my gosh.

745
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,360
 Are they Newfoundland dogs?

746
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
 Who fucking cares, Dan? It's 40 people!

747
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,360
 Yeah. One dog can't tow 40 people.

748
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
 No, that's impossible.

749
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,360
 Are they not on a lilo? Are they not on, like, a sort of...

750
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,360
 Are they floating on the surface so you're still...

751
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,360
 Exactly. They're not swimming.

752
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
 So, why are the dogs towing 40 doctors?

753
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,360
 Obviously, like, at that point, I feel, "Get a boat."

754
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,360
 Sometimes, Andy, and I only know this

755
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,360
 because I do watch a lot of Baywatch,

756
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,360
 you can't make it out past the surf on a boat, right?

757
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,360
 So, when you're swimming, if you're on a speedboat

758
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,360
 and the waves are coming in thick and high,

759
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,360
 you're going to get flipped over. You're not going to make it out.

760
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
 So, that's why David Hasselhoff always runs

761
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,360
 with that little red thing that looks like a mini,

762
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,360
 like, micro surfboard and does that.

763
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,360
 Now, let me ask you this. Let me ask you this.

764
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,360
 OK, go on.

765
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,360
 How much better would Baywatch be if he had a dog under his arm

766
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,360
 and was able to conserve his energy?

767
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,360
 And he surfed the dog. There you go.

768
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,360
 Not surf it, but, like, get out there in that sort of way, right?

769
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,360
 Amazing. It makes total sense.

770
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,360
 Oh, well, you've put me back in my box, Dan.

771
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,360
 I thought that was an insane thing about a dog towing 40 people,

772
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,360
 but you've made me see it as a very reasonable...

773
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,360
 The reason I mentioned Newfoundland dogs is because

774
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,360
 a lot of rescue boats take Newfoundland dogs with them on it

775
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,360
 in order to... They're amazing at saving people.

776
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,360
 They're these big, fluffy life rafts, basically.

777
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,360
 They get into the water. You can lay on them

778
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,360
 like your quake winslet on the door,

779
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
 and you can be saved dry.

780
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,360
 And there's a story in Greg. I wanted to ask you about this.

781
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,360
 Actually, full disclosure, it's the only time I've ever asked a guest

782
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,360
 whether or not this is true, and you said, "No."

783
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,360
 But I'm going to ask you anyway.

784
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,360
 I mean, actually, Napoleon fell off a boat

785
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,360
 and a Newfoundland dog jumped in after him and saved him.

786
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,360
 No.

787
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,360
 So your answer is still the same as before the show,

788
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,360
 is what you're saying.

789
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
 I mean, there's a billion stories about Napoleon,

790
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,360
 and you can never, ever rely on any of them.

791
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
 OK, right. Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe.

792
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
 Oh, upgraded to a maybe.

793
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,360
 I'm still taken by your vision of Titanic's closing scenes there.

794
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,360
 Get off the dog!

795
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,360
 I've got some other hero dogs who might be villains,

796
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,360
 but not really, but they're not villains,

797
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,360
 but they might have stolen a bit of thunder from other dogs.

798
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,360
 So the most famous one is Balto. Have you ever heard of Balto?

799
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,360
 Balto, no. Balto.

800
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,360
 He was a hero dog, really famous,

801
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,360
 because he was part of a team of sled dogs,

802
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,360
 sort of 120-odd dogs and 20 mushers,

803
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,360
 150 dogs, I think, who saved a town in Alaska in 1925 called Nome,

804
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,360
 and they had a terrifying outbreak of a really horrible disease.

805
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,360
 I think it was diphtheria.

806
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,360
 They couldn't get their medicine to them because it was just frozen,

807
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,360
 the planes wouldn't get there, the ships wouldn't get there,

808
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:28,360
 and a team of kind of sled dog mushers, I guess, volunteered,

809
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,360
 and they had to take this medicine 670 miles in terrifying,

810
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,360
 you know, the worst possible Alaskan weather you can think of.

811
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,360
 And it's called the Great Mercy Race for Nome,

812
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,360
 and Balto was the lead dog in the final leg

813
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,360
 and became like a Hollywood celebrity.

814
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,360
 They put a statue up in Central Park, became a really famous,

815
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,360
 he was stuffed to put in a museum, and everyone was like,

816
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,360
 "Balto was a crap dog."

817
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,360
 "Really? Balto, the hero dog? He was never a good dog.

818
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,360
 There were other dogs, really that dog, that dog."

819
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,360
 And it sort of turns out maybe that the musher,

820
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,360
 at the end, a guy called Gunnar Carson,

821
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,360
 he had been doing the second to last leg,

822
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,360
 and he got to the kind of weigh station

823
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,360
 and found the other guy who was meant to finish the run was asleep,

824
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,360
 and he says, "Oh, well, I didn't want to wake him up and delay.

825
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,360
 I thought we just had to get to Nome,

826
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,360
 and so I did the final leg on my own as well."

827
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,360
 So he did two legs with Balto as his lead dog.

828
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,360
 But there's a sort of controversy

829
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,360
 as to whether he stole this guy's thunder,

830
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,360
 stole the other dog's thunder,

831
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,360
 and the Balto, the kind of mediocre dog and Carson,

832
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,360
 but basically nabbed the headlines

833
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,360
 and ended up as the hero of this enormous sort of relay race

834
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
 to save a town.

835
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,360
 But there's a bit of a kind of controversy

836
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,360
 as to whether he maybe nicked that from someone else.

837
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,360
 And I guess they kind of don't care that much

838
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,360
 because it gets a story out there still, right?

839
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,360
 And it's like the face of the story,

840
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,360
 so that's kind of the important part.

841
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,360
 I've got another villain that I found out as well.

842
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,360
 Worth mentioning.

843
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,360
 Have you heard of the DC superhero called Dog Welder?

844
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,360
 No? No, I'm sorry, Dog Welder.

845
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,360
 So Dog Welder, he was a villain,

846
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,360
 and what he used to do was weld people's dogs to their faces.

847
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,360
 That was his thing.

848
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,360
 And he has, you can read a sort of bio on him,

849
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,360
 so powers and abilities.

850
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,360
 Abilities. Dog Welding.

851
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:17,360
 Obsession has a strong compulsion to weld dogs on people's faces.

852
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,360
 Equipment. Welding equipment.

853
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,360
 Weapons. Dogs.

854
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,360
 Which he welds onto people's faces.

855
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,360
 And so this was a DC comic?

856
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,360
 Yeah.

857
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,360
 Wasn't he part of a...

858
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,360
 I think I remember that he was in a team,

859
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,360
 and one of the others in the team was the defenestrator

860
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,360
 who carried around a window to throw people through.

861
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,360
 I think you're thinking, because he gets rid of now,

862
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,360
 I think you're thinking of Dog Welder 2,

863
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,360
 who was basically, there was a husband

864
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,360
 who one day goes to an antique shop.

865
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,360
 He's possessed by original Dog Welder's welding equipment,

866
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
 which happens to be in the shop.

867
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,360
 And then he immediately gets very obsessed with welding dogs

868
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,360
 and welds the family dog to his children's faces.

869
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,360
 His wife is furious.

870
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,360
 She divorces him.

871
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,360
 And so he's like struggling with it,

872
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,360
 because he wants to get back with these kids.

873
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,360
 He's like, why am I welding dogs to people's faces?

874
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,360
 I don't understand what's going on.

875
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,360
 And then it turns out, and this is, he turns into a good guy,

876
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,360
 because he learns that actually there's a moment

877
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,360
 where the stars Sirius A and B are expanding,

878
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,360
 and if they touch, they'll explode and destroy Earth.

879
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,360
 And so...

880
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,360
 Wait a minute. The dog stars.

881
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,360
 The dog stars, and he realizes he's meant to weld them together.

882
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:32,360
 So he punches some NASA astronauts in the face,

883
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,360
 steals their outfits, their astronaut suits.

884
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,360
 Outfits, their suits.

885
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,360
 And flies beyond the moon to the Sirius stars,

886
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,360
 where he welds the planets, the stars back together,

887
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,360
 and he dies in the process.

888
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,360
 But so he turns good in the end, Dog Welder.

889
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,360
 It's a brilliant thing.

890
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,360
 When you weld a dog to a face, do you go dog face to human face?

891
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,360
 Do you do dog bum to human face?

892
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,360
 Do you do dog side?

893
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,360
 Like a human centipede.

894
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,360
 Is it schnauz or schnauz? Is it, you know...

895
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,360
 I would have thought the side of the dog to the side of the face.

896
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,360
 That's why I was thinking. I would think so.

897
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,360
 But don't you have to have metal to weld things together?

898
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,360
 Yeah. Yeah.

899
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,360
 Oh. Oh, hang on.

900
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,360
 Mr. One Dog can tow 40 people.

901
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,360
 No, you're right, Andy. Let me write to Fantasyland,

902
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,360
 the care of James and Andy.

903
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,360
 If we welded a Newfoundland to David Hasselhoff...

904
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,360
 We must wrap up soon, but...

905
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
 Can I tell you one last thing? Yeah.

906
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,360
 In 2015, the Telegraph reported on a stray dog called Archie,

907
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,360
 who had been rescued.

908
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,360
 It was a really nice story and coached back to strength by a volunteer,

909
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,360
 Jack Russell, little dog,

910
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,360
 and it was a lovely French nursery school teacher

911
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,360
 who had been volunteering at the centre

912
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,360
 and spending all of her weekends with him.

913
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,360
 She sang him lots of songs in French

914
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,360
 and she called him Montpetit Choux and all of this.

915
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,360
 And as a result, Archie now only reacts to commands

916
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,360
 given in a French accent.

917
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,360
 And if you want Archie to do anything,

918
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,360
 you have to say, "Sit!"

919
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,360
 And he won't do anything else.

920
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,360
 "Wackies!" Yeah, exactly.

921
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,360
 I got a very, very quick story.

922
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,360
 No, go for it. We have a few more minutes.

923
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,360
 OK, so about clever dogs. Yeah.

924
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,360
 So the Spectator, which is where I told you about

925
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,360
 the second evil dog,

926
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,360
 they actually got a bit of a reputation

927
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,360
 in the 19th century for sort of clever dog stories

928
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,360
 to such an extent that whenever any other newspaper

929
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,360
 would write about them, they'd say,

930
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,360
 "Oh, this is yet another Spectator dog."

931
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,360
 But they would always get people writing in with these stories

932
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,360
 and they all said they were definitely true.

933
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,360
 So there was one person who said that they were in church

934
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,360
 and there was a new priest

935
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,360
 and the priest was saying a sermon

936
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,360
 and it was going on for ever and ever and ever.

937
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,360
 And there was a dog in there and he got restless

938
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,360
 and the dog knew that an altar boy

939
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,360
 would always go around with the plates to collect money

940
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,360
 just before the end of the church service.

941
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,360
 And so what he did was, while this pastor was sort of droning on,

942
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,360
 he went over to the boy who always took it

943
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,360
 and sort of looked at him, just stared at him and said,

944
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,360
 "Well, when are you going to do your bloody thing?"

945
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,360
 And then when the boy didn't do anything,

946
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,360
 he started to beg for him to do the passing the plate round

947
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,360
 and when he didn't do anything about that,

948
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,360
 he started nuzzling him and trying to push him around the church

949
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,360
 to try and get him to do this part of the mass.

950
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,360
 And then knocked out the boy, took his cassock,

951
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,360
 dressed up as the boy,

952
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,360
 conducted the search.

953
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,360
 Sorry, not the search.

954
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,360
 What's the free money thing at the end of the church?

955
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,360
 Free money?

956
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,360
 You're doing it wrong if it's free money.

957
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,360
 Not the collection.

958
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,360
 The collection, I'm not going to say the tipping, which is not...

959
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,360
 Can I just ask, what is the tax implication of the free money?

960
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,360
 Can I just ask, what is the tax implication of the free money?

961
