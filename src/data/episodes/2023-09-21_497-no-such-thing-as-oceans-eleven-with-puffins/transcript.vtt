00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of No Singers of Fish. This is another live show

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.760
 which was recorded at the Soho Theatre in London and who is our special guest today?

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.760
 Well if you were a podcast fan, if you were a fan of amazing books, if you were a fan

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.560
 of the TV show Horrible Histories then you'll know who I'm talking about. Our guest was

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.840
 the historian Greg Jenner. So like I say, Greg first came to prominence I suppose as

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.960
 the historical consultant on Horrible Histories but he has since become a nerdy superstar

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.080
 at his own right thanks to his podcast Your Dead To Me which you definitely, I'm sure

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.160
 you've heard it but if you haven't heard it you definitely should check that out but

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.920
 he also has written lots of books, the latest of which are called Ask A Historian and Dead

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 Famous and Unexpected History of Celebrity and the very exciting thing about those if

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.720
 you are super quick off the blocks is that at the moment they are both 99p on e-book

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.240
 for the rest of September. He also has an illustrated kids book called You Are History

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.040
 and that is out in hardback and audiobook as well. Look, just go to the place where

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.120
 you buy your books, e-books and audiobooks and search for Greg Jenner and you will not

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.080
 be disappointed and I hope you will also not be disappointed with this week's podcast

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.160
 so let's just get on with it. On with the podcast.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:44.800
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:53.480
 week coming to you live from the Soho Theatre in London. My name is Jan Shriver, I am sitting

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.740
 here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Greg Jenner and once again we have gathered

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.640
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.600
 order, here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is my fact this week. My fact

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.400
 is when Virginia's Barter Theatre first opened in 1933, it paid playwrights their royalties

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.880
 exclusively in ham except for George Bernard Shaw who was a vegetarian and managed to

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.280
 negotiate his payment to be in spinach. Superb. Yeah, this is an amazing thing that happened

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.440
 during the Great Depression in America and this guy who was an actor, he was a very young

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.840
 actor at the time called Robert Porterfield, he found all these actors were out of work,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.600
 the theatres weren't running because no one could afford to go to the theatres but then

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.920
 he also noticed that there were a lot of farmers who had a lot of produce that they weren't

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.080
 able to shift so he thought what if I set up a bartering theatre whereby you could trade

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.320
 ham for hamlet, that would be the system right? So you could come in and you could then give

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.480
 any kind of produce that you wanted and that would get you a ticket and the bartering system

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.500
 worked very much like how bartering does, you know, you negotiate as you're doing it. More

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:20.560
 like bartering. Oh. Very good, very good. Yeah, so it would be, it was good Andy. Don't

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.800
 let everyone tell you differently. Yeah, so the system, yeah, God yeah. The stories are

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.680
 great because people have written about how this, you know, a lot of these playwrights

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.720
 so when George Bernard Shaw was first asked, he said, I'm not really into it and then

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.120
 Pygmalion came out and he said, oh yes, Pygmalion, Pygmalion. Should have been Spinachmalion.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.680
 Should have been, yeah. So all the stories that he collected over the years, people got

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.960
 interviews out of him and it's really fun so there would be examples of say a farmer

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.320
 who would bring his cow to the theatre and he'd say how much milk to get in to see the

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.520
 play and they would tell him and then he'd go to the side and milk the cow to the amount

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.640
 that they said, hand over the bucket and then he would start to go in and in the anecdote

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.520
 his wife was with him and they said, you're not going to get your wife to come in as well

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.200
 and he said, she can milk her own ticket. I was wondering how they did change at the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.080
 theatre because I thought you were saying- Oh, so you hadn't done your hum and you got

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.880
 a little bit of bacon back. Yeah, kind of. I mean, you could have a pig which was worth

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.440
 ten tickets. Wow. So I think if you traded a whole pig maybe you got like a season pass.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.320
 Yeah. That kind of thing. But they accepted, all sorts of, it wasn't just farm produce,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.400
 they accepted toothpaste, snakes and underwear as well. Which is good if you don't have a

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.760
 pig so you can get a pig. With the toothpaste for the snakes. Do they have teeth? They have

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.200
 teeth, right? They've got fangs. They've got fangs, man. Yeah. Can you brush a snake's

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:59.700
 teeth? Sorry. Actually, you can milk a snake's teeth. Hello, great point. One ticket. There

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.320
 was all sorts of weird, like there was a boy who said that he had some jam or some kind

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.520
 of substance in a jar turned out to be mud so people were trying to counterfeit their

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.440
 way in there as well. There was someone who did Brig a pig saying, I'll pay with my pig

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.680
 but then the pig got loose and all the actors had to chase their money down the street. And

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.600
 weirdly, there was a jail that was directly underneath the barter theater. So while they

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.960
 were doing the plays, there was always this slight concern that one of the jailmates would

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.840
 break free and sort of come onto stage and murder everyone. So there was added conflict,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.720
 you know. Yeah. It sounds like it was an amazing place. And one of the things was a guy came

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.400
 in, he was a mountaineer and he said, I don't have any food, but I make coffins. Do you all

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.840
 want a coffin? And they said, no, we're fine. He said, well, I make canes as well. And he

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.680
 made so many canes that apparently every major actor in Broadway was seen walking around

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.080
 with one of these canes because he just kept making them and kept going to more and more

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.200
 shows. That's cool. I mean, to me, I know I am an ex-accountant, but it does sound like

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.960
 a massive tax dodge. Oh yeah. Like bartering is all well and good as long as you pay the

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.920
 tax on the actual amount of the thing that you're bartering with. How much tax? One slice

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.320
 of bacon? Well, you know, 20% of your pig. Oh, whatever. That's the thing. Like, there's

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.880
 that old story of Picasso. Do you remember he was in a cafe? I mean, I don't think this

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.400
 is true, but he was in... It is true. Is it true? Yeah, my mum's got one. Wow. So Picasso...

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.160
 I think I know where you're going with it. Picasso used to buy his meals by doing a tiny

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.400
 little doodle because it'd be worth more than the meal. He did thousands. They're, they're

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.120
 now valueless. Really? Is that what Gary Linnika has been doing in all restaurants? In the

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.880
 restaurants. All in the restaurants in the UK have a signed photo of Gary Linnika. Yeah,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.960
 yeah. Like everyone, and you can see it, like, I was young, Gary was here. Oh, Gary was

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.300
 here quite recently. That's what he's doing. I imagine that is what he's doing. That probably

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.280
 is what he's doing. He's probably getting free food. Well, I don't want to do a smudge

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.160
 Gary Linnika. I don't mind. We don't know. The thing is, though, with Picasso, right?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.360
 So the story goes, one of the story goes that he did this doodle and they said, well, Mr.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.360
 Picasso, will you sign it? And he said, well, I want to pay for lunch. I don't want to pay

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:18.620
 for the entire establishment. That's the story. But the thing is... What a wanker. I don't

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.680
 think anyone's saying that Picasso wasn't a wanker. Yeah. Of all the artists, I think

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.480
 Picasso is very high in the wanker index. Okay. But the thing is, like, if you're an artist

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.560
 and you draw something and you're in a cafe and they give you some food, there are tax

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:37.040
 implications of that. And really, it is against the law to do that. The only way they could

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.240
 get around it is if Picasso, instead of just having lunch, if it was a business lunch and

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.120
 if the people in the cafe were going to put the picture up on the wall so that everyone

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.280
 in the cafe can enjoy it, so technically it's decoration, then they're both business expenses,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.760
 they're both tax deductible. That's fine. Why do you think accountants have such a reputation

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:06.480
 for that? Thank God James isn't at all these historical moments where Picasso lands an

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.840
 absolute zingo and he's going, "Well, actually, the tax implications of that are..." Could

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:16.600
 he do a smaller drawing to be the tax? No. Yeah, he could. In fact, I believe in some

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.400
 places in America sometimes they have accepted artwork as tax payment from artists who couldn't

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.080
 afford to pay their tax and have done that. So that is possible in theory. I can't believe

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.160
 we're accepting this fact given how much shit I took many episodes ago when I said that

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.080
 if Mozart was on the street and he was passing someone who asked him for some money, a beggar,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.000
 a homeless person was asking for some money, that he would say, "I have no money but here,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.320
 let me write you some music." And he would be like, "Raskebidaga doody." And give it

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:50.120
 to them. And then they would take that and they would... Do what? Sell it. What would

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.200
 you do with your Picasso? You can sell it for a lot of money. No, you can't. No, you

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.160
 can't because my mum has one and you can't do anything about it. Has your mum been trying

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.240
 to sell it? Yeah, it's not worth anything. I'll buy it. All right. I'll buy the on-site

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.680
 Picasso that we know is definitely him, yeah. Also, how do you verify that the music is

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:15.640
 by Mozart when it's just one bar of music? Because it sounds like ABBA. Right. Barter...

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.800
 Barter is a weird thing, isn't it? Because there's a lot of debate about barter. I definitely

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.840
 thought it's a thing before money. So the baker makes some bread and he goes to the

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.800
 butcher and the butcher... And the butcher has some meat and between them they have a

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:37.360
 sandwich. Well, they swap. They have two sandwiches. Exactly. You end up with two sandwiches and

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.800
 everyone's happy. But of course, what if the butcher doesn't want any bread, the baker

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.840
 starves to death? Nightmare. So you need money. That's the basic, and I say very basic premise.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.120
 But this is the weird thing about barter. There's no... I don't think there's any... Actually,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.640
 it seems like money produces barter systems. Like after the fall of the Roman Empire, people

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.320
 resorted to barter because there wasn't a stable currency anymore. There doesn't seem to be

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.640
 any good evidence of a proper barter society where someone says, "I'll give you these grapes

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:12.280
 if you give me that cloth." It just doesn't seem to be any evidence for that. Correct. Oh,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:20.960
 shit. One evidence that I found in a short look. I mean, money's fascinating, right?

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.160
 So coins are really new. In terms of the history of the world, coins are... They're like 2,700

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.120
 years old, give or take. They're really, really new. So you've got these sort of enormous

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.200
 societies in the Bronze Age. The Egyptians don't have money. Oh, really? The Sumerians,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.960
 the Babylonians, the Akkadians don't have money. Really? And the first coin has got

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.440
 a little lion face. It's very cute and it's ancient Greek. And I think at the city, I

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:48.080
 think it was maybe Liddy, I can't remember, but it's like 2,700 BCE. So prior to that,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.040
 you have economic structures and you've got kings and you've got people with power and

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.760
 you have got distribution of wealth of a sort, but it's not cash. And even in the 8th, 9th,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.400
 10th centuries, you get these coin hordes, Viking coin hordes buried in the ground. And

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.080
 you're never entirely sure to what extent they are someone going, "I'm going to put

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.560
 that in the ground and come back for it later," or it's someone's nicked it or someone has

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.680
 been killed in battle or... We're never quite sure because the money's not in circulation.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.960
 So the history of money is really interesting because there's a lot of stuff we don't know,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.800
 but obviously, Barter must have been part of that equation. It's certainly in the Stone

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.480
 Age, no? You're going to tell me there's no bartering in the Stone Age.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.680
 I'm not going to say anything. You're going to do that. Go on, do it.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:38.040
 Yeah, sort it, why not? Straight from nothing to Bitcoin, that's what I'm saying. We're

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.120
 dead. But you are right that definitely when society breaks down or when there's problems

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.720
 in society, we do resort to Barter. That's definitely true, right? So in Russia in the

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.120
 90s, there's a lot of it going on. So there was not much, certainly in the late 90s, not

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.640
 much demand for rubles. If you got any rubles, you just want to swap them for US dollars.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.360
 That's pretty much all you'd ever do with them. And so when companies ran out of cash

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.960
 to pay their workers, the workers would often just accept whatever you're making, you would

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.240
 take some of them home and then you'd be able to swap that for dollars. There's no point

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.800
 having the rubles in between. And so there was like Siberian workers who were paid in

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.680
 coffins, as we were saying before. There was a Volggrad factory where all the workers were

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:24.420
 paid in bras. And then there was another factory in Volggrad called Aktauba, and they made

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:33.960
 navigation equipment. But then they'd recently diversified into making dildos. And the workers

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.700
 decided, well, we're not going to get paid otherwise. So we'll just accept the dildos

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:45.440
 as payment. And this is in the economist guys. This is happening. And so they got all these

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.180
 dildos and then went to the local sex shops to try and sell them and get some US dollars.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.640
 But it turned out that just around the same time, the world had moved on to electronic

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.000
 vibrators. And the dildos were virtually worthless.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.240
 Oh, so navigation to dildos. Yeah, I was like, how did they diversify from that? Like,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:19.780
 yeah, so it's what from compass to compass is. Wow. Yeah, I sextant. You had sex. Wow,

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.300
 is there a heartwarming end to the story where they all use the dildos to build a new there's

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.340
 no heartwarming ending to any story that begins in Russia in 1999.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:32.020
 Okay. Do you remember the story of that guy who bought up a huge bulk amount of copies

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.920
 of Lance Armstrong's book? It's all about the bike. And then it's not the bike. Did

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.840
 you do two books? Did he? No, you're not about the bike. It's not about the bike, which

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:49.160
 turned out to be about the drugs. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, this guy suddenly had a warehouse

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.560
 full of these books and no one was buying them because this guy was an untouched celebrity

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.680
 all of a sudden before. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was like just before is like did the deal

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:02.700
 and suddenly like news headline. Lance Armstrong. So was he sort of bulk ordering them in the

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.300
 hope of then selling them and I think like they were remaindered and he thought I'll

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.900
 buy them and I can do a trade of them somehow. Yeah, here's a place that does have butter.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:17.180
 This is good zoos operate a barter system with each other even today because you need

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.940
 a permit to buy and sell endangered animals. But in America, zoos are allowed to barter

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:28.400
 the creatures. So in 2014, there was an aquarium in Boston that needed some fish and North

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.120
 Carolina's aquarium had some of those fish. And North Carolina wanted jellyfish and sniped

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.720
 fish in exchange for the fish that they were going to give to Boston. But the Boston people

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:43.360
 didn't have sniped fish. So Boston had to. Is this a riddle? Hang on Greg, hang on. So

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.680
 they had to get some Japanese sniped fish, swap them for some lump fish that they did

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.080
 have in Boston. Then they sent North Carolina those. But they can't be on the craft at the

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:58.340
 same time as the fox. Yeah. And the fox is in a submarine. Yeah. And that's it. The zookeeper

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.940
 was the mother. That's it. That's really cool. And it's because in the olden days,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.300
 if you had a zoo, you just send someone off and say, I'd like two pandas, please. Yeah.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.340
 I'm going to be an explorer and they just go and get you two pandas, but you can't really

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:17.980
 do that anymore. No. There was one because of Brexit. There was one aquarium that swapped

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:24.520
 800 mackerel for a dozen puffins. Does that feel like a good deal for you? I'd love a

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.920
 dozen puffins. Yeah. I feel like a dozen puffins is exactly the right number of puffins. I

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:35.680
 feel like that's that's a bank job. It's like Ocean's Eleven. But puffins. I genuinely think

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:42.040
 if your mother put up that Picasso, you could trade that for 11 puffins. Picasso is a dove,

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.120
 dove of peace. So it could actually we could swap a dove of peace for 12 puffins and then

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:54.520
 I could hit a bank and take on a casino. Are you also the 13th puffin in the costume?

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.940
 I'm George Clooney puffin. Yeah, nice. And then we'll have Brad Pitt puffin, Matt Damon

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.820
 puffin and other puffins. I've forgotten who else is in the film. Gently. Is he in

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.300
 the film? I don't know. Sorry, how did your mom come by this picture at the Picasso? Did

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:12.340
 you buy it? No, she was gifted, I think, because it's not value and it's just got it's not

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:17.400
 enough value to be worth anything. So it's a gift you give someone in return for like,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.440
 oh, thanks. That was really nice. Here's a big asset. James, are there any tax implications

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:27.360
 to Greg's mom receiving this? Price was welcome. If she got them as part of her job, yes, there

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:38.680
 would be. Alright, she's a French teacher. Where do we stand on that? Je ne sais pas.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:44.620
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Greg. My fact is complex, so I'm apologizing

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.500
 in advance for it. But my fact is this, at different times in history, Mondays have been

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:55.940
 considered the first day of the week, the second, the third and the seventh. Wow. And

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:05.420
 what is it now? Right. So we've got six hours. Yeah. Now it's officially internationally

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.080
 it's the first day of the week, the International Standards Committee or whatever they call

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.080
 the day. Because I was always taught at school that it's Sunday is the first day of the week.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.440
 Yeah. So in the religious Christian Mondays, the second day of the week now, it used to

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.160
 be the third day of the week because in the Jewish calendar, it was the third day, Sabbath

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:26.160
 and Saturday, Sunday, and then Monday became the third. But then when you get Christianity

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.160
 becoming dominant in Rome in the sort of second and third centuries, they move Sabbath from

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.200
 Saturday to Sunday. And so Monday becomes the second day. But the really tricky thing about

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:40.620
 it is that the Industrial Revolution gives us Mondays as we know them, the Garfield one,

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:45.500
 the Monday. The Garfield Monday that he hates. There's a lot of great philosophers who do

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:54.060
 Mondays, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, Bob Geldof, Garfield. So our Mondays is an economic Monday.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.260
 Our Monday is the post-Industrial Revolution, where you get the invention of a brand new

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.300
 temporal structure called the weekend. The weekend is a new thing, it's about a hundred

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:11.200
 years old. And so Mondays get redefined. But in ancient astronomy, Mondays are wrong. So

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:18.320
 the days of the week should be, according to astronomy, it should be Saturday, Thursday,

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:27.040
 Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday. Poor Craig David. He'd be so good to a park

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:33.040
 on Monday, met her for the first time Tuesday. What's happening? So that's the order that

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.180
 astronomically the planet should be in. And we've got this really lovely ancient book we

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.340
 don't have, we've got the title of, by Plutarch. And the title is literally, "Why is the days

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:47.060
 of the week ordered wrongly?" It's the kind of thing you Google at 3 a.m. and you're like,

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:52.280
 "What? Tuesdays?" So Dio Cassius wrote a thing saying, "What's happened here is it's

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.440
 because there's 168 hours in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, which the Romans are

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:02.300
 very keen on. Each hour gets assigned to a god. The first hour goes to the god and that

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.980
 god gets that day named after them. The second hour, the next god, third, fourth, fifth,

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.900
 sixth, seventh, and then you're back to the first god again. By the time you get to the

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:14.460
 25th hour, you're on to the second god. So the day gets named after him. And so you end

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:19.980
 up with the days being in the wrong order. So our Mondays are wrong and the Romans are

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.820
 like, "Oh, no. We'll just have to live with it." And we have. We've lived with it ever

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:29.360
 since. That's amazing. That is incredible. I've got a fact about Tuesday. Is it Thursday,

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.920
 Tuesday, or Saturday, Tuesday? I'm going to go for my Tuesday, which is tomorrow, yeah.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:39.600
 So we're doing this on a Monday, we should say, for the audience listening at home. So

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:45.600
 this is cool. This happened last year. The 22nd of February, 2022, was a Tuesday. Yeah,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:54.520
 which means it was Tuesday. It was Tuesday. It was Tuesday. It was Tuesday. It was Tuesday.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.580
 It was Tuesday. That's nice. That's the end of the fact. Monday's caused lightning.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:05.700
 It was a good thing. Well, it's not a good thing actually. It's just a thing. So it's

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:12.980
 because of car exhaust. So more people commute on Mondays. So scientists counted lightning

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.720
 strikes in the USA for a decade and worked out where they fall, where the distribution

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.200
 is. So this is particularly in southeastern states in the USA. And lightning strikes rock

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.840
 it because there's a bit more pollution in the air. The air is moisture. There are low

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.360
 line clouds. That creates the perfect conditions for lightning. So yeah, for hundreds of miles,

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.520
 you get more lightning on a Monday. That's really interesting. I've got a Wednesday

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:40.800
 fact. No. Go on. Is this your Wednesday? It's my Wednesday. Yeah. It's a day after tomorrow.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:46.660
 We're recording this on a Monday. It's worth knowing. According to one study, the best

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:55.660
 time to tweet or X is to... Oh, no. Oh, my God. No, no. Look at you staying in with Elon.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:03.380
 You creep. Apparently, if you want to get maximum impact, it's 5pm on a Wednesday is when you

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.140
 should send that tweet. Really? Yeah. They've just scanned through where most have engagement

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.260
 and so on. And apparently that's supposed to be wrong. Pump day. Is that... I mean, that

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.220
 doesn't feel... What's happening at 5pm on a Wednesday? They just found engagement was

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:20.140
 higher. That's wrong. I don't like that stat. I reckon it's because people aren't really

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.380
 trying as hard because it's not Monday anymore. Right. But you also haven't left early because

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.500
 it's not Friday. It's just like the perfect time. So you're stuck in the office. Yeah.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.200
 You're looking your phone. It's 5pm and you're out that door. I reckon. Are you got any Thursday

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:40.380
 facts done? I do. There's a theory that the universe was created last Thursday. It's called

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.740
 last Thursdayism. And the idea is that... And it's very hard to just prove this. Was this

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:50.860
 fact three weeks old in which case the universe hasn't been created yet until this week? No,

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.240
 is it always last Thursday? It's always last Thursday. The idea is that every memory that

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.940
 you have, everything that's on our planet, everything has been set to seem like it's

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:03.680
 been here for millions and billions of years in the case of the age of the universe. So

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:10.120
 last Thursdayism says it's impossible to deny the theory that it's infallible as a fact

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.080
 because it's impossible to find a glitch in. Right. Well, what if I put something in a box

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.680
 last Thursday and then I open the box today? Your theory falls over. No, it doesn't because

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:24.400
 your memory as you put it last Thursday. Yeah, but I know I did. I wrote a label. I labeled

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:30.340
 it Thursday. No, I labeled it Wednesday. I can't believe, Andy, that you found the

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:36.180
 hole in the bearing. Wow. How come Andy's underpants that say Thursday on them are still

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:43.460
 in the wash? Yeah. I got a fact about Fridays. Oh, yeah. You want to hear that? Do you know

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:49.220
 Dress Down Friday? Dress Down Friday, yeah. Do you know who invented that or why it was

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:55.040
 invented? Military thing. It's a military thing. Yeah? Yeah. Like every Friday, you

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.400
 don't have to wear your uniform. Yeah, you start in the city, but you're wearing a Hawaiian

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:04.360
 shirt. Yeah, exactly. It's fun. It's good for morale. It's bad for camouflage, but it'll

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:10.180
 be fun. Yeah. Well, I gave you a clue there. It was invented by people who made Hawaiian

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:17.000
 shirts to sell more Hawaiian shirts. Really? Really? This was in the '60s. Yeah, it was

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.860
 a company called, it was the Hawaiian fashion guild, actually. They came up with the idea

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:27.620
 of Aloha Fridays, where everyone would wear a Hawaiian shirt into work, and then it just

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:31.500
 took off, and now we have people just wearing jeans on Friday. Wow. But do the people who

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.580
 work at the Hawaiian fashion guild have to go in in a three-piece suit on a Friday?

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:41.040
 Just while we were talking about military on Fridays as well, there's a thing on Japanese

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.420
 Navy ships and submarines that they have curry every night on Friday nights, because

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.300
 on a ship, you might lose the track of the days, and that's a way of them going, "Oh,

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.620
 it's Friday. We're having curry." It's a thing on the menu that allows for them to remember.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.080
 It's a nice idea. Yeah, because you do lose track. And on a Saturday, you feel like, you

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.840
 know? Yeah. No, that's, no, that's, I do have a Saturday fact, if that's what you're

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:09.800
 edging to do. But it's absolutely not that. Okay, go on. Let's hear your Saturday fact.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:15.080
 My Saturday fact is that on U.S. ships and submarines, they will have burgers for dinner

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.640
 just so they remember what day it is, so that they know. And that's because so you can

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:24.180
 lose track when you're on a ship or a submarine, they will have burgers and they're like, "Ah,

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:30.620
 Saturday." Yeah, I feel like I'm losing track now. Yeah. Mondays, this is a study from 2006.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.700
 But Mondays, most of us apparently are tired and depressed on a Monday. And work that requires

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:41.740
 emotional involvement or flair should be avoided. Or flair. I'm afraid so. Oh, wow. It's best

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:47.920
 to be alone. Our lines of communication mentally are largely closed, and communication with

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.080
 each other is also poorer on a Monday. So that's why we did this kick on a Monday, wasn't it?

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.800
 I think maybe we're proving it. Very quickly, because I just thought, suddenly remember,

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.760
 Fridays are obviously Freyja. So these are the Germanic gods, right? So Saturday is Saturn,

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.120
 is the only one of the days of the week that's named after a Roman god. All the others are

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.540
 Monday, Sunday, and then Germanic gods. Who's Freyja? Freyja, she's Anglo-Saxon and Norse

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:19.860
 goddess, very powerful, very cool. Thursday's Thor, or Thunor, Wednesday's Woden. But the

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:26.740
 Romans called Venus the planet, not Venus. They called it Lucifer. Just suddenly, it

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:31.580
 occurs to me, and the Greeks called it Phosphorus, like Giver. So it suddenly reminded me that

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:36.820
 Friday is named after Venus, Aphrodite. But they didn't call the planet Venus. They called

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:42.240
 it Lucifer. So they would see Lucifer in the sky and go, "There he is." Oh, that's great.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.520
 It's quite a scary name. Although they didn't call it Lucifer, they'd call it Leukeph, Latin.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:54.420
 Leukeph. Leukeph. That's awesome. Go on, Dan, tell us your Sunday fact. So on Sundays,

00:25:54.420 --> 00:26:00.960
 in order for US Navy ships and submarines to know what day it is, they have steak, because

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.880
 you can lose track of time when you're on ship. So they will have steak on a Sunday,

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:10.620
 and they're like, "Ah, it's a Sunday." We're recording this on a Monday, by the way. We're

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.940
 going to have to move on to our next fact in one sec. Should we go for it?

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.420
 I can give you a quick Sunday fact. Obviously, Sunday trading was a thing. There were certain

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.060
 things you were allowed to sell on Sundays, certain things you weren't. And so if you're

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:26.460
 a shopkeeper, you're allowed to sell food for horses, because they were working animals,

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:32.060
 but you weren't allowed to sell food for dogs, because it was a pet often. This is in Hansard

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:37.120
 in 1968. They were discussing this. And apparently, the reason that they wanted to change the

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:42.000
 rules is because it was such nonsense that a man could go into a shop and say, "I have

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.800
 a pony who only eats dog biscuits." Can I have some dog biscuits for my pony? And they

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.480
 had to give him the biscuits. And that's when they thought, "Maybe we need to change our

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.880
 rules a little bit." That's so good. That's amazing.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:05.880
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is that the first electric

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:11.400
 cars were taken away each night and delivered back to your door fully charged in the morning.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.860
 So they were like, "Choose outside hotel rooms." Basically, we put them out, some takes

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.820
 them away, polishes them. Is that what happens?

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.820
 Sorry, what?

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.780
 Hang on, what? I tell you what, we stay at travel lodges.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:21.780
 Yeah, yeah.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.780
 Where have you gone, Tar?

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.780
 Where are you staying?

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.780
 Yeah.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.780
 What are you talking about?

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:26.780
 That's a thing.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.800
 I'm distracted from the main point of the - but that doesn't happen in hotels. You put

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.260
 your shoes outside the room and then they - like, if you want them polished, you don't

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.000
 have to - what?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 Do you leave a note on them?

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 No!

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Say, "Please."

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 It's red, it's understood.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 Is it?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 You don't need to leave a note.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.640
 I feel like the hotels where I stay in, they would just get stolen.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.640
 Yeah.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.680
 Well, just by round of chews, has anyone heard of that in here?

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.760
 OK, a few people who here hasn't heard of it.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.460
 Not enough for - OK, can I really take my fact?

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.460
 Yeah.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.460
 The fact is fine, it was the following.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.580
 The first electric cars were taken away each night and delivered to your door, fully charged

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:09.900
 for the morning. A unique occurrence.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.620
 When are we talking first electric cars?

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:16.980
 So early, early days, not the - so like late 19th, early 20th century. This is from an

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.420
 interview with the head of Ford. I was listening to a podcast the other day with - which was

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.360
 interviewed - he's called Jim Farley. And he was talking about the firm Detroit Electric,

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:30.020
 who they made early cars. Like loads of the early cars when combustion engines were just

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:36.080
 starting were electric. And the electric ones, they were kind of marketed at - they were

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.080
 marketed at women, basically.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.080
 Yeah.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.760
 The idea was they're a bit dainty here. You don't have to hand crank them to start because

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.080
 that's quite like a - it's quite a physical -

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.580
 It's the smell of petrol fuel.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.920
 The smell was particularly a big part.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.260
 Yeah, petrol stains and it's all - like it's very - yeah. And also Wikipedia claims they

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.820
 were sold to women drivers and physicians.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.820
 No idea why.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.900
 Well, I think the idea was if you needed to go and save someone's life really quickly

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.620
 because they were sick, you wouldn't have to do all the cranking. You just go straight

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:04.620
 away.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.940
 That's good. Okay. Okay, that tracks then. Yeah. And they had the system with the doors

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.220
 where they didn't have the charging capacity in your home, obviously, because most houses

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:17.180
 weren't even on the electric at that point. And they sound like mad cars. They were operated

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.240
 by - this is incredible - from the back seat.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.240
 So amazing.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.240
 Yeah, this is incredible.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.480
 From the back seat, they had a rear-facing front seat so you could face your passengers.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.480
 Oh, great.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:29.280
 You could put your passengers in the front seat facing backwards to you. You can chat to

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.760
 them as you drive. But you can't see the road. And they also - and they had - instead of

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.600
 a steering wheel, boring, they had a tiller.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.600
 Yeah.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.920
 Because that was nice and - it was nice and calm. It was like having a lovely sailboat

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.920
 or something.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.920
 What's a tiller?

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.920
 Like a rudder, basically.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.920
 Oh, on the back of the boat.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.920
 So it was quite ridiculous.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920
 Wow.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.760
 I know. So you have to - backwards, from the back seat of the car, unable to see the road

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.760
 ahead of you.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.760
 Yeah.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.760
 So weird that it didn't catch on.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.740
 The tiller thing is amazing. So Ben's invented the steering wheel in the 1890s.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.740
 Ben's and Jerry's.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.740
 Yeah.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.740
 Ben's and Jerry's.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:08.080
 But Americans just stuck with this tiller the whole time. And there was a journalist

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:15.080
 writing around the time who said, "Few have adopted that foreign freak, the steering wheel.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.520
 A car with a wheel would be a nerve wracker of the worst kind."

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.000
 Imagine that, a steering wheel. It's amazing.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.480
 So it came back to your house fully charged and we're talking not lithium-ion batteries,

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.560
 we're talking what, lead-acid?

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.640
 No, very - yeah, I don't know exactly what the batteries were in these.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.640
 How do you charge it?

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.920
 For sure, they were acid batteries, I'm pretty sure.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.920
 Yeah, okay.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.680
 But I think what would happen most of the time is they would replace the battery.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.680
 Yeah.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.520
 And then the battery would go back somewhere else to be charged, which might take time,

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.520
 I don't know.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.960
 Yeah, it was a lot of these places, which I think would be really cool now as someone

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.960
 with an electric car. I'd love to just, instead of plug in, they just take the battery out

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.240
 and put another one back in and you go straight away.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.240
 Oh, that's a cool idea.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.240
 Yeah.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.240
 It's not changing horses.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.720
 Well, that's actually the reason they did it, because people were used to changing horses.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.440
 And this was kind of the obvious way of doing it.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.080
 Well, it's what, like, you get up in the morning, you look outside your door, you get your nice

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.080
 polished shoes, go down, you take a fresh horse.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:14.720
 Someone has recharged your shoes. Rechargeable batteries were invented in 1859.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.720
 Wow.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.720
 So it's quite early, right?

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.720
 Yeah.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.080
 So that's Gaston Plontet who invents them, and that's quite exciting.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.880
 But that's already 20-odd years after the first electric car. It's really amazing how

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.240
 early they were, because we now look at electric cars and we kind of go like, oh, you know,

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.240
 Elon Musk.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:34.000
 But like the electric car is like so much more established than fuel and petrol.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 Yeah.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Yeah.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 And for a long time.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 But for 20 years, they couldn't recharge the batteries.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 That's the thing.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Yeah, the battery, finished it.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Yeah.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 Like, bang.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 Throw the car away.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Well, yeah, I mean, you just chuck it and you get a new one.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 The guy I like is, have you heard of Sibrande Strating?

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 No.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 No?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 No?

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 He's Dutch guy.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.600
 He's not, he sort of deserves more or renown.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.000
 He's quite cool.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.160
 And he possibly invented the first electric car that's like decent, and we know about.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.640
 There's a Scotsman who, called Robert Anderson, who may be invented one in the 1830s, but we

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.640
 don't know much about it.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.400
 But Sibrande Strating, who lived in Groningen, he was a Dutch chemistry professor.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.000
 And in 1835, he makes an electric car that weighs about three kilos.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.200
 It's a tricycle.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.800
 He can carry about 1.5 kilos, which is a guinea pig.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.800
 I don't know.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.800
 It's not great, is it?

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.360
 It can go for 20 minutes.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.880
 And it's 1835, nearly 200 years ago.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.680
 And this thing is already electrified.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.920
 But he's very cool because he also, he spoke 13 languages.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.960
 He built early electric light bulbs 50 years before Edison.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.160
 He fought a pandemic.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.620
 There was a malaria outbreak in Groningen, and he built a small chlorine factory to

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.560
 create disinfectant for the people.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.520
 And he built an electric boat.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.840
 So this one sort of chemistry professor in the mid-1830s was just sort of going, "Yeah,

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.840
 I'll do a bit of this, a bit of that, a bit of this."

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.840
 But yeah, electric car.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.840
 So cool.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.840
 Why don't we know his name?

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.920
 I think he's sort of been slightly forgotten.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:59.120
 And I discovered a PhD thesis by a Dutch historian who's been trying to like, just get back to

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.640
 the basics because it's really fascinating.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.360
 And I've got a picture of the car here.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360
 You can't...

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.360
 I've got a picture of it.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.360
 The electricity meant that the electric car failed.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.360
 Oh, no.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.360
 Dramatic irony.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.360
 Yes.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.360
 I mean, dramatic irony up the wazoo.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.360
 That's insane.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.360
 Yeah.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.360
 And there was another thing, the muffler.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.360
 The muffler was invented, which made petrol cars quieter.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.360
 Yeah.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.360
 Oh, because, yeah, that was a big issue, right?

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.360
 And they got cheaper and cheaper.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.360
 But it's also the discovery of oil, right?

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.360
 Yeah, the discovery of oil was a minor third element.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.360
 It's hugely revolutionised.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.360
 Because, I mean, Edison is talking to Ford, I think.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.360
 They're having conversations about whether to go big

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.360
 and produce electric cars on mass.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.360
 Because at this point, you know,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.360
 so London got electric tube trains in 1890.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.360
 It got electric trams in 1901.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:32.360
 And it got electric buses called electrode buses in 1907.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.360
 And they were powered by batteries.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.360
 So if you go on YouTube, there's footage of, like,

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.360
 Leicester Square or Piccadilly Circus in, like, 1908 or something.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.360
 There are electric buses pootling around.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.360
 Crazy.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.360
 We were saying we did a show about suffragettes recently,

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.360
 but you do see these images where suffragettes

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.360
 are on electric scooters.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.360
 Yeah.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.360
 And, I mean, it's basically London today.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.360
 Popping a wheelie.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.360
 Yeah, exactly.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.360
 How they were getting to, you know, throw bricks at parliament

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.360
 and stuff via electric scooter, which is mad.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.360
 And one of the big things, I guess, is that there was so much resistance,

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.360
 not only from members of the public

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.360
 who might not have thought that this was a useful thing,

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.360
 but by the rail workers as well.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.360
 Because trains were, you know, everyone would be out of the job

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.360
 if suddenly these electric cars worked.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.360
 So early cars were being hit by a whole group and whole industry,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.360
 because they just thought, "No way, we don't want to."

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.360
 My favourite electric car from this era is called the Electro Bat.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.360
 1894.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.360
 I feel like Batman in an electric car,

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.360
 but like a really cute pootling 15-mile-an-hour one.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.360
 That's a Chris Nolan movie I want to see.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.360
 In order to defeat fear, you must become fear,

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.360
 but only at 15 miles an hour.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.360
 In America, this is in the '50s now,

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.360
 they used to do mass car blessings.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.360
 If you got a car, you used to go to the church

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.360
 and have your car blessed just for, you know, good karma, basically.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.360
 I'm mixing my religions there, but yeah.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.360
 Oh, nice.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.360
 Oh, oh, shit!

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.360
 Oh, wow!

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.360
 You cool.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.360
 You stealth-punned yourself.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.360
 Wow, that was cool.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:11.360
 Care to come back into the room, Mr. Shriver?

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.360
 I'm just doing my victory lap, Andy.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.360
 I'm sorry.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.360
 So, yeah, so you would take it to church

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.360
 and you would have it blessed by a priest.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.360
 Is it like a drive-through?

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.360
 No, but they did have en masse.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.360
 En masse?

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.360
 Oh, fuck!

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:33.360
 I am on fire!

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.360
 I feel like if I put my shoes on you, they're going to recharge.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.360
 What puns coming next?

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.360
 No one knows.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.360
 I'm too nervous.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.360
 I'm going to start trying to think of one, and I should just say it.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.360
 Stay in that state.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.360
 I'll stay in the zone, yeah.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.360
 Okay, so, yeah, so they would do mass blessings and so on,

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.360
 and it would be thousands.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.360
 Yeah, pretty cool, hey.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:38:01.360
 We do need to move on in a second.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.360
 In 2010, Renault in France were sued

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.360
 for trying to call their new electric car the Zoe.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.360
 Can you guess why?

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360
 The Zoe.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.360
 Okay, so was it by another person called Zoe,

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.360
 who didn't want to be Zoe Wanamaker?

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.360
 It was, well, it was by two married couples

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.360
 who both had daughters named Zoe Renault.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.360
 Their surname was Renault, it's just a name, you know.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.360
 And so they said, "Our children's lives will be irreversibly damaged

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.360
 if you call your new car the Renault Zoe."

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.360
 And they basically brought a case saying first names are for humans,

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.360
 not for cars.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.360
 So French.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.360
 And then...

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.360
 But listen to this.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.360
 This is from the reporting of the time, right?

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.360
 The lawyer also argued that all of France's thousands of Zoe's

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.360
 could be affected with playground teasing,

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.360
 and, as they grow older,

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.360
 comments in bars such as, "Can I see your airbags?"

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:02.360
 Or, "Can I shine your bumper?"

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:07.360
 Case was rejected flat out of hand.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.360
 LAUGHTER

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:15.360
 I do need to move this on to our final fact.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.360
 It is time for our final fact of the show,

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.360
 and that is James.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.360
 OK, my fact this week is that in 1908,

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.360
 the New York Times reported on a dog in France

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.360
 that was deliberately knocking children into the sen

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.360
 before rescuing them and claiming a reward.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.360
 So, yeah, this is a thing that happened.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.360
 It was in the New York Times that the headline was,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.360
 "Dog, a fake hero."

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.360
 And they said that he was doing it to win beef steaks.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.360
 And, yeah, basically a child had fallen into the river,

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.360
 and he'd gone and saved the child,

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.360
 and they'd given him a big old steak,

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.360
 and he thought, "Well, I could do it a bit more of that."

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.360
 And sure enough, over the next few days,

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.360
 more and more children started falling in the sen.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.360
 And the same dog kept saving them.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.360
 That's amazing. Isn't it cool?

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.360
 That's incredible, isn't it?

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.360
 How long did the scam go before people went hanging on us?

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.360
 It was only a few times.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.360
 The newspaper article said it wasn't too long

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.360
 before the jig was up, so, yeah.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.360
 But, actually, this isn't the first dog who's done this.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.360
 I found an article in The Spectator from 1885

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.360
 about a dog in Lake Ontario

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.360
 who had pulled a boy out of Lake Ontario,

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.360
 and they'd taken him, and they said he went to a confectioner's

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.360
 and had a variety of cakes and other sweets.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.360
 I'm not sure if dogs were allowed to eat cakes

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.360
 and other sweets, but they did anyway.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.360
 But, yeah, sure enough,

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.360
 he started pushing kids into the lake.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.360
 Wow.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.360
 It's such a good example of unintended consequences.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.360
 It's brilliant, isn't it?

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.360
 I was looking into life-saving dogs,

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.360
 and I found a report.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.360
 This is from 2009, right?

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.360
 That Italy had 300 life-saving dogs

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.360
 that were stationed at beaches.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.360
 Okay, I'm just going to tell you what it said, right?

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.360
 And then we can get into it,

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.360
 because the vice president of the training school

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.360
 was a woman called Donna Pascuali,

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.360
 and she said, I'm quoting here,

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.360
 "The dogs learned to tow their instructors out to sea,

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.360
 "so they had the medical strengths

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.360
 "to give attention to drowning swimmers."

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.360
 Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.360
 Does it? Well, if you don't have a boat,

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.360
 if you don't have a boat... Okay, that's the if.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.360
 That's the big if. Yeah.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.360
 Because why can't you just have a boat?

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.360
 But, okay...

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.360
 They spent all the money on dogs.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.360
 Exactly. She says...

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.360
 Okay, okay, Dan, that's...

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.360
 Okay, so maybe you don't have a boat on any of the 300 beaches

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.360
 where you stationed the dogs. Yeah.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.360
 Here's what Ms Pascuali said.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.360
 "The dogs are incredibly strong.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.360
 "Our record is one dog towing 40 people at the same time."

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.360
 What? Oh, my gosh.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.360
 Are they Newfoundland dogs?

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.360
 Who fucking cares, Dan? It's 40 people!

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.360
 Yeah. One dog can't tow 40 people.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.360
 No, that's impossible.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.360
 Are they not on a lilo? Are they not on, like, a sort of...

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.360
 Are they floating on the surface so you're still...

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.360
 Exactly. They're not swimming.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.360
 So, why are the dogs towing 40 doctors?

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.360
 Obviously, like, at that point, I feel, "Get a boat."

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.360
 Sometimes, Andy, and I only know this

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.360
 because I do watch a lot of Baywatch,

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.360
 you can't make it out past the surf on a boat, right?

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.360
 So, when you're swimming, if you're on a speedboat

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.360
 and the waves are coming in thick and high,

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.360
 you're going to get flipped over. You're not going to make it out.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.360
 So, that's why David Hasselhoff always runs

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.360
 with that little red thing that looks like a mini,

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.360
 like, micro surfboard and does that.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.360
 Now, let me ask you this. Let me ask you this.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.360
 OK, go on.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.360
 How much better would Baywatch be if he had a dog under his arm

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.360
 and was able to conserve his energy?

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.360
 And he surfed the dog. There you go.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.360
 Not surf it, but, like, get out there in that sort of way, right?

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.360
 Amazing. It makes total sense.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.360
 Oh, well, you've put me back in my box, Dan.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.360
 I thought that was an insane thing about a dog towing 40 people,

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.360
 but you've made me see it as a very reasonable...

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.360
 The reason I mentioned Newfoundland dogs is because

00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:00.360
 a lot of rescue boats take Newfoundland dogs with them on it

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.360
 in order to... They're amazing at saving people.

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.360
 They're these big, fluffy life rafts, basically.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.360
 They get into the water. You can lay on them

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.360
 like your quake winslet on the door,

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.360
 and you can be saved dry.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.360
 And there's a story in Greg. I wanted to ask you about this.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:18.360
 Actually, full disclosure, it's the only time I've ever asked a guest

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.360
 whether or not this is true, and you said, "No."

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.360
 But I'm going to ask you anyway.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.360
 I mean, actually, Napoleon fell off a boat

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.360
 and a Newfoundland dog jumped in after him and saved him.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.360
 No.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.360
 So your answer is still the same as before the show,

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.360
 is what you're saying.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.360
 I mean, there's a billion stories about Napoleon,

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.360
 and you can never, ever rely on any of them.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.360
 OK, right. Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.360
 Oh, upgraded to a maybe.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.360
 I'm still taken by your vision of Titanic's closing scenes there.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.360
 Get off the dog!

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.360
 I've got some other hero dogs who might be villains,

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.360
 but not really, but they're not villains,

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.360
 but they might have stolen a bit of thunder from other dogs.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.360
 So the most famous one is Balto. Have you ever heard of Balto?

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.360
 Balto, no. Balto.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.360
 He was a hero dog, really famous,

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.360
 because he was part of a team of sled dogs,

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.360
 sort of 120-odd dogs and 20 mushers,

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:14.360
 150 dogs, I think, who saved a town in Alaska in 1925 called Nome,

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.360
 and they had a terrifying outbreak of a really horrible disease.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.360
 I think it was diphtheria.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.360
 They couldn't get their medicine to them because it was just frozen,

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.360
 the planes wouldn't get there, the ships wouldn't get there,

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.360
 and a team of kind of sled dog mushers, I guess, volunteered,

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.360
 and they had to take this medicine 670 miles in terrifying,

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.360
 you know, the worst possible Alaskan weather you can think of.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.360
 And it's called the Great Mercy Race for Nome,

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.360
 and Balto was the lead dog in the final leg

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.360
 and became like a Hollywood celebrity.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.360
 They put a statue up in Central Park, became a really famous,

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.360
 he was stuffed to put in a museum, and everyone was like,

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.360
 "Balto was a crap dog."

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.360
 "Really? Balto, the hero dog? He was never a good dog.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.360
 There were other dogs, really that dog, that dog."

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.360
 And it sort of turns out maybe that the musher,

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.360
 at the end, a guy called Gunnar Carson,

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.360
 he had been doing the second to last leg,

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.360
 and he got to the kind of weigh station

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.360
 and found the other guy who was meant to finish the run was asleep,

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.360
 and he says, "Oh, well, I didn't want to wake him up and delay.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.360
 I thought we just had to get to Nome,

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.360
 and so I did the final leg on my own as well."

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.360
 So he did two legs with Balto as his lead dog.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.360
 But there's a sort of controversy

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:22.360
 as to whether he stole this guy's thunder,

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.360
 stole the other dog's thunder,

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.360
 and the Balto, the kind of mediocre dog and Carson,

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.360
 but basically nabbed the headlines

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.360
 and ended up as the hero of this enormous sort of relay race

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.360
 to save a town.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.360
 But there's a bit of a kind of controversy

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.360
 as to whether he maybe nicked that from someone else.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.360
 And I guess they kind of don't care that much

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.360
 because it gets a story out there still, right?

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.360
 And it's like the face of the story,

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.360
 so that's kind of the important part.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.360
 I've got another villain that I found out as well.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.360
 Worth mentioning.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.360
 Have you heard of the DC superhero called Dog Welder?

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.360
 No? No, I'm sorry, Dog Welder.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.360
 So Dog Welder, he was a villain,

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.360
 and what he used to do was weld people's dogs to their faces.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.360
 That was his thing.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.360
 And he has, you can read a sort of bio on him,

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.360
 so powers and abilities.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.360
 Abilities. Dog Welding.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:17.360
 Obsession has a strong compulsion to weld dogs on people's faces.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.360
 Equipment. Welding equipment.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.360
 Weapons. Dogs.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.360
 Which he welds onto people's faces.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.360
 And so this was a DC comic?

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.360
 Yeah.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.360
 Wasn't he part of a...

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.360
 I think I remember that he was in a team,

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.360
 and one of the others in the team was the defenestrator

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.360
 who carried around a window to throw people through.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.360
 I think you're thinking, because he gets rid of now,

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.360
 I think you're thinking of Dog Welder 2,

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.360
 who was basically, there was a husband

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.360
 who one day goes to an antique shop.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:51.360
 He's possessed by original Dog Welder's welding equipment,

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.360
 which happens to be in the shop.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.360
 And then he immediately gets very obsessed with welding dogs

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:59.360
 and welds the family dog to his children's faces.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.360
 His wife is furious.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.360
 She divorces him.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.360
 And so he's like struggling with it,

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.360
 because he wants to get back with these kids.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.360
 He's like, why am I welding dogs to people's faces?

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.360
 I don't understand what's going on.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.360
 And then it turns out, and this is, he turns into a good guy,

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.360
 because he learns that actually there's a moment

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.360
 where the stars Sirius A and B are expanding,

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.360
 and if they touch, they'll explode and destroy Earth.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.360
 And so...

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.360
 Wait a minute. The dog stars.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.360
 The dog stars, and he realizes he's meant to weld them together.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:32.360
 So he punches some NASA astronauts in the face,

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.360
 steals their outfits, their astronaut suits.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.360
 Outfits, their suits.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.360
 And flies beyond the moon to the Sirius stars,

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.360
 where he welds the planets, the stars back together,

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.360
 and he dies in the process.

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.360
 But so he turns good in the end, Dog Welder.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.360
 It's a brilliant thing.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.360
 When you weld a dog to a face, do you go dog face to human face?

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.360
 Do you do dog bum to human face?

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.360
 Do you do dog side?

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.360
 Like a human centipede.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.360
 Is it schnauz or schnauz? Is it, you know...

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.360
 I would have thought the side of the dog to the side of the face.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.360
 That's why I was thinking. I would think so.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.360
 But don't you have to have metal to weld things together?

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.360
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.360
 Oh. Oh, hang on.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.360
 Mr. One Dog can tow 40 people.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:23.360
 No, you're right, Andy. Let me write to Fantasyland,

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.360
 the care of James and Andy.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.360
 If we welded a Newfoundland to David Hasselhoff...

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.360
 We must wrap up soon, but...

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.360
 Can I tell you one last thing? Yeah.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.360
 In 2015, the Telegraph reported on a stray dog called Archie,

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.360
 who had been rescued.

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.360
 It was a really nice story and coached back to strength by a volunteer,

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.360
 Jack Russell, little dog,

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.360
 and it was a lovely French nursery school teacher

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.360
 who had been volunteering at the centre

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.360
 and spending all of her weekends with him.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.360
 She sang him lots of songs in French

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.360
 and she called him Montpetit Choux and all of this.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.360
 And as a result, Archie now only reacts to commands

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.360
 given in a French accent.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.360
 And if you want Archie to do anything,

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.360
 you have to say, "Sit!"

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.360
 And he won't do anything else.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.360
 "Wackies!" Yeah, exactly.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.360
 I got a very, very quick story.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.360
 No, go for it. We have a few more minutes.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.360
 OK, so about clever dogs. Yeah.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.360
 So the Spectator, which is where I told you about

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.360
 the second evil dog,

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.360
 they actually got a bit of a reputation

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.360
 in the 19th century for sort of clever dog stories

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:30.360
 to such an extent that whenever any other newspaper

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.360
 would write about them, they'd say,

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.360
 "Oh, this is yet another Spectator dog."

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.360
 But they would always get people writing in with these stories

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.360
 and they all said they were definitely true.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.360
 So there was one person who said that they were in church

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.360
 and there was a new priest

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.360
 and the priest was saying a sermon

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.360
 and it was going on for ever and ever and ever.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.360
 And there was a dog in there and he got restless

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.360
 and the dog knew that an altar boy

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.360
 would always go around with the plates to collect money

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.360
 just before the end of the church service.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:00.360
 And so what he did was, while this pastor was sort of droning on,

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.360
 he went over to the boy who always took it

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.360
 and sort of looked at him, just stared at him and said,

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.360
 "Well, when are you going to do your bloody thing?"

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.360
 And then when the boy didn't do anything,

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.360
 he started to beg for him to do the passing the plate round

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.360
 and when he didn't do anything about that,

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.360
 he started nuzzling him and trying to push him around the church

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.360
 to try and get him to do this part of the mass.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.360
 And then knocked out the boy, took his cassock,

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.360
 dressed up as the boy,

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.360
 conducted the search.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.360
 Sorry, not the search.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:34.360
 What's the free money thing at the end of the church?

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.360
 Free money?

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.360
 You're doing it wrong if it's free money.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.360
 Not the collection.

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.360
 The collection, I'm not going to say the tipping, which is not...

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.360
 Can I just ask, what is the tax implication of the free money?

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.360
 Can I just ask, what is the tax implication of the free money?

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:58.360
 All right, need to wrap us up, guys. That is it.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.360
