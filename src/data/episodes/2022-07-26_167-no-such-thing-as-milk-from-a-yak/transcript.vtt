00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI Offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you Chazinski.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 My fact this week is that Tibet is suffering from a shortage of butter sculptors.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Yeah, this is people who make sculptures out of butter.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 When you say "shortage" it means they must have some of them still. They do have some but they must need a lot of them.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 I'm not sure that's the case because if you had a month, you could start a shortage. It would have just been extremely severe shortage.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 I think that's when it's been called an absence.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Yes, yeah.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 So butter sculpting in Tibet is very popular and it goes back a really long way and it's part of their Buddhist celebrations.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 And so in the biggest Tibetan Buddhist festival, which is called the Monlang Festival, then the largest day of it is like the day when they light all these butter lamps and they make all these butter sculptures.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 And it's a way of celebrating butter and butter's victories.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Yeah, because these sounds a bit like butter.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 It's exactly because of that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 I don't believe it's not butter.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 I wanted to laugh and I was laughing really hard inside there.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 It's got all the form of it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 It's got everything. It's got everything.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 The reason I didn't laugh at it is because there is no such thing as I can't believe it's not butter anymore.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 That's true, they changed the name.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 What?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Yeah, they changed the name to "I can't believe it's so good for everything."

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 What?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 I'm not sure it is good for everything, is it?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 No.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 No, it's not as versatile as their claiming.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 But they might have been building houses.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 It's good for building statues.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Yeah.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Well, I can't believe it's sort of butter.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Yeah, maybe.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 I don't think that's the reason you didn't laugh.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 No.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 It's a supplementary fact.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Actually, I think it is.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Because when you said it, that was what was going through my brain rather than on a great joke.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 So they specifically use yak butter as opposed to cow milk.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Is that different?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Is it more like normal?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Yes, it's exactly.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 It's a solid substance.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Yeah, it's a lot thicker.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 A yak butter generally is used for most things in Tibet.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 I was talking to my auntie, Bettina.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 She lived in Tibet.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 And I, as a child, I went to Tibet in 1994.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 And it was my friend's birthday up there.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 And we had a yak cheese cake.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 It was made from yak butter and yak cheese.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 We couldn't get the knife into it.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 It was so hard.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 The chef was experimenting with new uses of yak for these sudden western meals.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 So they also had yak pizza that they were trying to work on as well.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Which was using yak butter as well.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 But yeah, so.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 When you say it's used for most things, I think that is a bit like I can't believe it's not butter saying it can be used for everything.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Slightly butter.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 I mean, do you ride on yak butter?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Well, according to Bettina, my auntie, she said that it would be used in place of, say, blue tack.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 So I guess, like, yak tack.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 What?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 And blue yak.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Blue yak, sorry.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Do they use it medicinally?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 They use it as moisturizer.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Yeah, and they also, my auntie said people used to use it and she did as well as a barrier because the winds would be so painfully cold as they were hitting your face.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 That it was a sort of, like, masking device to stop the cold wind from something like a balaclava.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 It's like a moisturiser balaclava.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Sometimes though, a lot of a slice of bread will blow into your face and I'll just stick that.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 And then if another one hates you to go away.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Turn into a sandwich.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 They use it for their main tea as well.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Yak butter tea is traditional drinks.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Is it nice?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 I didn't have it when I was up there.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 I think I've had butter tea.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Is it for mint?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 I'm sure there's some fermenting process that goes on.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Yeah.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 And then they do the rancid or a bit.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Well, they put yak poo in it because the way they do, they do.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Because the way they get the tea is off a block of tea.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 What they do, they give you some yak butter tea and they go, "Would you like poo with that?"

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Or just half a poo.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 But we're the same because I always, when I have a cavity, I put a bit of a cow manure in there.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Yeah, it's a bit.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 What it says is that to bind the tea particles together because they will be...

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Shopping, scraping the tea off a compressed block of tea and it would be all bitty in too much.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 It feels like your auntie is setting you up for a really good practical joke when you go there.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 She gave me so much information.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 And she said as well, by the way, her name, Bettina, is an anagram of Tibetan.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Which is quite a cool.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Yeah, and she said just yesterday, they moved house.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 They have a folding table that they had in Tibet when they were living there.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 And they haven't unpacked it for many years.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 It still smells of yak butter.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Wow.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Because they used to just have blobs of it on there.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 I don't know why.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 So Bossa has been used medicinally in the past, hasn't it?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 And they used to think I was reading this in a book called A History of Food.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 And it didn't give a specific day, it just said until quite recently.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 It was thought that if you put a pot of butter next to a sick person, it would absorb their disease.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 And they would recover.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 You do get people putting butter on bruises.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 That's a thing.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Is it?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Yeah.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 The ancient Egyptians used it.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Okay.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 They would put a bit of butter on a bruise with some powdered mummy.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Really?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Yeah.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Why were they using powdered mummy?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 I think they just had a lot of mummy to use up.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Right.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 I've got so much rhizmary, but we'll have rhizmary and everything.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 I was reading an article by the interviewed Elaine Kasrova, who's a historian of butter.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 And she thinks that it was like a magical, holy thing, because no one really knew how it was made.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 So I mean, so you would get some milk and you put it in some animal skin or something like that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And then the right kind of bacteria would have to be there for it to churn and turn into butter.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 But quite often it wouldn't work.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 And people wouldn't know why it wasn't working.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 And so sometimes it works, sometimes it didn't.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 And they thought it was magical for that reason.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Oh, really?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Oh, well, that's so in Iceland.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 I think the Icelandic people used to pray to the god of blacksmiths for better butter,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 because in a similar way they didn't know how it was made and they thought it was like gold.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Because it just had that gold, goldy shine.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 And so they thought, let's pray to the guys responsible for metal because he'll sort out our butter shortages.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 I can't believe it's not better.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Yeah, you're really pushing this joke.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Do you want it to be a surprise to one of these moments?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Do you know where else they have the big butter statuary industry is?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Massive in America?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 You know, I didn't know about this.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 No, I don't know about this.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 And everyone in America watching this will know absolutely about it.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Butter is huge.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Butter statues.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 Oh, butter statues.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Sorry, right.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Stay farms and state fairs and things.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 And they always have massive butter sculptures.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 And they had, well, there's one woman who just recently retired.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 She did it for 50 years in Iowa every year.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 She just made it cow out of butter.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Cool.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 And they really used the butter as well.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Would you want to eat or for mass statues?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 No, not all of it.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 For mass statues.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Really?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 In between.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 So they don't have to use another, you know.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 It's not.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 100 kilos of butter to make her cow.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Well, it started in the 1800s in America where they would make things,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 not just out of butter, but out of lots of foodstuffs.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 So they were making loads and loads of foods because the land was so good for growing.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 And there was one where they have this thing called serial architecture,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 where someone made a palace out of corn and grass and stuff like that.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 They made a Liberty Bell out of oranges.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 And they made a life-size night out of prunes.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 It's not a weird childhood fantasy world.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 I think it's to kind of show up that they've got all this amazing, all these truths.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Yeah. We've got so many prunes. We can waste some of them by making them into a night.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Yeah.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Yeah, because the person who started it, I think, was a woman called Caroline Short Brooks,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 who was this really famous sculptor in America.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 And so she displayed her sculptures at the world fair.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 She has this one called Dreaming Eye Length,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 which if you look it up, it's really beautiful.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 How did she get them to the world fair?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Which she's sculpted down there.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Or she's got them there. And the problem was, she wanted to use her kind of butter.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And she had to get it all the way to Europe, because welfare was in Paris, I think.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 But the problem was, she couldn't keep it cool.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 So she didn't find a boat with enough ice in it.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Yeah. So she eventually found one that took her ages.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 She got it onto this boat, got all the butter over,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 like a hundred kilos of butter, got there, and the welfare had already finished.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 No!

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Oh!

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 I thought you said she showed it at the world fair.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 It must have been enough. It was a different one.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Did it go off?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Yeah, the fair.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 It's not the butter that she had once she.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Well, I don't know what they did with it once she got there.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 I can't believe it's not bitter.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Anyway.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 You know, yak milk should actually be called neck milk.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Why is that?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Because the yak is a male.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Yeah.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 The neck is the female.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Really?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 You can't milk a yak.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 You can't milk a yak.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 No, you can't.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 No, you can't.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 But if you think you've milked a yak, that's not milk.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 You can't.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 That's not milk.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 You can prank.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 Time for fact number two.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 And that is my fact.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 My fact this week is that you can email any one of the 70,000 trees in Melbourne, Australia.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Okay.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Cool.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 An individual email to anyone of those 70,000 trees.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Have you done so?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 I have not.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 No.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 I'd rather think you should have done.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Well, what have people had though?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 So what happens is this was a project that was set up in 2013.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 The idea was that every single tree got its own ID number because they wanted to.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 If you lived near this tree and you sought being vandalised or you saw that it was in any way dying,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 you could report this tree by sending an email to the tree and then someone would pick it up.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Report the tree.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 It just sounds like the tree is in trouble.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 I just don't think it's in trouble.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Well, yeah.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Do they call it tree mail or?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 They should do, yeah.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 But as far as I know, they don't.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 No.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 And this is a project called the Urban Forest Visual Project.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And they set this up back in 2013.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 So instead of calling it tree mail, they called it what?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 The Urban Forest Visual Project.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 I think they need some help with driving.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 They set it up.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 It was set up back in, I believe, 2013.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 So it's been around for a long time and what ends up happening is very occasionally someone from a big newspaper or a big online magazine finds out about this.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 And then they write an article and then people start flooding the trees with emails.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 But how do they deliver the emails to the trees?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 They print them out.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 That's pretty messed up.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 That's like sending to the tree.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Yeah.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 That's like sending, like getting a ransom and sending someone their friends body part and writing the ransom notes on that one.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 It's like getting a flamm of skin saying hello, I think your grade is not it.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Yeah.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 If you all skip.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Well, but then that's isn't it like trying to heal a bruise by dropping some powdered you on it.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Yeah.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Like some mummies.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Yeah, you're right.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 No, we don't always got through.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 Yeah.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 But yeah, so the idea is that you have this individual ID number and people do send them emails.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 There's one that was, that says my dearest almost as I was leaving some Mary's college today.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 I was struck not by a branch, but by your radiant beauty.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 You must get these messages all the time.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 You're such an attractive tree.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 That's a bit creepy, though.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 That's a bit odd, yeah.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 If I got that email and they substituted tree for human, I think I'd be pretty creeped out actually.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 And imagine how true that you be if you were literally rooted into the ground.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 So you can't even run away.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 That's a good point.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Can you get a restraining order as a tree?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Because I think they should invest in some of those.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Well, maybe they do.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Or maybe maybe the restraining order is against someone who's graffiti the tree.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Yeah.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 Imagine if someone came up and wrote a letter on your body when you never even met them.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Imagine if someone tattooed into you that they liked somebody else.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Yeah.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 I've got a tattoo on my shoulder saying, "Daddy, four ever, four ever."

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 But then also, you could go even further and say, "Imagine if someone took your body, pulped it up, added water, squashed it down,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 and they got a pen and wrote a letter on you, and then sent it through the post."

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 Yeah, that'd be pretty creepy, doesn't it?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 I'd be happy that I'd had a new life as a different form.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 It's like being reincarnated, isn't it?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Every tree is reincarnated.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 There's a book.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 There's a book.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 That you can look at it that way.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 Well, I think that you get reincarnated as a corpse.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 No, but I don't get used as a corpse.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 I think you need to be used in order for it to be reincarnation, don't you?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 If you were used today, I thought it was that you'd come back to life.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 I thought that was the whole point, reincarnation.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Yeah, it is.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 There is a use applied to the body.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Because if you donate your skeleton to medical science and they use it in classrooms and universities...

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 I've been reincarnated as a teaching assistant.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 But these trees have been mainly getting non-helpful environmental emails and just love letters from people, haven't they?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 They have, yeah.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Or really a self-involved letters.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 So there was one thing that's supposed to be about the trees, but someone wrote Dear Greenleaf Elm.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 I have exams coming up and I should be busy studying.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 You do not have exams because you're a tree.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 I don't think there's much more to talk about as we don't have a lot in common.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 You being a tree in search.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 But I'm glad we're in this together.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Cheers.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 F, she signed off.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 And then a few days later, another email came through.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Well, sorry, when she did F, do you think that's what she actually got in her exams?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Well, someone else did things that all the time.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Sorry.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 She hadn't got the exam results yet, obviously, because she was still taking the exams.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 But she did then send a follow-up saying, "Hello, Greenleaf Elm, it's me again," brackets F.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 I just got my marks for last semester back on a definitely completely unrelated note.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 How do you deal with the constant relentlessly-sold crushing pain of disappointment after disappointment

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 that characterizes our life on Earth?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 You must be very old, right?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 So I thought you might know.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Yeah.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 So I think maybe she did get an F?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Yeah, that sounds like it.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Sounds like it.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 For the figure.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 Sorry.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Well, I just think she's got a very high opinion of herself.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 If she thinks she's the only person in the world with an F as an initial.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 Do you remember me?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 F.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Yeah.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Probably the old person who's every email you about.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 You're right.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 These dreams are popular.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 They do.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Or the popular.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Oh.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Yeah.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Come on.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 That was strong.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 They do write back sometimes.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 To me.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Yeah.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 So someone wrote, well, I'll refer you to the Guardian.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 The Guardian wrote to Ginkgo Maiden, actually, in Fitzroy Gardens.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 And it replied, saying, dear Oliver, thank you for your lovely words.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 I am very well.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Enjoy your day.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 You're sincerely three, one, four, four, one, seven, two, four.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Well, that is going against council regulations, actually,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 because the guy who called Mr Woods, who's running this cafe.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Absolutely.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 He's called Mr Woods.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 That's great.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 You got a problem with that?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 No.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 That's astonishing.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 I wrote that down.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Didn't know.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Thank you.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 So whenever you try to visit him in his office, you can't see him through all the trees.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 So Mr Woods said that while these emails are highly amusing,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 the team remains vigilant in making sure they only reply to authentic requests.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Oh, really?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Which I was like, that wasn't.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Because as you said, the whole point of this project was that it would be no cost to the council.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 So they can't be wasting taxpayer's money spending their entire time replying to these males.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Well, that's true.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 I've got an example here where someone wrote a Willow Leaf Peppermint tree.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 ID1357982.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 So hello, Mr Willow Leaf Peppermint.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Or should I say Mrs Willow Leaf Peppermint?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Do trees have genders?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Regardless.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 The tree wrote back, selling, hello.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 I am not a Mr or Mrs as I have what's called perfect flowers.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 It includes both genders in my flower structure.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 Kind regard, Mr and Mrs Willow Leaf Peppermint.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Right.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 So they do send back stuff about education.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 It's not the whole point of this, then. It's an educational tool.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 No, I think maybe the replies will be, but it's genuinely for the fact that they want to use citizen reporters

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 for the maintenance of where.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 So actually all is.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 And most of the trees in Melbourne are going to die of old age over the next 20 years also, about 40%.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 And so they need to replace them and maintain them on the ones they've got quite carefully.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 So what you do is they have a map and it shows all the trees in Melbourne.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 So if you're walking through Melbourne and you see a tree that's damaged and you click on the icon,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 all it does is it sends an email to the council and the subject line is information about tree.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 That's what I said.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 And they're all the little icons are either red, amber or green, aren't they?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 And the red ones are the ones that are going to die soon.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Oh, really?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Yeah.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Because the Atlantic article I read about this story said that this is obviously ways for people to sort of get you invested

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 in things in your country or in your city that have problems in Hawaii.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 They have tsunami sirens and they have an adoptive siren thing.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 So you go to a map, you see where you live next to one.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Do you get a send a photo of it every Christmas?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Yeah, exactly the same.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Doing so well, still flashing.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Yeah, but you go, you test it and stuff.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 You have to sort of be responsible to make sure that the maintenance of it is still okay.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 I thought you didn't have to.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 I looked on the website and said if you choose to, it's called adoptive thing.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Right.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 And they say if you choose to adopt a thing, you're under no obligation and have no responsibility

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 to actually report problems with the thing.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 Wait, so what are you doing for it?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 I think you just give a bit of money.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Just give money, right?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 You get to say, you get to say in parties I adopted a tsunami warning.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 Yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 But the thing is, not if the place gets hit and you didn't give a warning.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 That's true.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Yeah, then you're kind of...

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Well, it's not that you have to give the warning.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 I guess you're relying on the sirens.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 It's not like a job smart way.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 You go and stand on the coast looking worried.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 The siren goes to the party.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 What's your name?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Ah!

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 So, on an album of objects.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Yeah.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 And sort of personifying them and getting into contact with them.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 There has been a study done recently which shows that if you are lonely,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 you're more likely to see an album of objects as being human-like.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Oh.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 You'll start a Halloween question or whatever.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 All right.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 But these microphones really do very closely resemble a beautiful man.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 I think. Don't you think?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Sure.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 I think they're beautiful, man.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Is it that you're lonely so you make inanimate objects more human?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Or is it that you're the kind of person who makes inanimate objects human?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 And so you're automatically a loner?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Well, I was asking my fridge about this the other day.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 No, I think it's that if you don't have human relationships,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 you're more likely to name your mugs.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 But what I'm saying is it's possible that it's the other way around.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Well, that it's just self-perpetuating, I guess.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 So once you do that, you get stuck in a cycle, don't you?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 It's not what makes you don't need people anymore.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 I mean, it is obviously a thing, isn't it?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 We can cast away with Wilson, the volleyball.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Oh, yeah, remember?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Yes.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 It's exactly like that.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 If he had been there with 50 or 60 other people,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 he probably wouldn't have done the volleyball thing.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 That would have been, and then he would have been a real weirdo in that film

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 if he had painted the best of the volleyball.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 But then, weirdly, he probably would have been outcast from the society

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 and then he would need it to sanitise the volleyball.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 You're right.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 I wonder what Teddy's for, because I'm very close to my Teddy's.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Maybe close to the name to most people,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 but I don't think that counts me as that I can person.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Well, you wouldn't think that, would you?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 But then people like me would think, yes, that is weird.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Well, I think you're weird.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 For liking women.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Okay, so I guess we all have our own weird friend elections.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 You don't need to get judgmental.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Well, my wife is definitely a real person.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Oh, you've thought that for years, haven't you?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 It's time to break the news to you.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 She's just a coat rack.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Yeah, that's a bit hard one.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 I mean, she does wear coats very well.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Did you know that in 1800s, then, a lot of Americans lived in trees?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Did they?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Yeah, it's in three house trees.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 No, inside trees.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 Inside trees?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Yeah.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 I'd say that's technically still a tree house.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Oh, yeah, it's true.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 I suppose it is, but they need to rebrand themselves, actually.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Well, they did, and they call themselves "stomp houses".

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Well, the houses didn't call themselves that.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 They didn't call themselves anything.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 They're just stomps.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Well, I actually think they have a bit of humanity to them.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Actually, they had, because they turned them into houses.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 So, you know, houses look like a face,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 because the windows at the top and then...

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 I don't know.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 I can assume that, but then I'm not lonely.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 Okay.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 You've got your clothes right, haven't you?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 Sorry about that, Paulina.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 She doesn't listen.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 She's not real.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 So, in the 19th century, there was a lot of logging in America,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 up in the northwest, up in Oregon and Washington, and then into Canada,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 and people would leave the stumps of the trees that they were logging,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 because they're not that useful, because the grains really aren't even in the stumps, I think.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 And then, a lot of people were immigrating to these places at the same time,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 and they would kind of turn the stumps into homes, because it was very cheap.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 So, some people lived inside tree stumps, or they turned them into storage shed,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 so they became chicken houses or pig pens.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Sometimes, they'd modify them and make them into dance floors apparently,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 and they'd have stomp dances.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Yeah, could you get a big tree stump?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 They'd flatten it out.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 They are absolutely massive, aren't they?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Yeah.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Which trees are these?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 They'll be like redwoods.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Yes, all right.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Clio's, they'll be really big here.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 You know, ants farm in trees, and have been doing so for many thousands of years.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 What do they farm?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 But proper farming.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 And proper cows.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 Tractors and stuff.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 Wow.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 So, they plant, they farm fruit crops.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 So, they farm different kinds of fruit, and basically they plant the seeds.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 So, they'll be like a fungus or a fruit crop growing out of the slits and trees,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 or the slits in bark, and they'll take that, and they'll plant it,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 and insert it up further up the tree, and then they'll pull on it to fertilise it,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 and then it grows, and it fruits.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Like farmers do.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 Like farmers.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 They always put them on their crops.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 And as the plants grow, they form these big hollow structures that the ants live in,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 so they're kind of turning their farm also into their farm house,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 and they can eat it as well, and then when it creates more seeds,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 and they take these seeds, and they go and plant them further up the tree,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 and they have this permanently self-fulfilling farm that they run up trees.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 It's very cool.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 I do know a fact about farmers' bottoms.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 Yeah, gone.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 There used to be a thing where to test whether the ground was ready for you to plant your seeds,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 you'd take down your trousers, and you'd put your bum on the ground,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 and if it was too cold, then you wouldn't plant the seeds.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 But if it's warm enough, then the ground was soft enough, and you could plant the seeds.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 If only other bits of the body could scent temperature.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 But it's a bit like kind of gauging the temperature of a child's bath by putting your elbow in.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 It's exactly like that.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 It's not exactly like that.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 No, because you wouldn't gave the child the child the child's bath.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 It's like when I dip my ass in my tea to save as warm enough.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 I know, yak dog for me.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 I brought my own.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 I've just got one thing on emails.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 There were team of scientists since South Carolina,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 who did a test they went through two million emails in people's Yahoo inboxes.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 Don't know how they got access to it.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 I'm getting mad.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 But they looked at the number of words that people sent through their emails per year,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 and it equates to basically writing a book.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Everyone, if they use--

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 It's not a good book.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 It's a terrible book.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 But yeah, roughly 41,368 words is what they said that we...

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 That's a short book.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 It's a short book.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 It's a short book.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 It's a Mr. Man book.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 That's not a Mr. Man book.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 It's a bit longer than Mr. Man book.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 So if you're not worth it.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the world's hottest chili is not meant to be eaten.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 It's meant to be used as an aesthetic.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 Mmm.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Is it like one of those fable things where it's like,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 "Oh, my arm really hurts."

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 And then someone stamps on your foot and you're like...

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 It's actual-- it can numb you, basically.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 It's incredibly, incredibly strong.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 The idea is if you're allergic to normal anesthetics,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 then you could maybe be able to use this kind of thing.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 If you were to dentist, it would only anesthetize the small amount around your tooth.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Oh, wow.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 So it wouldn't hit the muscles.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 It would only be the pain receptors.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 So it means that you wouldn't have that kind of thing where you can't talk properly.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 Do they turn into a gas or--

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Or is that what they're working on?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 They're still working on it.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Right.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 It would be a chemical, so I suppose they would inject it.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Yes.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 So how is it?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Because obviously, usually what Charlie does is it ignites your pain receptors.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 It's not even a taste capsicin.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Yeah.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Is something which makes you feel pain.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 But yeah, this is numbing pain.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Yes.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Explain that, James.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Explain that, James.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 I don't know exactly how that works.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 But the way that capsacin works is there's a channel called TRPV1.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 And that normally is a heat channel.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Oh, sorry.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 Okay.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 A lot of TV channels.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Not TV channels.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 It's normally a heat channel, and the body is tricked into thinking that it's hot when actually it's kind of spicing.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Yeah.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 Yeah.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 It's so weird.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 It's not hot at all.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 It's not hot at all.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 No.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 So this, uh, chili, ever.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Yes.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 It's called Dragon's Breath.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 It's called Dragon's Breath here.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And on this scale that they have called the Scoville scale, it scores 2.48 million, which is extremely high.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Yeah.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 So what that means is because they do the scale by how much diluting it needs.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 So if it's got 40 on the Scoville scale, if you dilute it 40 times, you will no longer be able to detect it.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 If you've got one drop of this stuff and 40 drops of water, you can't taste anymore.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 So this would need 2.48 million drops, and even then you could still just about taste it.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 Wow.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 And so it works out how much that is in natural water.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 It's half a bath tub full of water.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 Wow.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 That's really one drop.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 One drop into half a bath tub of water.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 That's how much you would only just stop noticing.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 That means we're effectively well like sharks.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 Yes.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 It does.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 If there was an animal that had chili sauce instead of blood.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Yeah.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 And it was bleeding and we were sweating a lot.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 And we'd be able to detect them.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Wow.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 And then attack them.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Does that mean if you drank one cup, let's say you put the chili into the water.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Yeah.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 Does it go across the body of the water as if I got a cup full away from the bath and I drank it.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 I think so.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 Yeah.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 I mean, maybe you'd have to.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 You'd have to stir it around.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Yeah, if you stir it, it might start.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 If you just put it in at that end, then it'd be quite easy.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 Yeah.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 It's a bit like homeopathic chili, this, isn't it?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Yeah.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 It's amazing.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 This is called Wilbur Scoville, who developed that.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 Yes.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 That's right.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 You developed the scale, not the chili pepper.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 Yeah.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 So this is now officially according to Guinness World Records, the hottest chili in the world.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 And it's taken it away from the previous World Record holder, which was called the Carolina Reaper.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 And the Carolina Reaper held it for quite a long time.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 It was developed and bred.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 So I think some of these hottest chilies are all part of a breeding plan.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 And so the, yeah, Carolina Reaper was made by a guy called Ed Curry.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 No.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Yeah.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 Curry developed it.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 And they did a thing.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 He did an anniversary eating of one.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 They threw a celebration for it.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 So he just ate one raw.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 And his quote, as he was eating it, sort of started normal.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 And then he started going bright red.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 His face, they say, was blood red.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 His eyes were watering.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 His quote has a lot of dot, dot, dots.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 So he got, I'm losing the ability to talk.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Wow.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 That's his official quote from his anniversary of the Carolina Reaper.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 It can make you lose, can't it?

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 Yeah.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Or it did.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 There was a guy called Ian Rothwell, who in 2013 became the first person to eat a whole plate

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 of the world's hottest curry.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 It's called The Widower.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 The reason he did it, he's a doctor.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 So maybe he shouldn't know better.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 But the reason he did it was that he's a doctor.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Because he hated all of his underpants.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 He didn't wear all of his underpants in one go.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 I bet you I would.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Do you not take your underpants down when you go to the toilet there?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Absolutely not, don't be disgusting.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Do you want to ruin that toilet?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 So this guy, his motivation was that his daughter, Alice, brought a boyfriend.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 And the boyfriend told was relating this story about him and his friends had tried this curry.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 And they couldn't get through more than a couple of bites.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 And the dad was obviously trying to impress this boyfriend.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 So it was like, I bet I can do that.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 And he did it.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 And he actually said it was okay.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 So he said, he had to take a short break halfway through because he felt really sweaty.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 And he did start hallucinating.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 And people told him he started to hallucinating.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Because he obviously can't remember it.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 But aside from a few tears in his eyes and a short period of hallucinating,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 he was cool and collected and seemed to cope very well.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 I thought, was this not the guy who went for a walk halfway through and started weeping

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 and stuff like that, was that him?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 He went for a walk halfway through because his eyes were watering.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 But I don't think he was crying with sadness.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 He was just crying.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 He was probably crying with joy about how impressed it was.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 I can kind of understand that because when I first met my father-in-law,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 who's Russian, he basically, we ended up drinking a lot of vodka,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 which was almost like an intensive vodka.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 But did he say, I bet I could drink those three bottles of vodka.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 You just wait, Sunny.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 There was an implication there, I think, which was because in Russia and probably everywhere,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 if you have a shot of vodka and you're doing it in a social way,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 it's basically, I'm down in mind, you're down in yours kind of thing.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 And then it's another one.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 And then it's another one.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 And then it's another one.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 And then next thing I knew I was invading Ukraine.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 You guys are so drunk, you're stuck.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Paulina, for a hat stand.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 So the weird thing, right, is that birds don't have any problem-seating chillies.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 The loads of chillies, often really hot ones, they're fine.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 They don't panic, they don't lose hands, they don't lose hands.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 They don't cry.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 My son-in-law must be really impressed by that.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 [laughter]

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 It's probably a bird one.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 [laughter]

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 So birds hate it.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 And birds find, but mammals hate them, right?

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 They do.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 And obviously humans have developed the ability to think, well, actually I do quite like it.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 But the theory is that the plants are using birds.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Because the birds, the seeds go through them really fast.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 And the birds poo them out and they spread the seed.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 And it spreads the plant.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 Whereas mammals have digestive juices which destroy the seeds.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 So the plant has developed seeds and, you know, little fibers and things.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 Which, it's not all the key.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 But birds don't.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Yeah.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 And maybe humans, they do it so humans like it so that humans cultivate them.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 Yeah.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 I found a couple of spiciest foods and drinks that use chilli in them.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 Yeah.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 I found a bottle of vodka.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 So they use a chilli, which is the Naga Yolokia chillies.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Have you heard of those?

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 I've heard of the Naga ones because that's from Naga and Indira, isn't it?

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Right.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 I think of the ones that, yes, I think they're from Asam and they were the hottest chilli until 2007.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 Yeah.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 And they're a genuine hottest chilli like they've been using cooking for hundreds of years.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Yes, exactly, yes.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 So they use that in a vodka.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 And they on the Scoville scale are 250,000.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 So they're quite far down from your hottest hottest ones these days.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 Which were in the millions, I believe?

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Yeah.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 It's quite interesting, actually, because it's been really good for Indian farmers.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Because they've got that books from the Guinness World Records.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 And so, suddenly lots of people were ordering in.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 It's quite expensive.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 And also now they're using it in crowd control.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 So they've started making the chilli into a spray.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 And they also farmers use it to repel elephants.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Because elephants aren't birds, they're mammals, so they don't like it.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Right.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 And so, actually, a lot of Asam scholars.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 I once very not.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Yeah.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 A elephant.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 Dumbbell.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 I was wondering if he might like chilli.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 God, who knows?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 He's really on the cast business.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Because if you think about it, he could probably pollinate quite a lot of.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 What?

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Or you could spread seeds, couldn't he?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Very effectively.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Because they poo a lot, don't they?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 Yeah, they do.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 So what Dumbbell was about him spreading chilli seeds?

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 I've not seen it, but yeah.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 Yeah.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 You've not seen Dumbbell.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 Dumbbell.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 Great.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 Anyway, that's very cool.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 So, yet, being used by the police?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Wow.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Yeah, because pepper spray is effectively chilli, isn't it?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 Yeah.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 But that bloke, that doctor trolling presses daughter's boyfriend.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Just wait till you see flies to India, gets involved in a riot.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 Simon, are you watching?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Maybe if he got shot by an arrow by the Aztecs,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 because they used to put chilli on the end of their arrows.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 I read that the Aztecs used to throw chilies at their enemies,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 and I thought that can't possibly be right.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 Apparently Japanese ninjas did.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 To throw chilies, but chilli powder.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 Yes.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Okay, that makes sense.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 So if you're close up, might be.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 A lot.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 Because I thought it wouldn't be impossible to get the chilli into someone's mouth from a distance.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Yeah.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 It's possible to throw a multiser into someone's mouth from a distance.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 But don't they have to be compliant?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 So you have to say to your enemy, it's just a multiser.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 Before the battle, can we take part in a traditional ritual of see

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 if you can get the multiser into the enemy's mouth?

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 My fact is that one of Napoleon's admirals lost three legs in battle.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Was he an animal?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Was he an animal?

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Sometimes people give naval ranks to animals.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 He was a spider.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 So he was still able to lead a full filling career.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 He really noticed.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 What a...

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 What's his story?

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 His name was Georges René Lepellet Lepletheu.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 And he was a French Admiral.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 And he lost his right leg at a battle.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 And then he lost his wooden leg in another battle.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 And then he lost his replacement wooden leg in another battle.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 So, did you lose anything else?

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 No, I think it was very...

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Imagine you're lucky.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 That's like bowling.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Well, it's not lucky to lose your first leg.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 No, the next two are lucky.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 Yes, true.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 And for a while, he spent his time sailing around in a ship called the Brilliant.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 That's so cool.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 That's awesome.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 That is good.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 That's very good.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 I should say this fact was originally tweeted by Uncle Peter Campbell

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 and was sent in by Ryan Goodman.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 So thank you to both of those guys.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Another person to lose their leg in the very same battle was Lord Uxbridge.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Quite famously lost it.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 I think it's in Britain, so as I'm not...

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 I didn't grow up here.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 I don't know if this is a famous encounter.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 But when he was talking to the Duke Wellington,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 as soon as...

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 And he lost it by Campbell as well.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 There's a line where he says, "By God, sir, I've lost my leg."

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 And then the Duke Wellington says, "By God, sir, so you have."

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 And apparently that's a thing that's taught in schools here.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Did you guys...

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Have you heard that before?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 I've heard it before, but not in school.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 It's not a school's thing.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 It's just an example of great British...

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 British, yeah.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 ...restraint and stiff upper lip that blatantly didn't happen.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 Exactly.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 ...in history.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 And he actually did something that seemed to be quite common.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 He buried his leg.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Or his leg was buried in the garden where it was cut off

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 and a little tombstone was erected, wasn't it?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 Yeah.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 And that seemed to be quite a common thing.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 So a few people did this.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 It's said that that's where the original inspiration for one foot in the grave came from.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Yeah, that's obviously not true.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 Pretty sure that would be when you're in the grave,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 both your feet are in there, so you're almost in there.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Yes.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 But why...no, but you'd say both feet are in all my body and stuff in the grave.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Right.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 When you are there.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 So it makes sense to say one foot in the grave.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 If it's if you buried your leg, yeah.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Yeah.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 But then why not one leg in the grave?

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 That's a very good point.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Yeah.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 I'll have a chat with myself about the original stuff.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 Not later, but they did.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 There wasn't things, so they got in a big row basically over the leg because the family who owned the house

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 where the leg had been left and buried made a little living from displaying it to people and choking the ramp.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 And then, 60 years later, his son visited the house.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 He thought I would visit my father's leg.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 And he was horrified to discover supposedly that it was sticking out of the ground

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 because it had been unearthed by a stalker.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 Wow.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 A really bad name.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Wow.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Like, foot up.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 But I can't quite believe it.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 You're kind of hoping it's a foot up, don't you?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 Yeah.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Like, the foot at least would be.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 Yeah.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 That's true, isn't it?

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 It's closed.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 And that's where the phrase one foot out of the grave originated from.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 The sequel.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 He said, right, I want that my father's leg back because he really made a hash of looking after it.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 So I got it.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 And they said, no, we want compensation.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 And they didn't let him have it.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 And there was a, you know, there was an am pass between them.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 And then eventually, they just kept hold of it.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 And then in 1932, supposedly, they burned it.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 They burned it.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 What?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 They never get hold of it out of spite.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 I don't know.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 I don't think so because that was even like 60 years after, even the initial route.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 Wow.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 Which was 60 years after that.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 But you're just burning bone, right?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 Can you burn bone?

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 I don't know.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 I don't know.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 That's the story.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 Do we know why they did that?

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Like, as in, obviously, they were, I can see what we're saying.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 They're doing grand gestures towards the legs.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 But why did people bury their...

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 I think it was partly because it was to show how important they are and this thing is so vital.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 And also because it was quite a mark of pride in the 19th century, I think,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 during Civil War and the Revolutionary Wars, if you lost the leg, that showed you're really mad.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 So it was more for veterans of war, as opposed to...

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 It was never a big thing.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 It was never a big thing.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 Oh, okay.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 It's just a handle, okay?

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 Yeah, because you were celebrating the end of your leg.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 It's where the word "legend" comes from, legend.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 Yeah.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 That is true.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Yeah.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 Is it?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 Yeah, well, we'll leave you to work on that.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 So a little bit of googling after this snow, I know, we...

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 Oh, I so believe it.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 Do you know what...

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 So this is something that's very cool.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 Do you know why flamingos are so stable on one leg?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 Because you always see flamingos standing on one leg, don't you? Always.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 Yeah, you do.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 Yeah, you do.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Yeah, so...

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Is it because they're used to it?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 No.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Oh, because you would think, because they do it all the time.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 I mean, they are.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 I'm sure they are used to it.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 That's not the reason that they could...

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 Is it because they welded onto a platform?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Yeah, they're all law law law laws.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 Yeah.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 Yeah.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 No.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 No, it's not that.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 It's not that.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Okay, I'll tell you.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 So a couple of biologists, they're called Young Vuichang and Lena Tech.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 They studied this just now, right?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 And they were trying to work out one of the flamingos are so stable,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 or rather, how are they so stable?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Yeah.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 And they discovered this by writing to some zoos and doing experiments on flamingos.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 And they would put them on a little plate, right?

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 And they'd measure the forces that the flamingos put down on the plate.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Yeah.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 To see how it's adjusting.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 And then they wrote to another zoo, which had just had a couple of flamingos which had died.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 And they said, can we have your flamingos please?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 And then they propped the flamingo up on one leg, this dead flamingo.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 And they found that its leg locked perfectly, right?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 Just on one leg.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 And they're more stable on one leg than they are on two.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 Oh.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 Because when a flamingo stands on one leg, somehow all of its tendons slop right into place

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 and it can just stay like that for ages.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 Why couldn't they lock both legs directly in place?

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Yeah.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 And then stand extended.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 And this is the thing.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 So what's the advantage in only standing on one leg?

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 Sometimes they're standing in cold water and they may not want to lose heat through both legs.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 Isn't it, right?

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 Isn't it also that they don't want both feet to be frozen in ice?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 Sometimes they get frozen in ice.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 I've read that.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 I've also read once that they said that they have it so that there's fewer legs for fish to bash into.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 Yeah.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 And there's just no one telling which of these is more or less plausible.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 They're all very plausible.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 Like, say if you're in a battle and there are cannonballs flying everywhere and you're standing on one leg the whole time,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 then you're less likely to get your leg vulnerable.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 Got it.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 So it's not to stop the fish from hurting themselves.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 It's to stop their legs getting hard.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 Yeah, I think that's it.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 Yeah.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 Okay.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 I believe that one.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Okay.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 Yes.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 All right.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 I've got one last thing on Cannonball war and so this is not about legs.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 It's about hands.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 There's a guy who was a knight in Germany in the 1500s called Gotts.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 And we know them as Gotts of the Iron Hand.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 Have I told you about this guy?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 Yeah.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 Gotts of the Iron Hand was this badass knight who's amazing.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 And during battle, when he had originally both of his hands, there's two theories.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 One that a cannonball sound freaked him out, chopped him slightly and he lost control of his massive sword.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 And the sword went back and he chopped off his own hand.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 The second theory.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 Unlikely.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 Unlikely, the second theory is that a cannonball took it off.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 More likely.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 Yes.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 What happened is that they replaced his hand with a prosthetic hand which was made out of iron so he became Gotts of the Iron Hand.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Right.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 And it had sort of joints in it so that the knuckles could hold the stirrup of the horse that he was riding them could hold around the sword.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 And he was so famous that he published an autobiography and it was translated into a play by Gerta who wrote this whole play about Gotts of the Iron Hand,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 which is still published in Germany, very famous. And there's a line in it which is thought to be either real or just Gerta was inspired by his sort of badass nature,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 which is the most famous line in the whole play, which an English is translated as, "Tell him he can kiss my ass."

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 And that is still a slang put down in Germany today.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 So it's still a slang put down in Germany.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 As a direct derivative of Gotts of the Iron Hand.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 Tell him he can kiss my ass.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 So what is that we got kissed my ass from?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 It doesn't feel like it. I can't believe it's not Gotta.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 And the show.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:54.000
