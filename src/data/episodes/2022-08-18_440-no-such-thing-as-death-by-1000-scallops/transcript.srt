00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 Hi everybody, just to let you know we've got a very special guest on the podcast today

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,360
 to replace Dan Schreiber who was momentarily disappeared. And that guest is the fantastic

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,800
 Steve Mould, very much friend of the podcast, friend of QI. Actually I think has made an

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,200
 appearance on QI. He's science presenter and communicator extraordinaire, he's one third

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,640
 of the brilliant troop festival of the spoken nerd. Please do check out his work, go to his

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,640
 YouTube page, it's full of amazing, mind-blowing, bizarre, extraordinary science videos. It really

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,160
 is a great place to hang out online and definitely listen to the Festival of Spoken Nerds podcast

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,560
 which is called a podcast of unnecessary detail where they take subjects you might think are boring

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,840
 if you're a fool and show you that they are of course fascinating. It really is worth a listen

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:07,520
 and we had a great time having him on the show. Okay, here we go.

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,920
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Substance Thing is a Fish, a weekly podcast

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,800
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm joined this

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,680
 week by James Harkin, Anna Tajinski and it's our very special guest, Steve Mould. We have gathered

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,760
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:37,600
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Steve. My fact is that protons taste

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,600
 sour. How do you, like you can't get the cutlery small enough for that. How do you taste a proton?

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,400
 So actually every time you taste something sour you're tasting protons. Oh okay that's a slight,

18
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,520
 is that a different fact or the same fact? I would say it's the same fact.

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,440
 Steve doesn't everything have protons in it? Oh I see what you mean free protons, everything's got

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:09,520
 protons on their own. So you know you have five taste senses on your tongue, sweet, sour, salt,

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,640
 bitter and umami and your sour taste, it just works in a completely different way. So like your

22
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,160
 sweetness taste, it's the old lock and key thing, you've probably heard it a thousand times in biology.

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,880
 So just in case I've forgotten literally everything I learned. So you've got these

24
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,400
 gustatory cells on your tongue and on the surface of those cells you have these big molecules,

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,600
 complicated shapes, they're proteins with a complicated shape and that's the lock in this

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:49,040
 analogy and there's one molecule that fits perfectly, that's the key and in the case of your sweetness

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,920
 receptors it's the sugar molecule, it's glucose that fits perfectly and when they combine in that

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,840
 way it causes some chemical reaction to occur inside the cell and that leads to a signal going

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,920
 to your brain and you experience that as something sweet in your mouth. But when you taste something

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,720
 sour it's because you're tasting something acidic, so sour is just your like acidity detecting

31
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,520
 mechanism right and something is acidic if it has a high concentration of hydrogen ions.

32
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,640
 And if we've got all of our chemistry, can we get on to physics actually, I feel safe

33
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,080
 for ground there. Can we get on to literature? Well, Andrew, so what is hydrogen, you can

34
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,800
 tell me what hydrogen is. Hydrogen is, yeah, it's an element of a periodic table very early on.

35
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,800
 Is it element number one? It's the earliest one, so what's it made of then? Hydrogen.

36
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:52,400
 I mean what's inside? So it's made of an acid, so the molecule of hydrogen is one,

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,600
 it's the central bit. It's a neutron and an electron. No, I think it doesn't have a neutron,

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,160
 isn't it? The one without a neutron. Does every other molecule in reality have a

39
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,200
 neutron? I've got bad news for you, Andy, you're currently naked but the good news is you're asleep.

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:18,320
 So it's a proton within an electron orbiting around it. That means it's neutral, it's balanced.

41
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,080
 That's an atom. It's not a charged particle. Hey, what's another word for that?

42
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,680
 What a charged particle? It's called an ion, isn't it?

43
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:40,480
 Is this your card, sir? So to turn a hydrogen atom into a hydrogen ion, you strip away the

44
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:48,000
 electron. Okay, leaving just the proton. That's right. So a hydrogen ion really is just a proton.

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,720
 And that tastes sour. And that tastes sour. So when you're tasting an acid,

46
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,880
 it's because you're tasting protons in the liquid or in the food or whatever. And so these

47
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,080
 gestatory cells, instead of having like some complicated molecule, lock and key thing going on,

48
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,520
 it's just a hole and it's a special kind of hole in the cell that accepts protons. It's got a proton

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,480
 channel. So cool. Yeah, so bizarre. So it's not a special shape, it's not one of those like when

50
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,640
 you're a kid and you fit bricks into holes, it's not that perfect shape. It's just a big

51
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,320
 cavern and it accepts protons. It sounds like my tongue is like something from back to the future.

52
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:35,120
 It's like taking protons. Okay, right. So a few questions. Do electrons taste

53
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,280
 the opposite? As in, do we know what electrons taste like? Or do we have a receptor that

54
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,160
 reacts to that? If an electron falls into this hole?

55
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,080
 Well, electrons wouldn't fall into the hole. No. Oh, yeah. Interesting. There's your answer, Andy.

56
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,920
 I don't think we have receptors for electrons to my knowledge. I don't believe we do.

57
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,760
 We wouldn't taste of anything. Unless you like put some jam on them.

58
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,880
 Okay, question number two. Follow up question number two. What is the smallest number of protons

59
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,040
 that we would be able to taste? Because obviously they're tiny. Would you have to have 500 billion?

60
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,560
 If you just licked one hydrogen ion, it's not going to taste anything. Exactly.

61
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,200
 Yeah. So what happens is the concentration of protons in the cell builds up until it reaches

62
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,840
 some limit. And then it sends an electric signal to your brain. I don't know what that limit is.

63
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,360
 No further questions.

64
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:33,120
 What I find really interesting about this I was reading is that possibly sourness might be the

65
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,400
 earliest taste that any animal had. And the reason being that animals are living in the deep ocean

66
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,360
 and the danger in the deep ocean might be acidic stuff coming up and you want to get away from the

67
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,640
 acid. And so perhaps that we learned how to taste this sourness before we learned anything else

68
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,520
 because it would stop us from getting fried by the acid. That's so cool. Yeah, that'd be good,

69
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,880
 wouldn't it? Actually, the way I like to think about taste is those five taste senses that we have

70
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,320
 on our tongues, you can think about them as chemical detecting mechanisms that we've evolved

71
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,400
 for survival. So like sugar is really important because it's a source of energy. So it makes

72
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,240
 sense that we would evolve the ability to detect that. Bitteness is your poison detecting mechanism.

73
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,760
 And actually, there's a few different receptors for that because there are a few different poisons

74
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:28,720
 that we can detect. What's really interesting about the bitterness receptor is that it's

75
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,200
 really in flux, like an evolutionary point of view, because we're in an arms race with plants.

76
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,560
 Like plants don't want to be eaten, except for fruit, you know, they don't want to be eaten.

77
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,040
 Obviously, anthropomorphizing, we're allowed to anthropomorphize. Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank god.

78
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:52,000
 I draw faces on all my plants. So plants are producing poisons to stop us from eating plants,

79
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,480
 but then some plants are producing molecules that interact with our poison receptors, poison

80
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,240
 detecting receptors on our tongues. They're not actually poisonous, but we react to them and decide

81
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,120
 not to eat them because they taste bitter. Whereas with sourness, you like it naturally from birth.

82
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,560
 I mean, no one likes sour sweets more than kids. And yet sourness in a way denotes something's

83
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,800
 gone bad. Like if milk goes sour, that's bad. And that's disgusting to us. But then if certain

84
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
 fruits are sour, then that's really good. And it actually can show that they haven't gone rotten.

85
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
 Yes, that's I love that. So it's the sign that there's a particular kind of acid there is

86
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,520
 citric acid provides the sour flavor in fruits. And actually, those various acids prevent really

87
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,600
 harmful bacteria from growing, meaning that, you know, lots of primates will enjoy fruit that's

88
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,640
 slightly spoiled because it means that it's safer. That's why orange juice tastes bad after you've

89
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,800
 cleaned your teeth, because toothpaste tends to have sodium aryl sulfate in it, that binds

90
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,000
 to the sweetness receptors in your mouth and stops them from working. So when you have orange juice,

91
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,840
 then you can't taste the sweetness of the orange juice, you can only taste the bitterness and the

92
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:09,040
 sourness. And that's not so nice. Interesting. On sourness and children and stuff, those sour

93
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,520
 candies you can get. And they're basically the sweet candies, but then they put some acids on

94
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,160
 the outside. So they put like citric acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid on the outside.

95
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,600
 And they also have malic acid, which they put inside palm oil, which means it's like a slow

96
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,320
 release. So it kind of very slowly comes out. So the sourness kind of stays in your mouth for

97
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,000
 longer and longer. But the interesting thing about those candies is something called sour patch kid.

98
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,080
 You know that? I love sour patch kids. You love sour patch kids. I have some quite a lot of them.

99
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:50,320
 Okay, so the sour patch kid is also a medical term. Can you guess what the medical procedure

100
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,000
 is that is known as the sour patch kid? Is it, I do know this one, you coat the child in.

101
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,960
 And then you remove their appendix. It's kind of close.

102
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,920
 This kid is sour. The kid has gone sour. So the kid is covered in some kind of acid.

103
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,840
 You put one of those sour astro belts, like a patch on a blister or something.

104
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,200
 Yeah, yeah. And it's, it gives it. We can do this. We can do this. On a wart.

105
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,320
 I think. No, you can't do this. I mean, you're not going to get this in a million years.

106
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,640
 It's prolapsed anuses. Oh God. Wow. I think that might be something to do with what they look like.

107
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,560
 So I've eaten quite a lot of sour patch kids sweets in my time. Yeah, yeah.

108
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,200
 I don't think I've ever come across one. You're not saying there's a team of

109
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,880
 servants in the sour patch kids factory. They're occasionally pushing back in.

110
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:45,680
 It's just a nickname. Basically what happens is, if you have a prolapsed anus, sometimes to get it

111
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,480
 back in, you're basically your intestines have come out of your rectum. So to get it back in,

112
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,880
 you need to shrink. And one of the ways to do that is to remove some of the water from it.

113
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,040
 And one of the ways that they do that is to sprinkle some sugar on the prolapsed anus.

114
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,960
 And you put the sugar on and it kind of goes down slightly. And then you give it a little

115
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,640
 prod and it goes back inside. And the technique is sometimes known as the sour patch kid or

116
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:18,560
 otherwise sugaring the REM. That's I believe is in Mary Poppins. A spoonful of sugar helps the

117
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,800
 prolapsed anus go down. Why is it called sour when it's putting sugar in it? Do they

118
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,160
 put acid down on it? I think I don't know what sour patch kids look like. They're not relevant to

119
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,680
 this. Would it work as a home remedy if you've got a sour patch kid and used it? This is medical

120
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,280
 professionals do this. They're coated in sugar and especially at the end of the packet, there's

121
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,360
 that kind of fine dusting that's fallen off the original sweets. And that's obviously the best

122
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,560
 bit. Because they're quite glutinous, right? Yeah. And some of them red in colour. Some of them red.

123
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,840
 It could it be what they look like a bit like a sour patch kid? Do you know what? For the benefit

124
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,480
 of my future enjoyment of sour patch kids, maybe we could draw a line on this. Have you guys heard

125
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,800
 of Eli Metchnikov? You might have done actually. So he's a famous Russian biologist in the early

126
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,200
 20th century. He was working and he effectively launched the yoghurt craze in Western Europe.

127
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,160
 Yeah, this is on soundness. So he was especially interested in aging and the science of aging

128
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,600
 and also in the gut and digestion. And in 1904, he was in Paris and he delivered a lecture claiming

129
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,320
 that aging was partly caused by harmful bacteria in the gut and that you also had to eat foods like

130
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,720
 yoghurt to cultivate those friendly bacteria, beneficial bacteria. And he suggested that sour

131
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,760
 milk didn't spoil because of that lactic acid in it. So it sort of kills off the, you know,

132
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,560
 the really the rottenness germs. And he said hypothetically, maybe if that's happening in the

133
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,280
 lab to sour milk, the microbes might stop internal putrefaction in you and prevent aging. And this

134
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,440
 turned into a huge thing in Paris. Like there was this mad yoghurt rush basically, where people were

135
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,840
 rushing to shops and queuing up and saying, yoghurt is the thing that's going to keep us young. This

136
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,560
 was 1904. And he slightly clarified the next year, look, yoghurt is not the elixir of youth,

137
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,480
 but it was too late by that point. Everyone in Paris was covering themselves in yoghurt.

138
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,800
 The great yoghurting of 1905. And then John Harvey Kellogg, who, you know, the very famous

139
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,320
 dietician. Oh God, anything he latches on to, you know, it's going to go a bit weird.

140
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
 He started feeding each of his patients a pint of yoghurt. And I appreciate that's

141
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,480
 a useless, I don't know what time period. There was like a huge craze, wasn't there? And I think

142
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:42,640
 like one petty fallou went for 200,000 euros. That was the yoghurt bubble. Everyone was coated

143
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:54,320
 in yoghurt again. So, like, sweeteners, artificial sweeteners are tricking your sweetness receptors

144
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,600
 into thinking you've got sugar in your mouth when you haven't. And there are examples in

145
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,400
 nature of plants that have done that. So there's a berry in West Africa that has evolved the ability

146
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:11,600
 to make this molecule that binds really strongly to the sweetness receptors of primates. And they

147
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,360
 bind so strongly to those sweeteners receptors that they only have to make a few of them.

148
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,760
 They don't have to spend loads of energy making loads of glucose molecules. They just make a few

149
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,120
 of these trick molecules. And all these primates are going mad for these berries. They're running

150
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,280
 around eating them and they're getting no benefit from it. There's no energy content in it, but

151
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,840
 they're still going around then pooing out the seeds. So the berries get the benefit of having

152
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,960
 their seeds dispersed, but the primates don't get any benefit from it. And there's one gorilla

153
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:46,000
 that has evolved a slightly different sweetness receptor that isn't tricked by the berries molecule.

154
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,280
 And so they do a lot better because they're not running around chasing these berries anymore.

155
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,120
 Are they miracle berries? Are they? Is that what they're called?

156
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,400
 No, miracle berries is something different, actually. Miracle berries is something that binds

157
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:05,200
 to your sweetness receptor, but in an inactive way, it doesn't do anything. But then when you

158
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,480
 introduce an acid, it activates the molecule in such a way that it then stimulates your

159
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,840
 sweetness receptor. So you suck on a miracle berry, nothing happens, and then you drink something sour

160
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,120
 and it tastes sweet because that molecule then turns into something that can stimulate your

161
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,080
 sweetness receptor. Like that old rumor about uzo, where if you drunk uzo and then the next day

162
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,000
 you drunk water, then it would reactivate the uzo and get you drunk again. Is that a thing?

163
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,240
 Yeah, not a true science. If I had a miracle berry, then I brush my teeth.

164
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,400
 Then I had some orange juice. Could I make the orange juice taste sweet?

165
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,200
 You're a true scientist, Andy. I would say with questions like that.

166
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:54,400
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that

167
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,800
 fans of Indiana Jones guessed details of the fourth film's plot before it was released

168
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,760
 from the expressions on the faces of the tie-in Lego characters.

169
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,320
 Were the expressions like, "Oh, this is going to be shit."

170
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:18,560
 Oh, where's my agent when you need him? So this is Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal

171
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,440
 Skull, which is the fourth Indiana Jones film released in 2008. I saw it at midnight in the

172
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,080
 cinema on the first night. Good on you. You had all the figurines already, didn't you?

173
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,080
 I knew the whole lot, basically. Anyway, there were these Lego figures released,

174
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,920
 and there were these little translucent skeletons, and basically fans worked out,

175
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,480
 "Oh, there's an alien plot in the film," which there is because of the nature of the little

176
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,520
 translucent Lego skeletons, and they also worked out that Cape Blanchett was a baddie,

177
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,960
 and again, sorry spoilers. Did she have like a sad, like an angry face?

178
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,760
 Yeah, the Lego figurine is frowning, and they released the merch before the film came out,

179
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,840
 so fans were able to work it out, and as a result, the film was not well received. It was solely because

180
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,760
 of this Lego thing. I think on your head bit, as a fan, if you're overanalyzing the Lego to that

181
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,520
 extent, then you deserve that. Yeah, exactly. If you're a real fan, they make the merch way

182
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,520
 in advance, don't they? I have to sign it off and clear it and all of that. It's quite hard to

183
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,440
 keep things really secret. Although some withhold it, Star Wars now withhold some figurines to make

184
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,640
 sure that they don't give anything away. Because of what happened? Because of this terrible event.

185
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:32,480
 We all learn from the great mistakes, don't we? I think in one of the Star Wars films,

186
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,360
 again, this is going to be full of spoilers this episode.

187
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,600
 Only things released before the financial crisis fell in the air.

188
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,120
 There was a character called Ray, and the figurine was holding a lightsaber,

189
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,160
 which I believe gives away the fact that maybe she is a Jedi knight or master.

190
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,240
 You're not supposed to know that. And so they withheld that,

191
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,880
 smart Star Wars people, until the film had been released. And this is the thing I was most outraged.

192
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,360
 I was looking at a list of things that Lego revealed in films, and most of it was stuff like,

193
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:10,160
 "Come on, who cares?" But in the first Shrek film... You don't understand film nerds.

194
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,400
 What do you mean, who cares? There would literally be like, "Oh, this little thing revealed that there

195
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,840
 was a scene involving grass." Or "This revealed that there were three family members." Anyway,

196
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,360
 but in the first Shrek film, Burger King released tie-in meal toys, kids' meal toys,

197
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,200
 and there was a figurine, and I've seen it, and it has Fiona, the princess,

198
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,520
 and it has her normal head with lovely pretty face and ginger hair. And then,

199
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,120
 if you spun it round, it revealed her as an ogre. Now, as we all know, you don't learn that until

200
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,000
 the very end of the film. Yeah, that's a big twist. It is a big twist. I remember being very excited

201
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,080
 when I learned that. You haven't seen Shrek. No, no. Oh, I think you should. Should I? Yeah,

202
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,320
 it's a good one. Well, I've got a child, I probably will at some stage, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

203
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,720
 On Lego, one thing I found really interesting is that if you have an idea for a Lego set,

204
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,080
 they might make it for you. All you need is 10,000 supporters on Lego.com, however it is,

205
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,920
 and then if you get 10,000 people to like your idea, then they'll review the idea and possibly

206
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,800
 make it. That's great. So that's like the parliament thing, isn't it? If you get, or is it 100,000

207
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,480
 people you need to sign a petition? Yeah, it's so considered. Exactly. So they're not like, if we

208
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,920
 managed to get all of the fish fans to say we want to know six things of fish Lego,

209
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,120
 then it might get to a level, but they might just go, "Well, no, we're obviously not making one."

210
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,800
 Could we ask all fish fans to make, ask parliament to make a Lego of fish?

211
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,080
 We could get... Does parliament make Lego? No, but we could ask parliament to put pressure on Lego

212
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,840
 to make the fish. That feels like corruption of some sort. I don't like it. I feel like...

213
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,280
 Oh, there's no money involved. Apart from all the money we'll make from Lego.

214
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,920
 That's right, it's on this. No such thing as a fish Lego experience. It's going to be huge.

215
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,320
 Actually, there is money involved, because if it's your idea and you get 10,000 people and

216
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,640
 they make it, you get 1% of all the money that Lego makes out of it, which is quite costly.

217
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,160
 All right, let's do it. I can't wait for the no such things as a fish ride at Legoland.

218
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,440
 Listen to Dan explain a fact slowly and correctly.

219
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,640
 People in the front carriage may get covered in yoghurt.

220
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,440
 Don't forget to pack your anus because we're going to be pouring sugar all over it.

221
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,520
 So they've made a central perk from friends, but through this system.

222
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,120
 They've made a Seinfeld in general, like a Seinfeld Lego set. Oh, yeah.

223
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,600
 Yeah. And things that are not yet approved, but you can currently go on the Lego website

224
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,840
 and approve these if you like. A pirate dentist currently.

225
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,120
 A pirate dentist. I think they would go, say R.

226
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,160
 That's kind of a boat in a boat face kind of entry, isn't it? It's just this one gag that

227
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,440
 shouldn't really be. Yeah. The correlation of Charlemagne is currently there. Me.

228
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
 It's really going a long way from what kids want at this point, isn't it?

229
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,720
 But there are so many adult Lego fans and Lego makers.

230
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,640
 Afol. This is completely their fault. The reason that these stupid things happen

231
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,800
 where lots of sad adults, tens of thousands of sign these petitions for new Lego pieces.

232
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,280
 Okay, well, they might listen to podcast too, Anna, so.

233
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,800
 No, I do obviously think it's very cool, but it is Afol's and they were a huge deal

234
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,000
 and they used to get ignored. You're going to get a brickthread through your window,

235
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,720
 but it'll be a very tiny plastic one. Yeah, look out for that tiny, tiny window you've got in your flesh.

236
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,560
 A little Lego Seinfeld banging on the door.

237
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 No, they, so they, there have always been adult fans of Lego and they got more and more vocal

238
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,880
 up to the nineties and the early 2000s. And Lego, the company thought they were quite annoying and

239
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,680
 kept getting all these letters suggesting possible design ideas and actually put signs on their website

240
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,560
 and, you know, on their merchandise saying, we do not take ideas, unsolicited ideas.

241
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,160
 And, you know, if you speak to people who worked at Lego at the time, they'd say it was so irritating.

242
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,360
 Adults were taking an interest in Lego and it wasn't meant to be for adults.

243
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,880
 And then they almost went bankrupt because they started almost child defying Lego. So they'd,

244
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,480
 they'd sell sets that were kind of almost completely made that were just for the play

245
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,520
 element rather than the build element. 2003 Lego was in serious trouble and someone in the

246
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,480
 company said, guys, should we start listening to all these adult nerds and disposable income?

247
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,000
 They did disposable income and they created an Afol engagement team, the adult fans of Lego

248
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,680
 engagement team. Was there a kind of summit where they were trying to bring in the Afol,

249
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,360
 the Afols? Yeah, there was actually, well, they, Lego went to one of these unofficial Lego

250
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,280
 conventions and said, okay, guys, we'll start listening to you. That, I guess, that was their

251
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,520
 summit. That was their big peace agreement. Did they go in disguise and sort of whip off their

252
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:58,080
 robes? And it turns out it's like a massive Lego minifigure. Exactly reveal their yellow

253
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,640
 claw hands. There is a, there was an app that was released last year. It was not an official one,

254
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,840
 but it was a Lego app. It was called brick it quite good name. And what it's for when you're

255
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,080
 nervous about something terrified of your Lego. Yeah, it's a therapy app. No, it was, it was you

256
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,520
 photograph your pile of Lego with your smartphone camera, and it will tell you what to build.

257
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,560
 And it gives you instructions. Like it says, you've got these pieces you can make Father Christmas

258
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:32,160
 out of Lego. And it gives you instructions about how to do it. And then if you see your, you know,

259
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,840
 this design and you think, oh, where's that red one that I need for the hat or whatever,

260
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,360
 you can't find it in your pile of Lego, you go back to the photo you took that you scanned,

261
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,880
 and it says, look, it's there. It's there in the pile, you idiot. That's brilliant.

262
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,400
 It's an amazing work for jigsaws. That would be good, wouldn't it? You just scan it and it says

263
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,200
 this one goes here. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I suspect that removes the main point of a jigsaw. Well,

264
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,640
 maybe I didn't know maybe this does too, but it's a, yeah, it's a pretty clever machine learning

265
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,480
 style thing. So there's a guy called Adam Beadle on YouTube and he's made a machine. It's like a

266
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,960
 pes dispenser for little Legos. And it's attached to a webcam. And the webcam is swivels so it can

267
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,520
 move around. And the webcam can tell where you are. It can recognize your socks, say for instance.

268
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,120
 And so it can sign a swivel round, look for your feet and then fire Lego under your feet.

269
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,760
 So wherever you walk, you always stand on Lego. Was this invented by Kevin and home alone or something?

270
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:41,360
 I wanted to build a machine learning app to find four leaf clovers. So you take a picture of a

271
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,160
 clover patch and it would say, yeah, here's the four leaf clover. And I spoke to a lot of people

272
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,320
 about it. And they said that actually, for some reason, artificial intelligence isn't very good

273
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,520
 at counting things. So it would be quite difficult because you've got to recognize leaves coming from

274
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,920
 the same thing and then count how many of them. So like, there's a lot of these image generation

275
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,920
 AIs out there. You say, you know, draw me a picture of a bird with three legs or whatever,

276
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:11,120
 and it'll draw this picture and it'll have like 17 legs. I don't understand why, but it's an

277
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,720
 interesting thing. The one thing computers are good at, but not artificial intelligence for

278
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,280
 some reason. I remember reading years ago, there was a record for the most four leaf clovers found

279
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,960
 in a certain area. And it was in a prison just outside London, I think. And all the prisoners

280
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,600
 had started finding four leaf clovers because there'd been some genetic mutation. Or I think

281
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,320
 the clover has grown extra leaf when there's some problem, like there's some acid in the start.

282
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,840
 But it's just like. And did they all magically break out of prison the next day? They're not

283
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,600
 really turned in. They're just not very lucky, are they? They're in prison already, they've been

284
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,120
 caught. So I mean, yeah. Yeah, that's really funny. Do you think it's still lucky if robots

285
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,200
 find your four leaf clover? That feels like you're cheating luck of days. No, I think it's fine.

286
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,920
 Okay, great. I think it's solved. I think it probably is still lucky. I don't know. You can buy

287
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,520
 four leaf clovers. Oh, that's not lucky. That's definitely not lucky. We can buy horse shoes.

288
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:19,280
 They're so hard to find in nature. That's true. I thought they were unlucky if you hang them upside

289
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,600
 down. Yeah, but then everyone says they're supposed to be one way and then everyone,

290
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,440
 the other people say they're supposed to be the other way. No one can tell whether they're supposed

291
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,760
 to be the rounded bit down or the rounded bit up. It seems like different parts of the country

292
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,440
 have different things. So I have a horseshoe in my house, but it's on its side. Because I thought

293
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,240
 that's the best place they're supposed to be is flat on the ground with a horse standing on top

294
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:55,760
 of it. Like everything else is misplacing for those. Okay, time for fact number three, and that is

295
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,160
 James. Okay, my fact this week is that one of the most environmentally friendly ways to catch

296
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:09,280
 scallops is to set up an underwater scallop disco. And lure them in with sounds of... The macarena?

297
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,960
 Is that seafood based? I was desperately craving for any songs that might be... Ah, I was going

298
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:22,560
 disco. Aqua. Aqua's quite disco. Aqua would have been a good one. On topic, Barbie Girl. Go on,

299
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:30,000
 so they like disco music. They do. Well, no, they don't. They like disco lights.

300
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,280
 And this is a press release from the University of York that I read. And it's about some work

301
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,800
 that they did with FishTech Marine, which is a fisheries company from Devon. And what they were

302
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:46,080
 trying to do is they were trying to put lights into crab and lobster pots. And they were hoping

303
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,000
 that they would catch a load of crabs and lobsters. But what they actually... So do they think crabs

304
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,280
 and lobsters would be attracted by the lights? They thought they might be. But it turns out that

305
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:59,280
 crabs and lobsters, they're more of going to the movies kind of animals. They like jazz. They like

306
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:06,160
 going to watch Indiana Jones at midnight. But actually, scallops, they love the lights. They

307
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,160
 love the disco lights. And they kind of went down and looked at these pots that they were

308
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,200
 expecting to have crabs and lobsters in and found just a billion scallops. And the interesting thing

309
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,880
 is that the current best way of catching scallops, and when I say best way, I mean most efficient way,

310
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,360
 very much not the best way for the environment, is to use dredges. So loads of claws that go down

311
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,720
 to the bottom of the ocean and drag the bottom of the ocean. And the scallops come up and you catch

312
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,840
 them from there. And obviously, this is not a sustainable way to catch seafood. Because it

313
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,160
 drags up so much other stuff with it. It basically turns over the seabed. It's awful. But this could

314
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,400
 be a much better way of doing it by putting some disco lights down there. Do you think because they

315
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,000
 have hundreds of eyes? And do you think they love the disco lights? Because they've got so many eyes.

316
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,760
 It's like going to a disco that's 500 times better than ours. There is a suggestion that it might be

317
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,800
 that because most animals that live under the sea don't have great eyesight, but they do have these

318
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,160
 amazing 200 eyes. And each of their eyes have two retinas, one that responds to light and one that

319
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,480
 responds to darkness. And so they have this incredible complex sight. Perhaps that's the reason

320
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,600
 that they're attracted to the lights. We don't know to be honest, but the fact is that it works

321
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,680
 and it could save the environment a little bit. And most of the scallop that you see on your plate,

322
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:30,640
 if you order a scallop in a restaurant, you'll get this sort of white cylinder of flesh.

323
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,840
 Doesn't sound as appealing. They're very delicious things. That's kind of what a sausage is,

324
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,840
 isn't it? It's a cylinder of flesh. Yeah, exactly. They're the sausages of the sea. They're nature

325
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:52,080
 sausage. So that is not the whole scallop. That's not the whole animal. You know, that's just the

326
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,240
 adductor muscle, which is this. So they have this incredibly powerful muscle that they use to open

327
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:03,600
 and close the shell. And you're not eating the 200 beautiful tiny eyes. And the eyes are so small

328
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,000
 as well. The eyes are the size of a poppy seed. And each of their eyes is on its own tentacle.

329
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:17,680
 Isn't that cool? And they can kind of peer. What's that over there? So each of their eyes,

330
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,280
 because they have mirrors at the back of their eyes. I think, did you say that, James? Well,

331
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,480
 they've got two retinas, but each eye has a mirror, which is made of millions of small square

332
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,160
 tiles. It's weird because it's almost like a disco bowl. Oh my God. Yeah, you're right.

333
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,560
 One of their own when they see the disco bowl. So okay, you're in the eye. You've got the mirror,

334
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,280
 which is made of millions of square tiles. But those mirrors are each made of 20 or 30 layers

335
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:51,200
 of a substance called guanine. And so guanine is one of the main ingredients of DNA, among

336
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,480
 lots of other things. It is what gives fish their silvery tint sometimes on that sort of gleamy

337
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,160
 tint. That's guanine. That's what you're saying. And it's also what chameleons use to change the

338
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:06,640
 colour of their skin. There's one chemical or substance. Yeah, crystals, doesn't it? Yeah.

339
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,960
 In the skin of chameleons. Yeah, so cool. And that's just scallops going around, you know.

340
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,800
 And they have growth rings like trees. Do they? Yeah, you can tell the age of a scallop by its rings.

341
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:26,000
 It's sound that you have to chop them down first though. No. Yeah, each ring on their shell.

342
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 It's the rings that radiate out of the shell, as it were, obviously. So each ring represents a

343
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,800
 year of growth, unless apparently it represents a stressful incident. So it might be that they've

344
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,400
 had an incredibly stressful life, in which case they're going to see much older than they are,

345
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,080
 much like humans. Like humans, yeah. Like they've got a lot of pressure at work or something like

346
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,080
 that. Yeah, yeah. It's a big report to hand in and they're trying to raise a kid at the same time,

347
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,560
 whatever. They've been dredged. It is mostly the dredging that a stressful incident will usually

348
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,200
 be you're caught in a net. And so you deposit an extra layer in your panic, apparently.

349
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,480
 I read an article with some scientists who reckon that if we mass produced

350
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,480
 oysters and mussels and scallops and stuff, then that could be the way to solve the world's nutrition

351
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,000
 problems. And the main problem that they found is that most people don't like oysters and mussels.

352
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,640
 Yeah, but if you mass produce anything, it's the answer to the world's nutrition problems.

353
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,040
 Well, the reason there's a few reasons. And the reason is because we have a lot of coastline,

354
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,920
 which is suitable for it. Using just 1% of the available coastline, we'd be able to get the

355
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:36,560
 protein for a billion people. Bivalves have higher protein content than beef does. They also have

356
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,600
 lots of key nutrients that we need. So vitamin A, they have iodine, they have omega three, they've

357
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,840
 got loads of stuff like that. And the other thing is they've come up with this new way of feeding

358
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,480
 them with like little, they call them bullets of nutrition. So it's a really cheap way of feeding

359
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,280
 the bivalves. They make it using algae, so it's very cheap to get as well. But also you can put

360
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,840
 stuff in these little bullets, so you can put flavorings in them, you can put more nutrition

361
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,160
 in them. What flavors do they like? Do they love sour flavors? Does the flavor end up in them?

362
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,760
 Yes, because they filter feed us. So because they filter feed, they keep a lot of the chemicals

363
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,960
 inside themselves. So you can put a little sour patch kid flavor into your muscle. And then when

364
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,520
 you eat it, you'll get all of this goodness, all of this protein. And you'll be able to

365
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:34,560
 you'll be able to have whatever flavor you want. I don't want to rub an oyster on my anus though.

366
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,600
 Well, you have to. You always have to draw a line on a first date.

367
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:49,360
 I have a related story about hepatitis A. Oh, yeah. So there was an outbreak of hepatitis A

368
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,440
 in the Netherlands. And by sequencing the genome of the virus, they traced the outbreak back to

369
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,560
 Bangor in Wales. And none of the people that got it in the Netherlands had been to Bangor in Wales.

370
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:10,480
 The family that had it in Wales didn't visit the Netherlands. So this one family visited the

371
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,640
 Caribbean, where it's endemic. And they didn't take vaccinations. Family from Wales? Yeah, in Bangor.

372
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,680
 They came back to Bangor. They brought hepatitis A back to Bangor. And they stayed at home because

373
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,440
 they knew they were real. But they were going to the toilet a lot. And they were shedding these

374
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,400
 virus particles into the sewage system. And by bad luck, there was a lot of rain at the time.

375
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:41,680
 And it overwhelmed the sewage system. So it ended up in the estuary in Bangor, which is a big muscle

376
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,720
 fishery. Wow. We're all, all three of us looking at you thinking, how is this going to get to the

377
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,600
 Netherlands? I think I know that. I think you're probably all in there. The muscle fishery was the

378
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,560
 giveaway. And their filter feeders. So the tide is moving in and out. This infected water is

379
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,400
 flowing back and forth over these filter feeders. They're gathering this, these virus particles.

380
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,760
 We're harvesting them. We're selling them around the world. And that particular batch,

381
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,600
 a lot of it went to the Netherlands. That is incredible. And that is also the downside of

382
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,640
 my plan of feeding the world with high valves. Because it just takes one family from Bangor

383
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:24,880
 and we're all fucked. And a downpour. In Poland, they use clams to automatically

384
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:36,160
 regulate their water systems. In Warsaw. So they have these clams in a room somewhere,

385
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,080
 but they've got water from the system flowing over them. And if the clams shut, it's because the

386
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:48,640
 water quality is low, but they've got a little like lever attached to the shell of the clam.

387
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,560
 And so when it closes, it hits a little button and automates the shutdown. So we know the quality

388
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,800
 of the water in Botticelli's Venus was good because it was open, she was standing up. And if

389
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,640
 Dodgy Water had entered that system, it would have been crushed. Do you know why he had a

390
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,520
 scallop shell Botticelli in that painting? So it's the famous painting of Venus and she's

391
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,120
 floating it on a seashell. Yeah, yeah. Improvisably large one. Yeah. I think it was a giant clam.

392
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,520
 I think she was tiny, wasn't she? I think yeah. Even giant clams aren't big enough to hold an

393
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:30,320
 entire woman. Why was it? Well, it was based on a Spanish shrine of St. James of Compostela.

394
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,120
 And St. James of Compostela was associated with the scallop. Few reasons may be why one, because

395
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:43,440
 the scallop's lines represent the different routes travelled by pilgrims to go and visit his remains.

396
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,440
 Santiago de Compostela is a pilgrimage. Exactly. It's this one. It takes a month.

397
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,040
 And also, possibly because when they got the remains of St. James originally, they were covered

398
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,760
 in scallop shells because he was in the water. One of those. Why was he devoured? Is that how he

399
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,880
 was invited to invite scallops? Wow. Because one of them lands on you. You think, oh, that's an

400
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,720
 irritation, but I can deal with that. And then the second one lands and then you see, you know,

401
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,880
 them all fluttering through the water towards you. It'd be a terrifying horror movie. Well,

402
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,720
 it's The Eternal. Would you rather question, would you rather fight like one shark or a thousand

403
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:24,400
 scallops? Anyway, one shark-sized scallop or a hundred scallop-sized sharks.

404
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:35,680
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna. My fact this week is that scientists,

405
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:43,600
 stupid scientists, still... Editorializing in the facts. We've done it before. I feel strongly

406
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:50,880
 about this one. I'm still saying that climate change is real. That's my fact over and out.

407
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,320
 No, my fact is that scientists still can't decide if hot water freezes faster than cold water.

408
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:05,520
 And it's true. It's a thing called the Pemba effect. If it's the case that hot water, you know,

409
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,600
 if you start freezing a glass of hot water and a glass of cold water, the Pemba effect is if the

410
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:16,160
 hot water freezes faster than the cold water. And it's bizarrely complicated to test. I think

411
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,280
 there are lots of problems with it. So it's hard to define when freezing starts. Like, is it when

412
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,840
 certain crystals start to form? Is it when the whole thing freezes? Is it hard to identify when

413
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,800
 those crystals have started to form? Or is it when the temperature drops down to zero? And anyway,

414
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,200
 people have been saying for thousands of years that this is a phenomenon. Aristotle said it in

415
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,800
 350 BC. He said hot water freezes faster than cold. People sort of forgot about it for hundreds of

416
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,880
 years. So I think, you know, it was, it was a thing with like Francis Bacon said it in the 17th

417
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,920
 century. And then in the 1960s, there was a Tanzanian boy called Erasto Pemba, which is why it's

418
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,440
 called the Pemba effect, who noticed it again. And we started studying it. It's great. It's really

419
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:06,480
 great this this effect. Is it real though? Well, in order for it to work, right, when the hot water

420
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,560
 is freezing, it must at some stage overtake the cold water. Yeah, for that to be true. But that

421
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,040
 means that when those two waters are the same temperature, the one that was previously hot must

422
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,760
 somehow remember that it was hot. So yeah, so that was the big thing that they've discovered that

423
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,560
 they have proved that it's possible in general for a system to behave in this way, like in a really

424
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,480
 abstract sense, you can have a system that, you know, is approaching some equilibrium point,

425
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,560
 approaching some temperature. And it's possible in general that if you are further away from that

426
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,440
 point, you can get there quicker, but they haven't shown it specifically for water. It's the tortoise

427
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,360
 and the hare. I think of it as being like, if you have to heat the oven to 180 degrees, you can

428
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:01,120
 if it was frozen, and you started from frozen, it would be quicker. That's not what I'd,

429
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:07,920
 I will put it to 250 degrees so that it has to get up. I think I better get a move on.

430
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,120
 I've got to rush. Very different to what actually is happening. When it gets to 180,

431
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,640
 you just pop it back down and the light goes off and you've saved time.

432
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,280
 No, you know you're definitely wasting your time when you do that because of the way ovens work,

433
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,720
 right? I have a hunch that my oven knows there's pressure. He needs to get there.

434
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,120
 I do exactly the same. It's the way that Anthony works with deadlines, isn't it?

435
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,160
 I am exactly the same as you. You know every time with the oven, I know it's completely logical.

436
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,840
 Obviously, it makes no difference, but I do. If you're in a rush, you put it on as hot as

437
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,080
 possible. It's not going to make a difference how long it takes to get to 100 degrees. Anyway,

438
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:48,080
 that's completely unrelated to the implementation. Agree to disagree. Just to get back to you.

439
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:55,360
 How can it remember what it did? There are various ways. For example, it might be that the

440
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,800
 hotter water freezes from the outside first, so you've got this structural difference.

441
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,680
 You've got this casing of ice around an unfrozen center, whereas that doesn't happen

442
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,200
 with the other ones. There could be an actual mechanism of accelerating towards freezing.

443
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,400
 One idea is there might be more eddy currents in it, which somehow causes it to freeze quicker.

444
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,920
 Those eddy currents remain after that transition point has happened.

445
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,800
 Sort of mini whirlpools. One idea is that cold water might super cool,

446
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,960
 so it has to go to a lower temperature before it freezes.

447
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,840
 Can we talk about Erasto Mpemba, the student who the thing is named after? He did it. He

448
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,800
 discovered this effect if it's real and clearly opinion varies around the table,

449
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,880
 but he was making ice cream. He was 13 years old and he was at school making ice cream,

450
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,320
 and his method was you boil the milk to make it with. You mix it with the sugar,

451
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,760
 you put it in the freezer bit of the fridge, but there was a rush for fridge space. He had boiled

452
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,720
 his milk already, but he saw another boy run to the fridge without boiling the milk and shove

453
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,440
 his milk and thing in there. He and the other boy put their milk and sugar mixes into the

454
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,000
 freezer at the same time. I think it was, was it not that the other boy let his milk cool down

455
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,520
 first and then put it in, whereas he put it in while it was boiling. They basically put two trays

456
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:20,000
 of milk and sugar in at the same time. One of it, his was boiling hot and the others was already

457
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,520
 cooled. And when he and the other boy went back, his tray had frozen into ice cream. The other

458
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,120
 boys hadn't frozen into ice cream. It's proved. And he took a situation to a physics lecturer

459
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,040
 at his school called Dennis Osborne, and they co-wrote a paper which was just called Cool,

460
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,280
 which I love. Well actually, he first of all took the situation to his teacher,

461
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,320
 who said, "You're an idiot. That doesn't happen." So he asked this teacher a question about it,

462
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,200
 and the teacher said, "That is Mpemba's physics and not the universal physics." And it became

463
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,040
 like a running joke at his school. Every time there was a mistake, he would be told,

464
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,280
 "That is Mpemba's mathematics. He's been made a mass error." And anyway, Mpemba's name has now

465
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,680
 been remembered, and the teacher who took a mickey out of him, his name is now Dust. So...

466
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,480
 Dead in the water. Do you know by sheer coincidence when Mpemba discovered this thing about hot water,

467
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,200
 his effect, there was a Canadian scientist called Dr. Kel, who at pretty much exactly the same time

468
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,360
 wrote a paper saying the same thing. It having not been mentioned for over a century, he discovered

469
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,960
 the same thing. That's one of those weird things, isn't it? Like the Dennis the Menace thing when

470
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,840
 two Dennis the Menaces were created. Were they? That's a cool fact. Yeah, the same week a Dennis

471
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,840
 the Menace was created in America as there was in Britain, and they were quite so. They were both

472
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:37,360
 young schoolboys. Isn't that called Morphic Resonance? Well, that's interesting. That sounds

473
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:44,480
 like bullshit. That's Sheldrake's idea of Morphic Resonance, and that's the idea that he said it was

474
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,520
 in the 70s, there was a few blue tits that learned how to peck into milk bottles, and then suddenly,

475
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,400
 within a week, everyone had noticed that in the whole country, all these blue tits were learning

476
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,440
 how to do it, and he thought there was some kind of special psychic way that all of these

477
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,960
 animals had managed to learn stuff. So I was trying to explain Morphic Resonance to someone

478
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,360
 last night, but I couldn't remember what the example was, and the blue tits and the milk bottles

479
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:17,920
 is a really good one, and I misremembered it as. So you know cattle grids? This is real. This is real.

480
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:28,320
 I remember that cows had learned to roll over cattle grids. You're so close. You're so close.

481
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,520
 That would like within three weeks of each other, cows across the planet were rolling

482
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:37,360
 across cattle grids. You're really close, but it's sheep, and sheep had learned how to roll

483
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,840
 across them. Damn it. Again, there was lots of anecdotal evidence from different farmers that

484
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:47,040
 that had happened, but no one, even in the world of smartphones, no one has ever been able to video

485
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,240
 this actually happening. They're not idiots. They're not going to do it in front of people with

486
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,400
 smartphones. Oh, wow. So I got closer to that. I feel like a cow, once it's halfway across rolling

487
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,600
 across a cattle grid, probably won't be able to get the rest of the way along. Yeah, I cannot

488
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,280
 believe you confused those, because the idea of a cow rolling across anything is, I don't know if

489
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,440
 it can happen. Yeah, it does explain why. Or as you can roll a sheep easily, can't you? You can roll

490
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,280
 a sheep. Can a sheep roll itself, though? That's the question. You can tip a cow, but you can roll

491
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,000
 a sheep. And that's why I tell the difference between sheep and a cow. That's why you're a farming

492
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,600
 crew. I also have an effect named after me. Really? The mold effect. The mold effect.

493
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,320
 No, you're just talking about molding. No, no, I made a video about this thing that I accidentally

494
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,920
 discovered, which I assumed had already been discovered, but I couldn't find anything about it

495
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,960
 on the internet. If you get a chain of beads, a bead chain like the type you see at the side of

496
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:49,520
 blinds that you used to get about 50 meters of it, feed it into a pot, and then take the end of it

497
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,320
 and allow it to fall out of the pot. The whole pot empties, which is already known and understood.

498
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,000
 But what happens is it rises above the pot first. It's really cool. It sort of rears up. I see the

499
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,560
 answer. The further it has to fall, the higher it goes. I got it to go two and a half meters

500
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,560
 out of the pot by dropping it at about 90 meters. It's a long story, but I was making a video about

501
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,800
 polymers. There's a polymer called polyethylene oxide. If you make a solution of it and start

502
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,080
 to pour it out of the beaker, it all pours out. It's self-pouring polymer. You don't have to tip

503
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,920
 the whole thing up. It all just comes out in one go. I wanted to make a physical model of that.

504
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,600
 I'd seen it done with plastic beads before, a chain of beads. The beads self-siphon,

505
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,440
 but it doesn't rise up if you use plastic beads. I thought I'll use metal beads because it'll look

506
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,360
 nicer and it'll discover this thing that goes around. Wouldn't it be amazing if that effect,

507
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,560
 which you described, then becomes very important in something else? It would be amazing.

508
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,200
 And then in a billion years' time, everyone's like, "Did you know that the person who the

509
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,280
 mould effect was named after was once on a podcast?" That's some idiot. To be able to

510
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,600
 prove that part of the explanation, it'd be amazing to see the beads moving in zero gravity.

511
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,520
 And so I put a call out, "Is there any way to get the beads on the International Space Station?"

512
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,040
 And it's happened. The beads went up in a rocket. I think it was in May.

513
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:15,440
 Commander Samantha Christofferetti has the beads. She hasn't done the experiment yet.

514
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,720
 She's got a lot on, probably. She's busy, but she will do it at some point.

515
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,240
 What if it wrecks the ISS?

516
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,440
 God, they get loaded with so much crap. I always feel sorry for them.

517
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:32,160
 The old mould effect, obviously, is going to be groundbreaking, but I always think with

518
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,160
 astronauts and NASA, it's like, "Oh, what? I have to put this weird plant on for this kid.

519
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,720
 It's bloke. I'm just lucky to bring up his experiment."

520
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:46,160
 I was looking at some experiments that I could try at home, and as I mentioned a few times,

521
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:54,080
 got a new baby. And Jean-Jacques Rousseau thought that he thought that humans were fundamentally

522
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:00,640
 good as children. And any kind of evilness in humans was all society corrupting people.

523
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,800
 And so there was a guy called Richard Lovell Edgeworth, and he was the guy who invented the

524
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:12,560
 conveyor belt. What have you done, James? He also thought that he would try and raise his son,

525
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:18,960
 who was called Richard Jr., to be like Rousseau said, and be permanently good. So he wouldn't

526
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,760
 let him get involved in society. Just let him run around in the garden and stuff. Anyway,

527
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,280
 by the age of eight, he had become what Edgeworth described as an ungovernable child of nature.

528
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,480
 And he had to ship him off to a seminary. What? He's just sort of gone savage?

529
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,440
 He's just gone savage. Wow. And there was another psychologist called Clarence Luba.

530
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:46,560
 And Clarence thought that children only laughed when they're tickled because their parents laugh.

531
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:52,080
 So the idea is I tickle my daughter. My daughter laughs, but she's only laughing because I'm enjoying

532
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:59,120
 it so much. And basically tickling is a learned thing. And so he invented some cardboard shield

533
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,560
 masks that he would, him and his wife would wear every time that they tickle their child

534
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:11,120
 in the hope that the child would never learn how to laugh when tickled. But by the time the child

535
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:16,160
 was seven months old, it was still laughing whenever it was tickled. But he thought that

536
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,520
 his hypothesis was still true. And maybe his wife was not fully observing the tickling rules.

537
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,760
 Your poor wife had been working for this weird man covered mask tickle experiment.

538
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,240
 The child's terrified of both of you at this stage. Darling, we have a tickling protocol.

539
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:41,760
 My ad hoc hypothesis about laughing and tickling, which means it's just an idea that I've got,

540
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:49,280
 is that it's a way to teach self-defense through play. So the sensation of being tickled is

541
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:55,280
 unpleasant, right? So if kids just cried when you tickled them, you wouldn't do it. But they laugh.

542
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,720
 And so as a parent, you think, oh, I've got to make them laugh. It's, someone may feel so good

543
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,880
 to make my kids laugh. So you, and you think about where you tickle kids, it's in those vulnerable

544
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:09,360
 places where you could get her like the neck armpits. So I think it's this way of like encouraging

545
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:14,240
 parents to do things that kids that actually don't really enjoy, but it's, it's, it's a form of

546
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,720
 learning self-defense. Are you saying it's like the sensation of being attacked by a wild animal?

547
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,400
 Yes. And you're kind of. So you're not very good at self-defense when you're being tickled,

548
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,200
 are you? Because I've never successfully fought off a tickle. Maybe I wasn't tickled enough to

549
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,080
 know. You have to go for the, you have to go for the eyes. Yeah. And the crotch. You know, you're

550
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:39,360
 shucking an eye guarantee. One theory about the tickling is that it's like if insects are getting

551
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,440
 on, you like poisonous insects. And it's to the reason that it's unpleasant. And the reason you

552
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:50,080
 want to stop it is because in the olden days before iPads, you might have been in the Serengeti

553
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,840
 and there were dangerous insects climbing on you. Yeah, but that makes sense. But why the laugh?

554
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,080
 But it's not funny. Well, it's not for you. I mean, it's funny for everyone else in the,

555
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,680
 in the camping trip. I think the same argument then about it being a protection thing. It's a

556
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,680
 defense thing. Yeah. So we're teaching our children to defend themselves. Why would you laugh

557
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,800
 as a defense? No, you should defend yourself. You're trying to stop. You're physically defending

558
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,080
 yourself. You're wiggling. No, no. But why the laughing? Like you want, I understand this tickle,

559
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,400
 you're obviously fighting off. Do encourage the parents. I get the, I love the parents theory.

560
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,320
 To stimulate the child so that they defend themselves against insects. So, no, hang on,

561
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:28,880
 we've got it. It's for the, the child laughs to make sure the parent keeps on wiggling the child,

562
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,800
 to encourage the child to learn how to fight off an insect swarm. I completely understood that,

563
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,240
 although it's the parent being an idiot, because all parents remember being tickled as kids. And

564
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,480
 what they remember is this was hell. Don't inflict this on your child. So what you're saying, Anna,

565
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:49,520
 is that my experiment where my house is full of dangerous hornets. And I release them every

566
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:59,040
 time I tickle my daughter. This is not a good idea. Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

567
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,560
