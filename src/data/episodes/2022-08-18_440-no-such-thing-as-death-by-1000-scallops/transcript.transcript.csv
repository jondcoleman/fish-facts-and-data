00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everybody, just to let you know we've got a very special guest on the podcast today"
00:00:04,00:00:11,to replace Dan Schreiber who was momentarily disappeared. And that guest is the fantastic
00:00:11,00:00:16,"Steve Mould, very much friend of the podcast, friend of QI. Actually I think has made an"
00:00:16,00:00:23,"appearance on QI. He's science presenter and communicator extraordinaire, he's one third"
00:00:23,00:00:28,"of the brilliant troop festival of the spoken nerd. Please do check out his work, go to his"
00:00:28,00:00:34,"YouTube page, it's full of amazing, mind-blowing, bizarre, extraordinary science videos. It really"
00:00:34,00:00:40,is a great place to hang out online and definitely listen to the Festival of Spoken Nerds podcast
00:00:40,00:00:46,which is called a podcast of unnecessary detail where they take subjects you might think are boring
00:00:46,00:00:51,if you're a fool and show you that they are of course fascinating. It really is worth a listen
00:00:51,00:01:07,"and we had a great time having him on the show. Okay, here we go."
00:01:07,00:01:13,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Substance Thing is a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:01:13,00:01:18,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm joined this
00:01:18,00:01:25,"week by James Harkin, Anna Tajinski and it's our very special guest, Steve Mould. We have gathered"
00:01:25,00:01:29,around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:01:29,00:01:37,order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Steve. My fact is that protons taste
00:01:37,00:01:45,"sour. How do you, like you can't get the cutlery small enough for that. How do you taste a proton?"
00:01:45,00:01:52,"So actually every time you taste something sour you're tasting protons. Oh okay that's a slight,"
00:01:52,00:01:55,is that a different fact or the same fact? I would say it's the same fact.
00:01:55,00:02:01,"Steve doesn't everything have protons in it? Oh I see what you mean free protons, everything's got"
00:02:01,00:02:09,"protons on their own. So you know you have five taste senses on your tongue, sweet, sour, salt,"
00:02:09,00:02:16,"bitter and umami and your sour taste, it just works in a completely different way. So like your"
00:02:16,00:02:22,"sweetness taste, it's the old lock and key thing, you've probably heard it a thousand times in biology."
00:02:22,00:02:28,So just in case I've forgotten literally everything I learned. So you've got these
00:02:28,00:02:34,"gustatory cells on your tongue and on the surface of those cells you have these big molecules,"
00:02:34,00:02:41,"complicated shapes, they're proteins with a complicated shape and that's the lock in this"
00:02:41,00:02:49,"analogy and there's one molecule that fits perfectly, that's the key and in the case of your sweetness"
00:02:49,00:02:55,"receptors it's the sugar molecule, it's glucose that fits perfectly and when they combine in that"
00:02:55,00:03:01,way it causes some chemical reaction to occur inside the cell and that leads to a signal going
00:03:01,00:03:07,to your brain and you experience that as something sweet in your mouth. But when you taste something
00:03:07,00:03:14,"sour it's because you're tasting something acidic, so sour is just your like acidity detecting"
00:03:14,00:03:21,mechanism right and something is acidic if it has a high concentration of hydrogen ions.
00:03:21,00:03:28,"And if we've got all of our chemistry, can we get on to physics actually, I feel safe"
00:03:28,00:03:36,"for ground there. Can we get on to literature? Well, Andrew, so what is hydrogen, you can"
00:03:36,00:03:40,"tell me what hydrogen is. Hydrogen is, yeah, it's an element of a periodic table very early on."
00:03:40,00:03:44,"Is it element number one? It's the earliest one, so what's it made of then? Hydrogen."
00:03:44,00:03:52,"I mean what's inside? So it's made of an acid, so the molecule of hydrogen is one,"
00:03:53,00:03:59,"it's the central bit. It's a neutron and an electron. No, I think it doesn't have a neutron,"
00:03:59,00:04:04,isn't it? The one without a neutron. Does every other molecule in reality have a
00:04:04,00:04:09,"neutron? I've got bad news for you, Andy, you're currently naked but the good news is you're asleep."
00:04:09,00:04:18,"So it's a proton within an electron orbiting around it. That means it's neutral, it's balanced."
00:04:19,00:04:24,"That's an atom. It's not a charged particle. Hey, what's another word for that?"
00:04:24,00:04:27,"What a charged particle? It's called an ion, isn't it?"
00:04:27,00:04:40,"Is this your card, sir? So to turn a hydrogen atom into a hydrogen ion, you strip away the"
00:04:40,00:04:48,"electron. Okay, leaving just the proton. That's right. So a hydrogen ion really is just a proton."
00:04:48,00:04:54,"And that tastes sour. And that tastes sour. So when you're tasting an acid,"
00:04:54,00:05:00,it's because you're tasting protons in the liquid or in the food or whatever. And so these
00:05:00,00:05:06,"gestatory cells, instead of having like some complicated molecule, lock and key thing going on,"
00:05:06,00:05:11,it's just a hole and it's a special kind of hole in the cell that accepts protons. It's got a proton
00:05:11,00:05:16,"channel. So cool. Yeah, so bizarre. So it's not a special shape, it's not one of those like when"
00:05:16,00:05:20,"you're a kid and you fit bricks into holes, it's not that perfect shape. It's just a big"
00:05:20,00:05:26,cavern and it accepts protons. It sounds like my tongue is like something from back to the future.
00:05:26,00:05:35,"It's like taking protons. Okay, right. So a few questions. Do electrons taste"
00:05:35,00:05:39,"the opposite? As in, do we know what electrons taste like? Or do we have a receptor that"
00:05:39,00:05:42,reacts to that? If an electron falls into this hole?
00:05:42,00:05:48,"Well, electrons wouldn't fall into the hole. No. Oh, yeah. Interesting. There's your answer, Andy."
00:05:48,00:05:51,I don't think we have receptors for electrons to my knowledge. I don't believe we do.
00:05:51,00:05:55,We wouldn't taste of anything. Unless you like put some jam on them.
00:05:55,00:06:02,"Okay, question number two. Follow up question number two. What is the smallest number of protons"
00:06:02,00:06:07,that we would be able to taste? Because obviously they're tiny. Would you have to have 500 billion?
00:06:07,00:06:12,"If you just licked one hydrogen ion, it's not going to taste anything. Exactly."
00:06:12,00:06:19,Yeah. So what happens is the concentration of protons in the cell builds up until it reaches
00:06:19,00:06:23,some limit. And then it sends an electric signal to your brain. I don't know what that limit is.
00:06:23,00:06:25,No further questions.
00:06:25,00:06:33,What I find really interesting about this I was reading is that possibly sourness might be the
00:06:33,00:06:40,earliest taste that any animal had. And the reason being that animals are living in the deep ocean
00:06:40,00:06:45,and the danger in the deep ocean might be acidic stuff coming up and you want to get away from the
00:06:45,00:06:50,acid. And so perhaps that we learned how to taste this sourness before we learned anything else
00:06:50,00:06:55,"because it would stop us from getting fried by the acid. That's so cool. Yeah, that'd be good,"
00:06:55,00:07:00,"wouldn't it? Actually, the way I like to think about taste is those five taste senses that we have"
00:07:00,00:07:06,"on our tongues, you can think about them as chemical detecting mechanisms that we've evolved"
00:07:06,00:07:12,for survival. So like sugar is really important because it's a source of energy. So it makes
00:07:12,00:07:18,sense that we would evolve the ability to detect that. Bitteness is your poison detecting mechanism.
00:07:18,00:07:21,"And actually, there's a few different receptors for that because there are a few different poisons"
00:07:21,00:07:28,that we can detect. What's really interesting about the bitterness receptor is that it's
00:07:28,00:07:35,"really in flux, like an evolutionary point of view, because we're in an arms race with plants."
00:07:35,00:07:38,"Like plants don't want to be eaten, except for fruit, you know, they don't want to be eaten."
00:07:38,00:07:43,"Obviously, anthropomorphizing, we're allowed to anthropomorphize. Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank god."
00:07:43,00:07:52,"I draw faces on all my plants. So plants are producing poisons to stop us from eating plants,"
00:07:52,00:07:58,"but then some plants are producing molecules that interact with our poison receptors, poison"
00:07:58,00:08:04,"detecting receptors on our tongues. They're not actually poisonous, but we react to them and decide"
00:08:04,00:08:09,"not to eat them because they taste bitter. Whereas with sourness, you like it naturally from birth."
00:08:09,00:08:14,"I mean, no one likes sour sweets more than kids. And yet sourness in a way denotes something's"
00:08:14,00:08:18,"gone bad. Like if milk goes sour, that's bad. And that's disgusting to us. But then if certain"
00:08:18,00:08:22,"fruits are sour, then that's really good. And it actually can show that they haven't gone rotten."
00:08:22,00:08:27,"Yes, that's I love that. So it's the sign that there's a particular kind of acid there is"
00:08:27,00:08:33,"citric acid provides the sour flavor in fruits. And actually, those various acids prevent really"
00:08:33,00:08:39,"harmful bacteria from growing, meaning that, you know, lots of primates will enjoy fruit that's"
00:08:39,00:08:46,slightly spoiled because it means that it's safer. That's why orange juice tastes bad after you've
00:08:46,00:08:52,"cleaned your teeth, because toothpaste tends to have sodium aryl sulfate in it, that binds"
00:08:52,00:08:58,"to the sweetness receptors in your mouth and stops them from working. So when you have orange juice,"
00:08:58,00:09:01,"then you can't taste the sweetness of the orange juice, you can only taste the bitterness and the"
00:09:01,00:09:09,"sourness. And that's not so nice. Interesting. On sourness and children and stuff, those sour"
00:09:09,00:09:15,"candies you can get. And they're basically the sweet candies, but then they put some acids on"
00:09:15,00:09:20,"the outside. So they put like citric acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid on the outside."
00:09:20,00:09:25,"And they also have malic acid, which they put inside palm oil, which means it's like a slow"
00:09:25,00:09:30,release. So it kind of very slowly comes out. So the sourness kind of stays in your mouth for
00:09:30,00:09:36,longer and longer. But the interesting thing about those candies is something called sour patch kid.
00:09:36,00:09:40,You know that? I love sour patch kids. You love sour patch kids. I have some quite a lot of them.
00:09:40,00:09:50,"Okay, so the sour patch kid is also a medical term. Can you guess what the medical procedure"
00:09:50,00:09:56,"is that is known as the sour patch kid? Is it, I do know this one, you coat the child in."
00:09:58,00:10:02,And then you remove their appendix. It's kind of close.
00:10:02,00:10:07,This kid is sour. The kid has gone sour. So the kid is covered in some kind of acid.
00:10:07,00:10:11,"You put one of those sour astro belts, like a patch on a blister or something."
00:10:11,00:10:15,"Yeah, yeah. And it's, it gives it. We can do this. We can do this. On a wart."
00:10:15,00:10:18,"I think. No, you can't do this. I mean, you're not going to get this in a million years."
00:10:18,00:10:24,It's prolapsed anuses. Oh God. Wow. I think that might be something to do with what they look like.
00:10:24,00:10:28,"So I've eaten quite a lot of sour patch kids sweets in my time. Yeah, yeah."
00:10:28,00:10:33,I don't think I've ever come across one. You're not saying there's a team of
00:10:33,00:10:36,servants in the sour patch kids factory. They're occasionally pushing back in.
00:10:36,00:10:45,"It's just a nickname. Basically what happens is, if you have a prolapsed anus, sometimes to get it"
00:10:45,00:10:50,"back in, you're basically your intestines have come out of your rectum. So to get it back in,"
00:10:50,00:10:54,you need to shrink. And one of the ways to do that is to remove some of the water from it.
00:10:54,00:11:01,And one of the ways that they do that is to sprinkle some sugar on the prolapsed anus.
00:11:01,00:11:04,And you put the sugar on and it kind of goes down slightly. And then you give it a little
00:11:04,00:11:10,prod and it goes back inside. And the technique is sometimes known as the sour patch kid or
00:11:10,00:11:18,otherwise sugaring the REM. That's I believe is in Mary Poppins. A spoonful of sugar helps the
00:11:18,00:11:24,prolapsed anus go down. Why is it called sour when it's putting sugar in it? Do they
00:11:24,00:11:30,put acid down on it? I think I don't know what sour patch kids look like. They're not relevant to
00:11:30,00:11:35,this. Would it work as a home remedy if you've got a sour patch kid and used it? This is medical
00:11:35,00:11:41,"professionals do this. They're coated in sugar and especially at the end of the packet, there's"
00:11:41,00:11:45,that kind of fine dusting that's fallen off the original sweets. And that's obviously the best
00:11:45,00:11:50,"bit. Because they're quite glutinous, right? Yeah. And some of them red in colour. Some of them red."
00:11:50,00:11:55,It could it be what they look like a bit like a sour patch kid? Do you know what? For the benefit
00:11:55,00:12:02,"of my future enjoyment of sour patch kids, maybe we could draw a line on this. Have you guys heard"
00:12:02,00:12:08,of Eli Metchnikov? You might have done actually. So he's a famous Russian biologist in the early
00:12:08,00:12:15,20th century. He was working and he effectively launched the yoghurt craze in Western Europe.
00:12:15,00:12:20,"Yeah, this is on soundness. So he was especially interested in aging and the science of aging"
00:12:20,00:12:27,"and also in the gut and digestion. And in 1904, he was in Paris and he delivered a lecture claiming"
00:12:27,00:12:34,that aging was partly caused by harmful bacteria in the gut and that you also had to eat foods like
00:12:34,00:12:40,"yoghurt to cultivate those friendly bacteria, beneficial bacteria. And he suggested that sour"
00:12:40,00:12:45,"milk didn't spoil because of that lactic acid in it. So it sort of kills off the, you know,"
00:12:45,00:12:50,"the really the rottenness germs. And he said hypothetically, maybe if that's happening in the"
00:12:50,00:12:57,"lab to sour milk, the microbes might stop internal putrefaction in you and prevent aging. And this"
00:12:57,00:13:01,"turned into a huge thing in Paris. Like there was this mad yoghurt rush basically, where people were"
00:13:01,00:13:05,"rushing to shops and queuing up and saying, yoghurt is the thing that's going to keep us young. This"
00:13:05,00:13:10,"was 1904. And he slightly clarified the next year, look, yoghurt is not the elixir of youth,"
00:13:10,00:13:16,but it was too late by that point. Everyone in Paris was covering themselves in yoghurt.
00:13:16,00:13:22,"The great yoghurting of 1905. And then John Harvey Kellogg, who, you know, the very famous"
00:13:22,00:13:26,"dietician. Oh God, anything he latches on to, you know, it's going to go a bit weird."
00:13:26,00:13:29,He started feeding each of his patients a pint of yoghurt. And I appreciate that's
00:13:29,00:13:34,"a useless, I don't know what time period. There was like a huge craze, wasn't there? And I think"
00:13:34,00:13:42,"like one petty fallou went for 200,000 euros. That was the yoghurt bubble. Everyone was coated"
00:13:42,00:13:54,"in yoghurt again. So, like, sweeteners, artificial sweeteners are tricking your sweetness receptors"
00:13:54,00:13:59,into thinking you've got sugar in your mouth when you haven't. And there are examples in
00:13:59,00:14:04,nature of plants that have done that. So there's a berry in West Africa that has evolved the ability
00:14:04,00:14:11,to make this molecule that binds really strongly to the sweetness receptors of primates. And they
00:14:11,00:14:15,bind so strongly to those sweeteners receptors that they only have to make a few of them.
00:14:15,00:14:19,They don't have to spend loads of energy making loads of glucose molecules. They just make a few
00:14:19,00:14:25,of these trick molecules. And all these primates are going mad for these berries. They're running
00:14:25,00:14:29,"around eating them and they're getting no benefit from it. There's no energy content in it, but"
00:14:29,00:14:33,they're still going around then pooing out the seeds. So the berries get the benefit of having
00:14:33,00:14:38,"their seeds dispersed, but the primates don't get any benefit from it. And there's one gorilla"
00:14:38,00:14:46,that has evolved a slightly different sweetness receptor that isn't tricked by the berries molecule.
00:14:46,00:14:51,And so they do a lot better because they're not running around chasing these berries anymore.
00:14:51,00:14:53,Are they miracle berries? Are they? Is that what they're called?
00:14:53,00:14:58,"No, miracle berries is something different, actually. Miracle berries is something that binds"
00:14:58,00:15:05,"to your sweetness receptor, but in an inactive way, it doesn't do anything. But then when you"
00:15:05,00:15:10,"introduce an acid, it activates the molecule in such a way that it then stimulates your"
00:15:10,00:15:15,"sweetness receptor. So you suck on a miracle berry, nothing happens, and then you drink something sour"
00:15:15,00:15:21,and it tastes sweet because that molecule then turns into something that can stimulate your
00:15:21,00:15:26,"sweetness receptor. Like that old rumor about uzo, where if you drunk uzo and then the next day"
00:15:26,00:15:30,"you drunk water, then it would reactivate the uzo and get you drunk again. Is that a thing?"
00:15:30,00:15:36,"Yeah, not a true science. If I had a miracle berry, then I brush my teeth."
00:15:36,00:15:40,Then I had some orange juice. Could I make the orange juice taste sweet?
00:15:40,00:15:43,"You're a true scientist, Andy. I would say with questions like that."
00:15:43,00:15:54,"Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that"
00:15:54,00:16:00,fans of Indiana Jones guessed details of the fourth film's plot before it was released
00:16:00,00:16:05,from the expressions on the faces of the tie-in Lego characters.
00:16:05,00:16:10,"Were the expressions like, ""Oh, this is going to be shit."""
00:16:10,00:16:18,"Oh, where's my agent when you need him? So this is Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal"
00:16:18,00:16:23,"Skull, which is the fourth Indiana Jones film released in 2008. I saw it at midnight in the"
00:16:23,00:16:28,"cinema on the first night. Good on you. You had all the figurines already, didn't you?"
00:16:28,00:16:32,"I knew the whole lot, basically. Anyway, there were these Lego figures released,"
00:16:32,00:16:35,"and there were these little translucent skeletons, and basically fans worked out,"
00:16:35,00:16:40,"""Oh, there's an alien plot in the film,"" which there is because of the nature of the little"
00:16:40,00:16:45,"translucent Lego skeletons, and they also worked out that Cape Blanchett was a baddie,"
00:16:45,00:16:48,"and again, sorry spoilers. Did she have like a sad, like an angry face?"
00:16:48,00:16:53,"Yeah, the Lego figurine is frowning, and they released the merch before the film came out,"
00:16:53,00:16:57,"so fans were able to work it out, and as a result, the film was not well received. It was solely because"
00:16:57,00:17:03,"of this Lego thing. I think on your head bit, as a fan, if you're overanalyzing the Lego to that"
00:17:03,00:17:09,"extent, then you deserve that. Yeah, exactly. If you're a real fan, they make the merch way"
00:17:09,00:17:13,"in advance, don't they? I have to sign it off and clear it and all of that. It's quite hard to"
00:17:13,00:17:19,"keep things really secret. Although some withhold it, Star Wars now withhold some figurines to make"
00:17:19,00:17:24,sure that they don't give anything away. Because of what happened? Because of this terrible event.
00:17:24,00:17:32,"We all learn from the great mistakes, don't we? I think in one of the Star Wars films,"
00:17:32,00:17:35,"again, this is going to be full of spoilers this episode."
00:17:35,00:17:39,Only things released before the financial crisis fell in the air.
00:17:41,00:17:45,"There was a character called Ray, and the figurine was holding a lightsaber,"
00:17:45,00:17:50,which I believe gives away the fact that maybe she is a Jedi knight or master.
00:17:50,00:17:54,"You're not supposed to know that. And so they withheld that,"
00:17:54,00:17:58,"smart Star Wars people, until the film had been released. And this is the thing I was most outraged."
00:17:58,00:18:03,"I was looking at a list of things that Lego revealed in films, and most of it was stuff like,"
00:18:03,00:18:10,"""Come on, who cares?"" But in the first Shrek film... You don't understand film nerds."
00:18:10,00:18:16,"What do you mean, who cares? There would literally be like, ""Oh, this little thing revealed that there"
00:18:16,00:18:21,"was a scene involving grass."" Or ""This revealed that there were three family members."" Anyway,"
00:18:21,00:18:27,"but in the first Shrek film, Burger King released tie-in meal toys, kids' meal toys,"
00:18:27,00:18:31,"and there was a figurine, and I've seen it, and it has Fiona, the princess,"
00:18:31,00:18:35,"and it has her normal head with lovely pretty face and ginger hair. And then,"
00:18:35,00:18:41,"if you spun it round, it revealed her as an ogre. Now, as we all know, you don't learn that until"
00:18:41,00:18:48,"the very end of the film. Yeah, that's a big twist. It is a big twist. I remember being very excited"
00:18:48,00:18:52,"when I learned that. You haven't seen Shrek. No, no. Oh, I think you should. Should I? Yeah,"
00:18:52,00:18:56,"it's a good one. Well, I've got a child, I probably will at some stage, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:56,00:19:00,"On Lego, one thing I found really interesting is that if you have an idea for a Lego set,"
00:19:01,00:19:08,"they might make it for you. All you need is 10,000 supporters on Lego.com, however it is,"
00:19:08,00:19:13,"and then if you get 10,000 people to like your idea, then they'll review the idea and possibly"
00:19:13,00:19:18,"make it. That's great. So that's like the parliament thing, isn't it? If you get, or is it 100,000"
00:19:18,00:19:24,"people you need to sign a petition? Yeah, it's so considered. Exactly. So they're not like, if we"
00:19:24,00:19:27,"managed to get all of the fish fans to say we want to know six things of fish Lego,"
00:19:28,00:19:33,"then it might get to a level, but they might just go, ""Well, no, we're obviously not making one."""
00:19:33,00:19:38,"Could we ask all fish fans to make, ask parliament to make a Lego of fish?"
00:19:38,00:19:44,"We could get... Does parliament make Lego? No, but we could ask parliament to put pressure on Lego"
00:19:44,00:19:47,to make the fish. That feels like corruption of some sort. I don't like it. I feel like...
00:19:47,00:19:51,"Oh, there's no money involved. Apart from all the money we'll make from Lego."
00:19:51,00:19:55,"That's right, it's on this. No such thing as a fish Lego experience. It's going to be huge."
00:19:55,00:20:00,"Actually, there is money involved, because if it's your idea and you get 10,000 people and"
00:20:00,00:20:04,"they make it, you get 1% of all the money that Lego makes out of it, which is quite costly."
00:20:04,00:20:08,"All right, let's do it. I can't wait for the no such things as a fish ride at Legoland."
00:20:08,00:20:13,Listen to Dan explain a fact slowly and correctly.
00:20:13,00:20:18,People in the front carriage may get covered in yoghurt.
00:20:21,00:20:27,Don't forget to pack your anus because we're going to be pouring sugar all over it.
00:20:27,00:20:33,"So they've made a central perk from friends, but through this system."
00:20:33,00:20:39,"They've made a Seinfeld in general, like a Seinfeld Lego set. Oh, yeah."
00:20:39,00:20:43,"Yeah. And things that are not yet approved, but you can currently go on the Lego website"
00:20:43,00:20:47,and approve these if you like. A pirate dentist currently.
00:20:48,00:20:51,"A pirate dentist. I think they would go, say R."
00:20:51,00:20:58,"That's kind of a boat in a boat face kind of entry, isn't it? It's just this one gag that"
00:20:58,00:21:03,shouldn't really be. Yeah. The correlation of Charlemagne is currently there. Me.
00:21:03,00:21:07,"It's really going a long way from what kids want at this point, isn't it?"
00:21:07,00:21:10,But there are so many adult Lego fans and Lego makers.
00:21:10,00:21:16,Afol. This is completely their fault. The reason that these stupid things happen
00:21:16,00:21:20,"where lots of sad adults, tens of thousands of sign these petitions for new Lego pieces."
00:21:20,00:21:23,"Okay, well, they might listen to podcast too, Anna, so."
00:21:23,00:21:28,"No, I do obviously think it's very cool, but it is Afol's and they were a huge deal"
00:21:28,00:21:32,"and they used to get ignored. You're going to get a brickthread through your window,"
00:21:32,00:21:38,"but it'll be a very tiny plastic one. Yeah, look out for that tiny, tiny window you've got in your flesh."
00:21:38,00:21:42,A little Lego Seinfeld banging on the door.
00:21:44,00:21:48,"No, they, so they, there have always been adult fans of Lego and they got more and more vocal"
00:21:48,00:21:52,"up to the nineties and the early 2000s. And Lego, the company thought they were quite annoying and"
00:21:52,00:21:57,kept getting all these letters suggesting possible design ideas and actually put signs on their website
00:21:57,00:22:02,"and, you know, on their merchandise saying, we do not take ideas, unsolicited ideas."
00:22:02,00:22:06,"And, you know, if you speak to people who worked at Lego at the time, they'd say it was so irritating."
00:22:06,00:22:09,Adults were taking an interest in Lego and it wasn't meant to be for adults.
00:22:09,00:22:14,"And then they almost went bankrupt because they started almost child defying Lego. So they'd,"
00:22:14,00:22:18,they'd sell sets that were kind of almost completely made that were just for the play
00:22:18,00:22:23,element rather than the build element. 2003 Lego was in serious trouble and someone in the
00:22:23,00:22:28,"company said, guys, should we start listening to all these adult nerds and disposable income?"
00:22:28,00:22:34,"They did disposable income and they created an Afol engagement team, the adult fans of Lego"
00:22:34,00:22:39,"engagement team. Was there a kind of summit where they were trying to bring in the Afol,"
00:22:39,00:22:43,"the Afols? Yeah, there was actually, well, they, Lego went to one of these unofficial Lego"
00:22:43,00:22:47,"conventions and said, okay, guys, we'll start listening to you. That, I guess, that was their"
00:22:47,00:22:51,summit. That was their big peace agreement. Did they go in disguise and sort of whip off their
00:22:51,00:22:58,robes? And it turns out it's like a massive Lego minifigure. Exactly reveal their yellow
00:22:58,00:23:04,"claw hands. There is a, there was an app that was released last year. It was not an official one,"
00:23:04,00:23:09,but it was a Lego app. It was called brick it quite good name. And what it's for when you're
00:23:09,00:23:16,"nervous about something terrified of your Lego. Yeah, it's a therapy app. No, it was, it was you"
00:23:16,00:23:21,"photograph your pile of Lego with your smartphone camera, and it will tell you what to build."
00:23:21,00:23:26,"And it gives you instructions. Like it says, you've got these pieces you can make Father Christmas"
00:23:26,00:23:32,"out of Lego. And it gives you instructions about how to do it. And then if you see your, you know,"
00:23:32,00:23:35,"this design and you think, oh, where's that red one that I need for the hat or whatever,"
00:23:35,00:23:39,"you can't find it in your pile of Lego, you go back to the photo you took that you scanned,"
00:23:39,00:23:42,"and it says, look, it's there. It's there in the pile, you idiot. That's brilliant."
00:23:42,00:23:48,"It's an amazing work for jigsaws. That would be good, wouldn't it? You just scan it and it says"
00:23:48,00:23:55,"this one goes here. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I suspect that removes the main point of a jigsaw. Well,"
00:23:55,00:24:00,"maybe I didn't know maybe this does too, but it's a, yeah, it's a pretty clever machine learning"
00:24:00,00:24:06,style thing. So there's a guy called Adam Beadle on YouTube and he's made a machine. It's like a
00:24:06,00:24:12,pes dispenser for little Legos. And it's attached to a webcam. And the webcam is swivels so it can
00:24:12,00:24:19,"move around. And the webcam can tell where you are. It can recognize your socks, say for instance."
00:24:19,00:24:25,"And so it can sign a swivel round, look for your feet and then fire Lego under your feet."
00:24:25,00:24:31,"So wherever you walk, you always stand on Lego. Was this invented by Kevin and home alone or something?"
00:24:31,00:24:41,I wanted to build a machine learning app to find four leaf clovers. So you take a picture of a
00:24:41,00:24:46,"clover patch and it would say, yeah, here's the four leaf clover. And I spoke to a lot of people"
00:24:46,00:24:50,"about it. And they said that actually, for some reason, artificial intelligence isn't very good"
00:24:50,00:24:55,at counting things. So it would be quite difficult because you've got to recognize leaves coming from
00:24:55,00:24:59,"the same thing and then count how many of them. So like, there's a lot of these image generation"
00:24:59,00:25:05,"AIs out there. You say, you know, draw me a picture of a bird with three legs or whatever,"
00:25:05,00:25:11,"and it'll draw this picture and it'll have like 17 legs. I don't understand why, but it's an"
00:25:11,00:25:16,"interesting thing. The one thing computers are good at, but not artificial intelligence for"
00:25:16,00:25:23,"some reason. I remember reading years ago, there was a record for the most four leaf clovers found"
00:25:23,00:25:28,"in a certain area. And it was in a prison just outside London, I think. And all the prisoners"
00:25:28,00:25:33,had started finding four leaf clovers because there'd been some genetic mutation. Or I think
00:25:33,00:25:38,"the clover has grown extra leaf when there's some problem, like there's some acid in the start."
00:25:39,00:25:43,But it's just like. And did they all magically break out of prison the next day? They're not
00:25:43,00:25:47,"really turned in. They're just not very lucky, are they? They're in prison already, they've been"
00:25:47,00:25:53,"caught. So I mean, yeah. Yeah, that's really funny. Do you think it's still lucky if robots"
00:25:53,00:25:57,"find your four leaf clover? That feels like you're cheating luck of days. No, I think it's fine."
00:25:57,00:26:03,"Okay, great. I think it's solved. I think it probably is still lucky. I don't know. You can buy"
00:26:03,00:26:09,"four leaf clovers. Oh, that's not lucky. That's definitely not lucky. We can buy horse shoes."
00:26:09,00:26:19,They're so hard to find in nature. That's true. I thought they were unlucky if you hang them upside
00:26:19,00:26:23,"down. Yeah, but then everyone says they're supposed to be one way and then everyone,"
00:26:23,00:26:27,the other people say they're supposed to be the other way. No one can tell whether they're supposed
00:26:27,00:26:33,to be the rounded bit down or the rounded bit up. It seems like different parts of the country
00:26:33,00:26:39,"have different things. So I have a horseshoe in my house, but it's on its side. Because I thought"
00:26:39,00:26:44,that's the best place they're supposed to be is flat on the ground with a horse standing on top
00:26:44,00:26:55,"of it. Like everything else is misplacing for those. Okay, time for fact number three, and that is"
00:26:55,00:27:00,"James. Okay, my fact this week is that one of the most environmentally friendly ways to catch"
00:27:00,00:27:09,scallops is to set up an underwater scallop disco. And lure them in with sounds of... The macarena?
00:27:09,00:27:14,"Is that seafood based? I was desperately craving for any songs that might be... Ah, I was going"
00:27:14,00:27:22,"disco. Aqua. Aqua's quite disco. Aqua would have been a good one. On topic, Barbie Girl. Go on,"
00:27:22,00:27:30,"so they like disco music. They do. Well, no, they don't. They like disco lights."
00:27:30,00:27:35,And this is a press release from the University of York that I read. And it's about some work
00:27:35,00:27:40,"that they did with FishTech Marine, which is a fisheries company from Devon. And what they were"
00:27:40,00:27:46,trying to do is they were trying to put lights into crab and lobster pots. And they were hoping
00:27:46,00:27:50,that they would catch a load of crabs and lobsters. But what they actually... So do they think crabs
00:27:50,00:27:53,and lobsters would be attracted by the lights? They thought they might be. But it turns out that
00:27:53,00:27:59,"crabs and lobsters, they're more of going to the movies kind of animals. They like jazz. They like"
00:27:59,00:28:06,"going to watch Indiana Jones at midnight. But actually, scallops, they love the lights. They"
00:28:06,00:28:10,love the disco lights. And they kind of went down and looked at these pots that they were
00:28:10,00:28:15,expecting to have crabs and lobsters in and found just a billion scallops. And the interesting thing
00:28:15,00:28:20,"is that the current best way of catching scallops, and when I say best way, I mean most efficient way,"
00:28:20,00:28:25,"very much not the best way for the environment, is to use dredges. So loads of claws that go down"
00:28:25,00:28:30,to the bottom of the ocean and drag the bottom of the ocean. And the scallops come up and you catch
00:28:30,00:28:35,"them from there. And obviously, this is not a sustainable way to catch seafood. Because it"
00:28:35,00:28:42,drags up so much other stuff with it. It basically turns over the seabed. It's awful. But this could
00:28:42,00:28:46,be a much better way of doing it by putting some disco lights down there. Do you think because they
00:28:46,00:28:50,have hundreds of eyes? And do you think they love the disco lights? Because they've got so many eyes.
00:28:50,00:28:53,It's like going to a disco that's 500 times better than ours. There is a suggestion that it might be
00:28:53,00:28:58,"that because most animals that live under the sea don't have great eyesight, but they do have these"
00:28:58,00:29:04,"amazing 200 eyes. And each of their eyes have two retinas, one that responds to light and one that"
00:29:04,00:29:10,responds to darkness. And so they have this incredible complex sight. Perhaps that's the reason
00:29:10,00:29:15,"that they're attracted to the lights. We don't know to be honest, but the fact is that it works"
00:29:15,00:29:21,"and it could save the environment a little bit. And most of the scallop that you see on your plate,"
00:29:21,00:29:30,"if you order a scallop in a restaurant, you'll get this sort of white cylinder of flesh."
00:29:30,00:29:37,"Doesn't sound as appealing. They're very delicious things. That's kind of what a sausage is,"
00:29:37,00:29:43,"isn't it? It's a cylinder of flesh. Yeah, exactly. They're the sausages of the sea. They're nature"
00:29:43,00:29:52,"sausage. So that is not the whole scallop. That's not the whole animal. You know, that's just the"
00:29:52,00:29:56,"adductor muscle, which is this. So they have this incredibly powerful muscle that they use to open"
00:29:56,00:30:03,and close the shell. And you're not eating the 200 beautiful tiny eyes. And the eyes are so small
00:30:03,00:30:08,as well. The eyes are the size of a poppy seed. And each of their eyes is on its own tentacle.
00:30:09,00:30:17,"Isn't that cool? And they can kind of peer. What's that over there? So each of their eyes,"
00:30:17,00:30:21,"because they have mirrors at the back of their eyes. I think, did you say that, James? Well,"
00:30:21,00:30:26,"they've got two retinas, but each eye has a mirror, which is made of millions of small square"
00:30:26,00:30:32,"tiles. It's weird because it's almost like a disco bowl. Oh my God. Yeah, you're right."
00:30:33,00:30:40,"One of their own when they see the disco bowl. So okay, you're in the eye. You've got the mirror,"
00:30:40,00:30:45,which is made of millions of square tiles. But those mirrors are each made of 20 or 30 layers
00:30:45,00:30:51,"of a substance called guanine. And so guanine is one of the main ingredients of DNA, among"
00:30:51,00:30:56,lots of other things. It is what gives fish their silvery tint sometimes on that sort of gleamy
00:30:56,00:31:00,tint. That's guanine. That's what you're saying. And it's also what chameleons use to change the
00:31:00,00:31:06,"colour of their skin. There's one chemical or substance. Yeah, crystals, doesn't it? Yeah."
00:31:06,00:31:12,"In the skin of chameleons. Yeah, so cool. And that's just scallops going around, you know."
00:31:12,00:31:18,"And they have growth rings like trees. Do they? Yeah, you can tell the age of a scallop by its rings."
00:31:18,00:31:26,"It's sound that you have to chop them down first though. No. Yeah, each ring on their shell."
00:31:26,00:31:30,"It's the rings that radiate out of the shell, as it were, obviously. So each ring represents a"
00:31:30,00:31:36,"year of growth, unless apparently it represents a stressful incident. So it might be that they've"
00:31:36,00:31:40,"had an incredibly stressful life, in which case they're going to see much older than they are,"
00:31:40,00:31:44,"much like humans. Like humans, yeah. Like they've got a lot of pressure at work or something like"
00:31:44,00:31:48,"that. Yeah, yeah. It's a big report to hand in and they're trying to raise a kid at the same time,"
00:31:48,00:31:54,whatever. They've been dredged. It is mostly the dredging that a stressful incident will usually
00:31:54,00:31:59,"be you're caught in a net. And so you deposit an extra layer in your panic, apparently."
00:31:59,00:32:04,I read an article with some scientists who reckon that if we mass produced
00:32:04,00:32:10,"oysters and mussels and scallops and stuff, then that could be the way to solve the world's nutrition"
00:32:10,00:32:16,problems. And the main problem that they found is that most people don't like oysters and mussels.
00:32:16,00:32:20,"Yeah, but if you mass produce anything, it's the answer to the world's nutrition problems."
00:32:20,00:32:25,"Well, the reason there's a few reasons. And the reason is because we have a lot of coastline,"
00:32:25,00:32:29,"which is suitable for it. Using just 1% of the available coastline, we'd be able to get the"
00:32:29,00:32:36,protein for a billion people. Bivalves have higher protein content than beef does. They also have
00:32:36,00:32:41,"lots of key nutrients that we need. So vitamin A, they have iodine, they have omega three, they've"
00:32:41,00:32:45,got loads of stuff like that. And the other thing is they've come up with this new way of feeding
00:32:45,00:32:52,"them with like little, they call them bullets of nutrition. So it's a really cheap way of feeding"
00:32:52,00:32:59,"the bivalves. They make it using algae, so it's very cheap to get as well. But also you can put"
00:32:59,00:33:03,"stuff in these little bullets, so you can put flavorings in them, you can put more nutrition"
00:33:03,00:33:10,in them. What flavors do they like? Do they love sour flavors? Does the flavor end up in them?
00:33:10,00:33:15,"Yes, because they filter feed us. So because they filter feed, they keep a lot of the chemicals"
00:33:15,00:33:22,inside themselves. So you can put a little sour patch kid flavor into your muscle. And then when
00:33:22,00:33:27,"you eat it, you'll get all of this goodness, all of this protein. And you'll be able to"
00:33:27,00:33:34,you'll be able to have whatever flavor you want. I don't want to rub an oyster on my anus though.
00:33:37,00:33:41,"Well, you have to. You always have to draw a line on a first date."
00:33:41,00:33:49,"I have a related story about hepatitis A. Oh, yeah. So there was an outbreak of hepatitis A"
00:33:49,00:33:55,"in the Netherlands. And by sequencing the genome of the virus, they traced the outbreak back to"
00:33:55,00:34:02,Bangor in Wales. And none of the people that got it in the Netherlands had been to Bangor in Wales.
00:34:02,00:34:10,The family that had it in Wales didn't visit the Netherlands. So this one family visited the
00:34:10,00:34:16,"Caribbean, where it's endemic. And they didn't take vaccinations. Family from Wales? Yeah, in Bangor."
00:34:16,00:34:21,They came back to Bangor. They brought hepatitis A back to Bangor. And they stayed at home because
00:34:21,00:34:25,they knew they were real. But they were going to the toilet a lot. And they were shedding these
00:34:25,00:34:32,"virus particles into the sewage system. And by bad luck, there was a lot of rain at the time."
00:34:32,00:34:41,"And it overwhelmed the sewage system. So it ended up in the estuary in Bangor, which is a big muscle"
00:34:41,00:34:46,"fishery. Wow. We're all, all three of us looking at you thinking, how is this going to get to the"
00:34:46,00:34:51,Netherlands? I think I know that. I think you're probably all in there. The muscle fishery was the
00:34:51,00:34:58,giveaway. And their filter feeders. So the tide is moving in and out. This infected water is
00:34:58,00:35:04,"flowing back and forth over these filter feeders. They're gathering this, these virus particles."
00:35:04,00:35:07,"We're harvesting them. We're selling them around the world. And that particular batch,"
00:35:07,00:35:11,a lot of it went to the Netherlands. That is incredible. And that is also the downside of
00:35:11,00:35:16,my plan of feeding the world with high valves. Because it just takes one family from Bangor
00:35:16,00:35:24,"and we're all fucked. And a downpour. In Poland, they use clams to automatically"
00:35:26,00:35:36,"regulate their water systems. In Warsaw. So they have these clams in a room somewhere,"
00:35:36,00:35:42,"but they've got water from the system flowing over them. And if the clams shut, it's because the"
00:35:42,00:35:48,"water quality is low, but they've got a little like lever attached to the shell of the clam."
00:35:48,00:35:54,"And so when it closes, it hits a little button and automates the shutdown. So we know the quality"
00:35:54,00:36:00,"of the water in Botticelli's Venus was good because it was open, she was standing up. And if"
00:36:00,00:36:06,"Dodgy Water had entered that system, it would have been crushed. Do you know why he had a"
00:36:06,00:36:11,scallop shell Botticelli in that painting? So it's the famous painting of Venus and she's
00:36:11,00:36:17,"floating it on a seashell. Yeah, yeah. Improvisably large one. Yeah. I think it was a giant clam."
00:36:17,00:36:21,"I think she was tiny, wasn't she? I think yeah. Even giant clams aren't big enough to hold an"
00:36:21,00:36:30,"entire woman. Why was it? Well, it was based on a Spanish shrine of St. James of Compostela."
00:36:30,00:36:37,"And St. James of Compostela was associated with the scallop. Few reasons may be why one, because"
00:36:37,00:36:43,the scallop's lines represent the different routes travelled by pilgrims to go and visit his remains.
00:36:43,00:36:47,Santiago de Compostela is a pilgrimage. Exactly. It's this one. It takes a month.
00:36:48,00:36:53,"And also, possibly because when they got the remains of St. James originally, they were covered"
00:36:53,00:36:57,in scallop shells because he was in the water. One of those. Why was he devoured? Is that how he
00:36:57,00:37:04,"was invited to invite scallops? Wow. Because one of them lands on you. You think, oh, that's an"
00:37:04,00:37:08,"irritation, but I can deal with that. And then the second one lands and then you see, you know,"
00:37:08,00:37:12,"them all fluttering through the water towards you. It'd be a terrifying horror movie. Well,"
00:37:12,00:37:16,"it's The Eternal. Would you rather question, would you rather fight like one shark or a thousand"
00:37:16,00:37:24,"scallops? Anyway, one shark-sized scallop or a hundred scallop-sized sharks."
00:37:24,00:37:35,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna. My fact this week is that scientists,"
00:37:36,00:37:43,"stupid scientists, still... Editorializing in the facts. We've done it before. I feel strongly"
00:37:43,00:37:50,about this one. I'm still saying that climate change is real. That's my fact over and out.
00:37:50,00:37:58,"No, my fact is that scientists still can't decide if hot water freezes faster than cold water."
00:37:58,00:38:05,"And it's true. It's a thing called the Pemba effect. If it's the case that hot water, you know,"
00:38:05,00:38:09,"if you start freezing a glass of hot water and a glass of cold water, the Pemba effect is if the"
00:38:09,00:38:16,hot water freezes faster than the cold water. And it's bizarrely complicated to test. I think
00:38:16,00:38:21,"there are lots of problems with it. So it's hard to define when freezing starts. Like, is it when"
00:38:21,00:38:25,certain crystals start to form? Is it when the whole thing freezes? Is it hard to identify when
00:38:25,00:38:30,"those crystals have started to form? Or is it when the temperature drops down to zero? And anyway,"
00:38:30,00:38:35,people have been saying for thousands of years that this is a phenomenon. Aristotle said it in
00:38:35,00:38:40,350 BC. He said hot water freezes faster than cold. People sort of forgot about it for hundreds of
00:38:40,00:38:44,"years. So I think, you know, it was, it was a thing with like Francis Bacon said it in the 17th"
00:38:44,00:38:51,"century. And then in the 1960s, there was a Tanzanian boy called Erasto Pemba, which is why it's"
00:38:51,00:38:57,"called the Pemba effect, who noticed it again. And we started studying it. It's great. It's really"
00:38:57,00:39:06,"great this this effect. Is it real though? Well, in order for it to work, right, when the hot water"
00:39:06,00:39:12,"is freezing, it must at some stage overtake the cold water. Yeah, for that to be true. But that"
00:39:12,00:39:17,"means that when those two waters are the same temperature, the one that was previously hot must"
00:39:17,00:39:23,"somehow remember that it was hot. So yeah, so that was the big thing that they've discovered that"
00:39:23,00:39:30,"they have proved that it's possible in general for a system to behave in this way, like in a really"
00:39:30,00:39:36,"abstract sense, you can have a system that, you know, is approaching some equilibrium point,"
00:39:36,00:39:42,approaching some temperature. And it's possible in general that if you are further away from that
00:39:42,00:39:47,"point, you can get there quicker, but they haven't shown it specifically for water. It's the tortoise"
00:39:47,00:39:55,"and the hare. I think of it as being like, if you have to heat the oven to 180 degrees, you can"
00:39:55,00:40:01,"if it was frozen, and you started from frozen, it would be quicker. That's not what I'd,"
00:40:01,00:40:07,I will put it to 250 degrees so that it has to get up. I think I better get a move on.
00:40:07,00:40:13,"I've got to rush. Very different to what actually is happening. When it gets to 180,"
00:40:13,00:40:16,you just pop it back down and the light goes off and you've saved time.
00:40:16,00:40:21,"No, you know you're definitely wasting your time when you do that because of the way ovens work,"
00:40:21,00:40:26,right? I have a hunch that my oven knows there's pressure. He needs to get there.
00:40:26,00:40:29,"I do exactly the same. It's the way that Anthony works with deadlines, isn't it?"
00:40:29,00:40:34,"I am exactly the same as you. You know every time with the oven, I know it's completely logical."
00:40:34,00:40:37,"Obviously, it makes no difference, but I do. If you're in a rush, you put it on as hot as"
00:40:37,00:40:42,"possible. It's not going to make a difference how long it takes to get to 100 degrees. Anyway,"
00:40:42,00:40:48,that's completely unrelated to the implementation. Agree to disagree. Just to get back to you.
00:40:48,00:40:55,"How can it remember what it did? There are various ways. For example, it might be that the"
00:40:55,00:41:00,"hotter water freezes from the outside first, so you've got this structural difference."
00:41:00,00:41:05,"You've got this casing of ice around an unfrozen center, whereas that doesn't happen"
00:41:05,00:41:11,with the other ones. There could be an actual mechanism of accelerating towards freezing.
00:41:11,00:41:16,"One idea is there might be more eddy currents in it, which somehow causes it to freeze quicker."
00:41:16,00:41:19,Those eddy currents remain after that transition point has happened.
00:41:19,00:41:24,"Sort of mini whirlpools. One idea is that cold water might super cool,"
00:41:24,00:41:28,so it has to go to a lower temperature before it freezes.
00:41:28,00:41:33,"Can we talk about Erasto Mpemba, the student who the thing is named after? He did it. He"
00:41:33,00:41:38,"discovered this effect if it's real and clearly opinion varies around the table,"
00:41:38,00:41:42,"but he was making ice cream. He was 13 years old and he was at school making ice cream,"
00:41:42,00:41:46,"and his method was you boil the milk to make it with. You mix it with the sugar,"
00:41:46,00:41:51,"you put it in the freezer bit of the fridge, but there was a rush for fridge space. He had boiled"
00:41:51,00:41:56,"his milk already, but he saw another boy run to the fridge without boiling the milk and shove"
00:41:56,00:42:03,his milk and thing in there. He and the other boy put their milk and sugar mixes into the
00:42:03,00:42:08,"freezer at the same time. I think it was, was it not that the other boy let his milk cool down"
00:42:08,00:42:13,"first and then put it in, whereas he put it in while it was boiling. They basically put two trays"
00:42:13,00:42:20,"of milk and sugar in at the same time. One of it, his was boiling hot and the others was already"
00:42:20,00:42:23,"cooled. And when he and the other boy went back, his tray had frozen into ice cream. The other"
00:42:23,00:42:29,boys hadn't frozen into ice cream. It's proved. And he took a situation to a physics lecturer
00:42:29,00:42:33,"at his school called Dennis Osborne, and they co-wrote a paper which was just called Cool,"
00:42:33,00:42:37,"which I love. Well actually, he first of all took the situation to his teacher,"
00:42:37,00:42:44,"who said, ""You're an idiot. That doesn't happen."" So he asked this teacher a question about it,"
00:42:44,00:42:49,"and the teacher said, ""That is Mpemba's physics and not the universal physics."" And it became"
00:42:49,00:42:53,"like a running joke at his school. Every time there was a mistake, he would be told,"
00:42:53,00:42:57,"""That is Mpemba's mathematics. He's been made a mass error."" And anyway, Mpemba's name has now"
00:42:57,00:43:01,"been remembered, and the teacher who took a mickey out of him, his name is now Dust. So..."
00:43:01,00:43:08,"Dead in the water. Do you know by sheer coincidence when Mpemba discovered this thing about hot water,"
00:43:08,00:43:13,"his effect, there was a Canadian scientist called Dr. Kel, who at pretty much exactly the same time"
00:43:13,00:43:17,"wrote a paper saying the same thing. It having not been mentioned for over a century, he discovered"
00:43:17,00:43:20,"the same thing. That's one of those weird things, isn't it? Like the Dennis the Menace thing when"
00:43:20,00:43:25,"two Dennis the Menaces were created. Were they? That's a cool fact. Yeah, the same week a Dennis"
00:43:25,00:43:29,"the Menace was created in America as there was in Britain, and they were quite so. They were both"
00:43:29,00:43:37,"young schoolboys. Isn't that called Morphic Resonance? Well, that's interesting. That sounds"
00:43:37,00:43:44,"like bullshit. That's Sheldrake's idea of Morphic Resonance, and that's the idea that he said it was"
00:43:44,00:43:51,"in the 70s, there was a few blue tits that learned how to peck into milk bottles, and then suddenly,"
00:43:51,00:43:56,"within a week, everyone had noticed that in the whole country, all these blue tits were learning"
00:43:56,00:44:01,"how to do it, and he thought there was some kind of special psychic way that all of these"
00:44:01,00:44:06,animals had managed to learn stuff. So I was trying to explain Morphic Resonance to someone
00:44:06,00:44:11,"last night, but I couldn't remember what the example was, and the blue tits and the milk bottles"
00:44:11,00:44:17,"is a really good one, and I misremembered it as. So you know cattle grids? This is real. This is real."
00:44:22,00:44:28,I remember that cows had learned to roll over cattle grids. You're so close. You're so close.
00:44:28,00:44:31,"That would like within three weeks of each other, cows across the planet were rolling"
00:44:31,00:44:37,"across cattle grids. You're really close, but it's sheep, and sheep had learned how to roll"
00:44:37,00:44:41,"across them. Damn it. Again, there was lots of anecdotal evidence from different farmers that"
00:44:41,00:44:47,"that had happened, but no one, even in the world of smartphones, no one has ever been able to video"
00:44:47,00:44:52,this actually happening. They're not idiots. They're not going to do it in front of people with
00:44:52,00:44:58,"smartphones. Oh, wow. So I got closer to that. I feel like a cow, once it's halfway across rolling"
00:44:58,00:45:01,"across a cattle grid, probably won't be able to get the rest of the way along. Yeah, I cannot"
00:45:01,00:45:07,"believe you confused those, because the idea of a cow rolling across anything is, I don't know if"
00:45:07,00:45:11,"it can happen. Yeah, it does explain why. Or as you can roll a sheep easily, can't you? You can roll"
00:45:11,00:45:17,"a sheep. Can a sheep roll itself, though? That's the question. You can tip a cow, but you can roll"
00:45:17,00:45:22,a sheep. And that's why I tell the difference between sheep and a cow. That's why you're a farming
00:45:22,00:45:29,crew. I also have an effect named after me. Really? The mold effect. The mold effect.
00:45:29,00:45:34,"No, you're just talking about molding. No, no, I made a video about this thing that I accidentally"
00:45:34,00:45:37,"discovered, which I assumed had already been discovered, but I couldn't find anything about it"
00:45:37,00:45:42,"on the internet. If you get a chain of beads, a bead chain like the type you see at the side of"
00:45:42,00:45:49,"blinds that you used to get about 50 meters of it, feed it into a pot, and then take the end of it"
00:45:49,00:45:54,"and allow it to fall out of the pot. The whole pot empties, which is already known and understood."
00:45:54,00:46:00,But what happens is it rises above the pot first. It's really cool. It sort of rears up. I see the
00:46:00,00:46:06,"answer. The further it has to fall, the higher it goes. I got it to go two and a half meters"
00:46:06,00:46:12,"out of the pot by dropping it at about 90 meters. It's a long story, but I was making a video about"
00:46:12,00:46:16,polymers. There's a polymer called polyethylene oxide. If you make a solution of it and start
00:46:16,00:46:22,"to pour it out of the beaker, it all pours out. It's self-pouring polymer. You don't have to tip"
00:46:22,00:46:25,the whole thing up. It all just comes out in one go. I wanted to make a physical model of that.
00:46:25,00:46:31,"I'd seen it done with plastic beads before, a chain of beads. The beads self-siphon,"
00:46:31,00:46:35,but it doesn't rise up if you use plastic beads. I thought I'll use metal beads because it'll look
00:46:35,00:46:39,"nicer and it'll discover this thing that goes around. Wouldn't it be amazing if that effect,"
00:46:39,00:46:44,"which you described, then becomes very important in something else? It would be amazing."
00:46:44,00:46:49,"And then in a billion years' time, everyone's like, ""Did you know that the person who the"
00:46:49,00:46:55,"mould effect was named after was once on a podcast?"" That's some idiot. To be able to"
00:46:55,00:46:59,"prove that part of the explanation, it'd be amazing to see the beads moving in zero gravity."
00:46:59,00:47:03,"And so I put a call out, ""Is there any way to get the beads on the International Space Station?"""
00:47:03,00:47:09,And it's happened. The beads went up in a rocket. I think it was in May.
00:47:09,00:47:15,Commander Samantha Christofferetti has the beads. She hasn't done the experiment yet.
00:47:15,00:47:18,"She's got a lot on, probably. She's busy, but she will do it at some point."
00:47:18,00:47:20,What if it wrecks the ISS?
00:47:20,00:47:25,"God, they get loaded with so much crap. I always feel sorry for them."
00:47:25,00:47:32,"The old mould effect, obviously, is going to be groundbreaking, but I always think with"
00:47:32,00:47:36,"astronauts and NASA, it's like, ""Oh, what? I have to put this weird plant on for this kid."
00:47:36,00:47:38,"It's bloke. I'm just lucky to bring up his experiment."""
00:47:38,00:47:46,"I was looking at some experiments that I could try at home, and as I mentioned a few times,"
00:47:46,00:47:54,got a new baby. And Jean-Jacques Rousseau thought that he thought that humans were fundamentally
00:47:54,00:48:00,good as children. And any kind of evilness in humans was all society corrupting people.
00:48:01,00:48:04,"And so there was a guy called Richard Lovell Edgeworth, and he was the guy who invented the"
00:48:04,00:48:12,"conveyor belt. What have you done, James? He also thought that he would try and raise his son,"
00:48:12,00:48:18,"who was called Richard Jr., to be like Rousseau said, and be permanently good. So he wouldn't"
00:48:18,00:48:23,"let him get involved in society. Just let him run around in the garden and stuff. Anyway,"
00:48:23,00:48:29,"by the age of eight, he had become what Edgeworth described as an ungovernable child of nature."
00:48:30,00:48:34,And he had to ship him off to a seminary. What? He's just sort of gone savage?
00:48:34,00:48:39,He's just gone savage. Wow. And there was another psychologist called Clarence Luba.
00:48:39,00:48:46,And Clarence thought that children only laughed when they're tickled because their parents laugh.
00:48:46,00:48:52,"So the idea is I tickle my daughter. My daughter laughs, but she's only laughing because I'm enjoying"
00:48:52,00:48:59,it so much. And basically tickling is a learned thing. And so he invented some cardboard shield
00:48:59,00:49:04,"masks that he would, him and his wife would wear every time that they tickle their child"
00:49:04,00:49:11,in the hope that the child would never learn how to laugh when tickled. But by the time the child
00:49:11,00:49:16,"was seven months old, it was still laughing whenever it was tickled. But he thought that"
00:49:16,00:49:21,his hypothesis was still true. And maybe his wife was not fully observing the tickling rules.
00:49:21,00:49:27,Your poor wife had been working for this weird man covered mask tickle experiment.
00:49:27,00:49:32,"The child's terrified of both of you at this stage. Darling, we have a tickling protocol."
00:49:32,00:49:41,"My ad hoc hypothesis about laughing and tickling, which means it's just an idea that I've got,"
00:49:41,00:49:49,is that it's a way to teach self-defense through play. So the sensation of being tickled is
00:49:49,00:49:55,"unpleasant, right? So if kids just cried when you tickled them, you wouldn't do it. But they laugh."
00:49:55,00:49:58,"And so as a parent, you think, oh, I've got to make them laugh. It's, someone may feel so good"
00:49:58,00:50:02,"to make my kids laugh. So you, and you think about where you tickle kids, it's in those vulnerable"
00:50:02,00:50:09,places where you could get her like the neck armpits. So I think it's this way of like encouraging
00:50:09,00:50:14,"parents to do things that kids that actually don't really enjoy, but it's, it's, it's a form of"
00:50:14,00:50:18,learning self-defense. Are you saying it's like the sensation of being attacked by a wild animal?
00:50:18,00:50:22,"Yes. And you're kind of. So you're not very good at self-defense when you're being tickled,"
00:50:22,00:50:27,are you? Because I've never successfully fought off a tickle. Maybe I wasn't tickled enough to
00:50:27,00:50:32,"know. You have to go for the, you have to go for the eyes. Yeah. And the crotch. You know, you're"
00:50:32,00:50:39,shucking an eye guarantee. One theory about the tickling is that it's like if insects are getting
00:50:39,00:50:43,"on, you like poisonous insects. And it's to the reason that it's unpleasant. And the reason you"
00:50:43,00:50:50,"want to stop it is because in the olden days before iPads, you might have been in the Serengeti"
00:50:50,00:50:53,"and there were dangerous insects climbing on you. Yeah, but that makes sense. But why the laugh?"
00:50:53,00:50:58,"But it's not funny. Well, it's not for you. I mean, it's funny for everyone else in the,"
00:50:58,00:51:01,in the camping trip. I think the same argument then about it being a protection thing. It's a
00:51:01,00:51:05,defense thing. Yeah. So we're teaching our children to defend themselves. Why would you laugh
00:51:05,00:51:08,"as a defense? No, you should defend yourself. You're trying to stop. You're physically defending"
00:51:08,00:51:12,"yourself. You're wiggling. No, no. But why the laughing? Like you want, I understand this tickle,"
00:51:12,00:51:16,"you're obviously fighting off. Do encourage the parents. I get the, I love the parents theory."
00:51:17,00:51:22,"To stimulate the child so that they defend themselves against insects. So, no, hang on,"
00:51:22,00:51:28,"we've got it. It's for the, the child laughs to make sure the parent keeps on wiggling the child,"
00:51:28,00:51:34,"to encourage the child to learn how to fight off an insect swarm. I completely understood that,"
