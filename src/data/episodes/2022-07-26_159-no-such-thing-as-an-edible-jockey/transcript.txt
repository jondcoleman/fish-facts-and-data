 Hey guys, just a quick announcement before we begin this week's show which is that we are going on tour
 We are going all over the country and there are tickets available now
 We're gonna nodding him. We're gonna Manchester, London, Lester, Dunstable, Birmingham, Coventry
 Yeah, and there are more dates coming up, aren't there?
 There are indeed, but we're not allowed to say where they are yet
 But there'll be a bit further from the center of England than those places that Dan's just mentioned
 Yeah, it's gonna be so much fun. We're putting together this whole fantastic first half full of stupid games and extra
 bits and interactive bits, and in the second half we're gonna record an episode of the podcast
 Yep, so if you want to see any or all preferably all of that then go to qi.com/fishevents and you can get your tickets there
 Okay, on with the show
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anitzenski and Andrew Hunter Murray
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones of our four favorite facts from the last seven days
 And in no particular order, here we go
 Starting with you, James
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1966 the Chinese press reported that a 73-year-old German Mao had swam 15 kilometres of the Yangtze River in 65 minutes
 That's twice the speed that Michael Phelps has ever swam
 75, imagine what he could do at 40
 73
 73
 It's amazing that you're given a number and you just remember a different number
 No, I confused it with 65 minutes
 So I took the seven from the year and I took the five from the minutes
 Wait, may I have 73 kilometres in 15 minutes?
 I don't know
 He swam 1966 kilometres and 65 seconds
 Okay, wow, can you say the numbers again?
 Yes, year 1966, age 73, distance 15 kilometres and time 65 minutes
 And the thing is, I've read about this and it's possible that he might have been carried along
 by some very, very strong currents
 Right, but then I wonder if that's really swimming
 It's not, it's because it could be floating
 But he had floating bodyguards with him
 Yeah, he did
 And huge portraits of himself
 So there's a picture of him floating along with these six bodyguards around him
 And then these giant pictures of Chairman Mao floating alongside him in front of him
 But wait, when you say they were floating bodyguards
 What were they?
 They were swimming, too
 And they managed to keep up with the fastest swimmer
 And maybe that's why there were six, they were positioned strategically further up
 And after the river
 An improvement to Olympic swimming would be to have a giant raft with the swimmer's face on it
 Going behind it
 Because often when the water you don't know who it is
 But if there's a massive raft with Michael Phelps' face going behind it
 Yes, that's great
 It's interesting he spent so much time in a body of order because he never bathed
 Chairman Mao
 In order to wash himself he would have servants wipe him up and down with towels
 Yeah, yeah, so just wet towels
 In fact, and this is a bit early in the podcast to be going into this territory
 But he claimed to wash his body in the body of his women
 That was his
 Wait, in the body, he washed his body in the body of his women
 Yes, I think what that's saying is he liked to have sex with a lot of women
 And he thought that that was enough of a cleaning process
 It really wasn't there, was it?
 No, no, no
 That's a wipe him off with towels afterwards
 I had to go for that really long swim to really get it off
 Well, he is the most polluted river in the world, isn't it?
 It's unbelievably dirty
 So I suppose it suited him
 What I think, I think it's got rivals in now
 Maybe it was completely cleaned before he got it
 Mao used to suffer from very bad constipation
 And apparently if he actually managed to get a bowel movement out
 It was like a cause of celebration amongst the staff
 It was seen as a great way
 It would be celebration if I was a towel guy
 That's true, that's true
 He used to have two to three animals a day
 Wow
 Maybe when he was saying, "I'm surrounded by enemies"
 He was actually saying, "I'm surrounded by enemies"
 And the whole cultural revolution was a big mistake
 So there's a lot of work for Mao lookalikes at the moment
 Because in Chinese television, there's a lot of things you're not allowed to do
 If you want to write a screenplay
 I think we might have said before you're not allowed time travel
 And you're not really allowed word play and puns and stuff like that
 They have a lot of things you're not allowed to do
 But one thing you are allowed to do is historical dramas
 And so basically if you're a talented screenwriter in China
 You just write historical dramas
 And usually about Mao because he's like the most famous historical figure
 And so 44% of all Chinese shows produced in 2013 were historical dramas
 Wow
 You say that, I would be surprised if I was the same on the BBC
 No
 That's just what you watch, I know
 Oh yeah
 And so because a lot of these have Mao in them, there's a lot of work
 If you're a Mao lookalike, it's one of the best jobs you can have
 Wow, remember there's that Chinese guy who's an Obama lookalike?
 Is he
 Yeah, so he gets a lot of work in TV shows and stuff
 Is he Chinese?
 Yeah, he's Chinese, but he just looks a lot like Obama
 And he gets hired out as Obama
 He's not like exactly like Obama
 Well, he's a lookalike
 He's a lookalike
 Just on crazy claims made by dictators
 Oh yeah
 In 2006, a North Korean publication called Nodong Simmon
 reported that Kim Jong Il had mastered the art of teleporting
 and that he could move so quickly that American satellites could not track him
 Hey, have we ever mentioned the ex-president of Turkmenistan?
 Almost certainly, what...
 Feel like we must have the ears of?
 Yeah, the ears of, yeah
 He's just, he was one of those characters as well
 Claimed crazy things, did crazy things
 He changed the names of the days and the months
 in the country to the names of his family members
 Didn't he name Bread After His Mother? Was that him or something?
 He renamed Bread to his mother's name
 Yeah, very cool
 Just on on Mao
 So a statue of Chairman Mao was unveiled in 1993
 And it was a really big deal
 It was to commemorate him
 It was the, I think it was 120th anniversary of his birth or something
 Okay
 That makes sense
 And it was in December
 So and it was in the Hunan province
 So it's cold and dark and it's constant rain and sleet
 And you can now, if you go to China, you can buy photographs of
 The moment where the sheet was pulled off this giant statue
 The 6-meter-high bronze statue
 And at the same time the sun suddenly came out
 And the moon came out
 And they both shone upon the statue at the same time
 Wow
 And if you go, I mean
 Do you look very, as if you're believing it?
 Well that's, I mean that's possible, isn't it?
 It is plausible, I think it was just the
 Fortunatousness of the event
 I don't believe it
 I don't believe it at all
 Sun and the moon coming out at the same time
 But the sun and the moon are always out at the same time
 But half the year they're out at the same time
 That's not always
 No, but it bears credence that this might have been in that half of the year
 And I just think it sounds suspiciously like a propaganda quote
 Rather than, I think you guys are
 And also, it's very trusting
 No, but also this is what, last year, or the year before
 I mean China has a lot
 Ninety-nine-two-three
 Ninety-nine-three, okay
 Sorry, 25 years ago
 Regardless, China has been scientifically
 They would know basic things like when the sun and the moon's going to be out
 And like time it
 Also, don't forget the Trump, when he was doing his inauguration speech
 And the rain just mysteriously stopped
 Actually, yeah
 I'll start it, I can't remember
 I'll start it, I'll start it, yeah
 No, he very clearly remembered afterwards it a bit of sunny day
 So that's nice
 Just quickly on Mao, he initiated a campaign where you were supposed to murder all the sparrows
 It was called the Four Pest campaign
 He started it in 1958 and the idea was to exterminate mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows
 And it was really, really successful, so lots of people went out there
 And were supposed to form these kind of people's armies to try and kill them
 It was successful in the sense that it achieved what it was supposed to achieve
 And then it caused enormous problems
 Like these things do so, for instance
 The sparrows all been gone meant that there was a plague of literal plague of locusts
 Which now weren't being scared off by the sparrows
 And they, all the crops, and had incredibly devastating consequences
 Where many, you know, millions of people died
 And as far as what it was trying to do was get rid of pests, it didn't really work
 No, it worked as in it got rid of those pests
 But it's just such a strong lesson in how we definitely shouldn't be just trying to randomly wipe out something that's annoying us
 Yes
 Also, if you're on the side that's telling you to go out in massacre the sparrows
 It feels like you know that you're not on the right side, don't you?
 Do you?
 The others are quite bad, rats, mosquitoes, sparrows are so adorable
 They're like the epitome of a sweet innocent
 Not when they're eating all of your grain
 Of course not, but the word sparrow
 And the image of a little sparrow
 If someone's telling you to trample it down
 But without grain, how can you make a loaf of the president of Turkmenistan's mother?
 [laughter]
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy
 My factor is that seahorses greet their partners every day to make sure they are still alive
 Ooh
 Top tip for all you couples out there
 [laughter]
 What does that mean exactly?
 Because you'd greet them anyway, wouldn't you?
 [laughter]
 Every day
 I know their intentions
 Well, if you're a seahorse, you might not
 You know
 I don't like that, so I'm asking what do they, what do they, how do we know?
 Because most likely a seahorse is going to say hi to another seahorse if they're married every day
 [laughter]
 I'm so much unclean
 We don't need to do that, senders
 [laughter]
 I'm completely with Dan
 You're joining the side of the lunatics, Anna
 You're completely with that, are you?
 So that the married seaharses, you're with him on that bit, are you?
 Well, partners, it says
 We just jumped in with both feet, and I just decided
 When married seahorses get up in the morning, obviously they greet each other
 How do we know it's to make sure they're still alive?
 You're right, what they do is they do this courtship dance every day before dawn
 for a while
 Which is for two different reasons
 One is to check that the other one is still alive
 And the other is to also synchronise their mating
 Because you know the male carries the young in his pouch
 And then he sort of, yeah, he's pregnant
 That's a thing that is, you've just said quite casually
 But is incredibly amazing about seahorses
 The male carries the child
 Yeah, but apparently the ritual that they do, the sort of ritual they move around and sing
 is designed to synchronise their movements
 So the male will receive the eggs well
 when the female deposits her eggs in his pouch
 Okay
 Because otherwise they won't dock properly
 And just this keeping a live thing
 Is it really common for them to die in their sleep?
 They can't really drop in dead overnight
 I don't know
 I don't know, I don't know why it's so necessary
 Well, I looked into the life span of seahorses
 And in the wild between one and four years
 In captivity, four years
 And they say they just almost always make it to four years
 They have a really consistent sort of oldest age a seahorse gets to life span
 That's interesting
 So you're not basically, when you're three years old
 You know, you've only got a year left
 That's good, you can plan stuff
 Can't you? Like the pensions world is very stable
 In seahors land
 Because you know, roughly how long you've got
 I did not know that they were fish
 Yes, I don't know
 Well, I thought there was something
 Acquasty
 Did you think they were horses?
 I didn't think they were horses exactly
 But you thought they were maybe like muscles and...
 Yeah, I thought a lobster isn't a fish
 You know, and so they're called hippocampus, which means horse sea monster
 And they eat super quick
 They have to use in order to actually see them eating food
 Ice-peed cameras in order to catch it
 Because they can eat stuff in like six milliseconds
 Oh really, they're sucking, they suck it in, don't they?
 Yeah
 And also, they kind of flick their head
 Because they got this horse neck
 And they catch the culpods that they eat
 About 94% of the time
 Which the article I read said might be the most successful in nature
 But we know that actually dragonflies are slightly better than that
 We think dragonflies are 95%
 But they're similar kind of...
 But it very much depends on the prey
 It's like, it's all gone tech
 So, you know, a lion will be terrible at catching a copepod
 But a seahorse will be terrible at catching a zebra
 That's true
 And if I was to go to McDonald's and I wanted to get a Big Mac
 I would have 100% success rate
 Yeah, so we are the best hunters now I suppose
 If you're calling that hunting
 And I would be not
 That's when James and I go to McDonald's
 We hunt for the burgers, we sort of tiptoe up
 And make sure it doesn't see us coming
 So, the copepods, which they hunt
 The reason the seahorses have to be so good at hunting
 Is because the copepods can flee unbelievably fast
 They can move at 500 body lengths a second
 Which is the equivalent of a human swimming at 2,000 miles an hour
 Which is roughly as fast as chairman Mao
 And seahorses swim incredibly slow
 There's one that's called the line seahorse
 If you put it into a bathtub, just your regular length bathtub
 To swim that length would take five minutes
 Seahorse racing would be quite a cool thing to watch
 So, wouldn't it?
 Yes, you could paint a little like a little ascot
 Put little jockeys on top and tiny copepod jockeys
 And they have to jump over things in the water
 With these tiles and hedges and things like that
 I think you want the jockeys to be the things that the seahorses are going to try and eat
 No, you're right
 You want the copepods to be going round like a hare in a greyhound race
 Exactly
 Yeah
 That'd be amazing if in real horse racing there was a chance that the horse would eat the jockeys
 Halfway through the race
 And the Tories come off
 And he's being eaten
 James and I know seahorse expert, by the way
 Yes, we do
 Helen Scales
 I know her too
 I think we know her better
 We probably introduced you to her once
 Yeah, you did, yeah
 Yeah, okay
 I don't know her
 Good
 She's great
 She's written the book called Beside and Steed which is unbelievably good
 Yeah, I have a feeling most of the stuff that I'm saying right now is taken directly from her book
 But it was stuff taken from her book by James and put it to a script which I've been just lifted
 And I'd look through the script, by the way
 So she was on our show Museum of Curiosity as a guest about six years ago, seven years ago
 Almost even
 This was the opening question we asked her in the show
 Oh dear
 Helen, as someone who spent the past 15 years learning everything there is to know that fish
 Perhaps you can answer this for me
 Is it true that there is no such thing as a fish?
 Oh, the way
 Yeah, that was our opening question
 And what did she say?
 No, that's rubbish
 Yeah
 I'm in 2009
 There was a woman in Dorset who found a seahorse on her drive
 And she lived three miles in land
 Wow
 And it was alive
 How did it get there?
 Well, they think a seagull dropped it
 Seagull, I think
 Over, right
 It was a really rare endangered seahorse
 Wow
 It could be that thing, you know that riddle about the man who's found in a diving suit in the forest
 It could be that someone was trying to put out a fire in her house by scooping up water from the sea
 Into a helicopter
 And then dropping it onto her house
 And they scooped up a seahorse
 Right
 I was thinking of that one where there's a guy found hanging in a room
 With a puddle of water
 So I was wondering if the seahorse was trying to hang itself
 And he was still on an ice cube
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh with that
 Or a man arrives into town on a seahorse on Thursday and then leaves again
 Friday, it's called Friday, the seahorse is called Friday
 Yes
 I think it's that a seagull dropped it
 I just think that's amazing
 Trying to get endangered animals
 A lot of them are quite endangered
 I read something I think it was on Mother Nature Network
 Maybe saying that they could be extinct within about 30 years
 Which seems radically pessimistic
 But because they use so much in Asian medicine
 So 25 million seahorses a year are used in traditional Chinese medicine
 Or actually the seahorse trust claims that it's 150 million a year
 So it's somewhere between those two
 Which is a lot because they thought to help impotence, aren't they
 Which makes--
 Yeah, it's in China, yeah
 Which kind of makes a lot of sense
 No, it doesn't stop saying it makes sense
 Yeah, it doesn't make sense
 Yeah, killing them
 Don't say that sentence
 Seahorse grinding up
 It doesn't make sense, it's a terrible idea
 I can see where culturally it happened
 Because as the only males that give birth
 Perhaps that has some connection to the fact that men now think if they eat ground up seahorse they'll get fertile
 It starts spewing out babies
 I know it doesn't make a lot of sense
 It doesn't make any sense, Hannah
 No, it doesn't
 Scientists tested seahorse relationships about 10 years ago
 They did an experiment
 Because everyone thinks that they're monogamous
 And they wanted to see maybe they're not
 And so they put little wire labels on them, colored wire labels
 And sort of match them up with their partners
 And then they asked the public to spy on them to see if they were sleeping around
 And the scientists, one of the scientists responsible for it said
 When people hear that this might not be true after all, i.e. the monogamy
 Their curiosity is immediately aroused
 And they seem quite happy to watch
 For long periods to see if there's any hanky panky going on
 Aroused, so they are an aphrodisiac
 That's the big thing
 Sorry, the fish this week is sponsored by ground up seahorses
 They found out that they flirted with both sexes up to 25 times a day
 So it's hanky panky all over the shop?
 Oh yeah, it's quite a lot
 There's a lot in going on
 Every day
 Every day
 So yeah, it's a lot, i mean that's a lot
 Wake up, check your partners alive down
 Dab it
 Well, might as well do a bit of flirting anyway
 And their flirting is pretty intense, isn't it?
 Their meeting rituals last for days and days sometimes
 And the way they mate is they interlock their tails
 And they just bob along together with tails interlocked for hours on end
 Or they dance around a kind of invisible maple
 And yeah, it's just very romantic kind of animal
 It's very sweet, it's durable
 It's weirdly sweet, yeah
 The eyes move independently of each other as well
 Which is actually much bigger than me
 It's because they're trying to check out all the other male and female horses
 It's got a roving eye, yeah, but they all do
 Okay, it is time to move on to fact number three
 And that is my fact
 My fact this week is that falcon experts put on a special hat
 When they want to collect semen
 Basically falcons have been going extinct
 Or endangered in the wild
 And so that what they were trying to do was
 To force them to mate with each other
 They had to do artificial insemination
 And this guy in America called Les Boyd
 Worked out the best way to do that
 Was to wear a special hat
 Which he would then walk into a room
 The hat would excite the falcon
 Who would then land on his head
 And hump his head
 Until it ejaculated into this guy's hat
 And then he would wait for the next falcon
 So it's onto the hat really
 Because I imagine that into a hat means
 It's you turn the hat upside down
 And ejaculate into the...
 No, no, no, no
 It's no, no, the hat looks like a waffle
 So it's got all these little holes on it
 And so I think what happens when the ejaculate comes out
 It sort of seeps through the holes
 Like Swiss cheese
 We should say they're not wearing these hats are they
 Because they're particularly sexually attractive to the falcons
 The hats are specifically there to collect the semen
 But why does the falcon...
 I mean, this is an amazing fact
 Why does the falcon want to have sex with the hat?
 I think it is and correct me if I'm wrong
 They introduced the falcon to the hat very early on in life
 And it sort of develops a mother complex with it
 It imprints it
 And then when they see the hat come back in all those years later
 It thinks I've got to have it and lands on it
 But wait, are they introduced to the hat?
 Because yeah, I think when falcons are raised by people
 They are more attracted to people than they are to other falcons
 Because they are imprinted, so it's whatever raises them
 They both are attracted to
 I thought it was the humans and then the humans put on the hats
 Oh, wow
 Did it introduce the baby falcons to the humans
 So what happens if the human walks in without the hat?
 Then they think they'll shine their heads
 So there's a real debate in the falcon in community
 Over whether it's better to buy a collecting hat
 They call it a copulation hat
 Or whether it's better to make your own
 Because it's much cheaper to make your own
 But sometimes you just want a professional hat
 Don't you?
 Because it looks better
 I guess so
 But I don't think anyone's wearing this for fashion actually
 They're not very fashionable things
 They've got waffle stuff on the top
 And usually a bird shagging
 You can see it being a hipster thing
 Yeah, I can imagine walking around Shardich
 No, I've just remembered that's what they do
 They imitate the falcon's voice
 So they imitate the falcon's vocalizations
 To sound like a lady falcon
 Yeah
 I think that's amazing
 Yeah, it's incredible
 And you can see footage of this online by the way
 They sort of land on the head
 And they're just going at it, flapping their wings
 This guy's head is just big jutted around all over the shop
 And then it ends and he walks out
 And then he takes it through a tube, doesn't he?
 And he brings it to
 To inseminate it into the female falcon
 And that in itself is another whole process
 What does he have to put on a special chest wig or something like that?
 In the video that I saw
 He also had what like a glove and God talks were mating on that
 The copulation hat began as a copulation glove
 I think because it definitely happened on the hand before
 And I think some genius
 Or wait a second
 Yeah
 What if I wear the glove on my head?
 I think probably because if you have a falcon land on your hand
 You can only stretch it so far
 And they are moving about a lot
 I mean it's a vigorous activity
 And so you might get a wing in the face
 So maybe that was a protection point
 So that, yeah, yeah, possibly
 But does that mean that they can be collecting
 Gossalk on their hand and falcon at the same time?
 Yeah
 Do you know the other method to do it for doing this?
 It's called stripping
 It's a moral fashion method
 None of this high tech
 Digital equipment that he's using
 So what you do is you get a little pipette
 And you have to put it
 It's a sort of tiny suction pump
 Into the birds, the male falcon's
 Khloeakka, sort of genital opening
 And then you have to use an automatic pipette
 To just, you know, you just put it one notch
 And it just extracts a little bit of semen from the falcon
 Right
 Before the invention of the automatic pipette
 What you would have to do is
 Someone on the team would have to suck the open end of the pipette
 To get the falcon semen going
 And
 This is from the book How Fast Can a Falcon Dive
 Peter Kappai-Nolo had some experience performing this procedure as an undergraduate
 Despite keeping an eye out for the rapid movement of semenal fluid up the tube
 He occasionally learned the hard way
 That while falcon semen looks like a nice lager
 It tastes rather bitter
 Because it's amber falcon semen
 That looks so cool
 But he discovered
 And he's the co-author of this book
 So does falcon semen look like beer?
 Like if we went to the pub and I accidentally swaps duns beer for a pint of falcon semen
 He might not notice
 I if I saw the hat
 If I was like
 What are you doing wearing in that James?
 It's just fashion Daniel
 We are in shortage
 Okay, I can definitely say they're being a beer in shortage called falcon semen
 That's a really good beer name
 Yeah it is
 That should be our no such thing as a fish
 Brewery
 Yeah, release
 But I put in falcon jizz into google in order to
 To make sure that there is already a beer called falcon jizz
 But what came up is that there's a
 A club in America called falcon jizz which is what it would have corrected it
 You have to wear this special hat to go in
 It sounds like a really fun jazz club
 And it's run by like this environmental scientist
 And why is he running a jazz club?
 I don't know
 And his name is Tony Falco
 So he's just missing the end to be Tony falcon
 And he's in the falcon jazz club
 And it's in New York
 So if you're in New York
 Go see the falcon jazz
 And ask for a pint of falcon jizz
 He should launch a beer there
 Falco jazz presents falcon jizz
 I think what's really interesting about this fact is it's the current method
 Probably the most successful falcon breeder in the world
 His name is Brynn Close
 He specifically breeds falcons who fly incredibly fast
 Because falcon racing is a thing that happens a lot in the Middle East
 To buy an Abu Dhabi specifically do it
 And the shakes and the super rich out there by these falcons
 He is the number one breeder of these falcons
 And that's how he collects the semen of all these of these different falcons
 But anyone listening to this might remember ages ago
 There was an image that appeared online of a commercial aeroplane
 And it was the economy class of the aeroplane
 And it was just packed with falcons
 Sitting there
 And to Brynn that's a very regular thing
 Because that's how they fly all the falcons out to Abu Dhabi and Dubai
 Was there a business class on the same flight for a few months
 Or was it as people were coming in like yeah just this way so this way
 Falcon you'd need to turn right
 So airlines have specific rules for this right
 There are a lot of airlines that will only animals that are allowing
 The cabin are guide dogs for the blind and falcons for falcon racing
 So Emirates is one of those airlines where it says they're the only two animals that are allowed
 But if you buy a first-class seat you're allowed to falcons
 So I think this is
 One on the head one on the other
 This is with Etihad that's what it's with
 Yeah if you're going to Dubai or Abu Dhabi or something like that
 You buy a first-class seat you're allowed to additional falcons
 On the seat next to you
 I get Etihad and Emirates a lot because my sister lives over in Abu Dhabi
 I have never seen a falcon
 Well you're never in first class then that's where they were hanging out
 I thought you said you can have one in economy
 You can't have one in economy yeah maybe
 So just very quickly on brim close he raises these falcons in donkaster near an industrial estate
 He's been doing it for years
 He says that his falcons can get up to 75 miles an hour
 The average falcon can get up to 60 miles an hour
 So he doesn't know what he's doing right except that he knows that he's spending a lot of money
 On their daily meals and so on in order to just build them up to be the strongest that they can be
 And what's interesting is he lives in an industrial town
 I read an article a year or so ago about pigeons which is that pigeons can fly faster
 Through noxious air than they can through cleaner
 If you get if you have racing pigeons they always go faster if you put them through horrible air
 And no one knows why it might be because they just want to get out of it
 Or it might be something to do I don't know
 But that's the secret as what you're saying
 Maybe maybe the donkaster air is the one secret
 Maybe it's not anything else he's doing
 Do you know how staff at marine parks get seeming out of a killer whale?
 No, go on
 They used to use a calvagina
 They lost it
 Some real and some artificial
 Although where you would make an artificial calvagina I do not know
 I could think the worst way
 Wearing a swimming cap
 Another marine biologist had his neck broken today
 [Music]
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is Anna
 My fact this week is that my and women had to prove they could make cocoa with the right amount of froth before men would marry them
 This is something I was reading in the Smithsonian
 And it's something that's claimed by this guy called Haze Lovis
 And I've known if that's how you pronounce his name
 But he's a cultural curator at the Smithsonian
 And he said that early records of my own marriages in Guatemala
 Indicate that in some places a woman would have to make the cacao
 So she'd have to make the chocolate drink
 And prove that she could make it with the proper amount of froth
 Before she was able to marry the man
 And this is the thing froth was incredibly important
 So I hadn't realized that the froth on the chocolate drinks in
 Mesoamerican civilizations was a bigger deal than the actual chocolate drink I think
 And why for do we know?
 I guess because it was part of just part of the ritual right? So you'll see lots of Mesoamerican art
 Which shows the women making the froth
 And they'd stand up really really high above the vessel that they were pouring the chocolate drink into
 And they'd pour it in from really high above and it would splash down onto the ground
 Like two meters high
 And that would sort of froth it up and they'd do that a few times
 So you just pour back and forth and back and forth
 So it's just like a ritualistic thing
 I guess it's just showing that you're not a complete idiot
 Can you pour some stuff into a pot and then back and forth? Okay, well I'm angry, that's fine
 Are you from quite a height?
 I'd struggle, I would have been a spinster
 I don't know
 So Jose de Acosta who was a Spanish Jesuit missionary
 He said that the scum of froth had a very unpleasant taste
 I really
 I think to European taste it wasn't that tasty because it's hot chocolate but it's not that sugar in
 That'll pass on the chocolate, I'll just have some of that falcon seam and thank you very much
 Much nicer
 Because they didn't have cane sugar or anything like that
 They could have put honey in it I suppose
 But mostly it was a bitter and spicy drink, it wasn't sweet and
 Yeah, they morphed with chilli in it, didn't they?
 Yeah and yeah it was really really popular in spite of not being delicious and sweet like we now have
 You know when old chocolate goes white, you know that?
 No
 Yeah when it goes off
 When you leave chocolate for a while, you get white, do you know what that is?
 No
 It's called a fat bloom
 So it's liquid from the cacao bean
 Gradually moving towards the surface of the chocolate and breaking out on the surface like a rash
 It's not bad
 Yeah, I wouldn't eat it
 I would
 Would you?
 Yeah
 What about green bacon?
 Yeah, I'd love it
 No, sorry, no
 Green bacon?
 You know bacon goes a little bit off
 Off that shimmery sheen on it
 I think that's probably still all right
 I still eat that
 Yeah, it's nitrate burn that
 It's the nitrates that they use to cure the bacon with and preserve it
 That's just that reacting with the oxygen
 Great
 So does that imply that it's on the turn, right?
 Yeah, but it's fine, it's still okay to eat
 Good
 Otherwise, I'm in serious trouble
 I mean, if it's green and furry, probably not
 They used to, the Mayans and the Aztecs used to use the cacao bean as currency
 That would be their equivalent to money
 Not exclusively, but it was, it was a traded thing
 So and you would know what it was worth
 So one bean might be worth according to this expert
 Sorry, 200 beans might be worth according to this expert
 The price of one turkey, for example
 Okay
 No, they think they know that, don't they?
 Because so there, we can't, a lot of this stuff
 We kind of have to guess that
 Because we don't have written records
 For a lot of these cultures
 But they think they know that because they found counterfeit beans, right?
 So
 No
 They have
 They found the archaeologists keep finding what look like cacao beans
 And then they go up close
 And their little beans made of clay to look exactly like cacao beans
 And they think it must be counterfeit currency
 But or it could be, you know, they use them in
 It's hot chocolate, tastes like shit
 Is it their equivalent of chocolate money?
 It's the non chocolate money
 One of the suggestions was that the counterfeits
 were to use in ceremonies
 Because a lot of religious ceremonies involved cacao
 Because it was such a valuable thing
 But the point of religious ceremonies
 Is to give offerings to the gods, right?
 And you would have thought
 If you're offering a god what looks like a cacao bean
 But when he tries it
 It's a bit of clay
 Doug would actually piss the wall because ceremonial things don't you like
 Like in ancient Egypt they would have made fake slaves
 Or fake this or fake
 Fakes slaves for the afterlife
 For the afterlife
 For the afterlife
 For the afterlife
 I'm sorry I thought I meant like
 I saw you my slave
 It's just a block of wood
 And in China
 Traditionally they would do paper
 Versions of things you want in the afterlife
 Because they knew that you couldn't necessarily take your iPad
 To the next life
 Because it's a solid thing
 But you could take a paper one
 And they still do that
 It's amazing
 Yeah, I think we have mentioned before
 They do money
 So you just burn money
 And you burn items that you think they would like to take into the afterlife
 It's amazing if you get to the afterlife
 And you've got a paper iPad there
 Oh, shit
 I thought when I walked through this door
 It would all chance for me to fail the egg
 Everyone in the afterlife has all wondered how with paper iPad
 Yeah, mine doesn't do anything either
 It's ridiculous
 We've no way of communicating to you
 I know
 Maybe that's what ghosts are trying to do
 Bring my friends
 So, I didn't know this
 But Kakao bean
 Stocks are running lower and lower
 And all the crops are being converted to corn
 And West Africa where they grow a lot of it
 And chocolate's going to get way more expensive in the next few years
 And Erika McAllister mentioned this a few weeks ago
 Yes
 But there was a guy in 2010
 Because you get traders who buy and sell loads of Kakao beans
 He bought 7% of the world's Kakao beans
 658 million pounds worth, mountains of them
 And he was nicknamed "choc finger"
 Chocolate finger, it should be just...
 I'm his real name's Anthony
 He's just a trader who's specialised in Kakao his whole life
 He knows all about the market movements
 And you know, he's just spend his whole life buying and selling it
 On what he thinks the market will do
 Just on the Mayans very quickly, not to do with Kakao
 But to do with those massive, amazing pyramids that they built
 So back in the 30s, they discovered a pyramid within a pyramid
 So is it in Russia?
 Well, no
 But what's amazing is last year
 They've just found another pyramid inside that pyramid
 Inside the pyramid
 Yeah, and they think there may be a few more in sight
 So yeah, it's like a Russian dollar factor that's going on
 Very, very middle
 That's the top of your own
 Yeah, this is only last year that they announced it
 That they found this new, smaller pyramid
 I would have looked outside
 Yeah
 First pyramid for a massive pyramid
 It could be that we're all living inside a massive kind of solar system size pyramid
 And that one first one they found is actually the second one
 Exactly
 Yes
 Why would you make the second Russian doll so much more
 than the outside layer?
 You just wouldn't, doesn't make any sense
 Yeah, that's a huge scaling difference between
 Well, they're faster than that
 When they get that big
 The first one took a lot of effort
 And then the next one they're like, oh, we shouldn't make one that big
 Just very quickly
 We've never mentioned before that the first ATM machine
 So the first cash machine was based on a chocolate bar dispenser
 And so it was invented by this guy called John Shepherd Baron in the 1960s and '67
 And he, I was really an interview with him
 Well, I just imagine in like five of us on one of those chocolate machines
 where it's just about to fall down
 I think it's just quite fall down
 That would be the worst thing ever, wouldn't it?
 Yeah, and they wouldn't fall properly, I don't know
 Yeah, it would be a nightmare
 It was done with using checks in the olden days
 So you'd write a check and it had a bit of, come off here
 Like, even to get some chocolate out of a chocolate machine, you'd write a check
 And six days later, once it's cleared
 Who should I make it out to?
 Just A9
 Please deliver this check to A9
 You're sincerely just a Baron
 Don, you don't sign off checks, you're sincerely
 I am so lost with what's happening at the moment
 Clear up number one, no, you didn't ever put checks into chocolate bar machines
 I'm sorry, give that impression
 What I meant was, he based the cash machine on a chocolate bar machine
 But to use cash machines in the olden days, you put a check in
 And it had a bit of radioactive carbon, 14-nice atop
 Which interacted with the machine
 And he used to get in trouble and people would say
 Oh, we reckon this is dangerous, it's radioactive
 So he said, I later worked out that you'd have to eat 136,000 checks
 for it to have any effect on your health
 Okay, so, is it, you put, that's our cash machine used to work with radioactive
 Yeah, a radioactive system that triggered it to give you some cash
 That is unbelievable
 But that's not how the chocolate, the chocolate dispenser works
 Because it would melt, it would melt
 You did used to get radioactive chocolate bars
 When they first invented radium or discovered radium, they started putting them in chocolate bars
 So technically, you could have actually put a chocolate bar into a cash machine and got a cash
 But he'd have to get his chocolate from the original machine
 So it's just the system that's just working back and forth
 He still stopped between two vending machines
 So this guy, this inventor, said he then moved up to Scotland to the coast
 And the next thing he invented, and the only other thing he invented as far as I can tell
 Is a device that played the sound of killer whales to ward seals off his fish farm
 And he said to the BBC, he only succeeded in attracting many more of them
 He should have put it inside a cow's vagina
 Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts
