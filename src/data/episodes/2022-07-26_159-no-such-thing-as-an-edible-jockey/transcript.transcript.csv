00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hey guys, just a quick announcement before we begin this week's show which is that we are going on tour"
00:00:05,00:00:09,We are going all over the country and there are tickets available now
00:00:09,00:00:14,"We're gonna nodding him. We're gonna Manchester, London, Lester, Dunstable, Birmingham, Coventry"
00:00:14,00:00:16,"Yeah, and there are more dates coming up, aren't there?"
00:00:16,00:00:18,"There are indeed, but we're not allowed to say where they are yet"
00:00:18,00:00:23,But there'll be a bit further from the center of England than those places that Dan's just mentioned
00:00:23,00:00:29,"Yeah, it's gonna be so much fun. We're putting together this whole fantastic first half full of stupid games and extra"
00:00:29,00:00:34,"bits and interactive bits, and in the second half we're gonna record an episode of the podcast"
00:00:34,00:00:41,"Yep, so if you want to see any or all preferably all of that then go to qi.com/fishevents and you can get your tickets there"
00:00:41,00:00:42,"Okay, on with the show"
00:00:57,00:01:04,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden"
00:01:04,00:01:10,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anitzenski and Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:01:10,00:01:16,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones of our four favorite facts from the last seven days"
00:01:16,00:01:18,"And in no particular order, here we go"
00:01:18,00:01:20,"Starting with you, James"
00:01:20,00:01:33,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1966 the Chinese press reported that a 73-year-old German Mao had swam 15 kilometres of the Yangtze River in 65 minutes"
00:01:33,00:01:36,That's twice the speed that Michael Phelps has ever swam
00:01:36,00:01:40,"75, imagine what he could do at 40"
00:01:40,00:01:41,73
00:01:41,00:01:42,73
00:01:42,00:01:47,It's amazing that you're given a number and you just remember a different number
00:01:47,00:01:49,"No, I confused it with 65 minutes"
00:01:49,00:01:53,So I took the seven from the year and I took the five from the minutes
00:01:53,00:01:57,"Wait, may I have 73 kilometres in 15 minutes?"
00:01:57,00:01:58,I don't know
00:01:58,00:02:03,He swam 1966 kilometres and 65 seconds
00:02:03,00:02:06,"Okay, wow, can you say the numbers again?"
00:02:06,00:02:13,"Yes, year 1966, age 73, distance 15 kilometres and time 65 minutes"
00:02:13,00:02:19,"And the thing is, I've read about this and it's possible that he might have been carried along"
00:02:19,00:02:21,"by some very, very strong currents"
00:02:21,00:02:24,"Right, but then I wonder if that's really swimming"
00:02:24,00:02:26,"It's not, it's because it could be floating"
00:02:26,00:02:29,But he had floating bodyguards with him
00:02:29,00:02:30,"Yeah, he did"
00:02:30,00:02:32,And huge portraits of himself
00:02:32,00:02:35,So there's a picture of him floating along with these six bodyguards around him
00:02:35,00:02:40,And then these giant pictures of Chairman Mao floating alongside him in front of him
00:02:40,00:02:42,"But wait, when you say they were floating bodyguards"
00:02:42,00:02:43,What were they?
00:02:43,00:02:44,"They were swimming, too"
00:02:44,00:02:47,And they managed to keep up with the fastest swimmer
00:02:47,00:02:51,"And maybe that's why there were six, they were positioned strategically further up"
00:02:51,00:02:52,And after the river
00:02:52,00:02:58,An improvement to Olympic swimming would be to have a giant raft with the swimmer's face on it
00:02:58,00:02:59,Going behind it
00:02:59,00:03:02,Because often when the water you don't know who it is
00:03:02,00:03:06,But if there's a massive raft with Michael Phelps' face going behind it
00:03:06,00:03:07,"Yes, that's great"
00:03:07,00:03:11,It's interesting he spent so much time in a body of order because he never bathed
00:03:11,00:03:12,Chairman Mao
00:03:12,00:03:17,In order to wash himself he would have servants wipe him up and down with towels
00:03:17,00:03:19,"Yeah, yeah, so just wet towels"
00:03:19,00:03:22,"In fact, and this is a bit early in the podcast to be going into this territory"
00:03:22,00:03:27,But he claimed to wash his body in the body of his women
00:03:27,00:03:28,That was his
00:03:28,00:03:31,"Wait, in the body, he washed his body in the body of his women"
00:03:31,00:03:34,"Yes, I think what that's saying is he liked to have sex with a lot of women"
00:03:34,00:03:38,And he thought that that was enough of a cleaning process
00:03:38,00:03:39,"It really wasn't there, was it?"
00:03:39,00:03:40,"No, no, no"
00:03:40,00:03:41,That's a wipe him off with towels afterwards
00:03:41,00:03:45,I had to go for that really long swim to really get it off
00:03:45,00:03:47,"Well, he is the most polluted river in the world, isn't it?"
00:03:47,00:03:49,It's unbelievably dirty
00:03:49,00:03:51,So I suppose it suited him
00:03:51,00:03:53,"What I think, I think it's got rivals in now"
00:03:53,00:03:55,Maybe it was completely cleaned before he got it
00:03:55,00:04:03,Mao used to suffer from very bad constipation
00:04:03,00:04:06,And apparently if he actually managed to get a bowel movement out
00:04:06,00:04:09,It was like a cause of celebration amongst the staff
00:04:09,00:04:11,It was seen as a great way
00:04:11,00:04:17,It would be celebration if I was a towel guy
00:04:17,00:04:19,"That's true, that's true"
00:04:19,00:04:23,He used to have two to three animals a day
00:04:23,00:04:24,Wow
00:04:24,00:04:27,"Maybe when he was saying, ""I'm surrounded by enemies"""
00:04:27,00:04:29,"He was actually saying, ""I'm surrounded by enemies"""
00:04:29,00:04:31,And the whole cultural revolution was a big mistake
00:04:31,00:04:36,So there's a lot of work for Mao lookalikes at the moment
00:04:36,00:04:41,"Because in Chinese television, there's a lot of things you're not allowed to do"
00:04:41,00:04:44,If you want to write a screenplay
00:04:44,00:04:46,I think we might have said before you're not allowed time travel
00:04:46,00:04:49,And you're not really allowed word play and puns and stuff like that
00:04:49,00:04:51,They have a lot of things you're not allowed to do
00:04:51,00:04:54,But one thing you are allowed to do is historical dramas
00:04:54,00:04:57,And so basically if you're a talented screenwriter in China
00:04:57,00:04:59,You just write historical dramas
00:04:59,00:05:03,And usually about Mao because he's like the most famous historical figure
00:05:03,00:05:09,And so 44% of all Chinese shows produced in 2013 were historical dramas
00:05:09,00:05:10,Wow
00:05:10,00:05:13,"You say that, I would be surprised if I was the same on the BBC"
00:05:13,00:05:14,No
00:05:14,00:05:17,"That's just what you watch, I know"
00:05:17,00:05:18,Oh yeah
00:05:18,00:05:22,"And so because a lot of these have Mao in them, there's a lot of work"
00:05:22,00:05:25,"If you're a Mao lookalike, it's one of the best jobs you can have"
00:05:25,00:05:28,"Wow, remember there's that Chinese guy who's an Obama lookalike?"
00:05:28,00:05:30,Is he
00:05:30,00:05:34,"Yeah, so he gets a lot of work in TV shows and stuff"
00:05:34,00:05:35,Is he Chinese?
00:05:35,00:05:38,"Yeah, he's Chinese, but he just looks a lot like Obama"
00:05:38,00:05:41,And he gets hired out as Obama
00:05:41,00:05:43,He's not like exactly like Obama
00:05:43,00:05:44,"Well, he's a lookalike"
00:05:44,00:05:46,He's a lookalike
00:05:46,00:05:50,Just on crazy claims made by dictators
00:05:50,00:05:50,Oh yeah
00:05:50,00:05:54,"In 2006, a North Korean publication called Nodong Simmon"
00:05:54,00:05:57,reported that Kim Jong Il had mastered the art of teleporting
00:05:57,00:06:02,and that he could move so quickly that American satellites could not track him
00:06:02,00:06:06,"Hey, have we ever mentioned the ex-president of Turkmenistan?"
00:06:06,00:06:07,"Almost certainly, what..."
00:06:07,00:06:09,Feel like we must have the ears of?
00:06:09,00:06:10,"Yeah, the ears of, yeah"
00:06:10,00:06:13,"He's just, he was one of those characters as well"
00:06:13,00:06:15,"Claimed crazy things, did crazy things"
00:06:15,00:06:18,He changed the names of the days and the months
00:06:18,00:06:22,in the country to the names of his family members
00:06:22,00:06:24,Didn't he name Bread After His Mother? Was that him or something?
00:06:24,00:06:26,He renamed Bread to his mother's name
00:06:26,00:06:28,"Yeah, very cool"
00:06:28,00:06:29,Just on on Mao
00:06:29,00:06:32,So a statue of Chairman Mao was unveiled in 1993
00:06:32,00:06:35,And it was a really big deal
00:06:35,00:06:37,It was to commemorate him
00:06:37,00:06:41,"It was the, I think it was 120th anniversary of his birth or something"
00:06:41,00:06:41,Okay
00:06:41,00:06:43,That makes sense
00:06:43,00:06:44,And it was in December
00:06:44,00:06:45,So and it was in the Hunan province
00:06:45,00:06:48,So it's cold and dark and it's constant rain and sleet
00:06:48,00:06:51,"And you can now, if you go to China, you can buy photographs of"
00:06:51,00:06:55,The moment where the sheet was pulled off this giant statue
00:06:55,00:06:56,The 6-meter-high bronze statue
00:06:56,00:06:59,And at the same time the sun suddenly came out
00:06:59,00:07:00,And the moon came out
00:07:00,00:07:03,And they both shone upon the statue at the same time
00:07:03,00:07:03,Wow
00:07:03,00:07:04,"And if you go, I mean"
00:07:04,00:07:06,"Do you look very, as if you're believing it?"
00:07:06,00:07:08,"Well that's, I mean that's possible, isn't it?"
00:07:08,00:07:10,"It is plausible, I think it was just the"
00:07:10,00:07:13,Fortunatousness of the event
00:07:13,00:07:14,I don't believe it
00:07:14,00:07:15,I don't believe it at all
00:07:15,00:07:17,Sun and the moon coming out at the same time
00:07:17,00:07:20,But the sun and the moon are always out at the same time
00:07:20,00:07:22,But half the year they're out at the same time
00:07:22,00:07:23,That's not always
00:07:23,00:07:27,"No, but it bears credence that this might have been in that half of the year"
00:07:27,00:07:30,And I just think it sounds suspiciously like a propaganda quote
00:07:30,00:07:31,"Rather than, I think you guys are"
00:07:31,00:07:33,"And also, it's very trusting"
00:07:33,00:07:36,"No, but also this is what, last year, or the year before"
00:07:36,00:07:37,I mean China has a lot
00:07:37,00:07:38,Ninety-nine-two-three
00:07:38,00:07:39,"Ninety-nine-three, okay"
00:07:39,00:07:42,"Sorry, 25 years ago"
00:07:42,00:07:46,"Regardless, China has been scientifically"
00:07:46,00:07:49,They would know basic things like when the sun and the moon's going to be out
00:07:49,00:07:50,And like time it
00:07:50,00:07:54,"Also, don't forget the Trump, when he was doing his inauguration speech"
00:07:54,00:07:57,And the rain just mysteriously stopped
00:07:57,00:07:58,"Actually, yeah"
00:07:58,00:07:59,"I'll start it, I can't remember"
00:07:59,00:08:00,"I'll start it, I'll start it, yeah"
00:08:00,00:08:02,"No, he very clearly remembered afterwards it a bit of sunny day"
00:08:02,00:08:05,So that's nice
00:08:05,00:08:10,"Just quickly on Mao, he initiated a campaign where you were supposed to murder all the sparrows"
00:08:10,00:08:12,It was called the Four Pest campaign
00:08:12,00:08:18,"He started it in 1958 and the idea was to exterminate mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows"
00:08:18,00:08:21,"And it was really, really successful, so lots of people went out there"
00:08:21,00:08:24,And were supposed to form these kind of people's armies to try and kill them
00:08:24,00:08:28,It was successful in the sense that it achieved what it was supposed to achieve
00:08:28,00:08:30,And then it caused enormous problems
00:08:30,00:08:32,"Like these things do so, for instance"
00:08:32,00:08:36,The sparrows all been gone meant that there was a plague of literal plague of locusts
00:08:36,00:08:39,Which now weren't being scared off by the sparrows
00:08:39,00:08:43,"And they, all the crops, and had incredibly devastating consequences"
00:08:43,00:08:46,"Where many, you know, millions of people died"
00:08:46,00:08:50,"And as far as what it was trying to do was get rid of pests, it didn't really work"
00:08:50,00:08:52,"No, it worked as in it got rid of those pests"
00:08:52,00:08:59,But it's just such a strong lesson in how we definitely shouldn't be just trying to randomly wipe out something that's annoying us
00:08:59,00:09:00,Yes
00:09:00,00:09:03,"Also, if you're on the side that's telling you to go out in massacre the sparrows"
00:09:03,00:09:06,"It feels like you know that you're not on the right side, don't you?"
00:09:06,00:09:07,Do you?
00:09:07,00:09:12,"The others are quite bad, rats, mosquitoes, sparrows are so adorable"
00:09:12,00:09:14,They're like the epitome of a sweet innocent
00:09:14,00:09:16,Not when they're eating all of your grain
00:09:16,00:09:18,"Of course not, but the word sparrow"
00:09:18,00:09:20,And the image of a little sparrow
00:09:20,00:09:22,If someone's telling you to trample it down
00:09:22,00:09:26,"But without grain, how can you make a loaf of the president of Turkmenistan's mother?"
00:09:26,00:09:29,[laughter]
00:09:29,00:09:39,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy"
00:09:39,00:09:43,My factor is that seahorses greet their partners every day to make sure they are still alive
00:09:43,00:09:45,Ooh
00:09:45,00:09:46,Top tip for all you couples out there
00:09:46,00:09:47,[laughter]
00:09:47,00:09:49,What does that mean exactly?
00:09:49,00:09:51,"Because you'd greet them anyway, wouldn't you?"
00:09:51,00:09:52,[laughter]
00:09:52,00:09:52,Every day
00:09:52,00:09:53,I know their intentions
00:09:53,00:09:55,"Well, if you're a seahorse, you might not"
00:09:55,00:09:55,You know
00:09:55,00:09:59,"I don't like that, so I'm asking what do they, what do they, how do we know?"
00:09:59,00:10:04,Because most likely a seahorse is going to say hi to another seahorse if they're married every day
00:10:04,00:10:05,[laughter]
00:10:05,00:10:07,I'm so much unclean
00:10:07,00:10:08,"We don't need to do that, senders"
00:10:08,00:10:09,[laughter]
00:10:09,00:10:10,I'm completely with Dan
00:10:10,00:10:13,"You're joining the side of the lunatics, Anna"
00:10:13,00:10:15,"You're completely with that, are you?"
00:10:15,00:10:18,"So that the married seaharses, you're with him on that bit, are you?"
00:10:18,00:10:19,"Well, partners, it says"
00:10:19,00:10:22,"We just jumped in with both feet, and I just decided"
00:10:22,00:10:26,"When married seahorses get up in the morning, obviously they greet each other"
00:10:26,00:10:28,How do we know it's to make sure they're still alive?
00:10:28,00:10:32,"You're right, what they do is they do this courtship dance every day before dawn"
00:10:32,00:10:33,for a while
00:10:33,00:10:35,Which is for two different reasons
00:10:35,00:10:38,One is to check that the other one is still alive
00:10:38,00:10:42,And the other is to also synchronise their mating
00:10:42,00:10:47,Because you know the male carries the young in his pouch
00:10:47,00:10:49,"And then he sort of, yeah, he's pregnant"
00:10:49,00:10:52,"That's a thing that is, you've just said quite casually"
00:10:52,00:10:54,But is incredibly amazing about seahorses
00:10:54,00:10:56,The male carries the child
00:10:56,00:11:00,"Yeah, but apparently the ritual that they do, the sort of ritual they move around and sing"
00:11:00,00:11:01,is designed to synchronise their movements
00:11:01,00:11:05,So the male will receive the eggs well
00:11:05,00:11:08,when the female deposits her eggs in his pouch
00:11:08,00:11:09,Okay
00:11:09,00:11:11,Because otherwise they won't dock properly
00:11:11,00:11:13,And just this keeping a live thing
00:11:13,00:11:16,Is it really common for them to die in their sleep?
00:11:16,00:11:19,They can't really drop in dead overnight
00:11:19,00:11:20,I don't know
00:11:20,00:11:22,"I don't know, I don't know why it's so necessary"
00:11:22,00:11:25,"Well, I looked into the life span of seahorses"
00:11:25,00:11:28,And in the wild between one and four years
00:11:28,00:11:30,"In captivity, four years"
00:11:30,00:11:34,And they say they just almost always make it to four years
00:11:34,00:11:39,They have a really consistent sort of oldest age a seahorse gets to life span
00:11:39,00:11:40,That's interesting
00:11:40,00:11:43,"So you're not basically, when you're three years old"
00:11:43,00:11:45,"You know, you've only got a year left"
00:11:45,00:11:46,"That's good, you can plan stuff"
00:11:46,00:11:49,Can't you? Like the pensions world is very stable
00:11:49,00:11:51,In seahors land
00:11:51,00:11:53,"Because you know, roughly how long you've got"
00:11:53,00:11:55,I did not know that they were fish
00:11:55,00:11:56,"Yes, I don't know"
00:11:56,00:11:58,"Well, I thought there was something"
00:11:58,00:11:58,Acquasty
00:11:58,00:11:59,Did you think they were horses?
00:11:59,00:12:02,I didn't think they were horses exactly
00:12:02,00:12:04,But you thought they were maybe like muscles and...
00:12:04,00:12:06,"Yeah, I thought a lobster isn't a fish"
00:12:06,00:12:11,"You know, and so they're called hippocampus, which means horse sea monster"
00:12:11,00:12:13,And they eat super quick
00:12:13,00:12:16,They have to use in order to actually see them eating food
00:12:16,00:12:18,Ice-peed cameras in order to catch it
00:12:18,00:12:20,Because they can eat stuff in like six milliseconds
00:12:20,00:12:22,"Oh really, they're sucking, they suck it in, don't they?"
00:12:22,00:12:23,Yeah
00:12:23,00:12:25,"And also, they kind of flick their head"
00:12:25,00:12:27,Because they got this horse neck
00:12:27,00:12:29,And they catch the culpods that they eat
00:12:29,00:12:31,About 94% of the time
00:12:31,00:12:34,Which the article I read said might be the most successful in nature
00:12:34,00:12:39,But we know that actually dragonflies are slightly better than that
00:12:39,00:12:42,We think dragonflies are 95%
00:12:42,00:12:43,But they're similar kind of...
00:12:43,00:12:45,But it very much depends on the prey
00:12:45,00:12:47,"It's like, it's all gone tech"
00:12:47,00:12:50,"So, you know, a lion will be terrible at catching a copepod"
00:12:50,00:12:52,But a seahorse will be terrible at catching a zebra
00:12:52,00:12:53,That's true
00:12:53,00:12:55,And if I was to go to McDonald's and I wanted to get a Big Mac
00:12:55,00:12:57,I would have 100% success rate
00:12:57,00:13:02,"Yeah, so we are the best hunters now I suppose"
00:13:02,00:13:03,If you're calling that hunting
00:13:03,00:13:05,And I would be not
00:13:05,00:13:07,That's when James and I go to McDonald's
00:13:07,00:13:10,"We hunt for the burgers, we sort of tiptoe up"
00:13:10,00:13:12,And make sure it doesn't see us coming
00:13:12,00:13:13,"So, the copepods, which they hunt"
00:13:13,00:13:16,The reason the seahorses have to be so good at hunting
00:13:16,00:13:18,Is because the copepods can flee unbelievably fast
00:13:18,00:13:21,They can move at 500 body lengths a second
00:13:21,00:13:25,"Which is the equivalent of a human swimming at 2,000 miles an hour"
00:13:25,00:13:28,Which is roughly as fast as chairman Mao
00:13:28,00:13:32,And seahorses swim incredibly slow
00:13:32,00:13:35,There's one that's called the line seahorse
00:13:35,00:13:39,"If you put it into a bathtub, just your regular length bathtub"
00:13:39,00:13:41,To swim that length would take five minutes
00:13:41,00:13:43,Seahorse racing would be quite a cool thing to watch
00:13:43,00:13:44,"So, wouldn't it?"
00:13:44,00:13:47,"Yes, you could paint a little like a little ascot"
00:13:47,00:13:50,Put little jockeys on top and tiny copepod jockeys
00:13:50,00:13:55,And they have to jump over things in the water
00:13:55,00:13:58,With these tiles and hedges and things like that
00:13:58,00:14:02,I think you want the jockeys to be the things that the seahorses are going to try and eat
00:14:02,00:14:03,"No, you're right"
00:14:03,00:14:06,You want the copepods to be going round like a hare in a greyhound race
00:14:06,00:14:07,Exactly
00:14:07,00:14:08,Yeah
00:14:08,00:14:12,That'd be amazing if in real horse racing there was a chance that the horse would eat the jockeys
00:14:12,00:14:14,Halfway through the race
00:14:14,00:14:16,And the Tories come off
00:14:16,00:14:18,And he's being eaten
00:14:18,00:14:24,"James and I know seahorse expert, by the way"
00:14:24,00:14:24,"Yes, we do"
00:14:24,00:14:25,Helen Scales
00:14:25,00:14:26,I know her too
00:14:26,00:14:28,I think we know her better
00:14:28,00:14:29,We probably introduced you to her once
00:14:29,00:14:30,"Yeah, you did, yeah"
00:14:30,00:14:30,"Yeah, okay"
00:14:30,00:14:32,I don't know her
00:14:32,00:14:33,Good
00:14:33,00:14:35,She's great
00:14:35,00:14:38,She's written the book called Beside and Steed which is unbelievably good
00:14:38,00:14:42,"Yeah, I have a feeling most of the stuff that I'm saying right now is taken directly from her book"
00:14:42,00:14:47,But it was stuff taken from her book by James and put it to a script which I've been just lifted
00:14:47,00:14:50,"And I'd look through the script, by the way"
00:14:50,00:14:56,"So she was on our show Museum of Curiosity as a guest about six years ago, seven years ago"
00:14:56,00:14:57,Almost even
00:14:57,00:14:59,This was the opening question we asked her in the show
00:14:59,00:15:00,Oh dear
00:15:00,00:15:04,"Helen, as someone who spent the past 15 years learning everything there is to know that fish"
00:15:04,00:15:05,Perhaps you can answer this for me
00:15:05,00:15:07,Is it true that there is no such thing as a fish?
00:15:07,00:15:08,"Oh, the way"
00:15:08,00:15:09,"Yeah, that was our opening question"
00:15:09,00:15:10,And what did she say?
00:15:10,00:15:11,"No, that's rubbish"
00:15:11,00:15:12,Yeah
00:15:12,00:15:13,I'm in 2009
00:15:13,00:15:17,There was a woman in Dorset who found a seahorse on her drive
00:15:17,00:15:20,And she lived three miles in land
00:15:20,00:15:21,Wow
00:15:21,00:15:22,And it was alive
00:15:22,00:15:23,How did it get there?
00:15:23,00:15:26,"Well, they think a seagull dropped it"
00:15:26,00:15:28,"Seagull, I think"
00:15:28,00:15:29,"Over, right"
00:15:29,00:15:31,It was a really rare endangered seahorse
00:15:31,00:15:32,Wow
00:15:32,00:15:36,"It could be that thing, you know that riddle about the man who's found in a diving suit in the forest"
00:15:36,00:15:41,It could be that someone was trying to put out a fire in her house by scooping up water from the sea
00:15:41,00:15:42,Into a helicopter
00:15:42,00:15:44,And then dropping it onto her house
00:15:44,00:15:45,And they scooped up a seahorse
00:15:45,00:15:46,Right
00:15:46,00:15:50,I was thinking of that one where there's a guy found hanging in a room
00:15:50,00:15:52,With a puddle of water
00:15:52,00:15:55,So I was wondering if the seahorse was trying to hang itself
00:15:55,00:15:56,And he was still on an ice cube
00:15:56,00:15:56,Yeah
00:15:56,00:15:57,Yeah
00:15:57,00:15:58,Oh with that
00:15:58,00:16:04,Or a man arrives into town on a seahorse on Thursday and then leaves again
00:16:04,00:16:07,"Friday, it's called Friday, the seahorse is called Friday"
00:16:07,00:16:07,Yes
00:16:07,00:16:10,I think it's that a seagull dropped it
00:16:10,00:16:12,I just think that's amazing
00:16:12,00:16:14,Trying to get endangered animals
00:16:14,00:16:15,A lot of them are quite endangered
00:16:15,00:16:18,I read something I think it was on Mother Nature Network
00:16:18,00:16:21,Maybe saying that they could be extinct within about 30 years
00:16:21,00:16:23,Which seems radically pessimistic
00:16:23,00:16:26,But because they use so much in Asian medicine
00:16:26,00:16:31,So 25 million seahorses a year are used in traditional Chinese medicine
00:16:31,00:16:35,Or actually the seahorse trust claims that it's 150 million a year
00:16:35,00:16:37,So it's somewhere between those two
00:16:37,00:16:40,"Which is a lot because they thought to help impotence, aren't they"
00:16:40,00:16:40,Which makes--
00:16:40,00:16:42,"Yeah, it's in China, yeah"
00:16:42,00:16:43,Which kind of makes a lot of sense
00:16:43,00:16:45,"No, it doesn't stop saying it makes sense"
00:16:45,00:16:45,"Yeah, it doesn't make sense"
00:16:45,00:16:46,"Yeah, killing them"
00:16:46,00:16:47,Don't say that sentence
00:16:47,00:16:48,Seahorse grinding up
00:16:48,00:16:50,"It doesn't make sense, it's a terrible idea"
00:16:50,00:16:53,I can see where culturally it happened
00:16:53,00:16:55,Because as the only males that give birth
00:16:55,00:17:01,Perhaps that has some connection to the fact that men now think if they eat ground up seahorse they'll get fertile
00:17:01,00:17:03,It starts spewing out babies
00:17:03,00:17:04,I know it doesn't make a lot of sense
00:17:04,00:17:06,"It doesn't make any sense, Hannah"
00:17:06,00:17:07,"No, it doesn't"
00:17:07,00:17:11,Scientists tested seahorse relationships about 10 years ago
00:17:11,00:17:12,They did an experiment
00:17:12,00:17:14,Because everyone thinks that they're monogamous
00:17:14,00:17:16,And they wanted to see maybe they're not
00:17:16,00:17:19,"And so they put little wire labels on them, colored wire labels"
00:17:19,00:17:21,And sort of match them up with their partners
00:17:21,00:17:24,And then they asked the public to spy on them to see if they were sleeping around
00:17:25,00:17:28,"And the scientists, one of the scientists responsible for it said"
00:17:28,00:17:32,"When people hear that this might not be true after all, i.e. the monogamy"
00:17:32,00:17:34,Their curiosity is immediately aroused
00:17:34,00:17:35,And they seem quite happy to watch
00:17:35,00:17:38,For long periods to see if there's any hanky panky going on
00:17:38,00:17:40,"Aroused, so they are an aphrodisiac"
00:17:40,00:17:41,That's the big thing
00:17:41,00:17:47,"Sorry, the fish this week is sponsored by ground up seahorses"
00:17:47,00:17:52,They found out that they flirted with both sexes up to 25 times a day
00:17:52,00:17:54,So it's hanky panky all over the shop?
00:17:54,00:17:55,"Oh yeah, it's quite a lot"
00:17:55,00:17:57,There's a lot in going on
00:17:57,00:17:58,Every day
00:17:58,00:17:59,Every day
00:17:59,00:18:01,"So yeah, it's a lot, i mean that's a lot"
00:18:01,00:18:04,"Wake up, check your partners alive down"
00:18:04,00:18:05,Dab it
00:18:05,00:18:08,"Well, might as well do a bit of flirting anyway"
00:18:08,00:18:10,"And their flirting is pretty intense, isn't it?"
00:18:10,00:18:13,Their meeting rituals last for days and days sometimes
00:18:13,00:18:16,And the way they mate is they interlock their tails
00:18:16,00:18:19,And they just bob along together with tails interlocked for hours on end
00:18:19,00:18:23,Or they dance around a kind of invisible maple
00:18:23,00:18:27,"And yeah, it's just very romantic kind of animal"
00:18:27,00:18:28,"It's very sweet, it's durable"
00:18:28,00:18:29,"It's weirdly sweet, yeah"
00:18:29,00:18:33,The eyes move independently of each other as well
00:18:33,00:18:34,Which is actually much bigger than me
00:18:34,00:18:38,It's because they're trying to check out all the other male and female horses
00:18:38,00:18:40,"It's got a roving eye, yeah, but they all do"
00:18:40,00:18:51,"Okay, it is time to move on to fact number three"
00:18:51,00:18:52,And that is my fact
00:18:52,00:18:56,My fact this week is that falcon experts put on a special hat
00:18:56,00:18:58,When they want to collect semen
00:18:58,00:19:00,Basically falcons have been going extinct
00:19:00,00:19:02,Or endangered in the wild
00:19:02,00:19:04,And so that what they were trying to do was
00:19:04,00:19:06,To force them to mate with each other
00:19:06,00:19:08,They had to do artificial insemination
00:19:08,00:19:10,And this guy in America called Les Boyd
00:19:10,00:19:12,Worked out the best way to do that
00:19:12,00:19:14,Was to wear a special hat
00:19:14,00:19:15,Which he would then walk into a room
00:19:15,00:19:17,The hat would excite the falcon
00:19:17,00:19:19,Who would then land on his head
00:19:19,00:19:20,And hump his head
00:19:20,00:19:24,Until it ejaculated into this guy's hat
00:19:24,00:19:26,And then he would wait for the next falcon
00:19:26,00:19:28,So it's onto the hat really
00:19:28,00:19:30,Because I imagine that into a hat means
00:19:30,00:19:32,It's you turn the hat upside down
00:19:32,00:19:34,And ejaculate into the...
00:19:34,00:19:35,"No, no, no, no"
00:19:35,00:19:36,"It's no, no, the hat looks like a waffle"
00:19:36,00:19:38,So it's got all these little holes on it
00:19:38,00:19:41,And so I think what happens when the ejaculate comes out
00:19:41,00:19:42,It sort of seeps through the holes
00:19:42,00:19:43,Like Swiss cheese
00:19:43,00:19:45,We should say they're not wearing these hats are they
00:19:45,00:19:48,Because they're particularly sexually attractive to the falcons
00:19:48,00:19:50,The hats are specifically there to collect the semen
00:19:50,00:19:52,But why does the falcon...
00:19:52,00:19:54,"I mean, this is an amazing fact"
00:19:54,00:19:58,Why does the falcon want to have sex with the hat?
00:19:58,00:19:59,I think it is and correct me if I'm wrong
00:19:59,00:20:02,They introduced the falcon to the hat very early on in life
00:20:02,00:20:06,And it sort of develops a mother complex with it
00:20:06,00:20:07,It imprints it
00:20:07,00:20:11,And then when they see the hat come back in all those years later
00:20:11,00:20:14,It thinks I've got to have it and lands on it
00:20:14,00:20:15,"But wait, are they introduced to the hat?"
00:20:15,00:20:18,"Because yeah, I think when falcons are raised by people"
00:20:18,00:20:20,They are more attracted to people than they are to other falcons
00:20:20,00:20:23,"Because they are imprinted, so it's whatever raises them"
00:20:23,00:20:24,They both are attracted to
00:20:24,00:20:26,I thought it was the humans and then the humans put on the hats
00:20:26,00:20:26,"Oh, wow"
00:20:26,00:20:28,Did it introduce the baby falcons to the humans
00:20:28,00:20:30,So what happens if the human walks in without the hat?
00:20:30,00:20:33,Then they think they'll shine their heads
00:20:33,00:20:36,So there's a real debate in the falcon in community
00:20:36,00:20:39,Over whether it's better to buy a collecting hat
00:20:39,00:20:41,They call it a copulation hat
00:20:41,00:20:43,Or whether it's better to make your own
00:20:43,00:20:45,Because it's much cheaper to make your own
00:20:45,00:20:47,But sometimes you just want a professional hat
00:20:47,00:20:48,Don't you?
00:20:48,00:20:50,Because it looks better
00:20:50,00:20:51,I guess so
00:20:51,00:20:54,But I don't think anyone's wearing this for fashion actually
00:20:54,00:20:55,They're not very fashionable things
00:20:55,00:20:57,They've got waffle stuff on the top
00:20:57,00:20:59,And usually a bird shagging
00:20:59,00:21:02,You can see it being a hipster thing
00:21:02,00:21:04,"Yeah, I can imagine walking around Shardich"
00:21:04,00:21:07,"No, I've just remembered that's what they do"
00:21:07,00:21:09,They imitate the falcon's voice
00:21:09,00:21:11,So they imitate the falcon's vocalizations
00:21:11,00:21:13,To sound like a lady falcon
00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah
00:21:14,00:21:15,I think that's amazing
00:21:15,00:21:16,"Yeah, it's incredible"
00:21:16,00:21:18,And you can see footage of this online by the way
00:21:18,00:21:19,They sort of land on the head
00:21:19,00:21:22,"And they're just going at it, flapping their wings"
00:21:22,00:21:25,This guy's head is just big jutted around all over the shop
00:21:25,00:21:27,And then it ends and he walks out
00:21:27,00:21:29,"And then he takes it through a tube, doesn't he?"
00:21:29,00:21:31,And he brings it to
00:21:31,00:21:33,To inseminate it into the female falcon
00:21:33,00:21:35,And that in itself is another whole process
00:21:35,00:21:40,What does he have to put on a special chest wig or something like that?
00:21:40,00:21:41,In the video that I saw
00:21:41,00:21:45,He also had what like a glove and God talks were mating on that
00:21:45,00:21:49,The copulation hat began as a copulation glove
00:21:49,00:21:51,I think because it definitely happened on the hand before
00:21:51,00:21:54,And I think some genius
00:21:54,00:21:56,Or wait a second
00:21:56,00:21:56,Yeah
00:21:56,00:21:58,What if I wear the glove on my head?
00:21:58,00:22:03,I think probably because if you have a falcon land on your hand
00:22:03,00:22:04,You can only stretch it so far
00:22:04,00:22:06,And they are moving about a lot
00:22:06,00:22:07,I mean it's a vigorous activity
00:22:07,00:22:09,And so you might get a wing in the face
00:22:09,00:22:10,So maybe that was a protection point
00:22:10,00:22:12,"So that, yeah, yeah, possibly"
00:22:12,00:22:15,But does that mean that they can be collecting
00:22:15,00:22:18,Gossalk on their hand and falcon at the same time?
00:22:18,00:22:19,Yeah
00:22:19,00:22:21,Do you know the other method to do it for doing this?
00:22:21,00:22:22,It's called stripping
00:22:22,00:22:24,It's a moral fashion method
00:22:24,00:22:28,None of this high tech
00:22:28,00:22:31,Digital equipment that he's using
00:22:31,00:22:35,So what you do is you get a little pipette
00:22:35,00:22:37,And you have to put it
00:22:37,00:22:38,It's a sort of tiny suction pump
00:22:38,00:22:41,"Into the birds, the male falcon's"
00:22:41,00:22:44,"Khloeakka, sort of genital opening"
00:22:44,00:22:45,And then you have to use an automatic pipette
00:22:45,00:22:47,"To just, you know, you just put it one notch"
00:22:47,00:22:51,And it just extracts a little bit of semen from the falcon
00:22:51,00:22:51,Right
00:22:51,00:22:53,Before the invention of the automatic pipette
00:22:53,00:22:55,What you would have to do is
00:22:55,00:22:59,Someone on the team would have to suck the open end of the pipette
00:22:59,00:23:01,To get the falcon semen going
00:23:01,00:23:03,And
00:23:03,00:23:06,This is from the book How Fast Can a Falcon Dive
00:23:07,00:23:10,Peter Kappai-Nolo had some experience performing this procedure as an undergraduate
00:23:10,00:23:14,Despite keeping an eye out for the rapid movement of semenal fluid up the tube
00:23:14,00:23:16,He occasionally learned the hard way
00:23:16,00:23:18,That while falcon semen looks like a nice lager
00:23:18,00:23:20,It tastes rather bitter
00:23:20,00:23:23,Because it's amber falcon semen
00:23:23,00:23:24,That looks so cool
00:23:24,00:23:25,But he discovered
00:23:25,00:23:27,And he's the co-author of this book
00:23:27,00:23:29,So does falcon semen look like beer?
00:23:29,00:23:35,Like if we went to the pub and I accidentally swaps duns beer for a pint of falcon semen
00:23:35,00:23:37,He might not notice
00:23:37,00:23:38,I if I saw the hat
00:23:38,00:23:39,If I was like
00:23:39,00:23:41,What are you doing wearing in that James?
00:23:41,00:23:42,It's just fashion Daniel
00:23:42,00:23:43,We are in shortage
00:23:43,00:23:48,"Okay, I can definitely say they're being a beer in shortage called falcon semen"
00:23:48,00:23:49,That's a really good beer name
00:23:49,00:23:50,Yeah it is
00:23:50,00:23:51,That should be our no such thing as a fish
00:23:51,00:23:52,Brewery
00:23:52,00:23:54,"Yeah, release"
00:23:54,00:23:57,But I put in falcon jizz into google in order to
00:23:57,00:24:01,To make sure that there is already a beer called falcon jizz
00:24:01,00:24:03,But what came up is that there's a
00:24:03,00:24:06,A club in America called falcon jizz which is what it would have corrected it
00:24:06,00:24:10,You have to wear this special hat to go in
00:24:10,00:24:13,It sounds like a really fun jazz club
00:24:13,00:24:15,And it's run by like this environmental scientist
00:24:15,00:24:18,And why is he running a jazz club?
00:24:18,00:24:18,I don't know
00:24:18,00:24:20,And his name is Tony Falco
00:24:20,00:24:22,So he's just missing the end to be Tony falcon
00:24:22,00:24:24,And he's in the falcon jazz club
00:24:24,00:24:25,And it's in New York
00:24:25,00:24:26,So if you're in New York
00:24:26,00:24:28,Go see the falcon jazz
00:24:28,00:24:30,And ask for a pint of falcon jizz
00:24:30,00:24:32,He should launch a beer there
00:24:33,00:24:35,Falco jazz presents falcon jizz
00:24:35,00:24:41,I think what's really interesting about this fact is it's the current method
00:24:41,00:24:45,Probably the most successful falcon breeder in the world
00:24:45,00:24:46,His name is Brynn Close
00:24:46,00:24:50,He specifically breeds falcons who fly incredibly fast
00:24:50,00:24:53,Because falcon racing is a thing that happens a lot in the Middle East
00:24:53,00:24:55,To buy an Abu Dhabi specifically do it
00:24:55,00:24:58,And the shakes and the super rich out there by these falcons
00:24:58,00:25:00,He is the number one breeder of these falcons
00:25:00,00:25:05,And that's how he collects the semen of all these of these different falcons
00:25:05,00:25:08,But anyone listening to this might remember ages ago
00:25:08,00:25:12,There was an image that appeared online of a commercial aeroplane
00:25:12,00:25:15,And it was the economy class of the aeroplane
00:25:15,00:25:17,And it was just packed with falcons
00:25:17,00:25:18,Sitting there
00:25:18,00:25:20,And to Brynn that's a very regular thing
00:25:20,00:25:24,Because that's how they fly all the falcons out to Abu Dhabi and Dubai
00:25:24,00:25:27,Was there a business class on the same flight for a few months
00:25:27,00:25:31,Or was it as people were coming in like yeah just this way so this way
00:25:31,00:25:33,Falcon you'd need to turn right
00:25:33,00:25:37,So airlines have specific rules for this right
00:25:37,00:25:39,There are a lot of airlines that will only animals that are allowing
00:25:39,00:25:44,The cabin are guide dogs for the blind and falcons for falcon racing
00:25:44,00:25:49,So Emirates is one of those airlines where it says they're the only two animals that are allowed
00:25:49,00:25:53,But if you buy a first-class seat you're allowed to falcons
00:25:53,00:25:55,So I think this is
00:25:56,00:25:58,One on the head one on the other
00:25:58,00:26:02,This is with Etihad that's what it's with
00:26:02,00:26:05,Yeah if you're going to Dubai or Abu Dhabi or something like that
00:26:05,00:26:08,You buy a first-class seat you're allowed to additional falcons
00:26:08,00:26:10,On the seat next to you
00:26:10,00:26:15,I get Etihad and Emirates a lot because my sister lives over in Abu Dhabi
00:26:15,00:26:17,I have never seen a falcon
00:26:17,00:26:18,Well you're never in first class then that's where they were hanging out
00:26:18,00:26:20,I thought you said you can have one in economy
00:26:20,00:26:22,You can't have one in economy yeah maybe
00:26:23,00:26:29,So just very quickly on brim close he raises these falcons in donkaster near an industrial estate
00:26:29,00:26:30,He's been doing it for years
00:26:30,00:26:34,He says that his falcons can get up to 75 miles an hour
00:26:34,00:26:36,The average falcon can get up to 60 miles an hour
00:26:36,00:26:40,So he doesn't know what he's doing right except that he knows that he's spending a lot of money
00:26:40,00:26:45,On their daily meals and so on in order to just build them up to be the strongest that they can be
00:26:45,00:26:48,And what's interesting is he lives in an industrial town
00:26:49,00:26:55,I read an article a year or so ago about pigeons which is that pigeons can fly faster
00:26:55,00:26:57,Through noxious air than they can through cleaner
00:26:57,00:27:02,If you get if you have racing pigeons they always go faster if you put them through horrible air
00:27:02,00:27:05,And no one knows why it might be because they just want to get out of it
00:27:05,00:27:07,Or it might be something to do I don't know
00:27:07,00:27:10,But that's the secret as what you're saying
00:27:10,00:27:12,Maybe maybe the donkaster air is the one secret
00:27:12,00:27:14,Maybe it's not anything else he's doing
00:27:15,00:27:19,Do you know how staff at marine parks get seeming out of a killer whale?
00:27:19,00:27:21,"No, go on"
00:27:21,00:27:23,They used to use a calvagina
00:27:23,00:27:25,They lost it
00:27:25,00:27:29,Some real and some artificial
00:27:29,00:27:32,Although where you would make an artificial calvagina I do not know
00:27:32,00:27:33,I could think the worst way
00:27:33,00:27:36,Wearing a swimming cap
00:27:36,00:27:43,Another marine biologist had his neck broken today
00:27:43,00:27:49,[Music]
00:27:49,00:27:54,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is Anna"
00:27:54,00:28:02,My fact this week is that my and women had to prove they could make cocoa with the right amount of froth before men would marry them
00:28:02,00:28:07,This is something I was reading in the Smithsonian
00:28:07,00:28:10,And it's something that's claimed by this guy called Haze Lovis
00:28:10,00:28:12,And I've known if that's how you pronounce his name
00:28:12,00:28:15,But he's a cultural curator at the Smithsonian
00:28:15,00:28:19,And he said that early records of my own marriages in Guatemala
00:28:19,00:28:22,Indicate that in some places a woman would have to make the cacao
00:28:22,00:28:24,So she'd have to make the chocolate drink
00:28:24,00:28:27,And prove that she could make it with the proper amount of froth
00:28:27,00:28:29,Before she was able to marry the man
00:28:29,00:28:31,And this is the thing froth was incredibly important
00:28:31,00:28:34,So I hadn't realized that the froth on the chocolate drinks in
00:28:34,00:28:38,Mesoamerican civilizations was a bigger deal than the actual chocolate drink I think
00:28:38,00:28:39,And why for do we know?
00:28:39,00:28:44,I guess because it was part of just part of the ritual right? So you'll see lots of Mesoamerican art
00:28:44,00:28:46,Which shows the women making the froth
00:28:46,00:28:51,And they'd stand up really really high above the vessel that they were pouring the chocolate drink into
00:28:51,00:28:55,And they'd pour it in from really high above and it would splash down onto the ground
00:28:55,00:28:56,Like two meters high
00:28:56,00:28:59,And that would sort of froth it up and they'd do that a few times
00:28:59,00:29:01,So you just pour back and forth and back and forth
00:29:01,00:29:03,So it's just like a ritualistic thing
00:29:03,00:29:06,I guess it's just showing that you're not a complete idiot
00:29:07,00:29:11,"Can you pour some stuff into a pot and then back and forth? Okay, well I'm angry, that's fine"
00:29:11,00:29:13,Are you from quite a height?
00:29:13,00:29:16,"I'd struggle, I would have been a spinster"
00:29:16,00:29:16,I don't know
00:29:16,00:29:20,So Jose de Acosta who was a Spanish Jesuit missionary
00:29:20,00:29:24,He said that the scum of froth had a very unpleasant taste
00:29:24,00:29:25,I really
00:29:25,00:29:29,I think to European taste it wasn't that tasty because it's hot chocolate but it's not that sugar in
00:29:29,00:29:32,"That'll pass on the chocolate, I'll just have some of that falcon seam and thank you very much"
00:29:32,00:29:34,Much nicer
00:29:35,00:29:38,Because they didn't have cane sugar or anything like that
00:29:38,00:29:40,They could have put honey in it I suppose
00:29:40,00:29:44,"But mostly it was a bitter and spicy drink, it wasn't sweet and"
00:29:44,00:29:46,"Yeah, they morphed with chilli in it, didn't they?"
00:29:46,00:29:50,Yeah and yeah it was really really popular in spite of not being delicious and sweet like we now have
00:29:50,00:29:55,"You know when old chocolate goes white, you know that?"
00:29:55,00:29:56,No
00:29:56,00:29:57,Yeah when it goes off
00:29:57,00:29:59,"When you leave chocolate for a while, you get white, do you know what that is?"
00:29:59,00:30:00,No
00:30:00,00:30:02,It's called a fat bloom
00:30:02,00:30:06,So it's liquid from the cacao bean
00:30:06,00:30:10,Gradually moving towards the surface of the chocolate and breaking out on the surface like a rash
00:30:10,00:30:11,It's not bad
00:30:11,00:30:12,"Yeah, I wouldn't eat it"
00:30:12,00:30:13,I would
00:30:13,00:30:13,Would you?
00:30:13,00:30:14,Yeah
00:30:14,00:30:15,What about green bacon?
00:30:15,00:30:16,"Yeah, I'd love it"
00:30:16,00:30:17,"No, sorry, no"
00:30:17,00:30:18,Green bacon?
00:30:18,00:30:20,You know bacon goes a little bit off
00:30:20,00:30:22,Off that shimmery sheen on it
00:30:22,00:30:23,I think that's probably still all right
00:30:23,00:30:24,I still eat that
00:30:24,00:30:25,"Yeah, it's nitrate burn that"
00:30:25,00:30:30,It's the nitrates that they use to cure the bacon with and preserve it
00:30:30,00:30:32,That's just that reacting with the oxygen
00:30:32,00:30:32,Great
00:30:32,00:30:34,"So does that imply that it's on the turn, right?"
00:30:34,00:30:37,"Yeah, but it's fine, it's still okay to eat"
00:30:37,00:30:37,Good
00:30:37,00:30:39,"Otherwise, I'm in serious trouble"
00:30:39,00:30:41,"I mean, if it's green and furry, probably not"
00:30:41,00:30:48,"They used to, the Mayans and the Aztecs used to use the cacao bean as currency"
00:30:48,00:30:51,That would be their equivalent to money
00:30:51,00:30:54,"Not exclusively, but it was, it was a traded thing"
00:30:54,00:30:56,So and you would know what it was worth
00:30:56,00:30:58,So one bean might be worth according to this expert
00:30:58,00:31:02,"Sorry, 200 beans might be worth according to this expert"
00:31:02,00:31:04,"The price of one turkey, for example"
00:31:04,00:31:05,Okay
00:31:05,00:31:07,"No, they think they know that, don't they?"
00:31:07,00:31:09,"Because so there, we can't, a lot of this stuff"
00:31:09,00:31:10,We kind of have to guess that
00:31:10,00:31:11,Because we don't have written records
00:31:11,00:31:13,For a lot of these cultures
00:31:13,00:31:16,"But they think they know that because they found counterfeit beans, right?"
00:31:16,00:31:16,So
00:31:16,00:31:17,No
00:31:17,00:31:18,They have
00:31:18,00:31:22,They found the archaeologists keep finding what look like cacao beans
00:31:22,00:31:23,And then they go up close
00:31:23,00:31:26,And their little beans made of clay to look exactly like cacao beans
00:31:26,00:31:28,And they think it must be counterfeit currency
00:31:28,00:31:30,"But or it could be, you know, they use them in"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"It's hot chocolate, tastes like shit"
00:31:32,00:31:34,Is it their equivalent of chocolate money?
00:31:34,00:31:36,It's the non chocolate money
00:31:36,00:31:42,One of the suggestions was that the counterfeits
00:31:42,00:31:43,were to use in ceremonies
00:31:43,00:31:46,Because a lot of religious ceremonies involved cacao
00:31:46,00:31:47,Because it was such a valuable thing
00:31:47,00:31:49,But the point of religious ceremonies
00:31:49,00:31:51,"Is to give offerings to the gods, right?"
00:31:51,00:31:52,And you would have thought
00:31:52,00:31:54,If you're offering a god what looks like a cacao bean
00:31:54,00:31:55,But when he tries it
00:31:55,00:31:57,It's a bit of clay
00:31:57,00:32:00,Doug would actually piss the wall because ceremonial things don't you like
00:32:00,00:32:04,Like in ancient Egypt they would have made fake slaves
00:32:04,00:32:05,Or fake this or fake
00:32:05,00:32:07,Fakes slaves for the afterlife
00:32:07,00:32:08,For the afterlife
00:32:08,00:32:08,For the afterlife
00:32:08,00:32:08,For the afterlife
00:32:08,00:32:10,I'm sorry I thought I meant like
00:32:10,00:32:11,I saw you my slave
00:32:11,00:32:13,It's just a block of wood
00:32:13,00:32:14,And in China
00:32:14,00:32:17,Traditionally they would do paper
00:32:17,00:32:18,Versions of things you want in the afterlife
00:32:18,00:32:22,Because they knew that you couldn't necessarily take your iPad
00:32:22,00:32:22,To the next life
00:32:22,00:32:24,Because it's a solid thing
00:32:24,00:32:26,But you could take a paper one
00:32:26,00:32:28,And they still do that
00:32:28,00:32:29,It's amazing
00:32:29,00:32:30,"Yeah, I think we have mentioned before"
00:32:30,00:32:32,They do money
00:32:32,00:32:33,So you just burn money
00:32:33,00:32:37,And you burn items that you think they would like to take into the afterlife
00:32:37,00:32:39,It's amazing if you get to the afterlife
00:32:39,00:32:41,And you've got a paper iPad there
00:32:41,00:32:42,"Oh, shit"
00:32:42,00:32:46,I thought when I walked through this door
00:32:46,00:32:48,It would all chance for me to fail the egg
00:32:48,00:32:53,Everyone in the afterlife has all wondered how with paper iPad
00:32:53,00:32:55,"Yeah, mine doesn't do anything either"
00:32:55,00:32:56,It's ridiculous
00:32:56,00:32:58,We've no way of communicating to you
00:32:58,00:32:59,I know
00:32:59,00:33:01,Maybe that's what ghosts are trying to do
00:33:01,00:33:04,Bring my friends
00:33:04,00:33:08,"So, I didn't know this"
00:33:08,00:33:10,But Kakao bean
00:33:10,00:33:12,Stocks are running lower and lower
00:33:12,00:33:14,And all the crops are being converted to corn
00:33:14,00:33:16,And West Africa where they grow a lot of it
00:33:16,00:33:18,And chocolate's going to get way more expensive in the next few years
00:33:18,00:33:20,And Erika McAllister mentioned this a few weeks ago
00:33:20,00:33:21,Yes
00:33:21,00:33:25,But there was a guy in 2010
00:33:25,00:33:29,Because you get traders who buy and sell loads of Kakao beans
00:33:29,00:33:33,He bought 7% of the world's Kakao beans
00:33:33,00:33:36,"658 million pounds worth, mountains of them"
00:33:36,00:33:39,"And he was nicknamed ""choc finger"""
00:33:39,00:33:42,"Chocolate finger, it should be just..."
00:33:42,00:33:46,I'm his real name's Anthony
00:33:46,00:33:49,He's just a trader who's specialised in Kakao his whole life
00:33:50,00:33:52,He knows all about the market movements
00:33:52,00:33:54,"And you know, he's just spend his whole life buying and selling it"
00:33:54,00:33:56,On what he thinks the market will do
00:33:56,00:33:59,"Just on the Mayans very quickly, not to do with Kakao"
00:33:59,00:34:03,"But to do with those massive, amazing pyramids that they built"
00:34:03,00:34:09,"So back in the 30s, they discovered a pyramid within a pyramid"
00:34:09,00:34:12,So is it in Russia?
00:34:12,00:34:14,"Well, no"
00:34:14,00:34:15,But what's amazing is last year
00:34:15,00:34:19,They've just found another pyramid inside that pyramid
00:34:19,00:34:20,Inside the pyramid
00:34:20,00:34:23,"Yeah, and they think there may be a few more in sight"
00:34:23,00:34:26,"So yeah, it's like a Russian dollar factor that's going on"
00:34:26,00:34:27,"Very, very middle"
00:34:27,00:34:28,That's the top of your own
00:34:28,00:34:33,"Yeah, this is only last year that they announced it"
00:34:33,00:34:34,"That they found this new, smaller pyramid"
00:34:34,00:34:36,I would have looked outside
00:34:36,00:34:36,Yeah
00:34:36,00:34:38,First pyramid for a massive pyramid
00:34:38,00:34:44,It could be that we're all living inside a massive kind of solar system size pyramid
00:34:44,00:34:47,And that one first one they found is actually the second one
00:34:47,00:34:47,Exactly
00:34:47,00:34:48,Yes
00:34:48,00:34:51,Why would you make the second Russian doll so much more
00:34:51,00:34:53,than the outside layer?
00:34:53,00:34:54,"You just wouldn't, doesn't make any sense"
00:34:54,00:34:57,"Yeah, that's a huge scaling difference between"
00:34:57,00:34:58,"Well, they're faster than that"
00:34:58,00:34:59,When they get that big
00:34:59,00:35:02,The first one took a lot of effort
00:35:02,00:35:05,"And then the next one they're like, oh, we shouldn't make one that big"
00:35:05,00:35:08,Just very quickly
00:35:08,00:35:11,We've never mentioned before that the first ATM machine
00:35:11,00:35:14,So the first cash machine was based on a chocolate bar dispenser
00:35:14,00:35:20,And so it was invented by this guy called John Shepherd Baron in the 1960s and '67
00:35:20,00:35:23,"And he, I was really an interview with him"
00:35:23,00:35:27,"Well, I just imagine in like five of us on one of those chocolate machines"
00:35:27,00:35:29,where it's just about to fall down
00:35:29,00:35:30,I think it's just quite fall down
00:35:30,00:35:32,"That would be the worst thing ever, wouldn't it?"
00:35:32,00:35:35,"Yeah, and they wouldn't fall properly, I don't know"
00:35:35,00:35:37,"Yeah, it would be a nightmare"
00:35:37,00:35:39,It was done with using checks in the olden days
00:35:39,00:35:42,"So you'd write a check and it had a bit of, come off here"
00:35:42,00:35:46,"Like, even to get some chocolate out of a chocolate machine, you'd write a check"
00:35:46,00:35:49,"And six days later, once it's cleared"
00:35:49,00:35:53,Who should I make it out to?
00:35:53,00:35:55,Just A9
00:35:55,00:35:59,Please deliver this check to A9
00:35:59,00:36:04,You're sincerely just a Baron
00:36:04,00:36:06,"Don, you don't sign off checks, you're sincerely"
00:36:06,00:36:11,I am so lost with what's happening at the moment
00:36:11,00:36:16,"Clear up number one, no, you didn't ever put checks into chocolate bar machines"
00:36:16,00:36:17,"I'm sorry, give that impression"
00:36:17,00:36:21,"What I meant was, he based the cash machine on a chocolate bar machine"
00:36:21,00:36:24,"But to use cash machines in the olden days, you put a check in"
00:36:24,00:36:27,"And it had a bit of radioactive carbon, 14-nice atop"
00:36:27,00:36:29,Which interacted with the machine
00:36:29,00:36:31,And he used to get in trouble and people would say
00:36:31,00:36:33,"Oh, we reckon this is dangerous, it's radioactive"
00:36:33,00:36:38,"So he said, I later worked out that you'd have to eat 136,000 checks"
00:36:38,00:36:39,for it to have any effect on your health
00:36:39,00:36:44,"Okay, so, is it, you put, that's our cash machine used to work with radioactive"
00:36:44,00:36:48,"Yeah, a radioactive system that triggered it to give you some cash"
00:36:48,00:36:50,That is unbelievable
00:36:50,00:36:53,"But that's not how the chocolate, the chocolate dispenser works"
00:36:53,00:36:55,"Because it would melt, it would melt"
00:36:55,00:36:57,You did used to get radioactive chocolate bars
00:36:57,00:37:01,"When they first invented radium or discovered radium, they started putting them in chocolate bars"
00:37:01,00:37:04,"So technically, you could have actually put a chocolate bar into a cash machine and got a cash"
00:37:04,00:37:09,But he'd have to get his chocolate from the original machine
00:37:09,00:37:11,So it's just the system that's just working back and forth
00:37:11,00:37:14,He still stopped between two vending machines
00:37:14,00:37:21,"So this guy, this inventor, said he then moved up to Scotland to the coast"
00:37:21,00:37:24,"And the next thing he invented, and the only other thing he invented as far as I can tell"
00:37:24,00:37:29,Is a device that played the sound of killer whales to ward seals off his fish farm
00:37:29,00:37:34,"And he said to the BBC, he only succeeded in attracting many more of them"
00:37:36,00:37:38,He should have put it inside a cow's vagina
00:37:38,00:37:47,"Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts"
