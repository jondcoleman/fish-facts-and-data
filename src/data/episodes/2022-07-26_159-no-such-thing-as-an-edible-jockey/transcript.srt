1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
 Hey guys, just a quick announcement before we begin this week's show which is that we are going on tour

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,420
 We are going all over the country and there are tickets available now

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,500
 We're gonna nodding him. We're gonna Manchester, London, Lester, Dunstable, Birmingham, Coventry

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,360
 Yeah, and there are more dates coming up, aren't there?

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,780
 There are indeed, but we're not allowed to say where they are yet

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,920
 But there'll be a bit further from the center of England than those places that Dan's just mentioned

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,760
 Yeah, it's gonna be so much fun. We're putting together this whole fantastic first half full of stupid games and extra

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,960
 bits and interactive bits, and in the second half we're gonna record an episode of the podcast

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,200
 Yep, so if you want to see any or all preferably all of that then go to qi.com/fishevents and you can get your tickets there

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,360
 Okay, on with the show

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,920
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,520
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anitzenski and Andrew Hunter Murray

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,120
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones of our four favorite facts from the last seven days

14
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,920
 And in no particular order, here we go

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,920
 Starting with you, James

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:33,160
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1966 the Chinese press reported that a 73-year-old German Mao had swam 15 kilometres of the Yangtze River in 65 minutes

17
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,840
 That's twice the speed that Michael Phelps has ever swam

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,640
 75, imagine what he could do at 40

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,920
 73

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
 73

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,000
 It's amazing that you're given a number and you just remember a different number

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,240
 No, I confused it with 65 minutes

23
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,880
 So I took the seven from the year and I took the five from the minutes

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,160
 Wait, may I have 73 kilometres in 15 minutes?

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,360
 I don't know

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,480
 He swam 1966 kilometres and 65 seconds

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,040
 Okay, wow, can you say the numbers again?

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,560
 Yes, year 1966, age 73, distance 15 kilometres and time 65 minutes

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,080
 And the thing is, I've read about this and it's possible that he might have been carried along

30
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,320
 by some very, very strong currents

31
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,520
 Right, but then I wonder if that's really swimming

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,280
 It's not, it's because it could be floating

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,320
 But he had floating bodyguards with him

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,120
 Yeah, he did

35
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,360
 And huge portraits of himself

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,720
 So there's a picture of him floating along with these six bodyguards around him

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,120
 And then these giant pictures of Chairman Mao floating alongside him in front of him

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,360
 But wait, when you say they were floating bodyguards

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,080
 What were they?

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,600
 They were swimming, too

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,480
 And they managed to keep up with the fastest swimmer

42
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,720
 And maybe that's why there were six, they were positioned strategically further up

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,680
 And after the river

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,120
 An improvement to Olympic swimming would be to have a giant raft with the swimmer's face on it

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,160
 Going behind it

46
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,760
 Because often when the water you don't know who it is

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,360
 But if there's a massive raft with Michael Phelps' face going behind it

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,400
 Yes, that's great

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,320
 It's interesting he spent so much time in a body of order because he never bathed

50
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,600
 Chairman Mao

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,400
 In order to wash himself he would have servants wipe him up and down with towels

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
 Yeah, yeah, so just wet towels

53
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,760
 In fact, and this is a bit early in the podcast to be going into this territory

54
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,320
 But he claimed to wash his body in the body of his women

55
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,040
 That was his

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,160
 Wait, in the body, he washed his body in the body of his women

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,920
 Yes, I think what that's saying is he liked to have sex with a lot of women

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,120
 And he thought that that was enough of a cleaning process

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,480
 It really wasn't there, was it?

60
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,120
 No, no, no

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,720
 That's a wipe him off with towels afterwards

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,560
 I had to go for that really long swim to really get it off

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,880
 Well, he is the most polluted river in the world, isn't it?

64
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,400
 It's unbelievably dirty

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,160
 So I suppose it suited him

66
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,400
 What I think, I think it's got rivals in now

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
 Maybe it was completely cleaned before he got it

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:03,240
 Mao used to suffer from very bad constipation

69
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,680
 And apparently if he actually managed to get a bowel movement out

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,320
 It was like a cause of celebration amongst the staff

71
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,000
 It was seen as a great way

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,640
 It would be celebration if I was a towel guy

73
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,880
 That's true, that's true

74
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,240
 He used to have two to three animals a day

75
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,280
 Wow

76
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,160
 Maybe when he was saying, "I'm surrounded by enemies"

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
 He was actually saying, "I'm surrounded by enemies"

78
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,400
 And the whole cultural revolution was a big mistake

79
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,600
 So there's a lot of work for Mao lookalikes at the moment

80
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,880
 Because in Chinese television, there's a lot of things you're not allowed to do

81
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,040
 If you want to write a screenplay

82
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,440
 I think we might have said before you're not allowed time travel

83
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,480
 And you're not really allowed word play and puns and stuff like that

84
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,320
 They have a lot of things you're not allowed to do

85
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,360
 But one thing you are allowed to do is historical dramas

86
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,800
 And so basically if you're a talented screenwriter in China

87
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,720
 You just write historical dramas

88
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,480
 And usually about Mao because he's like the most famous historical figure

89
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,320
 And so 44% of all Chinese shows produced in 2013 were historical dramas

90
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,520
 Wow

91
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,000
 You say that, I would be surprised if I was the same on the BBC

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,200
 No

93
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,960
 That's just what you watch, I know

94
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,760
 Oh yeah

95
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,200
 And so because a lot of these have Mao in them, there's a lot of work

96
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,240
 If you're a Mao lookalike, it's one of the best jobs you can have

97
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,600
 Wow, remember there's that Chinese guy who's an Obama lookalike?

98
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,200
 Is he

99
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,040
 Yeah, so he gets a lot of work in TV shows and stuff

100
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,560
 Is he Chinese?

101
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,600
 Yeah, he's Chinese, but he just looks a lot like Obama

102
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,240
 And he gets hired out as Obama

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,000
 He's not like exactly like Obama

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,520
 Well, he's a lookalike

105
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
 He's a lookalike

106
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,200
 Just on crazy claims made by dictators

107
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,680
 Oh yeah

108
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,120
 In 2006, a North Korean publication called Nodong Simmon

109
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,880
 reported that Kim Jong Il had mastered the art of teleporting

110
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,040
 and that he could move so quickly that American satellites could not track him

111
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,120
 Hey, have we ever mentioned the ex-president of Turkmenistan?

112
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,160
 Almost certainly, what...

113
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,080
 Feel like we must have the ears of?

114
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,600
 Yeah, the ears of, yeah

115
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,160
 He's just, he was one of those characters as well

116
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,560
 Claimed crazy things, did crazy things

117
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,040
 He changed the names of the days and the months

118
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,120
 in the country to the names of his family members

119
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,280
 Didn't he name Bread After His Mother? Was that him or something?

120
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,600
 He renamed Bread to his mother's name

121
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,200
 Yeah, very cool

122
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,400
 Just on on Mao

123
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,920
 So a statue of Chairman Mao was unveiled in 1993

124
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,640
 And it was a really big deal

125
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,160
 It was to commemorate him

126
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,560
 It was the, I think it was 120th anniversary of his birth or something

127
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:41,880
 Okay

128
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,160
 That makes sense

129
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,440
 And it was in December

130
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,800
 So and it was in the Hunan province

131
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,760
 So it's cold and dark and it's constant rain and sleet

132
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,880
 And you can now, if you go to China, you can buy photographs of

133
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,080
 The moment where the sheet was pulled off this giant statue

134
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,920
 The 6-meter-high bronze statue

135
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,400
 And at the same time the sun suddenly came out

136
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,760
 And the moon came out

137
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,240
 And they both shone upon the statue at the same time

138
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,560
 Wow

139
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,920
 And if you go, I mean

140
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,680
 Do you look very, as if you're believing it?

141
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,440
 Well that's, I mean that's possible, isn't it?

142
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,600
 It is plausible, I think it was just the

143
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,560
 Fortunatousness of the event

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,520
 I don't believe it

145
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,640
 I don't believe it at all

146
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,560
 Sun and the moon coming out at the same time

147
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,280
 But the sun and the moon are always out at the same time

148
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,040
 But half the year they're out at the same time

149
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,560
 That's not always

150
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,720
 No, but it bears credence that this might have been in that half of the year

151
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,360
 And I just think it sounds suspiciously like a propaganda quote

152
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,880
 Rather than, I think you guys are

153
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,720
 And also, it's very trusting

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,440
 No, but also this is what, last year, or the year before

155
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,640
 I mean China has a lot

156
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,360
 Ninety-nine-two-three

157
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,640
 Ninety-nine-three, okay

158
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,680
 Sorry, 25 years ago

159
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,440
 Regardless, China has been scientifically

160
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,240
 They would know basic things like when the sun and the moon's going to be out

161
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,040
 And like time it

162
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,840
 Also, don't forget the Trump, when he was doing his inauguration speech

163
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,080
 And the rain just mysteriously stopped

164
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,120
 Actually, yeah

165
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,640
 I'll start it, I can't remember

166
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,760
 I'll start it, I'll start it, yeah

167
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
 No, he very clearly remembered afterwards it a bit of sunny day

168
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,560
 So that's nice

169
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,760
 Just quickly on Mao, he initiated a campaign where you were supposed to murder all the sparrows

170
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
 It was called the Four Pest campaign

171
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,280
 He started it in 1958 and the idea was to exterminate mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows

172
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,800
 And it was really, really successful, so lots of people went out there

173
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,760
 And were supposed to form these kind of people's armies to try and kill them

174
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,120
 It was successful in the sense that it achieved what it was supposed to achieve

175
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,760
 And then it caused enormous problems

176
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,600
 Like these things do so, for instance

177
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,360
 The sparrows all been gone meant that there was a plague of literal plague of locusts

178
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,240
 Which now weren't being scared off by the sparrows

179
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,320
 And they, all the crops, and had incredibly devastating consequences

180
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,440
 Where many, you know, millions of people died

181
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,440
 And as far as what it was trying to do was get rid of pests, it didn't really work

182
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,840
 No, it worked as in it got rid of those pests

183
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,640
 But it's just such a strong lesson in how we definitely shouldn't be just trying to randomly wipe out something that's annoying us

184
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,200
 Yes

185
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,960
 Also, if you're on the side that's telling you to go out in massacre the sparrows

186
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,920
 It feels like you know that you're not on the right side, don't you?

187
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,720
 Do you?

188
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,280
 The others are quite bad, rats, mosquitoes, sparrows are so adorable

189
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,680
 They're like the epitome of a sweet innocent

190
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,440
 Not when they're eating all of your grain

191
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,920
 Of course not, but the word sparrow

192
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,520
 And the image of a little sparrow

193
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,280
 If someone's telling you to trample it down

194
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,360
 But without grain, how can you make a loaf of the president of Turkmenistan's mother?

195
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,640
 [laughter]

196
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:39,400
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy

197
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,960
 My factor is that seahorses greet their partners every day to make sure they are still alive

198
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,240
 Ooh

199
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,920
 Top tip for all you couples out there

200
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,880
 [laughter]

201
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,240
 What does that mean exactly?

202
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,000
 Because you'd greet them anyway, wouldn't you?

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,360
 [laughter]

204
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,920
 Every day

205
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,880
 I know their intentions

206
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,480
 Well, if you're a seahorse, you might not

207
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:55,880
 You know

208
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,480
 I don't like that, so I'm asking what do they, what do they, how do we know?

209
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,120
 Because most likely a seahorse is going to say hi to another seahorse if they're married every day

210
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,880
 [laughter]

211
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,160
 I'm so much unclean

212
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,520
 We don't need to do that, senders

213
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,320
 [laughter]

214
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,360
 I'm completely with Dan

215
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,320
 You're joining the side of the lunatics, Anna

216
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,080
 You're completely with that, are you?

217
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,360
 So that the married seaharses, you're with him on that bit, are you?

218
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,480
 Well, partners, it says

219
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,680
 We just jumped in with both feet, and I just decided

220
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,360
 When married seahorses get up in the morning, obviously they greet each other

221
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,520
 How do we know it's to make sure they're still alive?

222
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,200
 You're right, what they do is they do this courtship dance every day before dawn

223
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
 for a while

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,480
 Which is for two different reasons

225
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,440
 One is to check that the other one is still alive

226
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,200
 And the other is to also synchronise their mating

227
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,160
 Because you know the male carries the young in his pouch

228
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,240
 And then he sort of, yeah, he's pregnant

229
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,440
 That's a thing that is, you've just said quite casually

230
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,680
 But is incredibly amazing about seahorses

231
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,200
 The male carries the child

232
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,120
 Yeah, but apparently the ritual that they do, the sort of ritual they move around and sing

233
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,400
 is designed to synchronise their movements

234
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,320
 So the male will receive the eggs well

235
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,600
 when the female deposits her eggs in his pouch

236
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,080
 Okay

237
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,560
 Because otherwise they won't dock properly

238
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,400
 And just this keeping a live thing

239
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,200
 Is it really common for them to die in their sleep?

240
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,480
 They can't really drop in dead overnight

241
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,280
 I don't know

242
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,840
 I don't know, I don't know why it's so necessary

243
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,880
 Well, I looked into the life span of seahorses

244
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,520
 And in the wild between one and four years

245
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,440
 In captivity, four years

246
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,200
 And they say they just almost always make it to four years

247
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,720
 They have a really consistent sort of oldest age a seahorse gets to life span

248
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,520
 That's interesting

249
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,400
 So you're not basically, when you're three years old

250
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
 You know, you've only got a year left

251
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,680
 That's good, you can plan stuff

252
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,160
 Can't you? Like the pensions world is very stable

253
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,160
 In seahors land

254
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,160
 Because you know, roughly how long you've got

255
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,400
 I did not know that they were fish

256
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,600
 Yes, I don't know

257
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,040
 Well, I thought there was something

258
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,760
 Acquasty

259
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,720
 Did you think they were horses?

260
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,040
 I didn't think they were horses exactly

261
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,520
 But you thought they were maybe like muscles and...

262
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,840
 Yeah, I thought a lobster isn't a fish

263
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,480
 You know, and so they're called hippocampus, which means horse sea monster

264
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
 And they eat super quick

265
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,440
 They have to use in order to actually see them eating food

266
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,360
 Ice-peed cameras in order to catch it

267
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,680
 Because they can eat stuff in like six milliseconds

268
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,840
 Oh really, they're sucking, they suck it in, don't they?

269
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,560
 Yeah

270
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,640
 And also, they kind of flick their head

271
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,080
 Because they got this horse neck

272
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,160
 And they catch the culpods that they eat

273
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,400
 About 94% of the time

274
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,840
 Which the article I read said might be the most successful in nature

275
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,480
 But we know that actually dragonflies are slightly better than that

276
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,280
 We think dragonflies are 95%

277
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,880
 But they're similar kind of...

278
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,480
 But it very much depends on the prey

279
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,000
 It's like, it's all gone tech

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,040
 So, you know, a lion will be terrible at catching a copepod

281
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,680
 But a seahorse will be terrible at catching a zebra

282
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,320
 That's true

283
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,960
 And if I was to go to McDonald's and I wanted to get a Big Mac

284
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
 I would have 100% success rate

285
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,040
 Yeah, so we are the best hunters now I suppose

286
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,240
 If you're calling that hunting

287
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
 And I would be not

288
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,800
 That's when James and I go to McDonald's

289
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,200
 We hunt for the burgers, we sort of tiptoe up

290
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,120
 And make sure it doesn't see us coming

291
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,960
 So, the copepods, which they hunt

292
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,280
 The reason the seahorses have to be so good at hunting

293
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,760
 Is because the copepods can flee unbelievably fast

294
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,800
 They can move at 500 body lengths a second

295
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,880
 Which is the equivalent of a human swimming at 2,000 miles an hour

296
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,120
 Which is roughly as fast as chairman Mao

297
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,680
 And seahorses swim incredibly slow

298
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,800
 There's one that's called the line seahorse

299
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,080
 If you put it into a bathtub, just your regular length bathtub

300
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,640
 To swim that length would take five minutes

301
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,720
 Seahorse racing would be quite a cool thing to watch

302
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,440
 So, wouldn't it?

303
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,160
 Yes, you could paint a little like a little ascot

304
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,440
 Put little jockeys on top and tiny copepod jockeys

305
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,640
 And they have to jump over things in the water

306
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,920
 With these tiles and hedges and things like that

307
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,520
 I think you want the jockeys to be the things that the seahorses are going to try and eat

308
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,240
 No, you're right

309
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,840
 You want the copepods to be going round like a hare in a greyhound race

310
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,720
 Exactly

311
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,120
 Yeah

312
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,840
 That'd be amazing if in real horse racing there was a chance that the horse would eat the jockeys

313
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,040
 Halfway through the race

314
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,840
 And the Tories come off

315
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,440
 And he's being eaten

316
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,120
 James and I know seahorse expert, by the way

317
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,760
 Yes, we do

318
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,720
 Helen Scales

319
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,760
 I know her too

320
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,040
 I think we know her better

321
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,400
 We probably introduced you to her once

322
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,200
 Yeah, you did, yeah

323
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,920
 Yeah, okay

324
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,200
 I don't know her

325
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,000
 Good

326
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,320
 She's great

327
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,920
 She's written the book called Beside and Steed which is unbelievably good

328
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,920
 Yeah, I have a feeling most of the stuff that I'm saying right now is taken directly from her book

329
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,960
 But it was stuff taken from her book by James and put it to a script which I've been just lifted

330
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,840
 And I'd look through the script, by the way

331
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,120
 So she was on our show Museum of Curiosity as a guest about six years ago, seven years ago

332
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,320
 Almost even

333
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,480
 This was the opening question we asked her in the show

334
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,120
 Oh dear

335
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,120
 Helen, as someone who spent the past 15 years learning everything there is to know that fish

336
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,480
 Perhaps you can answer this for me

337
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,880
 Is it true that there is no such thing as a fish?

338
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,600
 Oh, the way

339
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,800
 Yeah, that was our opening question

340
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,280
 And what did she say?

341
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,160
 No, that's rubbish

342
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,360
 Yeah

343
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,960
 I'm in 2009

344
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,960
 There was a woman in Dorset who found a seahorse on her drive

345
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,360
 And she lived three miles in land

346
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,000
 Wow

347
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,200
 And it was alive

348
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,320
 How did it get there?

349
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,120
 Well, they think a seagull dropped it

350
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,440
 Seagull, I think

351
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,240
 Over, right

352
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,480
 It was a really rare endangered seahorse

353
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,280
 Wow

354
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,920
 It could be that thing, you know that riddle about the man who's found in a diving suit in the forest

355
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,160
 It could be that someone was trying to put out a fire in her house by scooping up water from the sea

356
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,360
 Into a helicopter

357
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
 And then dropping it onto her house

358
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,960
 And they scooped up a seahorse

359
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,840
 Right

360
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,600
 I was thinking of that one where there's a guy found hanging in a room

361
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
 With a puddle of water

362
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,160
 So I was wondering if the seahorse was trying to hang itself

363
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,280
 And he was still on an ice cube

364
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,680
 Yeah

365
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,160
 Yeah

366
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,040
 Oh with that

367
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,280
 Or a man arrives into town on a seahorse on Thursday and then leaves again

368
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,000
 Friday, it's called Friday, the seahorse is called Friday

369
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,320
 Yes

370
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,040
 I think it's that a seagull dropped it

371
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,600
 I just think that's amazing

372
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,280
 Trying to get endangered animals

373
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,400
 A lot of them are quite endangered

374
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,040
 I read something I think it was on Mother Nature Network

375
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,320
 Maybe saying that they could be extinct within about 30 years

376
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,880
 Which seems radically pessimistic

377
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,760
 But because they use so much in Asian medicine

378
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,880
 So 25 million seahorses a year are used in traditional Chinese medicine

379
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,960
 Or actually the seahorse trust claims that it's 150 million a year

380
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,880
 So it's somewhere between those two

381
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,520
 Which is a lot because they thought to help impotence, aren't they

382
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:40,520
 Which makes--

383
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,120
 Yeah, it's in China, yeah

384
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,400
 Which kind of makes a lot of sense

385
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,000
 No, it doesn't stop saying it makes sense

386
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,880
 Yeah, it doesn't make sense

387
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,920
 Yeah, killing them

388
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,880
 Don't say that sentence

389
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,920
 Seahorse grinding up

390
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
 It doesn't make sense, it's a terrible idea

391
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,000
 I can see where culturally it happened

392
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,880
 Because as the only males that give birth

393
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,560
 Perhaps that has some connection to the fact that men now think if they eat ground up seahorse they'll get fertile

394
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,240
 It starts spewing out babies

395
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,680
 I know it doesn't make a lot of sense

396
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,200
 It doesn't make any sense, Hannah

397
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,400
 No, it doesn't

398
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,480
 Scientists tested seahorse relationships about 10 years ago

399
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,680
 They did an experiment

400
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,440
 Because everyone thinks that they're monogamous

401
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,280
 And they wanted to see maybe they're not

402
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,560
 And so they put little wire labels on them, colored wire labels

403
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,240
 And sort of match them up with their partners

404
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,440
 And then they asked the public to spy on them to see if they were sleeping around

405
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,200
 And the scientists, one of the scientists responsible for it said

406
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,440
 When people hear that this might not be true after all, i.e. the monogamy

407
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,280
 Their curiosity is immediately aroused

408
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,880
 And they seem quite happy to watch

409
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,680
 For long periods to see if there's any hanky panky going on

410
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,920
 Aroused, so they are an aphrodisiac

411
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,560
 That's the big thing

412
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:47,400
 Sorry, the fish this week is sponsored by ground up seahorses

413
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,920
 They found out that they flirted with both sexes up to 25 times a day

414
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,680
 So it's hanky panky all over the shop?

415
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,960
 Oh yeah, it's quite a lot

416
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,160
 There's a lot in going on

417
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,440
 Every day

418
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,960
 Every day

419
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,720
 So yeah, it's a lot, i mean that's a lot

420
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,360
 Wake up, check your partners alive down

421
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,480
 Dab it

422
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,920
 Well, might as well do a bit of flirting anyway

423
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,680
 And their flirting is pretty intense, isn't it?

424
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,720
 Their meeting rituals last for days and days sometimes

425
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,440
 And the way they mate is they interlock their tails

426
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,880
 And they just bob along together with tails interlocked for hours on end

427
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,320
 Or they dance around a kind of invisible maple

428
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,080
 And yeah, it's just very romantic kind of animal

429
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,440
 It's very sweet, it's durable

430
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,640
 It's weirdly sweet, yeah

431
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,560
 The eyes move independently of each other as well

432
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,520
 Which is actually much bigger than me

433
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,440
 It's because they're trying to check out all the other male and female horses

434
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
 It's got a roving eye, yeah, but they all do

435
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:51,240
 Okay, it is time to move on to fact number three

436
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,520
 And that is my fact

437
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,280
 My fact this week is that falcon experts put on a special hat

438
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,120
 When they want to collect semen

439
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,840
 Basically falcons have been going extinct

440
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,680
 Or endangered in the wild

441
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,600
 And so that what they were trying to do was

442
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,440
 To force them to mate with each other

443
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,600
 They had to do artificial insemination

444
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,920
 And this guy in America called Les Boyd

445
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,520
 Worked out the best way to do that

446
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,120
 Was to wear a special hat

447
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,560
 Which he would then walk into a room

448
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,560
 The hat would excite the falcon

449
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,240
 Who would then land on his head

450
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,600
 And hump his head

451
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,120
 Until it ejaculated into this guy's hat

452
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,440
 And then he would wait for the next falcon

453
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,200
 So it's onto the hat really

454
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,280
 Because I imagine that into a hat means

455
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
 It's you turn the hat upside down

456
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
 And ejaculate into the...

457
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,080
 No, no, no, no

458
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,840
 It's no, no, the hat looks like a waffle

459
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,680
 So it's got all these little holes on it

460
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,160
 And so I think what happens when the ejaculate comes out

461
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,680
 It sort of seeps through the holes

462
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,720
 Like Swiss cheese

463
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,560
 We should say they're not wearing these hats are they

464
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,360
 Because they're particularly sexually attractive to the falcons

465
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,680
 The hats are specifically there to collect the semen

466
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,200
 But why does the falcon...

467
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,280
 I mean, this is an amazing fact

468
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,040
 Why does the falcon want to have sex with the hat?

469
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,880
 I think it is and correct me if I'm wrong

470
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,760
 They introduced the falcon to the hat very early on in life

471
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,600
 And it sort of develops a mother complex with it

472
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,480
 It imprints it

473
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,160
 And then when they see the hat come back in all those years later

474
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,440
 It thinks I've got to have it and lands on it

475
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,880
 But wait, are they introduced to the hat?

476
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,360
 Because yeah, I think when falcons are raised by people

477
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,680
 They are more attracted to people than they are to other falcons

478
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,000
 Because they are imprinted, so it's whatever raises them

479
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,120
 They both are attracted to

480
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,280
 I thought it was the humans and then the humans put on the hats

481
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,680
 Oh, wow

482
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,840
 Did it introduce the baby falcons to the humans

483
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,760
 So what happens if the human walks in without the hat?

484
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,560
 Then they think they'll shine their heads

485
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,200
 So there's a real debate in the falcon in community

486
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,720
 Over whether it's better to buy a collecting hat

487
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,240
 They call it a copulation hat

488
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,560
 Or whether it's better to make your own

489
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,320
 Because it's much cheaper to make your own

490
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,880
 But sometimes you just want a professional hat

491
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,360
 Don't you?

492
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,600
 Because it looks better

493
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,080
 I guess so

494
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,360
 But I don't think anyone's wearing this for fashion actually

495
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,800
 They're not very fashionable things

496
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
 They've got waffle stuff on the top

497
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,160
 And usually a bird shagging

498
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,840
 You can see it being a hipster thing

499
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,760
 Yeah, I can imagine walking around Shardich

500
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,800
 No, I've just remembered that's what they do

501
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,080
 They imitate the falcon's voice

502
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,640
 So they imitate the falcon's vocalizations

503
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,160
 To sound like a lady falcon

504
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,360
 Yeah

505
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,320
 I think that's amazing

506
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,200
 Yeah, it's incredible

507
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,120
 And you can see footage of this online by the way

508
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,320
 They sort of land on the head

509
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,120
 And they're just going at it, flapping their wings

510
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,080
 This guy's head is just big jutted around all over the shop

511
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,960
 And then it ends and he walks out

512
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,640
 And then he takes it through a tube, doesn't he?

513
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,240
 And he brings it to

514
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,240
 To inseminate it into the female falcon

515
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,880
 And that in itself is another whole process

516
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,440
 What does he have to put on a special chest wig or something like that?

517
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,480
 In the video that I saw

518
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,240
 He also had what like a glove and God talks were mating on that

519
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,320
 The copulation hat began as a copulation glove

520
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,960
 I think because it definitely happened on the hand before

521
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,520
 And I think some genius

522
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,040
 Or wait a second

523
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,520
 Yeah

524
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,600
 What if I wear the glove on my head?

525
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,400
 I think probably because if you have a falcon land on your hand

526
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,760
 You can only stretch it so far

527
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,040
 And they are moving about a lot

528
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,480
 I mean it's a vigorous activity

529
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,160
 And so you might get a wing in the face

530
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,760
 So maybe that was a protection point

531
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,920
 So that, yeah, yeah, possibly

532
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,880
 But does that mean that they can be collecting

533
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,920
 Gossalk on their hand and falcon at the same time?

534
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,400
 Yeah

535
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,480
 Do you know the other method to do it for doing this?

536
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,280
 It's called stripping

537
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
 It's a moral fashion method

538
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,600
 None of this high tech

539
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,320
 Digital equipment that he's using

540
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,240
 So what you do is you get a little pipette

541
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,560
 And you have to put it

542
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,920
 It's a sort of tiny suction pump

543
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,480
 Into the birds, the male falcon's

544
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,040
 Khloeakka, sort of genital opening

545
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,880
 And then you have to use an automatic pipette

546
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,640
 To just, you know, you just put it one notch

547
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,000
 And it just extracts a little bit of semen from the falcon

548
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,800
 Right

549
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,880
 Before the invention of the automatic pipette

550
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,720
 What you would have to do is

551
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,880
 Someone on the team would have to suck the open end of the pipette

552
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,800
 To get the falcon semen going

553
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,000
 And

554
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,120
 This is from the book How Fast Can a Falcon Dive

555
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,840
 Peter Kappai-Nolo had some experience performing this procedure as an undergraduate

556
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,200
 Despite keeping an eye out for the rapid movement of semenal fluid up the tube

557
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
 He occasionally learned the hard way

558
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,840
 That while falcon semen looks like a nice lager

559
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,040
 It tastes rather bitter

560
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,080
 Because it's amber falcon semen

561
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,360
 That looks so cool

562
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,400
 But he discovered

563
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,320
 And he's the co-author of this book

564
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,800
 So does falcon semen look like beer?

565
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,640
 Like if we went to the pub and I accidentally swaps duns beer for a pint of falcon semen

566
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,000
 He might not notice

567
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,520
 I if I saw the hat

568
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,880
 If I was like

569
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,160
 What are you doing wearing in that James?

570
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,840
 It's just fashion Daniel

571
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,640
 We are in shortage

572
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,520
 Okay, I can definitely say they're being a beer in shortage called falcon semen

573
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,720
 That's a really good beer name

574
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,280
 Yeah it is

575
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,960
 That should be our no such thing as a fish

576
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,680
 Brewery

577
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,040
 Yeah, release

578
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,160
 But I put in falcon jizz into google in order to

579
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,720
 To make sure that there is already a beer called falcon jizz

580
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,400
 But what came up is that there's a

581
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,760
 A club in America called falcon jizz which is what it would have corrected it

582
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,520
 You have to wear this special hat to go in

583
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,400
 It sounds like a really fun jazz club

584
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,800
 And it's run by like this environmental scientist

585
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,200
 And why is he running a jazz club?

586
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,520
 I don't know

587
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,200
 And his name is Tony Falco

588
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,520
 So he's just missing the end to be Tony falcon

589
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,120
 And he's in the falcon jazz club

590
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,880
 And it's in New York

591
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,760
 So if you're in New York

592
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,760
 Go see the falcon jazz

593
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,840
 And ask for a pint of falcon jizz

594
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,200
 He should launch a beer there

595
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,240
 Falco jazz presents falcon jizz

596
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,560
 I think what's really interesting about this fact is it's the current method

597
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,160
 Probably the most successful falcon breeder in the world

598
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,440
 His name is Brynn Close

599
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,520
 He specifically breeds falcons who fly incredibly fast

600
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,240
 Because falcon racing is a thing that happens a lot in the Middle East

601
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,720
 To buy an Abu Dhabi specifically do it

602
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,760
 And the shakes and the super rich out there by these falcons

603
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
 He is the number one breeder of these falcons

604
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,800
 And that's how he collects the semen of all these of these different falcons

605
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,600
 But anyone listening to this might remember ages ago

606
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,120
 There was an image that appeared online of a commercial aeroplane

607
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,240
 And it was the economy class of the aeroplane

608
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,160
 And it was just packed with falcons

609
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,120
 Sitting there

610
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
 And to Brynn that's a very regular thing

611
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,600
 Because that's how they fly all the falcons out to Abu Dhabi and Dubai

612
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,240
 Was there a business class on the same flight for a few months

613
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,640
 Or was it as people were coming in like yeah just this way so this way

614
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,080
 Falcon you'd need to turn right

615
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,080
 So airlines have specific rules for this right

616
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,560
 There are a lot of airlines that will only animals that are allowing

617
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,760
 The cabin are guide dogs for the blind and falcons for falcon racing

618
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,400
 So Emirates is one of those airlines where it says they're the only two animals that are allowed

619
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,560
 But if you buy a first-class seat you're allowed to falcons

620
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,080
 So I think this is

621
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
 One on the head one on the other

622
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,680
 This is with Etihad that's what it's with

623
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,400
 Yeah if you're going to Dubai or Abu Dhabi or something like that

624
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,440
 You buy a first-class seat you're allowed to additional falcons

625
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,520
 On the seat next to you

626
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,080
 I get Etihad and Emirates a lot because my sister lives over in Abu Dhabi

627
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,480
 I have never seen a falcon

628
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,920
 Well you're never in first class then that's where they were hanging out

629
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,520
 I thought you said you can have one in economy

630
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,360
 You can't have one in economy yeah maybe

631
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:29,160
 So just very quickly on brim close he raises these falcons in donkaster near an industrial estate

632
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,760
 He's been doing it for years

633
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,120
 He says that his falcons can get up to 75 miles an hour

634
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,680
 The average falcon can get up to 60 miles an hour

635
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,920
 So he doesn't know what he's doing right except that he knows that he's spending a lot of money

636
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,880
 On their daily meals and so on in order to just build them up to be the strongest that they can be

637
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,920
 And what's interesting is he lives in an industrial town

638
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,000
 I read an article a year or so ago about pigeons which is that pigeons can fly faster

639
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,160
 Through noxious air than they can through cleaner

640
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,760
 If you get if you have racing pigeons they always go faster if you put them through horrible air

641
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,720
 And no one knows why it might be because they just want to get out of it

642
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,960
 Or it might be something to do I don't know

643
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,120
 But that's the secret as what you're saying

644
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,840
 Maybe maybe the donkaster air is the one secret

645
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,280
 Maybe it's not anything else he's doing

646
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,960
 Do you know how staff at marine parks get seeming out of a killer whale?

647
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,800
 No, go on

648
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,240
 They used to use a calvagina

649
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,320
 They lost it

650
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,320
 Some real and some artificial

651
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,040
 Although where you would make an artificial calvagina I do not know

652
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,800
 I could think the worst way

653
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,520
 Wearing a swimming cap

654
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:43,000
 Another marine biologist had his neck broken today

655
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,960
 [Music]

656
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,680
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is Anna

657
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:02,280
 My fact this week is that my and women had to prove they could make cocoa with the right amount of froth before men would marry them

658
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,160
 This is something I was reading in the Smithsonian

659
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,600
 And it's something that's claimed by this guy called Haze Lovis

660
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,520
 And I've known if that's how you pronounce his name

661
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,240
 But he's a cultural curator at the Smithsonian

662
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,000
 And he said that early records of my own marriages in Guatemala

663
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,840
 Indicate that in some places a woman would have to make the cacao

664
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
 So she'd have to make the chocolate drink

665
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,720
 And prove that she could make it with the proper amount of froth

666
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,640
 Before she was able to marry the man

667
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,800
 And this is the thing froth was incredibly important

668
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,760
 So I hadn't realized that the froth on the chocolate drinks in

669
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,440
 Mesoamerican civilizations was a bigger deal than the actual chocolate drink I think

670
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,960
 And why for do we know?

671
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,680
 I guess because it was part of just part of the ritual right? So you'll see lots of Mesoamerican art

672
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,920
 Which shows the women making the froth

673
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,800
 And they'd stand up really really high above the vessel that they were pouring the chocolate drink into

674
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,320
 And they'd pour it in from really high above and it would splash down onto the ground

675
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,680
 Like two meters high

676
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,240
 And that would sort of froth it up and they'd do that a few times

677
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,720
 So you just pour back and forth and back and forth

678
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,640
 So it's just like a ritualistic thing

679
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,200
 I guess it's just showing that you're not a complete idiot

680
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,240
 Can you pour some stuff into a pot and then back and forth? Okay, well I'm angry, that's fine

681
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
 Are you from quite a height?

682
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,040
 I'd struggle, I would have been a spinster

683
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,680
 I don't know

684
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,600
 So Jose de Acosta who was a Spanish Jesuit missionary

685
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,760
 He said that the scum of froth had a very unpleasant taste

686
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,480
 I really

687
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,400
 I think to European taste it wasn't that tasty because it's hot chocolate but it's not that sugar in

688
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,680
 That'll pass on the chocolate, I'll just have some of that falcon seam and thank you very much

689
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,040
 Much nicer

690
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,120
 Because they didn't have cane sugar or anything like that

691
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,280
 They could have put honey in it I suppose

692
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,200
 But mostly it was a bitter and spicy drink, it wasn't sweet and

693
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
 Yeah, they morphed with chilli in it, didn't they?

694
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,600
 Yeah and yeah it was really really popular in spite of not being delicious and sweet like we now have

695
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,560
 You know when old chocolate goes white, you know that?

696
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,440
 No

697
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,240
 Yeah when it goes off

698
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,720
 When you leave chocolate for a while, you get white, do you know what that is?

699
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,360
 No

700
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,600
 It's called a fat bloom

701
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,280
 So it's liquid from the cacao bean

702
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,280
 Gradually moving towards the surface of the chocolate and breaking out on the surface like a rash

703
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,560
 It's not bad

704
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,920
 Yeah, I wouldn't eat it

705
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,480
 I would

706
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:13,960
 Would you?

707
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,440
 Yeah

708
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,960
 What about green bacon?

709
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,840
 Yeah, I'd love it

710
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,640
 No, sorry, no

711
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,440
 Green bacon?

712
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,520
 You know bacon goes a little bit off

713
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,280
 Off that shimmery sheen on it

714
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,400
 I think that's probably still all right

715
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,200
 I still eat that

716
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,800
 Yeah, it's nitrate burn that

717
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,120
 It's the nitrates that they use to cure the bacon with and preserve it

718
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
 That's just that reacting with the oxygen

719
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,840
 Great

720
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,680
 So does that imply that it's on the turn, right?

721
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,240
 Yeah, but it's fine, it's still okay to eat

722
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,800
 Good

723
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
 Otherwise, I'm in serious trouble

724
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,480
 I mean, if it's green and furry, probably not

725
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:48,440
 They used to, the Mayans and the Aztecs used to use the cacao bean as currency

726
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,400
 That would be their equivalent to money

727
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,600
 Not exclusively, but it was, it was a traded thing

728
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,200
 So and you would know what it was worth

729
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,600
 So one bean might be worth according to this expert

730
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,040
 Sorry, 200 beans might be worth according to this expert

731
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,680
 The price of one turkey, for example

732
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,880
 Okay

733
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,240
 No, they think they know that, don't they?

734
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,080
 Because so there, we can't, a lot of this stuff

735
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,040
 We kind of have to guess that

736
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,400
 Because we don't have written records

737
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,160
 For a lot of these cultures

738
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,120
 But they think they know that because they found counterfeit beans, right?

739
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,760
 So

740
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,720
 No

741
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,680
 They have

742
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,520
 They found the archaeologists keep finding what look like cacao beans

743
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,400
 And then they go up close

744
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,440
 And their little beans made of clay to look exactly like cacao beans

745
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,600
 And they think it must be counterfeit currency

746
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,440
 But or it could be, you know, they use them in

747
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,600
 It's hot chocolate, tastes like shit

748
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,840
 Is it their equivalent of chocolate money?

749
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
 It's the non chocolate money

750
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,360
 One of the suggestions was that the counterfeits

751
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,400
 were to use in ceremonies

752
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,040
 Because a lot of religious ceremonies involved cacao

753
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,800
 Because it was such a valuable thing

754
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
 But the point of religious ceremonies

755
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,320
 Is to give offerings to the gods, right?

756
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,120
 And you would have thought

757
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,520
 If you're offering a god what looks like a cacao bean

758
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,800
 But when he tries it

759
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,160
 It's a bit of clay

760
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,360
 Doug would actually piss the wall because ceremonial things don't you like

761
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,840
 Like in ancient Egypt they would have made fake slaves

762
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,880
 Or fake this or fake

763
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,480
 Fakes slaves for the afterlife

764
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,040
 For the afterlife

765
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,040
 For the afterlife

766
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,840
 For the afterlife

767
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,200
 I'm sorry I thought I meant like

768
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,400
 I saw you my slave

769
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,320
 It's just a block of wood

770
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,280
 And in China

771
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,000
 Traditionally they would do paper

772
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,840
 Versions of things you want in the afterlife

773
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,040
 Because they knew that you couldn't necessarily take your iPad

774
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,840
 To the next life

775
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,520
 Because it's a solid thing

776
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,040
 But you could take a paper one

777
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
 And they still do that

778
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,000
 It's amazing

779
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,520
 Yeah, I think we have mentioned before

780
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,440
 They do money

781
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,640
 So you just burn money

782
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,720
 And you burn items that you think they would like to take into the afterlife

783
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,240
 It's amazing if you get to the afterlife

784
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,240
 And you've got a paper iPad there

785
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,840
 Oh, shit

786
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,040
 I thought when I walked through this door

787
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
 It would all chance for me to fail the egg

788
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:53,240
 Everyone in the afterlife has all wondered how with paper iPad

789
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,240
 Yeah, mine doesn't do anything either

790
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,200
 It's ridiculous

791
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
 We've no way of communicating to you

792
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,000
 I know

793
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Maybe that's what ghosts are trying to do

794
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,200
 Bring my friends

795
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,680
 So, I didn't know this

796
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,840
 But Kakao bean

797
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,360
 Stocks are running lower and lower

798
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,840
 And all the crops are being converted to corn

799
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,440
 And West Africa where they grow a lot of it

800
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,840
 And chocolate's going to get way more expensive in the next few years

801
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,840
 And Erika McAllister mentioned this a few weeks ago

802
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,480
 Yes

803
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,720
 But there was a guy in 2010

804
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,000
 Because you get traders who buy and sell loads of Kakao beans

805
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,560
 He bought 7% of the world's Kakao beans

806
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,680
 658 million pounds worth, mountains of them

807
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,000
 And he was nicknamed "choc finger"

808
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,360
 Chocolate finger, it should be just...

809
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,680
 I'm his real name's Anthony

810
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,400
 He's just a trader who's specialised in Kakao his whole life

811
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,280
 He knows all about the market movements

812
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,520
 And you know, he's just spend his whole life buying and selling it

813
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,280
 On what he thinks the market will do

814
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,320
 Just on the Mayans very quickly, not to do with Kakao

815
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,960
 But to do with those massive, amazing pyramids that they built

816
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,320
 So back in the 30s, they discovered a pyramid within a pyramid

817
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,280
 So is it in Russia?

818
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,520
 Well, no

819
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,960
 But what's amazing is last year

820
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,320
 They've just found another pyramid inside that pyramid

821
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,600
 Inside the pyramid

822
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,640
 Yeah, and they think there may be a few more in sight

823
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,280
 So yeah, it's like a Russian dollar factor that's going on

824
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,240
 Very, very middle

825
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,200
 That's the top of your own

826
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,080
 Yeah, this is only last year that they announced it

827
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,920
 That they found this new, smaller pyramid

828
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,360
 I would have looked outside

829
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:36,760
 Yeah

830
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,920
 First pyramid for a massive pyramid

831
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:44,440
 It could be that we're all living inside a massive kind of solar system size pyramid

832
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,080
 And that one first one they found is actually the second one

833
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,720
 Exactly

834
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,440
 Yes

835
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,640
 Why would you make the second Russian doll so much more

836
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,240
 than the outside layer?

837
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,840
 You just wouldn't, doesn't make any sense

838
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,160
 Yeah, that's a huge scaling difference between

839
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,360
 Well, they're faster than that

840
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,160
 When they get that big

841
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,680
 The first one took a lot of effort

842
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,080
 And then the next one they're like, oh, we shouldn't make one that big

843
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,600
 Just very quickly

844
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,400
 We've never mentioned before that the first ATM machine

845
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,840
 So the first cash machine was based on a chocolate bar dispenser

846
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,440
 And so it was invented by this guy called John Shepherd Baron in the 1960s and '67

847
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,160
 And he, I was really an interview with him

848
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,080
 Well, I just imagine in like five of us on one of those chocolate machines

849
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,080
 where it's just about to fall down

850
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,440
 I think it's just quite fall down

851
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,280
 That would be the worst thing ever, wouldn't it?

852
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,720
 Yeah, and they wouldn't fall properly, I don't know

853
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,240
 Yeah, it would be a nightmare

854
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,960
 It was done with using checks in the olden days

855
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,520
 So you'd write a check and it had a bit of, come off here

856
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,680
 Like, even to get some chocolate out of a chocolate machine, you'd write a check

857
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,720
 And six days later, once it's cleared

858
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,080
 Who should I make it out to?

859
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,320
 Just A9

860
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,960
 Please deliver this check to A9

861
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,040
 You're sincerely just a Baron

862
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,840
 Don, you don't sign off checks, you're sincerely

863
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,000
 I am so lost with what's happening at the moment

864
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,440
 Clear up number one, no, you didn't ever put checks into chocolate bar machines

865
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,720
 I'm sorry, give that impression

866
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,560
 What I meant was, he based the cash machine on a chocolate bar machine

867
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,520
 But to use cash machines in the olden days, you put a check in

868
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,400
 And it had a bit of radioactive carbon, 14-nice atop

869
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
 Which interacted with the machine

870
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,160
 And he used to get in trouble and people would say

871
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,240
 Oh, we reckon this is dangerous, it's radioactive

872
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,040
 So he said, I later worked out that you'd have to eat 136,000 checks

873
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,720
 for it to have any effect on your health

874
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,920
 Okay, so, is it, you put, that's our cash machine used to work with radioactive

875
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,600
 Yeah, a radioactive system that triggered it to give you some cash

876
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,120
 That is unbelievable

877
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,960
 But that's not how the chocolate, the chocolate dispenser works

878
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,160
 Because it would melt, it would melt

879
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,320
 You did used to get radioactive chocolate bars

880
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,400
 When they first invented radium or discovered radium, they started putting them in chocolate bars

881
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,680
 So technically, you could have actually put a chocolate bar into a cash machine and got a cash

882
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,080
 But he'd have to get his chocolate from the original machine

883
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,640
 So it's just the system that's just working back and forth

884
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,040
 He still stopped between two vending machines

885
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:21,000
 So this guy, this inventor, said he then moved up to Scotland to the coast

886
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,360
 And the next thing he invented, and the only other thing he invented as far as I can tell

887
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,160
 Is a device that played the sound of killer whales to ward seals off his fish farm

888
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,760
 And he said to the BBC, he only succeeded in attracting many more of them

889
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
 He should have put it inside a cow's vagina

890
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:47,560
 Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts

891
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,000
