00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.040
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.480
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.320
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Anna. My fact this week is that logs

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.000
 used to be carried around the Andaman Islands by swimming elephants. There's a lot of information

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.080
 to unpick in that. Okay here's the first one. In fact you've actually answered it with your fact

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.880
 but I was going to say can elephants swim? I'm not going to dignify that with an answer, James.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.560
 It's like you're questioning the veracity of my facts. What? Yes they can. They can swim. I see I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.320
 do see what you're saying. Is it just these elephants or all elephants? Oh I thought he meant

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.600
 are the logs like a floatation device and they were just using that to... That's a great point Dan,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 that's exactly what I didn't really mean but let's pretend I did. I mean you don't get swimming

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.400
 lessons for dogs do you but if they jump into a pond they're fine. Well interesting you say that my

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.800
 mum actually has a dog which can't swim. It's very embarrassing but yes largely I think four-legged

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.560
 mammals can instinctively swim and elephants can broadly and these ones particularly can but they

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 can swim incredibly long distances these particular Andaman elephants and they... So what happened was

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.480
 the Andaman Islands, Andaman and Nicobar Islands in fact are territories of India about 572 islands

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.440
 altogether and in about the 70s they started logging there and they brought a bunch of elephants

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.040
 over from mainland India and they sort of pulled down trees in the jungle and then they'd load up

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.440
 the elephants with trees and they'd take them to the beaches to be shipped off in barges but the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.320
 elephants had to block trees in various different islands and there was no way of transporting them

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.280
 between the islands and so they just sent them on their way to swim it and they'd swim like 30

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.760
 kilometers, 20-30 kilometers between islands do some logging and drag the logs out to sort of barges

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.360
 out to sea and load them up. That's incredible. That is an incredible distance to travel as an

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.360
 elephant. Are they getting guidance in terms of direction you know? Do currents take them out?

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.880
 Are there lanes for them to swim in? They're heavily signposted and I think humans would accompany them

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.520
 between the islands on small rafts and boats that couldn't accommodate the elephants. I don't,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.040
 I actually am not sure maybe they had memorized various routes but I think that might be a step

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.520
 beyond a lot of elephants. An elephant could remember any route it was given couldn't it?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.400
 But because an elephant never forgets. Exactly yeah. Yeah I didn't know that we were doing a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.040
 common erroneous phrase-based fact now. The thing is about the elephants is I've read an article

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.600
 called problems in the land vertebrate zoo geography of certain islands and the swimming

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.000
 powers of elephants by David Lee Johnson from 1980 and he says, I'm sure you've all read it,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.960
 but he says, I'm sure all the listeners have read it, but he says that elephants have such good

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.800
 eyesight and sense of smell that even kilometers and kilometers and kilometers away they can see

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.520
 another island that most animals wouldn't be able to see and also smell food on another island.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.640
 Incredible. And because it could smell the food it could find its way there. Yeah. So you're saying

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.960
 the logging humans make a phone call to the next island saying, look get a polo min,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.280
 leave it on the beach, I'm sending the elephant over now. Can I just say, I'm not saying that.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.480
 Donald Lee Johnson is saying that in his paper problems in the land vertebrate zoo geography

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.200
 of certain islands and the swimming powers of elephants from 1980. He was saying that, I wasn't

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.720
 saying that. That's so good. But you just need to, I don't know James, you're quoting him pretty

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.920
 extensively. I think you are now saying that. That's such a good idea. But as long as all you

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.520
 have to do is coordinate like no one, right, the elephants are moving today. No one's allowed to

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.520
 open a banana. It's a key. Within a 50 mile radar. That's how you poach then, right? That's the best

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.160
 poaching tactic. Yeah, absolutely. All the elephants just fuck off this way. Where are they going?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.160
 The thing is that according to this paper, until the 70s and 80s, a lot of geographers

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.120
 assumed that elephants couldn't swim. And so when you found elephant bones on an island,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.440
 even if they'd gone extinct or something, or even if you found living elephants,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.200
 then there must have been a land bridge because otherwise there's no way they could have got

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.400
 a cross. And that meant that a lot of geographers had these ideas of certain islands around the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.800
 world that must have been connected by land at some stage because they assumed that elephants could

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.320
 swim. Really? That's interesting. That's amazing. I thought, I didn't properly know that elephants

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.120
 could swim actually. I did know that they could walk underwater. That was a thing I knew at certain

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.280
 depths because I've seen footage where they use their trunk as a snorkel. And so, yeah, that's

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.200
 really fun when you see that bit of footage. But that, yeah, that's amazing. James, was it Donald

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.360
 Johnson, you were saying? Yeah, it was Donald Lee Johnson and his paper Problems in the Land

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.440
 Vertebrate Suji. No, no, I don't know if we need to. I didn't read that paper. I'm probably now the

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.120
 only person listening here in Baltimore who hasn't. But I think that I read a reference to it because

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.200
 there's a debate about how elephants got to Sri Lanka, isn't there? Yeah. And it was, because it's

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.280
 about, how far is it from the Indian coast? Quite a long way. It is quite a long way, but it has

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.600
 elephants. And lots of other places used to have elephants like Malta and Crete and Cyprus. Yes.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.760
 None of which I think have elephants now. I've been to Malta and it's quite a small island.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.040
 You would struggle to hide a wild elephant population on it.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.920
 The elephants on Sri Lanka, I think they're still swimming there. They're still making the journey

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.160
 over to Sri Lanka because every few months it seems like there's a story where a Sri Lankan

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.640
 elephant is caught at sea and is being swept around in the waves and has to be rescued.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.200
 Because there was one that, you know, in the media gets a theme and reports on every instance

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.640
 of it and it turns out it's happening all the time. And it happened once in 2017.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.960
 A Sri Lankan elephant was found being washed around about 16 kilometers out to sea.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.840
 And, you know, they all had to get a raft and come and pull it in again. And then two weeks later,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.360
 two Sri Lankan elephants were found stranded at sea and had to be dragged back in. And it looks so

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.280
 funny. You should look it up. There's all these people around with rafts and then bobbing under

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.600
 the water. Just these two vast elephants who look so stupidly out of place in the middle of the ocean.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.760
 They look really kind, they're really struggling aren't they? And the first one anyway, the 2017

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.360
 one, the elephants really, really struggling to swim. And National Geographic emailed the co-founder

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.360
 of Elephant Voices, which I think is a charity called Joyce Pool. They emailed her and asked her

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.520
 about elephant swimming. And she said she wasn't surprised that the elephant was swimming out

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.800
 there because she said elephants are considered the best swimmers of any land mammal, perhaps

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.920
 excluding trained human swimmers. And then they showed her the video of this elephant really,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.720
 really struggling to swim. And she said, maybe the elephant was tired.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:27.600
 It's 16 kilometers out. If you've swum 16 kilometers, pal, you'd be tired, wouldn't you?

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.480
 I certainly would. There was the theory at one point that the Loch Ness Monster was a swimming

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.520
 elephant, wasn't there? Was there? Yeah, because there was a story that there was a circus in town

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.360
 and they thought let's bring the elephant out for a swim. And the very famous photo that was seen,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.600
 I think it was the famous photo, the surgeon's photo it's called, the thought is that that's

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.000
 the trunk just coming up through the water, getting breath as it's going along.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.880
 It's not like humps going up to the trunk in the Loch Ness Monster.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.800
 Yeah, so I think they think that that's the head coming out from the back.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.920
 Maybe it was giving the circus' camel a piggyback in the water.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.280
 Yeah, and then the snake was at the back.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.080
 I guess it's not the stupidest theory ever, given that it only requires us to believe in

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.320
 the existence of a badly managed circus, rather than the existence of a dinosaur in a lake.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.360
 Well, it's not a badly managed circus, taking your elephant out for a swim.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.360
 I think if they've left the elephant in there and it's being photographed by the public,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.240
 that's what I thought you were saying. No, I'm not saying that there's an

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.880
 abandoned elephant swimming Loch Ness. That's what you're saying.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.880
 If you're saying the Loch Ness Monster is an elephant, then that's...

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.520
 No, I'm saying the photo. There was a thought that the photo was an elephant.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.160
 Yeah, okay. But if they put it in, then they took it out.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.920
 I see what you're saying. I thought you meant like Andy,

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.880
 there's been this elephant living under water in Loch Ness for hundreds of years,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.720
 which is almost more ridiculous than the Loch Ness Monster.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.920
 If you look at that photo, actually, if you look at the surgeon's photo,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.640
 you can just see in the corner of the shot a clown getting out of a little car.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.760
 And you can just see that it actually looks like water,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.840
 but it's actually confetti that he's swimming through.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.040
 And the clown's got giant shoes and has been mistaken for Bigfoot, actually, so...

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.640
 Well, we've moved down to the realm of facts, haven't we?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.200
 Do you want a real fact about elephants? I've got one.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:24.960
 Okay, well, I'm going to put it in James's special Donald Lee Johnson tongs for quoting without

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.320
 saying this is definitely true. I think it's an amazing theory that the theory is

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.200
 that Cornwall's first road network ever was created by elephants.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.880
 It's one of my favorite facts. I can't believe we've never mentioned it before.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.920
 Uh-huh, uh-huh, go on.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.960
 This is according to researchers at the University of North Cornwall.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.080
 Who should know, frankly?

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.480
 Can I quickly debunk their theory before it's even sort of found?

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.160
 No, no, no, no. Anna, I would like to get my thing up in the air before you take a pop at it,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.040
 if that's all right. Up to 115,000 years ago, Cornwall had elephants.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.240
 Okay, that was a bit warmer. It had them, all right.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.840
 There's a fossil record and all of that stuff.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.840
 Sorry, just a check. So we're going to listen to this knowing it's wrong.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.160
 We're just going to sit here and listen to this.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.440
 We're not because I know it's right.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:13.760
 Okay.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.880
 And Anna may know something different, but let me tell you what I know.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.680
 Right, so you know how Ice Age is kind of retreat in advance as the millennia go by.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.640
 So the most recent glacial maximum covered most of the UK, but it didn't cover Cornwall, right?

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.520
 It didn't get that far south.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.720
 That's definitely true.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.040
 So most of the elephant tracks across the UK will have been covered by ice sheets and erased,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.640
 but the ones in Cornwall were not.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:40.560
 And what the theory is by these researchers is that herds of migrating woolly mammoths and

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.960
 elephants who came to the UK, they came to England basically on their summer holidays

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.680
 when it was a bit warmer up there to eat, those tracks that they had, their roots,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:56.160
 which were used by them and by hunters, kind of map onto the road network in Cornwall today.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.560
 Ironically, it's the smaller roads that they created and not the trunk roads,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.080
 which were created in modern times for modern needs.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.280
 But the smaller road network in Cornwall is created by elephants.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.520
 Right, there, I've said my bit.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.560
 Now, please, Anna, get out of here.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.680
 Just going to say it doesn't make any sense because the roads in Cornwall are so sodding narrow

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.760
 that two elephants could never pass each other on.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.680
 Actually, in the Ice Age, these elephants, they got stuck behind tractors so often

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.160
 that they ended up trampling loads of extra roads.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.640
 When I was looking into elephants moving logs around everywhere,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.480
 I discovered that they actually moved trees and pooed them out eventually.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.880
 So, you know, they create trees.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.360
 They're not smuggling trees in the rain, so it's not a, it's, I'm getting-

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.760
 It's a big session on the toilet, isn't it, an oak.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.600
 What I mean to say is-

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.600
 As a mugger, you'd pay more, wouldn't you, for trees that hadn't been through the elephantanus.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.920
 So, what I mean to say is, there's the African savanna elephant, and what it does is,

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.240
 it basically, through eating, it transports seeds further than probably any other animal

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.560
 around, and this is including a lot of birds.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.960
 It's, it can go as far as 65 kilometers in delivering seeds, and that's because

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.280
 its intestines are so long for the seeds and the food to get through

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.160
 that it takes something like 33 hours, I believe, for it.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.400
 Before it, they actually start defecating the seeds that they might have swallowed,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.280
 and the last one will come out 96 hours after they've first swallowed a seed.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.560
 And so, they've been spreading plants and trees all over, you know, different parts,

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.040
 at greater distances than, as I say, a lot of birds in the area,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.960
 and certainly any other land mammal.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.480
 I wonder if they know they're doing it.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.040
 Like, they pick up a seed and eat it, and then they sprint for 96 hours straight.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.600
 Some kind of conservation project.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.760
 Exactly, just open a banana in that area.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.480
 They come running.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.840
 Yeah.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.640
 It's clever.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.280
 Did we, you know, we talked a while ago about sort of elephant trunk uses.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.680
 Oh yeah.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.960
 And there, there was a bit which sort of came after that,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.520
 which, because we'd already recorded the podcast, it didn't go in,

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.600
 but it was, and I found this website, which had all the uses of an elephant's trunk,

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.360
 and like, as observed by scientists.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.000
 Okay.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.840
 And one of the, there are about 200, you know, there are so many different

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.400
 things, and they all, they've all got a different name by the scientists.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.680
 So I don't think we mentioned this.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.000
 One of them is mating pandemonium is the one way they use their trunk.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.520
 One of them is dust with semen.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.640
 Okay.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.800
 So let's go back to the first one.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.160
 Mating pandemonium.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.560
 No pandas involved, I assume.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.760
 I hope not.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.120
 I'm lucky for them.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.840
 What does it mean?

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.800
 What, what is it?

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.640
 Must be just like, you, I mean, how do you make mating chaotic introduce your trunk?

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.960
 I can see how that would cause pandemonium.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.160
 What, trunk up the bum?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.480
 No, it can't, that's not what it can mean, is it?

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.280
 I know.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.080
 Do you?

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.040
 Sounds like pandemonium to me.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.160
 Dan, do you want to have a guess?

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:06.640
 Oh, um, do they, oh, do they, do they form a heart, um, like you would with your hands?

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.920
 You know, it's just to let people know that some sex going on over here.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.080
 What a tame definition of, of pandemonium.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.480
 Romantic, frankly.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.280
 I think on kids, um, like maybe like, um, could it be like loads of males

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.520
 attacking each other to attract a female, maybe?

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.360
 Like a big fight.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.480
 It's much less fun, actually.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.560
 It's, um, it's a mated, when a female has had sex, her relatives and companions join her

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.640
 and they have a party, basically.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.080
 So they, they shout and they rumble and they, they trumpet.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.520
 Like a baby shower.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.920
 It's like a baby shower, except it's a sort of post shag.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.120
 Right.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.640
 So I'm just quoting from the website here.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.000
 Females may turn towards the male, reaching their trunks to touch his penis

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.800
 or his semen on the ground or to touch one another

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.760
 and then turn rapidly outward in a kind of pirouette.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.200
 It's a bonding ceremony after, after one of your female friends has had sex.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.040
 Why don't we do that as humans?

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.640
 I think that is a ceremony that should translate across species.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.320
 Every time someone loses their virginity.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.720
 Andy, you could have yours quite soon.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:10.160
 If the semen's on the ground, we could all pirouette away from you.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:20.960
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.920
 My fact is that there is a French parliamentary manoeuvre

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.560
 which involves MPs hiding behind a curtain

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.120
 and then bursting out to vote at the last minute.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.480
 Why, why?

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.320
 It's really fun.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.480
 It's, it's not used often.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.720
 It's, it's not a weekly feature of the nationalism.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.880
 Well, you couldn't because then people would just check for feet sticking out.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.040
 How often people forget, eventually people forget.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.400
 Well, I found a reference to it being done in 2014

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.080
 and I don't know if it's been done since then.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.160
 So this was a fact that a writer for the New Yorker called Lauren Collins

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.240
 put it on Twitter and she reads a lot of French websites as well as English ones

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.640
 and the National Assembly is their parliament basically

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.880
 and it's got these enormous red curtains.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.280
 And if you think as the opposition that you're close to defeating the government,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.280
 sometimes you can try the coup de riteau which is the curtain blow

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.600
 and you hide your MPs behind a curtain.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.880
 You hold the vote that, you know, the government gets all its votes in

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.240
 and then they burst out from behind the curtain and vote against the government

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.600
 and the idea is that they defeat them.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.400
 It's a way of lulling the government into thinking

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.560
 that your side doesn't have the votes.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.320
 Doesn't the government, does the government ever say?

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.080
 It's so weird there are only six of us in here

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.480
 because I swear I saw about a dozen other people come in.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.720
 Well, the one main time when it happened in like living memory

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.400
 was with Sarkozy, wasn't it?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.080
 He was, he had some kind of internet bill that he wanted to get through.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.680
 It was like just trying to, you know, ban people from the internet

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.520
 if they copied too many things or whatever.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.280
 And everyone was so certain it was going to get through

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.840
 that hardly any of his party turned up.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.680
 And so that's how the other, the opposition managed to do something.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.200
 The final result was 21 to 15 in the vote.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.960
 And if you think about how many hundreds of MPs there are in the

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:12.480
 National Assembly, it's like they literally didn't think that it was a problem at all.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.440
 And then suddenly behind the curtain there were 21 people.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.480
 When they were behind those curtains, you could have said to your mates behind it,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.760
 we're all getting Sarkozy behind here, aren't we?

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.800
 That's great.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.920
 And it would have made sense.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.560
 Yes.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.160
 No, but then everyone laughing so loud that your amazing joke

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.200
 would have given the game away.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.920
 I was just reading some random stuff about French politics

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.600
 and mostly I just really enjoy it when they conform to stereotypes.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:46.000
 So I enjoy that Felix Foray, who was president of France at the end of the 19th century,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.040
 died just while having sex with a 30-year-old mistress, obviously.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.400
 That puts a real doubter on the party that you're having afterwards, doesn't it?

00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:03.120
 The dusting with Siemens is going to be a pretty somber affair this afternoon.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.440
 From dust to dust, from Siemens to Siemens.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.800
 He died doing what he loved.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.800
 I think everyone could always say that.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.640
 Just one or two more things on French parliamentary shenanigans.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.200
 One thing caught my eye and it's just incidents that happen outside the French parliament.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.720
 In 2013, there was a group who launched a protest

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.760
 by releasing a flash mob of chickens outside the French parliament.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.520
 They had 450 chickens in the back of their van.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.440
 They were a slightly regressive group, I'd say.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.280
 They were protesting against gay marriage.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.000
 And so they bundled 450 chickens into a van.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.480
 Their plan was to release them all outside the French parliament.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.760
 As part of an incredibly weak pun, Anna, you would have loved it.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.720
 Basically, they wrote "Ne plume pas les familles" or "Don't pluck families",

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.240
 which also means don't rip people off with family taxes.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.160
 So it's a very convoluted trap shot.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.200
 I mean, the French for chicken is a cock.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.480
 Yeah, you're right.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.040
 You're absolutely right.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.720
 It feels like they missed a trick or two there.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.200
 I don't know.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.880
 Huge open goal missed.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.440
 Yeah.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.600
 And surely a headline must have read at some point.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.920
 450 chickens, that is enough.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.920
 Brilliant.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.440
 Just to give a little coda.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.240
 Only about 40 of them got out of the van, the chickens,

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.720
 before the police noticed while all of these chickens out here

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.600
 had started chasing them.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.760
 So then they closed the van and bundled off.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.160
 Very sadly, two of the chickens were then killed crossing the road.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:26.320
 But presumably they were the homophobic chickens who got out to protest.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.240
 So not too big a loss.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:36.000
 Can I tell you about a very exciting article page on Wikipedia that I read recently?

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.360
 So just take us into the world of curtains for a second.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.480
 Curtain rings really, really brought the thunder I thought when I was reading it.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.240
 So there's a very interesting fact, which is that Lewis and Clark,

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.840
 when they went out on their expeditions,

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.720
 they brought a lot of curtain rings with them as presents.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.600
 Lewis and Clark, were they traveling across America?

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.040
 The North American interior.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.080
 Yeah, they were.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.080
 I suppose they were interior guys.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.640
 That's the curtain rings.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.680
 So if they'd been exploring the exterior,

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.120
 they would have taken the patio furniture with them and the fire pit.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.840
 So there's that little fact there.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.560
 And then there's this little paragraph of other uses and it says...

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.920
 Should we just quickly say, because I think they will have carried them

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.680
 like to trade, right?

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.800
 Yes, sorry.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.760
 Yeah, they were to trade and they were gifts as well.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.960
 They were really popular, new innovations back then.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.400
 They didn't have incredibly elaborate tents there every night with 400 pairs of curtains.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.120
 But what, they're just a good thing to trade.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.320
 I mean, if you're taking them to people who by and large don't have curtains.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.760
 They use them as rings and earrings apparently,

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.120
 which seems odd as they were specifically meant to be large enough to go around a human finger,

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.320
 which I mean, all curtain rings.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.600
 Yeah, so that's the thing.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.160
 It says in this article, other uses, for example,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.080
 they may be used as a wedding ring in a marriage ceremony.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.400
 So that's one use that they could have.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.520
 What do you mean one?

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.840
 What kind of sausage finger people are getting married?

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.400
 That you could use a curtain ring as a wedding ring.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.840
 It's what this Wikipedia page says, but then the next thing it says is,

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.040
 or it can be used as a ligature to prevent nocturnal urethes.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.400
 So bedwetting, right?

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.440
 And I thought, okay, this suddenly sounds like someone's just taking the piss here.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.240
 They're just, someone's hacked this Wikipedia page.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.080
 I clicked on the link and it took me to a book that's written by a guy called Robert Liston,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.840
 who was a big surgeon.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.920
 And yeah, okay.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.960
 So check this out.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.600
 This is the extract from the book about using it as a ligature.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.160
 "AR, when eight years old, passed a brass curtain ring over his penis

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.280
 to prevent incontinence of urine during the night,

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.480
 and thereby escaping chastisement to which he had been frequently subjected.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.440
 Great swelling soon took place round the ring,

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.320
 and he was unable to remove the jugum.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.800
 He experienced much pain and difficulty in..."

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.240
 Sorry, can we go back to that word you casually used there?

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.120
 Is it not jugum?

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.040
 I've just not heard that word.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.600
 No, I've actually not heard that word either.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.080
 Oh, okay.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:10.800
 How do you spell it?

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.440
 How do you spell it?

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.560
 J-U-G-U-M.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.760
 Wait, Dan, when you say is it not, what do you think it is?

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.160
 Well, I assume it's an old word for a curtain ring.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.240
 It's sort of another word for it.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.040
 Imagine if the word odd word all one day was jugum.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.320
 The internet would go fucking apeshit.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.320
 It's a very rare word, damn jugum.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.240
 You can't not acknowledge you just casually dropped the word jugum into a sentence.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.160
 It's say he's put something on his penis,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.000
 and then this is the same thing he can't take off.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.880
 It's obviously just another slang word for the item.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.480
 It's irrelevant to the story.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.880
 So, he experienced much pain and difficulty in voiding his urine.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.480
 The ring gradually ulcerated.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:56.160
 The ring appeared to sink into the substance of the penis, and the swelling subsided.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:56.960
 Oh.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.360
 Yes, except that this guy kept it on there.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.400
 It says that he then, after a while, became the father of a fine family.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.240
 So, he was eight years old when he put this on.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.640
 When between 50 and 60 years of age, he applied to me,

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.880
 and then this doctor, Liston, then has to remove this curtain ring

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.000
 that's been around this man's penis since the age of eight,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.440
 which has fused into the shaft of his penis.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.920
 So, you're saying it sort of migrated into his penis.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.480
 Exactly.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.240
 It kind of, it just--

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.040
 Through the skin.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:31.920
 It got, exactly.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.880
 It migrated through the skin, and it became infused.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.160
 He had a curtain ring.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.520
 His penis was the rod to this curtain ring.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:39.920
 Yeah, no, no, no.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.200
 He had kids, he had everything.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.720
 He never thought to take it off.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.240
 If it's fused into your penis, I would just live with it.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.040
 Well, that's what he did.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.720
 Can I just say, we're filming this on Zoom today.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.480
 We don't usually at the moment.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.160
 And Dan is in a bedroom.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.560
 Can anyone else not turn their eyes off the curtain

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.080
 that's behind his left shoulder?

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.080
 Actually, you're right.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.880
 Is one of the curtains at the end, it's sort of hanging off a bit.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.720
 Like there's a ring missing.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.200
 What's up?

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:07.520
 Yeah.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.520
 And I thought Dan was getting slowly more and more purple

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.480
 as this went on.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:18.480
 Just because you said it, I had to know.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.040
 A jugum is not an old word for a curtain ring.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.680
 A jugum is specifically a forceps for compressing the penis

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.720
 in olden days using an anti masturbatory device, apparently.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.320
 Apparently you needed a word that specific.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.440
 Okay, so great swelling took place around the ring

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.080
 and he was unable to remove the--

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.000
 It seems like they're using it metaphorically

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.480
 because that's how he was using it, right?

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.240
 He was almost using it like one of these medical things.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.960
 His penis worked again.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.160
 Like it worked normally again.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.400
 He was like, "Wow, my penis is flowing nicely.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.920
 This is in his 60s."

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.920
 Yeah, but he always got an erection whenever he heard a curtain

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.200
 being moved, which is very embarrassing.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:03.360
 Can I tell you an anecdote about politics?

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.440
 Which is not French, but I kind of like it.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.080
 It's about a vote, so it is kind of related.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.800
 So this is in 1872 and there was a vote

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.320
 against the New Zealand government.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.280
 And it looked like it was going to come down to one vote.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.960
 So this is like, what do you call that,

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.680
 when it's like in confidence of the government?

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.160
 So if they lose this, the government could fall.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.160
 And it was going to come down to one vote.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.880
 And one of the governing party called Edward Wakefield

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.280
 was a massive drunk, okay?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.760
 So his colleagues locked him in a room

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.320
 and they took all of his alcohol away from him

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.000
 and they kept him in this room and they said,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.440
 "Right, we're going to leave you there.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.960
 We're going to keep you sober.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.440
 And then as soon as the vote starts, we'll let you out

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.840
 and you can vote and then you can do whatever you want."

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.560
 Okay?

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.280
 So they put Edward Wakefield in this room

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.280
 and the opposition learned about it

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.240
 and so they lowered a bottle of whiskey down the chimney

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.960
 of the room that he was in.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.480
 He drank the whiskey and he was unable to vote

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.160
 and the government of New Zealand fell.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.760
 Oh, wow.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.360
 Jesus, amazing.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:03.920
 Brilliant.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.880
 That's incredible.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.600
 Wow.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.960
 You really do have a problem then.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.280
 I think the next trip when you let out of that room

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.480
 is a trip to the AA.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.400
 He must have thought it was Christmas, right?

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.240
 When the bottle of whiskey comes down.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.040
 Santa's changed, hasn't he?

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:17.360
 Yeah.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.280
 Can't be asked to come down the chimney himself anymore.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.160
 Oh, that's great.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.000
 Well, do you want to, look,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.840
 do you just want to impress your curtain-loving friends?

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.120
 Always.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.440
 Yes, please.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.000
 Yes, you do.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.480
 Do you know what you call a curtain's helmet?

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.720
 I didn't even know a curtain had a helmet, Anna, embarrassing me.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.320
 Well, when I say helmet, what I mean is,

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.640
 you know, on quite old-fashioned curtains

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.240
 or on eight curtains, you get like a fabric

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.920
 or sometimes a wooden border at the top.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.560
 Or a skirt, like a top skirt for the curtains.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.160
 Like a hem, kind of thing.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.720
 Yeah, but an upper and sort of a high hem.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.080
 I'd call it a skirtan if we were starting

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.280
 from scratch with the language.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.040
 That's actually better, and that wouldn't have forced me

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.480
 into saying, do you know what you call a curtain's helmet

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:04.880
 when it's clear?

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.960
 Not a helmet, but it is called a pelmet.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.560
 Pelmet, okay, yeah.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.200
 It's called a pelmet.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:11.760
 Oh, well, that's quite good,

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.080
 because isn't a pelmet slang for an extremely short skirt,

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.920
 like a racially short skirt as a pelmet?

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:16.960
 Is it?

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.400
 Is it?

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.120
 It might be.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.280
 If a curtain was analogous to a pair of legs,

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.960
 that little bit at the top would be a pelmet, wouldn't it?

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.880
 Dude, I did not know that,

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.800
 but that feels like one must be named after the other.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.480
 It is like a pelmet, yeah.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.200
 Do you know what kind of pelmet, though, a lambrokin is?

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.560
 No, I don't. A lambrokin, no.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.080
 Or a lambroquin is a pelmet with such deep sides

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.440
 they extend to the floor.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.280
 Just if you're ever at anyone's house, you can say,

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.600
 "I love your lambroquins."

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.680
 I think you're more likely to say,

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.920
 "Have you considered having some lambroquins here?"

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.640
 Because they're not likely to have them themselves.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.800
 Pelmet, which goes all the way to the floor?

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.480
 On the sides of the curtain.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.600
 Yeah, yeah, not all the way down,

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.480
 because that would be a blinding.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.200
 That's a curtain.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.960
 Wow.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.000
 Is it to conceal?

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.520
 It's like a square curtain,

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.880
 so it would come out on the sides,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.720
 and then it would be kind of flat in the front,

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.160
 and you'd have your pelmet at the top,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.080
 but then on the sides, it would come all the way down.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.200
 I see, so you're framing.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.000
 And yes, it is.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.200
 That's quite nice. I might get that.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.120
 It is, in answer to your assumption, Andy,

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.440
 it is to conceal the embarrassing bits,

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.840
 like the curtain rings and the pole.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.000
 Well, now we know they are functionally cock rings.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 I think it's probably quite a good idea to hide them.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:32.800
 Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.160
 and that is my fact.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.320
 My fact this week is that one of the biggest

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.840
 theme parks in China

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.560
 has a ride that puts visitors in a coffin,

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.800
 rolls them into a chamber,

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.040
 and then simulates their cremation.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.040
 This is the Sad Mahi game.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.640
 It's the experience of death.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.120
 The cremator goes by many, many names.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.280
 It is a very bizarre 4D virtual experience

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.960
 that supposedly, according to reports from 2014,

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.800
 costs roughly 26 pounds.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.480
 And the idea is that you go into a morgue,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.160
 you get into a coffin,

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.560
 and they push you through on a conveyor belt

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.560
 all the way to the crematorium,

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.280
 where then you are burnt to a cinder,

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.000
 at least that's the sensation that you're going to get.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.120
 Lots of hot air, lots of weird lights,

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.640
 and it just prepares you for your inevitable death

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.720
 is the idea.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.760
 I mean, first of all, it's not the sensation.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.720
 I think they claim it.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.120
 It's not the sensation of being burnt to a cinder is it?

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.360
 Because that would be a much less pleasant ride.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.760
 It's a sensation of being a bit worn with some weird lights.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.720
 Well, there are two.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.400
 The two people who came up with the idea

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.760
 who are Huangei Wipeng and Dingrui.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.360
 They're two people from Shanghai.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.720
 When Huangei went into it,

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.560
 he said, "I couldn't breathe,

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.240
 and I thought my life was over."

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.920
 That was the first time he ever tried it.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.080
 So to him, he thought he was dying, get it?

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:56.560
 Yeah.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.320
 Although, but that was when he...

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.480
 So they, I think to prepare for making this,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.480
 they asked to be sent through a crematorium, right?

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.400
 And they asked the controller of the crematorium

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.480
 to let them experience cremation

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.320
 with the crucial difference

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.400
 that he turned off the furnace.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.080
 It does say it heats you up to about 40 degrees Celsius,

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.080
 not Fahrenheit, which is, that's warm.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.880
 That is very warm.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.640
 I would feel pretty uncomfortable at that.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.360
 Yeah.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.080
 I think it depends on also, you know, if you're claustrophobic,

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.480
 if you, you know, so many senses are going to come into play.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.000
 But they do say it's an authentic experience of burning.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.960
 And I think that sounds quite fun.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.360
 So the idea is it's not a ride like,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.120
 let's say, the big one or oblivion or something like that.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.280
 It's basically like an escape room.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.640
 And there's a load of challenges.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.440
 And let's say there's us four are doing all the challenges.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.160
 After each one, whoever does the challenge worst

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.480
 will, in inverted commas, die.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.120
 And then when you die, you get put into the coffin

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.000
 and they do this kind of cremation thing.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.600
 And then there's three people left.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.760
 And then whoever comes last out of those three people

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.680
 then does the cremation.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.520
 So you're each kind of challenge.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.040
 You're trying not to die.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.800
 And the worst person does die.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.720
 And then in the end, the last person,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.800
 they actually make them die anyway

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.240
 because all people die in the end.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:10.960
 That's the idea.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.240
 So everyone gets to do the little ride at the end.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.520
 But yeah, it's like challenges that you have to do to get to it.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.080
 I would love, by the way, if anyone's listening to this,

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.680
 who's been to the cremator,

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.640
 to please let us know what it was actually like.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.560
 Because I can't find anyone really who's properly done it.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.320
 Like I went on TripAdvisor

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.040
 and it says that this is part of the windows of the world

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.720
 amusement park in Shenzhen.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.640
 So this is a pretty amazing place.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.640
 Where they've replicated some of the biggest landmarks in the world.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.080
 Some to sort of quite a nice big scale.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.440
 Like the Eiffel Tower is the third of the size of the Eiffel Tower.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.680
 They've got a life-size Mount Rushmore.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.400
 They've got, you know,

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.000
 you can do anything that's a sort of landmark around the world.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.360
 They most likely have it.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.560
 And then supposedly they have this random cremator game

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.440
 that you can play.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.480
 No one on TripAdvisor has mentioned it.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.240
 I can't see anyone who's been to it.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.200
 So I would love to know.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.280
 Do you think, is it possible that they keep

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.720
 forgetting to turn off the furnace?

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:18.240
 Thank God they don't survive to leave the one-star review.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.320
 It's funny because I'm not really worried

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.080
 about the being cremated a bit.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.760
 Because I don't expect to be.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.240
 If I am conscious for that,

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.240
 something's gone so badly wrong

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.440
 that even the brief preparation I've done at this escape room,

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.360
 I think is not going to be enough good

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.000
 to see me through it with a calm mood.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.800
 That's a tricky one.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.920
 Yeah.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.120
 Do you guys have anything on cremation?

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.080
 I can just say a little bit more on this particular thing.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:44.720
 Yeah, let's do it.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.120
 Yeah, sorry.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:45.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.480
 So this ride escape room thing,

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.960
 it comes from something called the Coffin Academy,

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.640
 which began in South Korea.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.880
 And this was a...

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.560
 The idea was that it's trying to prepare people for death.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.240
 And if you prepare for death,

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.760
 then it makes you able to live your life more freely

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.360
 because you're not worried about something

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.480
 that might happen.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.040
 And it was founded by a guy called Jung Joon.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.920
 And Samsung in South Korea,

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.480
 they required 900 of their employees

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.640
 to go to some of these sessions

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.760
 so that they could learn about what might happen when you die.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.160
 And you write your own epitaph,

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.800
 you compose last letters to your loved ones,

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.520
 and you're placed in a coffin for 10 minutes at the end.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.680
 And that's supposed to be like this memento mori

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.920
 of reminding you to live your life

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.120
 because one day you might die.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.040
 That's really good.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.880
 I hope they don't post the letters

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.680
 because that's a distressing experience for their families

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.400
 if they accidentally mix up in the post-dream.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.120
 Yeah.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.320
 It does work though.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.320
 Thinking incessantly about death

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.480
 is actually good for you, apparently.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.360
 And I think it was about South Korea's

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.880
 soaring suicide rate, wasn't it?

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.840
 They wanted to combat

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.720
 because it's the highest suicide rate in the world, I think.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.560
 But there have been studies that show,

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.440
 if you think about dying for five minutes a day,

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.720
 apparently five to 10 minutes a day,

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.720
 you will be happier.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.720
 And they did a study where they got people to write emails

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.920
 or respond to emails about dying and death every day

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.280
 for about 10 minutes.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.160
 And they found that the people who had done that,

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.600
 they had increased positive mood, better self-esteem,

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.440
 increased intrinsic motivation, whatever that means.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.120
 I suppose they felt like they had a reason to live.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.440
 And so it does work.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.680
 And you can get apps as an app called We Croak

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.520
 that my husband has, which is very annoying

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.120
 because it reminds you five times a day

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.320
 that you're going to die.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.680
 What? Hang on, what?

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.520
 Yeah. And it says, and it's quite annoying

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.720
 because he rarely uses his phone.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.800
 So it's always the latest message that came up

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.080
 because it comes up five times a day.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.240
 So whenever I'm walking past it and I move the phone,

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.880
 all I see is the phrase, "Don't forget you're going to die."

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.480
 Why does he have this?

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.960
 Because of this psychological thing we were just talking about?

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.280
 Is this actually, does your husband naturally have this?

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.680
 Or do you text him this five times a day just?

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.040
 I've been leaving constant threats.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.080
 But yeah, planning your own death, people do.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.680
 People plan their own funerals.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.200
 It's becoming more and more popular

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.080
 and actually attend their own funerals now,

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.000
 which is another way of reminding yourself

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.440
 you're going to die quite on the nose.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.880
 But this is a tradition that started in Japan, apparently,

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.400
 in the 1990s.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.360
 And they're called pre-funerals, or saizenso in Japan.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.160
 And I think they started out in response to,

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.760
 like, funerals are being really commercialized

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.440
 and people are being ripped off for these

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.320
 just off the conveyor belt out of the catalogue funerals.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.400
 And they thought, "Look, we want some more personalized funerals

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.320
 and I don't want to fork out so much cash.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.680
 I don't want my poor family to be

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.600
 forking out so much cash after I die."

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.600
 And so pre-funerals have become a thing.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.360
 And it's when people plan and then attend their own funeral,

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.360
 say a few words, say goodbye.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.560
 It's usually older people.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.320
 It's quite rare that you get like an 18-year-old

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.960
 having a pre-funeral.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.880
 And then that's nice.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.080
 Saves your family having to do it.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.360
 And I guess you get to go to your own party

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.560
 at the end of the day.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.360
 That is cool.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:03.840
 Yeah.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.680
 To people, I guess people must know

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.120
 that they're attending your pre-funeral

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.320
 instead of your funeral.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.600
 Yeah, I don't think you do the surprise.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.240
 Surprise!

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.840
 Provide the curtain.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:16.800
 Well, that'd be great use of your escape room coffin.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.480
 You'd finally get to use it

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.200
 instead of it just being a thing for post-death.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.080
 Good point.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.520
 I do think it's a good idea.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.240
 But, and I think it's a good idea from your perspective

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.320
 as the person who's having the pre-funeral,

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.240
 if you want to do all the mindfulness

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.760
 and remind yourself of your potential

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.520
 and experience life properly.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.800
 But I don't think it's a good experience

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.600
 for people who want to know

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.880
 what other people would say about them.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.360
 No.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.760
 Because everyone knows that you're not really,

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.040
 you're in the front row, you're sitting there.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.640
 So they'll say nice things.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.680
 But you'll think...

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.360
 Yeah, but in fairness, Andy,

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.520
 no people don't go to funerals in general

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.280
 and say, "Oh, he was a complete idiot."

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.280
 Thank God I can let loose now that he's not

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.640
 quite this evil.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.480
 If he was here, I wouldn't say this.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.680
 But what an asshole.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:03.280
 It's probably pretty similar before and after,

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.440
 and they're both lies, I think, is what we're saying.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.280
 I've definitely read, and this...

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.320
 I might have said this before.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.960
 I've definitely read a funeral director say

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.080
 that it's really common when bodies are cremated

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.400
 that you end up with metal implements

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.560
 that have been left in their body during surgery.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.400
 And I've always been so skeptical

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.160
 about the fact that surgeons are so careless.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.040
 They're just dropping things

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.400
 on our bodies left, right, and centre.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.320
 But apparently, that's quite a thing.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.800
 You pop in, you get a scalpel and a knife pair of scissors.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.760
 Really?

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.520
 Gossipiboma, it's called, isn't it?

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.640
 Supposedly.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.360
 A what?

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.040
 It's called gossipiboma.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:37.360
 The...

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:37.840
 Sorry?

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.960
 If someone leaves stuff in your body during surgery,

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.960
 that's the technical word for it.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.880
 And it comes from gossipimus,

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.760
 which means cloth or something.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.160
 Okay.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.840
 Which word do you think is rarer?

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.760
 Gossipiboma or jugum?

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.640
 I'd never heard of jugum before today.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.280
 I must admit.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.320
 I think you might be right.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.640
 You know when you're being cremated?

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.120
 Yeah.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.160
 And you go through the curtains?

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:04.400
 Yeah.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.840
 There's a lot of French politicians.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.320
 Nightmare.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.960
 What's the next thing that happens?

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.360
 Fire.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.400
 Right.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:12.880
 Well, I didn't...

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.680
 Not necessarily.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.880
 Yeah, I didn't think there was fire.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.080
 I thought it was deep heat.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:16.800
 Not deep heat.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.360
 No, that's fine.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.240
 They love you with that thumb.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.200
 Yeah, it's just a little bomb.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.360
 There's just a muscular masseur

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.640
 on the other side of the curtain view.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.240
 I told you it was just a sprain.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.760
 I don't know what it fusses about.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.680
 What are you all about?

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.560
 Deep heat.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.080
 What, Dan, what is...

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.000
 I thought it was an intensive heat,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.680
 which instead of a physical fire...

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:41.040
 It turns out that you don't automatically

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.400
 immediately go into the furnace.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.840
 Just to be clear, it is not deep heat,

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.040
 whatever Dan means.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:47.760
 It's flame.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.560
 Oh, it is flame.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.280
 Gas, power flame.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:49.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.720
 But legally, they have 72 hours

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.560
 before they have to cremate you.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.600
 What does that mean?

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.520
 So do they do fun stuff with your body

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.320
 in that three days?

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.360
 No, they're not allowed to interfere.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.440
 But they aim to do it on the same day,

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.440
 but sometimes it's busy

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.520
 and they don't get around to cremating you.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.320
 I suppose they might want to do a few people at once.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.640
 I don't think they're allowed to.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.280
 No, you're not.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:13.760
 I don't think...

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.240
 Well, I think because they're getting your remains

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.280
 for your family.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.760
 I didn't mean just put everyone in the same box,

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.720
 but I thought maybe just not turn the fire on

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.600
 and then turn it off again,

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.560
 and then turn it on, then turn it off again.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:26.880
 Maybe.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.720
 It's incredibly energy intensive.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.320
 I mean, it uses so much energy.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.600
 And in fact, there's a...

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.720
 You guys have heard of Redditch?

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.920
 The town.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.240
 The place.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.360
 Yeah, the town.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.000
 It's the Birmingham.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.120
 Yeah, relatively large cultivation.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.800
 Yeah, well, there's a swimming pool in Redditch

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.320
 which is heated by the local crematorium's spare heat.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.120
 I love that.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.280
 They voted for it in 2013.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.880
 And the council voted for it.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.720
 They won an award for it from some green group.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.240
 There were lots of protests at the time.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:56.640
 Oh, really?

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.880
 And ironically, whenever I use deep heat,

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.200
 because I've seemed to be allergic to capsaicin,

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.160
 I get a Redditch.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:08.720
 That proves something, doesn't it?

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.160
 It's hard to tell what.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.800
 It shows that the whole universe is connected in some way.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.480
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.240
 and that is James.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:29.120
 Okay, my fact this week is that the actor, Peter O'Toole,

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.400
 once smuggled a pair of earrings out of grease

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.480
 by hiding them in his foreskin.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:40.160
 And I must say, I came up with this fact

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.640
 before we talked about all the, you know,

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.960
 curtain rings and penises and stuff.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.880
 That's just a coincidence that those two things

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.400
 came up in the same show.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:48.640
 Yeah.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.280
 I completely forgot that I had that fact

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.360
 in relation to this fact.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.560
 What an extraordinary thing,

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.880
 an outer and inner ring in one show.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.280
 What an object to smuggle under your foreskin?

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.320
 A pair of earrings.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.760
 Traditionally, quite sharp.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.080
 Well, unless they were they clip on?

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.680
 I think that would actually be more painful.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.160
 I think not.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.840
 I think because these were ancient,

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.840
 so I think before the invention of clip on,

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.520
 not that I know when clip on's were invented,

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.760
 but I assume they're more modern.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.400
 The Etruscans didn't have clip on their rings.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.400
 We'd have to rethink a lot of our assumptions.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.280
 Seems unlikely.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.800
 So we are currently just coming to the end

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.320
 of the T series of QI,

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.720
 and we're doing a section on tools.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.240
 And I thought when I was looking at the scripts,

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.360
 I would flesh one of them out

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.120
 with an anecdote about Peter O'Toole.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.760
 So I thought if I'd find any anecdotes about him.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.640
 And I found this one in the telegraph,

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.640
 and then it was also in a biography of him

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.800
 by Nicholas Wapshot.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.760
 And he said that while Peter O'Toole

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.400
 was filming Lawrence of Arabia,

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.920
 he developed a love of exotic antiquities.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.080
 And so knowing that he wasn't allowed

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.480
 to take these things out of Greece legally,

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.720
 he thought, "Where can I hide them?"

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.960
 And no one would think of looking.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.120
 And he said, "Nicholas Wapshot says

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.560
 it was an act of daring

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.200
 which caused him pain for weeks afterwards."

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.000
 Wow.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.600
 Okay, so this wasn't a classic.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.840
 This wasn't like how we got the Elgin marbles here.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.080
 This is a very unique smuggling use.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:18.880
 They were actually-

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.240
 That's a big brag, isn't it?

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.200
 If you say, "Oh, I smuggled the Elgin marbles out of mine."

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.920
 They were smuggled in an elephant's foreskin

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.560
 all the way through the roads of Cornwall.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.560
 Do we know if he weaved them through

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.400
 or just tucked them under?

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.560
 I don't know for certain,

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.720
 but it can only be tucked under.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.600
 It could be tucked under.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.480
 He didn't pierce his voice.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.360
 How do we weave them through?

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.960
 No, if he pierced his voice.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.840
 You would not do that.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.760
 The only other way I can think of doing it

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.480
 is you kind of sellotape them to your penis

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.720
 and wait for the foreskin to grow over them

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.920
 over many, many years.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.880
 That's the only other positive.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.840
 Come on, game with those.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.120
 Well, he was out there filming it for two years.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.400
 Maybe the filming only took a month,

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.680
 but he had to wait the remaining year and three quarters

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.560
 for the skin to grow.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.520
 There is scant more information about this

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.400
 that I managed to find.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.280
 I don't know if you guys did,

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.800
 but it's just an anecdote in his anecdote filled life.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.640
 Yes, I do.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.160
 Actually, I do have a related anecdote

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.600
 just before we get into Petro Tool.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.960
 I do on this subject have a similar story.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.920
 A friend of mine, I don't know if I should say this,

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.920
 but in the dressing room before each show,

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.840
 one of his colleagues would play a game

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.480
 with all of them called Guess What's Under the Foreskin,

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.600
 where he would hide something beneath his foreskin,

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.800
 show everyone the foreskin,

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.440
 and the rest of the cast would have to guess what it was.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.640
 Okay, and so the idea is you can see the outline.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.080
 So if it was like a mountain bike,

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.360
 you'd be able to tell the shape of the wheels and stuff.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.240
 That's a fucked up Christmas.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.600
 That's how your presents are wrapped.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:58.320
 So I asked for the kind of things that he said.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.320
 He said once it was an old-fashioned penny,

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.960
 once it was seven jelly beans.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.560
 How are you supposed to identify an old-fashioned penny?

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.120
 You can't read the date inscribed on a penny

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.040
 through a foreskin. That's too much to ask.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.120
 You can tell which monarch is depicted.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:18.080
 That is a hell of a brass rubbing to work that out.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:22.640
 He was extremely eccentric.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.040
 I mean, there are so many stories about him.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.000
 So for example, his wife got him some ping-pong balls

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.320
 to throw at the TV screen when he didn't like it.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.840
 That doesn't sound very rock and roll,

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.360
 but apparently she only did this

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.160
 because he broke their previous TV set

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.800
 by throwing a smaller TV through it.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.560
 Right. That's amazing.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.920
 Isn't that rock and roll?

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.800
 That's impressive.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.520
 That's like one of those kids games

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.000
 where you have to fit the appropriate shape into itself.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.240
 And he's done it right.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.080
 We should say really quickly,

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.040
 because a lot of people will be a lot younger,

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.720
 might not have even heard of Peter at all,

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.640
 but this guy was a ginormous actor

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.040
 in the day of old Hollywood.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.160
 So Lawrence of Arabia probably has seminal role.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.680
 The big epic, some three hours and a bit long,

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.920
 he played the role of Lawrence.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.800
 And he was part of that crew of Hollywood

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.560
 that were the sort of hellraisers,

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.760
 these people that just didn't care about what they were doing.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:24.640
 And he was nominated eight times for best actor in the Oscars.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.200
 So he was a huge player.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.840
 I never won an acting Oscar, did he?

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.480
 And that's, I think, the record with Glenn Close,

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.120
 both him and Glenn Close, eight times nominated no wins.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.320
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.960
 And at least Glenn Close can say, "Oh, so close."

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.960
 He doesn't even have that.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.920
 Yeah, he was quite pissed off about that, I think.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.480
 In fact, he was offered an honorary Oscar in 2003,

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.200
 and that was when he'd had seven nominations for best actor.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.640
 And he didn't want to take it.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.400
 He said, "I'd like to defer that for at least 10 years

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.920
 'cause I might yet win the lovely bugger outright," he said.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.320
 And the only reason he did go and accept the honorary Oscar

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.640
 was 'cause his daughter wanted a jaunt in LA.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.520
 So he went and did it.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.320
 And then he got nominated an eighth time in 2007.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.920
 Didn't win that either. - Didn't win it.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.280
 - Poor guy. - Hmm.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.040
 - There are worse fates, but... - There are.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:17.200
 He was friends with Samuel Beckett, who we mentioned before.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.240
 Yeah, there's a story, it's not much of a story, really,

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:24.800
 that he kind of had a big night out with Samuel Beckett and Soho.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.000
 I'm sitting in the hallway drinking whiskey until the early hours,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.480
 getting the policemen involved and having drinks with them.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:36.480
 His second Oscar nomination was for Beckett, the movie Beckett,

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:41.680
 in which he played Henry II, so that was about Thomas Beckett.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.600
 So he was friends with Samuel Beckett,

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.920
 he was nominated for the movie Beckett,

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.360
 and he was born on Beckett Street in Leeds.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.640
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.560
 - Amazing. - Very cool.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.400
 He had lots, as I suppose everyone has,

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.080
 who's been a jobbing actor for ages,

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.720
 had lots of other jobs to actually pay the bills.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.480
 But he worked, I think, quite a good expression of his personality

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.960
 was the fact that he worked as a steeplejack,

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.800
 and he worked as a demolition man,

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.480
 and this was in his early twenties, I think, when he was in Leeds.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.680
 And he loved it.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.160
 He said, "Blowing things up and knocking things down

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.760
 "with a bloody great hammer.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.480
 "Nobody gave a flying shit for health and safety in those days.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.920
 "It was glorious."

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:22.640
 And he loved that.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.120
 And I think he also loved being in the Navy, didn't he?

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.120
 - Yes. - Sorry, what were you gonna say?

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.240
 A steeplejack.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.800
 That's somebody who climbs up very tall buildings,

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.080
 isn't it, a steeplejack?

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.560
 - Yeah. - What do they do when they're up there?

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.760
 I thought they kind of fixed them.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.640
 Although, this implies that he's knocking it down,

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.840
 so it sounds like he's doing it wrong.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.200
 - Yeah, yeah. - It's one of those old jobs.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.200
 - Yeah, oldy jobs, yeah. - Yeah.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.320
 The robots can do it now.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.720
 Just an irrelevant thing about climbing up tall buildings.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.480
 I learned the word "flaunching" the other day.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.520
 - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.320
 - "Flaunching." - Is it "launching" yourself off a flock?

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.560
 (laughing)

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.360
 It's, this is very, it's actually extremely boring,

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.520
 but you know the chimney pot at the top of a,

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.560
 there's a chimney stack,

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.080
 and then there's a tiny bit right at the top

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.120
 with the round chimney pot.

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.000
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.720
 The little layer of cement mortar

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.280
 between the stack and the pot is called the "flaunching."

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.640
 - Okay. - Right.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.520
 - Quite a niche thing to have a word for, really.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.360
 - I know, but if you have a roof around,

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.280
 you can knock them dead by saying,

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.520
 "Have you considered the "flaunching?"

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.280
 (laughing)

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.800
 - Is it maybe a problem with the "flaunching?"

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.840
 - That was like when I learned that brickwork

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.200
 had to be pointed.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.560
 I still don't know what it means,

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.320
 but I used to whenever a builder came around,

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.960
 I was like, "Oh, I think these bricks need to be pointed."

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.640
 - Mm, yeah, yeah.

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.280
 - Wow, God, that is a useful word.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.160
 Like.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.600
 - Anyway, what are we learning today?

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.760
 We've learned "Jugum, Flaunching,"

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.600
 and what was the curtains one?

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:48.640
 - It's a lambroquin.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.800
 - Lambroquin. - Wow.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.680
 - Like a harlequin who's drunk on lambrini.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.720
 That's how you remember it.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.600
 - Flaunching.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.360
 - First, there's a problem with my "flaunching,"

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.880
 then the lambroquins fall over.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.000
 I tell you, if something happens to my "Jugum" next,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.200
 that's gonna be the full set.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.520
 (laughing)

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.440
 - When they were delivering that bowl of whiskey

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.120
 to that New Zealand guy,

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:13.440
 was the "flaunching" an issue in getting the bottle down?

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.040
 - Great question.

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:18.720
 - I don't think the "flaunching" usually gets in the way,

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.720
 sounds like, unless it's very badly done.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.600
 - Okay.

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.200
 - And you don't want bad "flaunching" on a house,

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.120
 that'll ruin the valley.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:25.440
 - No.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.640
 (laughing)

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.760
 - Yes, I'm so sorry.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.560
 - Peter O'Toole?

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.160
 - We were talking about Peter O'Toole.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.520
 I'm sorry for distracting you.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.280
 - In 1980, he did Macbeth, the old Vic,

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.080
 and it was absolutely hammered.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.440
 The critics hated it.

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.880
 They said he was as subtle as a battering ram.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.440
 The Observer said there are chances that he likes to play,

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.880
 but his performance suggests

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.520
 that he is taking some kind of personal revenge on it.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.640
 So he's like, "Really, really, really hated."

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.800
 But the people loved it,

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.960
 because it was Peter O'Toole, he's very famous.

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.200
 It was almost kind of fun to go and watch something

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.280
 that was so bad, it was good kind of thing.

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.600
 But it could have been so much better,

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.320
 because originally he was the director,

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.880
 and he was basically allowed to do what he wanted.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.480
 And so he decided it was going to be an inflatable Macbeth.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.880
 And he had a friend who was working for a company

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.480
 called Labuta Limited,

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.880
 which was making inflatables

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.800
 that you could keep in the boot of your car.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:30.160
 And he decided that he was going to commission this person

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.040
 to do all of the scenery in Macbeth,

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.160
 and it was going to be a massive inflatable Macbeth.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.880
 And in the first time they tried to do the rehearsals,

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.800
 someone said that,

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.440
 "The curtain rose to reveal a dimly-lit collection

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.480
 of black plastic fallacies swaying in the wind."

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.760
 - Nice.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.000
 - And on top of that, no one could hear

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:50.960
 what anyone was saying,

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.320
 because these were inflatables

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.920
 that had to be constantly blown up.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.520
 So it was just like the air compression

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.360
 was just like the whole time.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.440
 No one could hear anything that they were saying.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.920
 And so in the end, he scrapped the inflatables,

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.240
 but it was still a terrible, terrible play.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.080
 - Peter, it's all sort of started acting by mistake.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.240
 - He was steeple-jacking one day, wasn't he?

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.000
 And there was accidentally an audience

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.200
 at the top of the flaunching he was climbing up towards.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.680
 - Yes, it flaunched his career, didn't it?

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.320
 (laughing)

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:26.720
 - No, it wasn't that.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.720
 He was doing, he was in Leeds,

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.680
 he was doing a poetry course.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.520
 He actually always wanted to do something in poetry.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.000
 He loved literature and poetry.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.240
 He was doing a poetry course in Leeds,

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.440
 and there was a professional production

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.760
 of "Fathers and Sons" going on down the road,

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.080
 and the lead actor in that production

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.120
 fell down some stairs and broke some bones.

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.360
 And in fact, O'Toole remembered,

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.120
 his name was Gordon Luck.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:52.240
 So, ouch, doubly painful for him.

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.520
 Parole Gordon, Gordon.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.800
 - It suffered some bad luck.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.640
 - Gordon, unlucky.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.800
 Fell down some stairs.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.240
 And they'd seen Peter O'Toole

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.160
 do some sort of little skit for fun

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.560
 on an amateur stage in the area the year before.

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:06.640
 So they said, "Look, do you want to play the lead

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.320
 in "Fathers and Sons?"

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.120
 And he said, "Yes."

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.000
 And he played it for two weeks.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:10.880
 He said, "I played it for two weeks,

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.200
 and then I got the bug, and there was no going back."

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.840
 - What's interesting is that it is bad luck

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.560
 to say "Gord Luck" in the theatre, isn't it?

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.600
 You're not supposed to say that.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.880
 You're supposed to say "Break a leg."

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.840
 - Oh my God, of course.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.040
 He should have changed.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.160
 What could you change your name to

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.600
 that sounds like "Break a leg."

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:26.720
 Like, but...

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.920
 - If you change your name to Macbeth,

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.520
 no one will ever call you for anything

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.640
 in the theatre at all.

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.240
 - Why am I not booking any gigs?

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:38.720
 - He once took a double bed on the northern line,

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.760
 Peter O'Toole.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.400
 - Yeah.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.120
 - Where did he take it?

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:41.680
 - Okay.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.920
 - To another, to a different stop on the northern line.

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.720
 - Why?

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.360
 - Why?

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.920
 - Did he just not, he'd thought

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.120
 the seats were uncomfortable.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.200
 - No, he had to move the bed from one place to another.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.280
 It was in 1954 and it was an anecdote

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.400
 in his autobiography.

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.400
 - I think the interesting part about the anecdote

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.760
 is he didn't pay, right?

00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.840
 And he sneaked it on and sneaked it off

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.240
 and he managed to sneak it through the turnstiles,

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.160
 a double bed without anyone noticing.

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.160
 - I think there were no turnstiles at the time.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.360
 He says at the start of the earlier,

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:10.560
 "This is before the bad days of turnstiles."

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.160
 But still, it's very impressive.

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:14.480
 - Yeah, I mean, how big was his foreskin?

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.960
 (laughing)

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.040
 - It's extraordinary.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:26.160
 - Okay, that's it.

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.200
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.800

 (gentle music)
