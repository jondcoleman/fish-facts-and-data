00:00:13,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming"
00:00:20,00:00:27,"to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:00:27,00:00:32,"with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered"
00:00:32,00:00:37,around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:00:37,00:00:46,order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Anna. My fact this week is that logs
00:00:46,00:00:54,used to be carried around the Andaman Islands by swimming elephants. There's a lot of information
00:00:54,00:01:00,to unpick in that. Okay here's the first one. In fact you've actually answered it with your fact
00:01:00,00:01:04,"but I was going to say can elephants swim? I'm not going to dignify that with an answer, James."
00:01:04,00:01:10,It's like you're questioning the veracity of my facts. What? Yes they can. They can swim. I see I
00:01:10,00:01:14,do see what you're saying. Is it just these elephants or all elephants? Oh I thought he meant
00:01:14,00:01:19,"are the logs like a floatation device and they were just using that to... That's a great point Dan,"
00:01:19,00:01:23,that's exactly what I didn't really mean but let's pretend I did. I mean you don't get swimming
00:01:23,00:01:28,lessons for dogs do you but if they jump into a pond they're fine. Well interesting you say that my
00:01:28,00:01:32,mum actually has a dog which can't swim. It's very embarrassing but yes largely I think four-legged
00:01:32,00:01:38,mammals can instinctively swim and elephants can broadly and these ones particularly can but they
00:01:38,00:01:44,can swim incredibly long distances these particular Andaman elephants and they... So what happened was
00:01:44,00:01:52,"the Andaman Islands, Andaman and Nicobar Islands in fact are territories of India about 572 islands"
00:01:52,00:01:57,altogether and in about the 70s they started logging there and they brought a bunch of elephants
00:01:57,00:02:03,over from mainland India and they sort of pulled down trees in the jungle and then they'd load up
00:02:03,00:02:07,the elephants with trees and they'd take them to the beaches to be shipped off in barges but the
00:02:07,00:02:12,elephants had to block trees in various different islands and there was no way of transporting them
00:02:12,00:02:17,between the islands and so they just sent them on their way to swim it and they'd swim like 30
00:02:17,00:02:23,"kilometers, 20-30 kilometers between islands do some logging and drag the logs out to sort of barges"
00:02:23,00:02:31,out to sea and load them up. That's incredible. That is an incredible distance to travel as an
00:02:31,00:02:37,elephant. Are they getting guidance in terms of direction you know? Do currents take them out?
00:02:37,00:02:44,Are there lanes for them to swim in? They're heavily signposted and I think humans would accompany them
00:02:44,00:02:49,"between the islands on small rafts and boats that couldn't accommodate the elephants. I don't,"
00:02:49,00:02:53,I actually am not sure maybe they had memorized various routes but I think that might be a step
00:02:53,00:02:57,beyond a lot of elephants. An elephant could remember any route it was given couldn't it?
00:02:57,00:03:02,But because an elephant never forgets. Exactly yeah. Yeah I didn't know that we were doing a
00:03:02,00:03:11,common erroneous phrase-based fact now. The thing is about the elephants is I've read an article
00:03:11,00:03:15,called problems in the land vertebrate zoo geography of certain islands and the swimming
00:03:15,00:03:22,"powers of elephants by David Lee Johnson from 1980 and he says, I'm sure you've all read it,"
00:03:22,00:03:26,"but he says, I'm sure all the listeners have read it, but he says that elephants have such good"
00:03:26,00:03:32,eyesight and sense of smell that even kilometers and kilometers and kilometers away they can see
00:03:32,00:03:39,another island that most animals wouldn't be able to see and also smell food on another island.
00:03:39,00:03:44,Incredible. And because it could smell the food it could find its way there. Yeah. So you're saying
00:03:44,00:03:48,"the logging humans make a phone call to the next island saying, look get a polo min,"
00:03:48,00:03:53,"leave it on the beach, I'm sending the elephant over now. Can I just say, I'm not saying that."
00:03:53,00:03:58,Donald Lee Johnson is saying that in his paper problems in the land vertebrate zoo geography
00:03:58,00:04:03,"of certain islands and the swimming powers of elephants from 1980. He was saying that, I wasn't"
00:04:03,00:04:06,"saying that. That's so good. But you just need to, I don't know James, you're quoting him pretty"
00:04:06,00:04:11,extensively. I think you are now saying that. That's such a good idea. But as long as all you
00:04:11,00:04:15,"have to do is coordinate like no one, right, the elephants are moving today. No one's allowed to"
00:04:15,00:04:23,"open a banana. It's a key. Within a 50 mile radar. That's how you poach then, right? That's the best"
00:04:23,00:04:28,"poaching tactic. Yeah, absolutely. All the elephants just fuck off this way. Where are they going?"
00:04:28,00:04:34,"The thing is that according to this paper, until the 70s and 80s, a lot of geographers"
00:04:34,00:04:39,"assumed that elephants couldn't swim. And so when you found elephant bones on an island,"
00:04:39,00:04:43,"even if they'd gone extinct or something, or even if you found living elephants,"
00:04:43,00:04:47,then there must have been a land bridge because otherwise there's no way they could have got
00:04:47,00:04:52,a cross. And that meant that a lot of geographers had these ideas of certain islands around the
00:04:52,00:04:56,world that must have been connected by land at some stage because they assumed that elephants could
00:04:56,00:05:02,"swim. Really? That's interesting. That's amazing. I thought, I didn't properly know that elephants"
00:05:02,00:05:07,could swim actually. I did know that they could walk underwater. That was a thing I knew at certain
00:05:07,00:05:13,"depths because I've seen footage where they use their trunk as a snorkel. And so, yeah, that's"
00:05:13,00:05:19,"really fun when you see that bit of footage. But that, yeah, that's amazing. James, was it Donald"
00:05:19,00:05:23,"Johnson, you were saying? Yeah, it was Donald Lee Johnson and his paper Problems in the Land"
00:05:23,00:05:31,"Vertebrate Suji. No, no, I don't know if we need to. I didn't read that paper. I'm probably now the"
00:05:31,00:05:37,only person listening here in Baltimore who hasn't. But I think that I read a reference to it because
00:05:37,00:05:41,"there's a debate about how elephants got to Sri Lanka, isn't there? Yeah. And it was, because it's"
00:05:41,00:05:47,"about, how far is it from the Indian coast? Quite a long way. It is quite a long way, but it has"
00:05:47,00:05:51,elephants. And lots of other places used to have elephants like Malta and Crete and Cyprus. Yes.
00:05:51,00:05:57,None of which I think have elephants now. I've been to Malta and it's quite a small island.
00:05:57,00:06:01,You would struggle to hide a wild elephant population on it.
00:06:01,00:06:05,"The elephants on Sri Lanka, I think they're still swimming there. They're still making the journey"
00:06:05,00:06:10,over to Sri Lanka because every few months it seems like there's a story where a Sri Lankan
00:06:10,00:06:14,elephant is caught at sea and is being swept around in the waves and has to be rescued.
00:06:14,00:06:19,"Because there was one that, you know, in the media gets a theme and reports on every instance"
00:06:19,00:06:22,of it and it turns out it's happening all the time. And it happened once in 2017.
00:06:22,00:06:26,A Sri Lankan elephant was found being washed around about 16 kilometers out to sea.
00:06:26,00:06:31,"And, you know, they all had to get a raft and come and pull it in again. And then two weeks later,"
00:06:31,00:06:37,two Sri Lankan elephants were found stranded at sea and had to be dragged back in. And it looks so
00:06:37,00:06:41,funny. You should look it up. There's all these people around with rafts and then bobbing under
00:06:41,00:06:47,the water. Just these two vast elephants who look so stupidly out of place in the middle of the ocean.
00:06:47,00:06:51,"They look really kind, they're really struggling aren't they? And the first one anyway, the 2017"
00:06:51,00:06:57,"one, the elephants really, really struggling to swim. And National Geographic emailed the co-founder"
00:06:57,00:07:01,"of Elephant Voices, which I think is a charity called Joyce Pool. They emailed her and asked her"
00:07:01,00:07:05,about elephant swimming. And she said she wasn't surprised that the elephant was swimming out
00:07:05,00:07:10,"there because she said elephants are considered the best swimmers of any land mammal, perhaps"
00:07:10,00:07:15,"excluding trained human swimmers. And then they showed her the video of this elephant really,"
00:07:15,00:07:20,"really struggling to swim. And she said, maybe the elephant was tired."
00:07:20,00:07:27,"It's 16 kilometers out. If you've swum 16 kilometers, pal, you'd be tired, wouldn't you?"
00:07:27,00:07:32,I certainly would. There was the theory at one point that the Loch Ness Monster was a swimming
00:07:32,00:07:37,"elephant, wasn't there? Was there? Yeah, because there was a story that there was a circus in town"
00:07:37,00:07:43,"and they thought let's bring the elephant out for a swim. And the very famous photo that was seen,"
00:07:43,00:07:47,"I think it was the famous photo, the surgeon's photo it's called, the thought is that that's"
00:07:47,00:07:52,"the trunk just coming up through the water, getting breath as it's going along."
00:07:52,00:07:56,It's not like humps going up to the trunk in the Loch Ness Monster.
00:07:56,00:08:00,"Yeah, so I think they think that that's the head coming out from the back."
00:08:00,00:08:03,Maybe it was giving the circus' camel a piggyback in the water.
00:08:03,00:08:07,"Yeah, and then the snake was at the back."
00:08:09,00:08:14,"I guess it's not the stupidest theory ever, given that it only requires us to believe in"
00:08:14,00:08:18,"the existence of a badly managed circus, rather than the existence of a dinosaur in a lake."
00:08:18,00:08:21,"Well, it's not a badly managed circus, taking your elephant out for a swim."
00:08:21,00:08:25,"I think if they've left the elephant in there and it's being photographed by the public,"
00:08:25,00:08:28,"that's what I thought you were saying. No, I'm not saying that there's an"
00:08:28,00:08:32,abandoned elephant swimming Loch Ness. That's what you're saying.
00:08:32,00:08:34,"If you're saying the Loch Ness Monster is an elephant, then that's..."
00:08:34,00:08:39,"No, I'm saying the photo. There was a thought that the photo was an elephant."
00:08:39,00:08:42,"Yeah, okay. But if they put it in, then they took it out."
00:08:42,00:08:43,"I see what you're saying. I thought you meant like Andy,"
00:08:43,00:08:46,"there's been this elephant living under water in Loch Ness for hundreds of years,"
00:08:46,00:08:48,which is almost more ridiculous than the Loch Ness Monster.
00:08:48,00:08:51,"If you look at that photo, actually, if you look at the surgeon's photo,"
00:08:51,00:08:56,you can just see in the corner of the shot a clown getting out of a little car.
00:08:56,00:08:59,"And you can just see that it actually looks like water,"
00:08:59,00:09:01,but it's actually confetti that he's swimming through.
00:09:01,00:09:07,"And the clown's got giant shoes and has been mistaken for Bigfoot, actually, so..."
00:09:07,00:09:12,"Well, we've moved down to the realm of facts, haven't we?"
00:09:12,00:09:15,Do you want a real fact about elephants? I've got one.
00:09:15,00:09:24,"Okay, well, I'm going to put it in James's special Donald Lee Johnson tongs for quoting without"
00:09:24,00:09:28,saying this is definitely true. I think it's an amazing theory that the theory is
00:09:28,00:09:33,that Cornwall's first road network ever was created by elephants.
00:09:33,00:09:36,It's one of my favorite facts. I can't believe we've never mentioned it before.
00:09:36,00:09:37,"Uh-huh, uh-huh, go on."
00:09:37,00:09:40,This is according to researchers at the University of North Cornwall.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"Who should know, frankly?"
00:09:42,00:09:46,Can I quickly debunk their theory before it's even sort of found?
00:09:46,00:09:52,"No, no, no, no. Anna, I would like to get my thing up in the air before you take a pop at it,"
00:09:52,00:09:57,"if that's all right. Up to 115,000 years ago, Cornwall had elephants."
00:09:57,00:10:00,"Okay, that was a bit warmer. It had them, all right."
00:10:00,00:10:05,There's a fossil record and all of that stuff.
00:10:06,00:10:09,"Sorry, just a check. So we're going to listen to this knowing it's wrong."
00:10:09,00:10:12,We're just going to sit here and listen to this.
00:10:12,00:10:13,We're not because I know it's right.
00:10:13,00:10:13,Okay.
00:10:13,00:10:16,"And Anna may know something different, but let me tell you what I know."
00:10:16,00:10:21,"Right, so you know how Ice Age is kind of retreat in advance as the millennia go by."
00:10:21,00:10:26,"So the most recent glacial maximum covered most of the UK, but it didn't cover Cornwall, right?"
00:10:26,00:10:27,It didn't get that far south.
00:10:27,00:10:28,That's definitely true.
00:10:28,00:10:33,"So most of the elephant tracks across the UK will have been covered by ice sheets and erased,"
00:10:33,00:10:34,but the ones in Cornwall were not.
00:10:34,00:10:40,And what the theory is by these researchers is that herds of migrating woolly mammoths and
00:10:40,00:10:44,"elephants who came to the UK, they came to England basically on their summer holidays"
00:10:44,00:10:49,"when it was a bit warmer up there to eat, those tracks that they had, their roots,"
00:10:49,00:10:56,"which were used by them and by hunters, kind of map onto the road network in Cornwall today."
00:10:56,00:11:00,"Ironically, it's the smaller roads that they created and not the trunk roads,"
00:11:01,00:11:04,which were created in modern times for modern needs.
00:11:04,00:11:07,But the smaller road network in Cornwall is created by elephants.
00:11:07,00:11:09,"Right, there, I've said my bit."
00:11:09,00:11:12,"Now, please, Anna, get out of here."
00:11:12,00:11:17,Just going to say it doesn't make any sense because the roads in Cornwall are so sodding narrow
00:11:17,00:11:19,that two elephants could never pass each other on.
00:11:19,00:11:25,"Actually, in the Ice Age, these elephants, they got stuck behind tractors so often"
00:11:25,00:11:28,that they ended up trampling loads of extra roads.
00:11:29,00:11:34,"When I was looking into elephants moving logs around everywhere,"
00:11:34,00:11:40,I discovered that they actually moved trees and pooed them out eventually.
00:11:40,00:11:42,"So, you know, they create trees."
00:11:42,00:11:47,"They're not smuggling trees in the rain, so it's not a, it's, I'm getting-"
00:11:47,00:11:49,"It's a big session on the toilet, isn't it, an oak."
00:11:49,00:11:51,What I mean to say is-
00:11:51,00:11:55,"As a mugger, you'd pay more, wouldn't you, for trees that hadn't been through the elephantanus."
00:11:56,00:12:01,"So, what I mean to say is, there's the African savanna elephant, and what it does is,"
00:12:01,00:12:08,"it basically, through eating, it transports seeds further than probably any other animal"
00:12:08,00:12:10,"around, and this is including a lot of birds."
00:12:10,00:12:16,"It's, it can go as far as 65 kilometers in delivering seeds, and that's because"
00:12:16,00:12:21,its intestines are so long for the seeds and the food to get through
00:12:21,00:12:26,"that it takes something like 33 hours, I believe, for it."
00:12:26,00:12:30,"Before it, they actually start defecating the seeds that they might have swallowed,"
00:12:30,00:12:35,and the last one will come out 96 hours after they've first swallowed a seed.
00:12:35,00:12:40,"And so, they've been spreading plants and trees all over, you know, different parts,"
00:12:40,00:12:45,"at greater distances than, as I say, a lot of birds in the area,"
00:12:45,00:12:46,and certainly any other land mammal.
00:12:46,00:12:48,I wonder if they know they're doing it.
00:12:48,00:12:53,"Like, they pick up a seed and eat it, and then they sprint for 96 hours straight."
00:12:53,00:12:55,Some kind of conservation project.
00:12:55,00:12:57,"Exactly, just open a banana in that area."
00:12:57,00:12:58,They come running.
00:12:58,00:12:59,Yeah.
00:12:59,00:13:00,It's clever.
00:13:00,00:13:05,"Did we, you know, we talked a while ago about sort of elephant trunk uses."
00:13:05,00:13:05,Oh yeah.
00:13:05,00:13:08,"And there, there was a bit which sort of came after that,"
00:13:08,00:13:11,"which, because we'd already recorded the podcast, it didn't go in,"
00:13:11,00:13:15,"but it was, and I found this website, which had all the uses of an elephant's trunk,"
00:13:15,00:13:17,"and like, as observed by scientists."
00:13:17,00:13:18,Okay.
00:13:18,00:13:21,"And one of the, there are about 200, you know, there are so many different"
00:13:21,00:13:24,"things, and they all, they've all got a different name by the scientists."
00:13:24,00:13:25,So I don't think we mentioned this.
00:13:25,00:13:30,One of them is mating pandemonium is the one way they use their trunk.
00:13:30,00:13:31,One of them is dust with semen.
00:13:31,00:13:32,Okay.
00:13:32,00:13:34,So let's go back to the first one.
00:13:34,00:13:36,Mating pandemonium.
00:13:36,00:13:38,"No pandas involved, I assume."
00:13:38,00:13:39,I hope not.
00:13:39,00:13:41,I'm lucky for them.
00:13:41,00:13:41,What does it mean?
00:13:41,00:13:42,"What, what is it?"
00:13:42,00:13:46,"Must be just like, you, I mean, how do you make mating chaotic introduce your trunk?"
00:13:46,00:13:48,I can see how that would cause pandemonium.
00:13:48,00:13:50,"What, trunk up the bum?"
00:13:50,00:13:52,"No, it can't, that's not what it can mean, is it?"
00:13:52,00:13:53,I know.
00:13:53,00:13:54,Do you?
00:13:54,00:13:57,Sounds like pandemonium to me.
00:13:57,00:14:00,"Dan, do you want to have a guess?"
00:14:00,00:14:06,"Oh, um, do they, oh, do they, do they form a heart, um, like you would with your hands?"
00:14:06,00:14:09,"You know, it's just to let people know that some sex going on over here."
00:14:09,00:14:12,"What a tame definition of, of pandemonium."
00:14:12,00:14:14,"Romantic, frankly."
00:14:14,00:14:19,"I think on kids, um, like maybe like, um, could it be like loads of males"
00:14:19,00:14:21,"attacking each other to attract a female, maybe?"
00:14:22,00:14:23,Like a big fight.
00:14:23,00:14:24,"It's much less fun, actually."
00:14:24,00:14:30,"It's, um, it's a mated, when a female has had sex, her relatives and companions join her"
00:14:30,00:14:32,"and they have a party, basically."
00:14:32,00:14:36,"So they, they shout and they rumble and they, they trumpet."
00:14:36,00:14:37,Like a baby shower.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"It's like a baby shower, except it's a sort of post shag."
00:14:39,00:14:41,Right.
00:14:41,00:14:42,So I'm just quoting from the website here.
00:14:42,00:14:46,"Females may turn towards the male, reaching their trunks to touch his penis"
00:14:46,00:14:48,or his semen on the ground or to touch one another
00:14:48,00:14:51,and then turn rapidly outward in a kind of pirouette.
00:14:51,00:14:55,"It's a bonding ceremony after, after one of your female friends has had sex."
00:14:55,00:14:57,Why don't we do that as humans?
00:14:57,00:15:00,I think that is a ceremony that should translate across species.
00:15:00,00:15:02,Every time someone loses their virginity.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"Andy, you could have yours quite soon."
00:15:04,00:15:10,"If the semen's on the ground, we could all pirouette away from you."
00:15:10,00:15:20,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy."
00:15:20,00:15:23,My fact is that there is a French parliamentary manoeuvre
00:15:23,00:15:26,which involves MPs hiding behind a curtain
00:15:26,00:15:29,and then bursting out to vote at the last minute.
00:15:29,00:15:32,"Why, why?"
00:15:32,00:15:34,It's really fun.
00:15:34,00:15:36,"It's, it's not used often."
00:15:36,00:15:38,"It's, it's not a weekly feature of the nationalism."
00:15:38,00:15:42,"Well, you couldn't because then people would just check for feet sticking out."
00:15:42,00:15:47,"How often people forget, eventually people forget."
00:15:47,00:15:50,"Well, I found a reference to it being done in 2014"
00:15:50,00:15:52,and I don't know if it's been done since then.
00:15:52,00:15:56,So this was a fact that a writer for the New Yorker called Lauren Collins
00:15:56,00:16:00,put it on Twitter and she reads a lot of French websites as well as English ones
00:16:00,00:16:02,and the National Assembly is their parliament basically
00:16:02,00:16:04,and it's got these enormous red curtains.
00:16:04,00:16:09,"And if you think as the opposition that you're close to defeating the government,"
00:16:09,00:16:13,sometimes you can try the coup de riteau which is the curtain blow
00:16:13,00:16:15,and you hide your MPs behind a curtain.
00:16:15,00:16:18,"You hold the vote that, you know, the government gets all its votes in"
00:16:18,00:16:22,and then they burst out from behind the curtain and vote against the government
00:16:22,00:16:23,and the idea is that they defeat them.
00:16:23,00:16:26,It's a way of lulling the government into thinking
00:16:26,00:16:28,that your side doesn't have the votes.
00:16:28,00:16:30,"Doesn't the government, does the government ever say?"
00:16:30,00:16:32,It's so weird there are only six of us in here
00:16:32,00:16:34,because I swear I saw about a dozen other people come in.
00:16:34,00:16:38,"Well, the one main time when it happened in like living memory"
00:16:38,00:16:40,"was with Sarkozy, wasn't it?"
00:16:40,00:16:44,"He was, he had some kind of internet bill that he wanted to get through."
00:16:44,00:16:47,"It was like just trying to, you know, ban people from the internet"
00:16:47,00:16:49,if they copied too many things or whatever.
00:16:49,00:16:53,And everyone was so certain it was going to get through
00:16:53,00:16:55,that hardly any of his party turned up.
00:16:55,00:16:59,"And so that's how the other, the opposition managed to do something."
00:16:59,00:17:03,The final result was 21 to 15 in the vote.
00:17:03,00:17:06,And if you think about how many hundreds of MPs there are in the
00:17:06,00:17:12,"National Assembly, it's like they literally didn't think that it was a problem at all."
00:17:12,00:17:15,And then suddenly behind the curtain there were 21 people.
00:17:15,00:17:20,"When they were behind those curtains, you could have said to your mates behind it,"
00:17:20,00:17:23,"we're all getting Sarkozy behind here, aren't we?"
00:17:23,00:17:24,That's great.
00:17:24,00:17:25,And it would have made sense.
00:17:25,00:17:26,Yes.
00:17:26,00:17:30,"No, but then everyone laughing so loud that your amazing joke"
00:17:30,00:17:31,would have given the game away.
00:17:31,00:17:35,I was just reading some random stuff about French politics
00:17:35,00:17:39,and mostly I just really enjoy it when they conform to stereotypes.
00:17:39,00:17:46,"So I enjoy that Felix Foray, who was president of France at the end of the 19th century,"
00:17:46,00:17:51,"died just while having sex with a 30-year-old mistress, obviously."
00:17:51,00:17:54,"That puts a real doubter on the party that you're having afterwards, doesn't it?"
00:17:54,00:18:03,The dusting with Siemens is going to be a pretty somber affair this afternoon.
00:18:03,00:18:05,"From dust to dust, from Siemens to Siemens."
00:18:05,00:18:08,He died doing what he loved.
00:18:08,00:18:10,I think everyone could always say that.
00:18:10,00:18:14,Just one or two more things on French parliamentary shenanigans.
00:18:14,00:18:19,One thing caught my eye and it's just incidents that happen outside the French parliament.
00:18:19,00:18:22,"In 2013, there was a group who launched a protest"
00:18:22,00:18:25,by releasing a flash mob of chickens outside the French parliament.
00:18:25,00:18:29,They had 450 chickens in the back of their van.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"They were a slightly regressive group, I'd say."
00:18:31,00:18:33,They were protesting against gay marriage.
00:18:33,00:18:36,And so they bundled 450 chickens into a van.
00:18:36,00:18:38,Their plan was to release them all outside the French parliament.
00:18:38,00:18:41,"As part of an incredibly weak pun, Anna, you would have loved it."
00:18:41,00:18:46,"Basically, they wrote ""Ne plume pas les familles"" or ""Don't pluck families"","
00:18:46,00:18:50,which also means don't rip people off with family taxes.
00:18:50,00:18:52,So it's a very convoluted trap shot.
00:18:52,00:18:55,"I mean, the French for chicken is a cock."
00:18:55,00:18:56,"Yeah, you're right."
00:18:56,00:18:57,You're absolutely right.
00:18:57,00:18:58,It feels like they missed a trick or two there.
00:18:58,00:18:59,I don't know.
00:18:59,00:19:00,Huge open goal missed.
00:19:00,00:19:01,Yeah.
00:19:01,00:19:03,And surely a headline must have read at some point.
00:19:03,00:19:05,"450 chickens, that is enough."
00:19:05,00:19:07,Brilliant.
00:19:07,00:19:09,Just to give a little coda.
00:19:09,00:19:12,"Only about 40 of them got out of the van, the chickens,"
00:19:12,00:19:14,before the police noticed while all of these chickens out here
00:19:14,00:19:15,had started chasing them.
00:19:15,00:19:17,So then they closed the van and bundled off.
00:19:17,00:19:20,"Very sadly, two of the chickens were then killed crossing the road."
00:19:20,00:19:26,But presumably they were the homophobic chickens who got out to protest.
00:19:26,00:19:28,So not too big a loss.
00:19:28,00:19:36,Can I tell you about a very exciting article page on Wikipedia that I read recently?
00:19:36,00:19:39,So just take us into the world of curtains for a second.
00:19:39,00:19:44,"Curtain rings really, really brought the thunder I thought when I was reading it."
00:19:44,00:19:48,"So there's a very interesting fact, which is that Lewis and Clark,"
00:19:48,00:19:49,"when they went out on their expeditions,"
00:19:49,00:19:52,they brought a lot of curtain rings with them as presents.
00:19:52,00:19:55,"Lewis and Clark, were they traveling across America?"
00:19:55,00:19:57,The North American interior.
00:19:57,00:19:58,"Yeah, they were."
00:19:58,00:20:00,I suppose they were interior guys.
00:20:00,00:20:02,That's the curtain rings.
00:20:05,00:20:07,"So if they'd been exploring the exterior,"
00:20:07,00:20:11,they would have taken the patio furniture with them and the fire pit.
00:20:11,00:20:13,So there's that little fact there.
00:20:13,00:20:16,And then there's this little paragraph of other uses and it says...
00:20:16,00:20:19,"Should we just quickly say, because I think they will have carried them"
00:20:19,00:20:21,"like to trade, right?"
00:20:21,00:20:22,"Yes, sorry."
00:20:22,00:20:25,"Yeah, they were to trade and they were gifts as well."
00:20:25,00:20:28,"They were really popular, new innovations back then."
00:20:28,00:20:34,They didn't have incredibly elaborate tents there every night with 400 pairs of curtains.
00:20:35,00:20:37,"But what, they're just a good thing to trade."
00:20:37,00:20:40,"I mean, if you're taking them to people who by and large don't have curtains."
00:20:40,00:20:43,"They use them as rings and earrings apparently,"
00:20:43,00:20:49,"which seems odd as they were specifically meant to be large enough to go around a human finger,"
00:20:49,00:20:50,"which I mean, all curtain rings."
00:20:50,00:20:51,"Yeah, so that's the thing."
00:20:51,00:20:54,"It says in this article, other uses, for example,"
00:20:54,00:20:58,they may be used as a wedding ring in a marriage ceremony.
00:20:58,00:21:00,So that's one use that they could have.
00:21:00,00:21:01,What do you mean one?
00:21:01,00:21:03,What kind of sausage finger people are getting married?
00:21:03,00:21:06,That you could use a curtain ring as a wedding ring.
00:21:06,00:21:09,"It's what this Wikipedia page says, but then the next thing it says is,"
00:21:09,00:21:15,or it can be used as a ligature to prevent nocturnal urethes.
00:21:15,00:21:16,"So bedwetting, right?"
00:21:16,00:21:21,"And I thought, okay, this suddenly sounds like someone's just taking the piss here."
00:21:21,00:21:24,"They're just, someone's hacked this Wikipedia page."
00:21:24,00:21:30,"I clicked on the link and it took me to a book that's written by a guy called Robert Liston,"
00:21:30,00:21:31,who was a big surgeon.
00:21:31,00:21:33,"And yeah, okay."
00:21:33,00:21:34,So check this out.
00:21:34,00:21:39,This is the extract from the book about using it as a ligature.
00:21:39,00:21:44,"""AR, when eight years old, passed a brass curtain ring over his penis"
00:21:44,00:21:47,"to prevent incontinence of urine during the night,"
00:21:47,00:21:52,and thereby escaping chastisement to which he had been frequently subjected.
00:21:52,00:21:55,"Great swelling soon took place round the ring,"
00:21:55,00:21:58,and he was unable to remove the jugum.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"He experienced much pain and difficulty in..."""
00:22:00,00:22:04,"Sorry, can we go back to that word you casually used there?"
00:22:04,00:22:05,Is it not jugum?
00:22:05,00:22:07,I've just not heard that word.
00:22:07,00:22:09,"No, I've actually not heard that word either."
00:22:09,00:22:10,"Oh, okay."
00:22:10,00:22:10,How do you spell it?
00:22:10,00:22:11,How do you spell it?
00:22:11,00:22:12,J-U-G-U-M.
00:22:12,00:22:15,"Wait, Dan, when you say is it not, what do you think it is?"
00:22:15,00:22:18,"Well, I assume it's an old word for a curtain ring."
00:22:18,00:22:20,It's sort of another word for it.
00:22:20,00:22:23,Imagine if the word odd word all one day was jugum.
00:22:23,00:22:26,The internet would go fucking apeshit.
00:22:26,00:22:30,"It's a very rare word, damn jugum."
00:22:30,00:22:34,You can't not acknowledge you just casually dropped the word jugum into a sentence.
00:22:34,00:22:36,"It's say he's put something on his penis,"
00:22:36,00:22:38,and then this is the same thing he can't take off.
00:22:38,00:22:40,It's obviously just another slang word for the item.
00:22:40,00:22:42,It's irrelevant to the story.
00:22:42,00:22:46,"So, he experienced much pain and difficulty in voiding his urine."
00:22:46,00:22:50,The ring gradually ulcerated.
00:22:50,00:22:56,"The ring appeared to sink into the substance of the penis, and the swelling subsided."
00:22:56,00:22:56,Oh.
00:22:57,00:23:01,"Yes, except that this guy kept it on there."
00:23:01,00:23:06,"It says that he then, after a while, became the father of a fine family."
00:23:06,00:23:08,"So, he was eight years old when he put this on."
00:23:08,00:23:12,"When between 50 and 60 years of age, he applied to me,"
00:23:12,00:23:18,"and then this doctor, Liston, then has to remove this curtain ring"
00:23:18,00:23:22,"that's been around this man's penis since the age of eight,"
00:23:22,00:23:25,which has fused into the shaft of his penis.
00:23:25,00:23:27,"So, you're saying it sort of migrated into his penis."
00:23:27,00:23:28,Exactly.
00:23:28,00:23:30,"It kind of, it just--"
00:23:30,00:23:31,Through the skin.
00:23:31,00:23:31,"It got, exactly."
00:23:31,00:23:34,"It migrated through the skin, and it became infused."
00:23:34,00:23:36,He had a curtain ring.
00:23:36,00:23:39,His penis was the rod to this curtain ring.
00:23:39,00:23:39,"Yeah, no, no, no."
00:23:39,00:23:43,"He had kids, he had everything."
00:23:43,00:23:44,He never thought to take it off.
00:23:44,00:23:48,"If it's fused into your penis, I would just live with it."
00:23:48,00:23:49,"Well, that's what he did."
00:23:49,00:23:52,"Can I just say, we're filming this on Zoom today."
00:23:52,00:23:54,We don't usually at the moment.
00:23:54,00:23:56,And Dan is in a bedroom.
00:23:56,00:23:58,Can anyone else not turn their eyes off the curtain
00:23:58,00:24:00,that's behind his left shoulder?
00:24:00,00:24:02,"Actually, you're right."
00:24:02,00:24:04,"Is one of the curtains at the end, it's sort of hanging off a bit."
00:24:04,00:24:06,Like there's a ring missing.
00:24:06,00:24:07,What's up?
00:24:07,00:24:07,Yeah.
00:24:07,00:24:11,And I thought Dan was getting slowly more and more purple
00:24:11,00:24:12,as this went on.
00:24:12,00:24:18,"Just because you said it, I had to know."
00:24:18,00:24:21,A jugum is not an old word for a curtain ring.
00:24:21,00:24:25,A jugum is specifically a forceps for compressing the penis
00:24:25,00:24:28,"in olden days using an anti masturbatory device, apparently."
00:24:28,00:24:32,Apparently you needed a word that specific.
00:24:32,00:24:35,"Okay, so great swelling took place around the ring"
00:24:35,00:24:38,and he was unable to remove the--
00:24:38,00:24:40,It seems like they're using it metaphorically
00:24:40,00:24:42,"because that's how he was using it, right?"
00:24:42,00:24:46,He was almost using it like one of these medical things.
00:24:46,00:24:48,His penis worked again.
00:24:48,00:24:50,Like it worked normally again.
00:24:50,00:24:52,"He was like, ""Wow, my penis is flowing nicely."
00:24:52,00:24:53,"This is in his 60s."""
00:24:53,00:24:55,"Yeah, but he always got an erection whenever he heard a curtain"
00:24:55,00:24:57,"being moved, which is very embarrassing."
00:24:57,00:25:03,Can I tell you an anecdote about politics?
00:25:03,00:25:05,"Which is not French, but I kind of like it."
00:25:05,00:25:08,"It's about a vote, so it is kind of related."
00:25:08,00:25:10,So this is in 1872 and there was a vote
00:25:10,00:25:12,against the New Zealand government.
00:25:12,00:25:15,And it looked like it was going to come down to one vote.
00:25:15,00:25:16,"So this is like, what do you call that,"
00:25:16,00:25:19,when it's like in confidence of the government?
00:25:19,00:25:22,"So if they lose this, the government could fall."
00:25:22,00:25:24,And it was going to come down to one vote.
00:25:24,00:25:26,And one of the governing party called Edward Wakefield
00:25:26,00:25:29,"was a massive drunk, okay?"
00:25:29,00:25:31,So his colleagues locked him in a room
00:25:31,00:25:34,and they took all of his alcohol away from him
00:25:34,00:25:36,"and they kept him in this room and they said,"
00:25:36,00:25:37,"""Right, we're going to leave you there."
00:25:37,00:25:38,We're going to keep you sober.
00:25:38,00:25:41,"And then as soon as the vote starts, we'll let you out"
00:25:41,00:25:43,"and you can vote and then you can do whatever you want."""
00:25:43,00:25:44,Okay?
00:25:44,00:25:47,So they put Edward Wakefield in this room
00:25:47,00:25:49,and the opposition learned about it
00:25:49,00:25:52,and so they lowered a bottle of whiskey down the chimney
00:25:52,00:25:54,of the room that he was in.
00:25:54,00:25:58,He drank the whiskey and he was unable to vote
00:25:58,00:26:00,and the government of New Zealand fell.
00:26:00,00:26:01,"Oh, wow."
00:26:01,00:26:03,"Jesus, amazing."
00:26:03,00:26:03,Brilliant.
00:26:03,00:26:04,That's incredible.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Wow.
00:26:05,00:26:06,You really do have a problem then.
00:26:06,00:26:09,I think the next trip when you let out of that room
00:26:09,00:26:10,is a trip to the AA.
00:26:10,00:26:12,"He must have thought it was Christmas, right?"
00:26:12,00:26:14,When the bottle of whiskey comes down.
00:26:14,00:26:17,"Santa's changed, hasn't he?"
00:26:17,00:26:17,Yeah.
00:26:18,00:26:21,Can't be asked to come down the chimney himself anymore.
00:26:21,00:26:26,"Oh, that's great."
00:26:26,00:26:28,"Well, do you want to, look,"
00:26:28,00:26:29,do you just want to impress your curtain-loving friends?
00:26:29,00:26:31,Always.
00:26:31,00:26:31,"Yes, please."
00:26:31,00:26:32,"Yes, you do."
00:26:32,00:26:34,Do you know what you call a curtain's helmet?
00:26:34,00:26:40,"I didn't even know a curtain had a helmet, Anna, embarrassing me."
00:26:40,00:26:42,"Well, when I say helmet, what I mean is,"
00:26:42,00:26:44,"you know, on quite old-fashioned curtains"
00:26:44,00:26:46,"or on eight curtains, you get like a fabric"
00:26:46,00:26:47,or sometimes a wooden border at the top.
00:26:47,00:26:50,"Or a skirt, like a top skirt for the curtains."
00:26:50,00:26:52,"Like a hem, kind of thing."
00:26:52,00:26:54,"Yeah, but an upper and sort of a high hem."
00:26:54,00:26:58,I'd call it a skirtan if we were starting
00:26:58,00:26:59,from scratch with the language.
00:26:59,00:27:03,"That's actually better, and that wouldn't have forced me"
00:27:03,00:27:04,"into saying, do you know what you call a curtain's helmet"
00:27:04,00:27:04,when it's clear?
00:27:04,00:27:06,"Not a helmet, but it is called a pelmet."
00:27:06,00:27:10,"Pelmet, okay, yeah."
00:27:10,00:27:11,It's called a pelmet.
00:27:11,00:27:11,"Oh, well, that's quite good,"
00:27:11,00:27:14,"because isn't a pelmet slang for an extremely short skirt,"
00:27:14,00:27:15,like a racially short skirt as a pelmet?
00:27:16,00:27:16,Is it?
00:27:16,00:27:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:17,00:27:18,Is it?
00:27:18,00:27:19,It might be.
00:27:19,00:27:21,"If a curtain was analogous to a pair of legs,"
00:27:21,00:27:22,"that little bit at the top would be a pelmet, wouldn't it?"
00:27:22,00:27:23,"Yeah, yeah."
00:27:23,00:27:24,"Dude, I did not know that,"
00:27:24,00:27:26,but that feels like one must be named after the other.
00:27:26,00:27:28,"It is like a pelmet, yeah."
00:27:28,00:27:31,"Do you know what kind of pelmet, though, a lambrokin is?"
00:27:31,00:27:34,"No, I don't. A lambrokin, no."
00:27:34,00:27:38,Or a lambroquin is a pelmet with such deep sides
00:27:38,00:27:39,they extend to the floor.
00:27:39,00:27:41,"Just if you're ever at anyone's house, you can say,"
00:27:41,00:27:43,"""I love your lambroquins."""
00:27:43,00:27:45,"I think you're more likely to say,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,"""Have you considered having some lambroquins here?"""
00:27:47,00:27:50,Because they're not likely to have them themselves.
00:27:50,00:27:52,"Pelmet, which goes all the way to the floor?"
00:27:52,00:27:54,On the sides of the curtain.
00:27:54,00:27:55,"Yeah, yeah, not all the way down,"
00:27:55,00:27:56,because that would be a blinding.
00:27:56,00:27:57,That's a curtain.
00:27:57,00:28:00,Wow.
00:28:00,00:28:02,Is it to conceal?
00:28:02,00:28:03,"It's like a square curtain,"
00:28:03,00:28:04,"so it would come out on the sides,"
00:28:04,00:28:06,"and then it would be kind of flat in the front,"
00:28:06,00:28:08,"and you'd have your pelmet at the top,"
00:28:08,00:28:10,"but then on the sides, it would come all the way down."
00:28:10,00:28:11,"I see, so you're framing."
00:28:11,00:28:12,"And yes, it is."
00:28:12,00:28:13,That's quite nice. I might get that.
00:28:13,00:28:15,"It is, in answer to your assumption, Andy,"
00:28:15,00:28:17,"it is to conceal the embarrassing bits,"
00:28:17,00:28:19,like the curtain rings and the pole.
00:28:19,00:28:22,"Well, now we know they are functionally cock rings."
00:28:22,00:28:24,I think it's probably quite a good idea to hide them.
00:28:24,00:28:32,"Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:28:32,00:28:34,and that is my fact.
00:28:34,00:28:36,My fact this week is that one of the biggest
00:28:36,00:28:37,theme parks in China
00:28:37,00:28:40,"has a ride that puts visitors in a coffin,"
00:28:40,00:28:42,"rolls them into a chamber,"
00:28:42,00:28:45,and then simulates their cremation.
00:28:45,00:28:49,This is the Sad Mahi game.
00:28:49,00:28:50,It's the experience of death.
00:28:50,00:28:53,"The cremator goes by many, many names."
00:28:53,00:28:57,It is a very bizarre 4D virtual experience
00:28:57,00:29:00,"that supposedly, according to reports from 2014,"
00:29:00,00:29:02,costs roughly 26 pounds.
00:29:02,00:29:06,"And the idea is that you go into a morgue,"
00:29:06,00:29:08,"you get into a coffin,"
00:29:08,00:29:10,and they push you through on a conveyor belt
00:29:10,00:29:12,"all the way to the crematorium,"
00:29:12,00:29:15,"where then you are burnt to a cinder,"
00:29:15,00:29:18,at least that's the sensation that you're going to get.
00:29:18,00:29:21,"Lots of hot air, lots of weird lights,"
00:29:21,00:29:24,and it just prepares you for your inevitable death
00:29:24,00:29:26,is the idea.
00:29:26,00:29:29,"I mean, first of all, it's not the sensation."
00:29:29,00:29:30,I think they claim it.
00:29:30,00:29:33,It's not the sensation of being burnt to a cinder is it?
00:29:33,00:29:35,Because that would be a much less pleasant ride.
00:29:35,00:29:37,It's a sensation of being a bit worn with some weird lights.
00:29:37,00:29:38,"Well, there are two."
00:29:38,00:29:40,The two people who came up with the idea
00:29:40,00:29:43,who are Huangei Wipeng and Dingrui.
00:29:43,00:29:45,They're two people from Shanghai.
00:29:45,00:29:48,"When Huangei went into it,"
00:29:48,00:29:50,"he said, ""I couldn't breathe,"
00:29:50,00:29:52,"and I thought my life was over."""
00:29:52,00:29:53,That was the first time he ever tried it.
00:29:53,00:29:56,"So to him, he thought he was dying, get it?"
00:29:56,00:29:56,Yeah.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"Although, but that was when he..."
00:29:58,00:30:00,"So they, I think to prepare for making this,"
00:30:00,00:30:02,"they asked to be sent through a crematorium, right?"
00:30:02,00:30:04,And they asked the controller of the crematorium
00:30:04,00:30:06,to let them experience cremation
00:30:06,00:30:08,with the crucial difference
00:30:08,00:30:10,that he turned off the furnace.
00:30:10,00:30:14,"It does say it heats you up to about 40 degrees Celsius,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,"not Fahrenheit, which is, that's warm."
00:30:16,00:30:16,That is very warm.
00:30:16,00:30:18,I would feel pretty uncomfortable at that.
00:30:18,00:30:19,Yeah.
00:30:19,00:30:22,"I think it depends on also, you know, if you're claustrophobic,"
00:30:22,00:30:24,"if you, you know, so many senses are going to come into play."
00:30:24,00:30:28,But they do say it's an authentic experience of burning.
00:30:28,00:30:30,And I think that sounds quite fun.
00:30:30,00:30:33,"So the idea is it's not a ride like,"
00:30:33,00:30:37,"let's say, the big one or oblivion or something like that."
00:30:37,00:30:39,It's basically like an escape room.
00:30:39,00:30:40,And there's a load of challenges.
00:30:40,00:30:43,And let's say there's us four are doing all the challenges.
00:30:43,00:30:46,"After each one, whoever does the challenge worst"
00:30:46,00:30:48,"will, in inverted commas, die."
00:30:48,00:30:51,"And then when you die, you get put into the coffin"
00:30:51,00:30:54,and they do this kind of cremation thing.
00:30:54,00:30:55,And then there's three people left.
00:30:55,00:30:57,And then whoever comes last out of those three people
00:30:57,00:30:59,then does the cremation.
00:30:59,00:31:01,So you're each kind of challenge.
00:31:01,00:31:03,You're trying not to die.
00:31:03,00:31:04,And the worst person does die.
00:31:04,00:31:06,"And then in the end, the last person,"
00:31:06,00:31:08,they actually make them die anyway
00:31:08,00:31:10,because all people die in the end.
00:31:10,00:31:10,That's the idea.
00:31:10,00:31:14,So everyone gets to do the little ride at the end.
00:31:14,00:31:17,"But yeah, it's like challenges that you have to do to get to it."
00:31:17,00:31:20,"I would love, by the way, if anyone's listening to this,"
00:31:20,00:31:21,"who's been to the cremator,"
00:31:21,00:31:24,to please let us know what it was actually like.
00:31:24,00:31:28,Because I can't find anyone really who's properly done it.
00:31:28,00:31:30,Like I went on TripAdvisor
00:31:30,00:31:33,and it says that this is part of the windows of the world
00:31:33,00:31:34,amusement park in Shenzhen.
00:31:34,00:31:36,So this is a pretty amazing place.
00:31:36,00:31:40,Where they've replicated some of the biggest landmarks in the world.
00:31:40,00:31:44,Some to sort of quite a nice big scale.
00:31:44,00:31:47,Like the Eiffel Tower is the third of the size of the Eiffel Tower.
00:31:47,00:31:49,They've got a life-size Mount Rushmore.
00:31:49,00:31:50,"They've got, you know,"
00:31:50,00:31:54,you can do anything that's a sort of landmark around the world.
00:31:54,00:31:55,They most likely have it.
00:31:55,00:32:00,And then supposedly they have this random cremator game
00:32:00,00:32:01,that you can play.
00:32:01,00:32:04,No one on TripAdvisor has mentioned it.
00:32:04,00:32:06,I can't see anyone who's been to it.
00:32:06,00:32:07,So I would love to know.
00:32:07,00:32:09,"Do you think, is it possible that they keep"
00:32:09,00:32:10,forgetting to turn off the furnace?
00:32:10,00:32:18,Thank God they don't survive to leave the one-star review.
00:32:18,00:32:20,It's funny because I'm not really worried
00:32:20,00:32:22,about the being cremated a bit.
00:32:22,00:32:23,Because I don't expect to be.
00:32:23,00:32:26,"If I am conscious for that,"
00:32:26,00:32:28,something's gone so badly wrong
00:32:28,00:32:31,"that even the brief preparation I've done at this escape room,"
00:32:31,00:32:33,I think is not going to be enough good
00:32:33,00:32:36,to see me through it with a calm mood.
00:32:36,00:32:38,That's a tricky one.
00:32:38,00:32:39,Yeah.
00:32:39,00:32:41,Do you guys have anything on cremation?
00:32:41,00:32:44,I can just say a little bit more on this particular thing.
00:32:44,00:32:44,"Yeah, let's do it."
00:32:44,00:32:45,"Yeah, sorry."
00:32:45,00:32:45,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:45,00:32:48,"So this ride escape room thing,"
00:32:48,00:32:50,"it comes from something called the Coffin Academy,"
00:32:50,00:32:52,which began in South Korea.
00:32:52,00:32:54,And this was a...
00:32:54,00:32:58,The idea was that it's trying to prepare people for death.
00:32:58,00:33:00,"And if you prepare for death,"
00:33:00,00:33:03,then it makes you able to live your life more freely
00:33:03,00:33:05,because you're not worried about something
00:33:05,00:33:06,that might happen.
00:33:06,00:33:09,And it was founded by a guy called Jung Joon.
00:33:09,00:33:11,"And Samsung in South Korea,"
00:33:11,00:33:14,they required 900 of their employees
00:33:14,00:33:16,to go to some of these sessions
00:33:16,00:33:19,so that they could learn about what might happen when you die.
00:33:19,00:33:22,"And you write your own epitaph,"
00:33:22,00:33:24,"you compose last letters to your loved ones,"
00:33:24,00:33:27,and you're placed in a coffin for 10 minutes at the end.
00:33:27,00:33:29,And that's supposed to be like this memento mori
00:33:29,00:33:31,of reminding you to live your life
00:33:31,00:33:33,because one day you might die.
00:33:33,00:33:35,That's really good.
00:33:35,00:33:36,I hope they don't post the letters
00:33:36,00:33:39,because that's a distressing experience for their families
00:33:39,00:33:42,if they accidentally mix up in the post-dream.
00:33:42,00:33:43,Yeah.
00:33:43,00:33:44,It does work though.
00:33:44,00:33:46,Thinking incessantly about death
00:33:46,00:33:48,"is actually good for you, apparently."
00:33:48,00:33:51,And I think it was about South Korea's
00:33:51,00:33:52,"soaring suicide rate, wasn't it?"
00:33:52,00:33:53,They wanted to combat
00:33:53,00:33:56,"because it's the highest suicide rate in the world, I think."
00:33:56,00:33:58,"But there have been studies that show,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,"if you think about dying for five minutes a day,"
00:34:01,00:34:02,"apparently five to 10 minutes a day,"
00:34:02,00:34:04,you will be happier.
00:34:04,00:34:08,And they did a study where they got people to write emails
00:34:08,00:34:11,or respond to emails about dying and death every day
00:34:11,00:34:13,for about 10 minutes.
00:34:13,00:34:16,"And they found that the people who had done that,"
00:34:16,00:34:19,"they had increased positive mood, better self-esteem,"
00:34:19,00:34:23,"increased intrinsic motivation, whatever that means."
00:34:23,00:34:25,I suppose they felt like they had a reason to live.
00:34:25,00:34:27,And so it does work.
00:34:27,00:34:29,And you can get apps as an app called We Croak
00:34:29,00:34:31,"that my husband has, which is very annoying"
00:34:31,00:34:33,because it reminds you five times a day
00:34:33,00:34:34,that you're going to die.
00:34:34,00:34:35,"What? Hang on, what?"
00:34:35,00:34:37,"Yeah. And it says, and it's quite annoying"
00:34:37,00:34:38,because he rarely uses his phone.
00:34:38,00:34:40,So it's always the latest message that came up
00:34:40,00:34:42,because it comes up five times a day.
00:34:42,00:34:44,"So whenever I'm walking past it and I move the phone,"
00:34:44,00:34:46,"all I see is the phrase, ""Don't forget you're going to die."""
00:34:46,00:34:48,Why does he have this?
00:34:48,00:34:50,Because of this psychological thing we were just talking about?
00:34:50,00:34:53,"Is this actually, does your husband naturally have this?"
00:34:53,00:34:55,Or do you text him this five times a day just?
00:34:55,00:34:59,I've been leaving constant threats.
00:34:59,00:35:02,"But yeah, planning your own death, people do."
00:35:02,00:35:03,People plan their own funerals.
00:35:03,00:35:05,It's becoming more and more popular
00:35:05,00:35:08,"and actually attend their own funerals now,"
00:35:08,00:35:10,which is another way of reminding yourself
00:35:10,00:35:11,you're going to die quite on the nose.
00:35:11,00:35:14,"But this is a tradition that started in Japan, apparently,"
00:35:14,00:35:16,in the 1990s.
00:35:16,00:35:21,"And they're called pre-funerals, or saizenso in Japan."
00:35:21,00:35:24,"And I think they started out in response to,"
00:35:24,00:35:25,"like, funerals are being really commercialized"
00:35:25,00:35:27,and people are being ripped off for these
00:35:27,00:35:32,just off the conveyor belt out of the catalogue funerals.
00:35:32,00:35:36,"And they thought, ""Look, we want some more personalized funerals"
00:35:36,00:35:38,and I don't want to fork out so much cash.
00:35:38,00:35:39,I don't want my poor family to be
00:35:39,00:35:41,"forking out so much cash after I die."""
00:35:41,00:35:43,And so pre-funerals have become a thing.
00:35:43,00:35:47,"And it's when people plan and then attend their own funeral,"
00:35:47,00:35:49,"say a few words, say goodbye."
00:35:49,00:35:50,It's usually older people.
00:35:50,00:35:52,It's quite rare that you get like an 18-year-old
00:35:52,00:35:54,having a pre-funeral.
00:35:54,00:35:56,And then that's nice.
00:35:56,00:35:58,Saves your family having to do it.
00:35:58,00:36:01,And I guess you get to go to your own party
00:36:01,00:36:02,at the end of the day.
00:36:02,00:36:03,That is cool.
00:36:03,00:36:03,Yeah.
00:36:03,00:36:05,"To people, I guess people must know"
00:36:05,00:36:07,that they're attending your pre-funeral
00:36:07,00:36:08,instead of your funeral.
00:36:08,00:36:09,"Yeah, I don't think you do the surprise."
00:36:09,00:36:10,Surprise!
00:36:10,00:36:11,Provide the curtain.
00:36:11,00:36:16,"Well, that'd be great use of your escape room coffin."
00:36:16,00:36:18,You'd finally get to use it
00:36:18,00:36:21,instead of it just being a thing for post-death.
00:36:21,00:36:22,Good point.
00:36:22,00:36:23,I do think it's a good idea.
00:36:23,00:36:26,"But, and I think it's a good idea from your perspective"
00:36:26,00:36:28,"as the person who's having the pre-funeral,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,if you want to do all the mindfulness
00:36:30,00:36:31,and remind yourself of your potential
00:36:31,00:36:33,and experience life properly.
00:36:33,00:36:34,But I don't think it's a good experience
00:36:34,00:36:35,for people who want to know
00:36:35,00:36:36,what other people would say about them.
00:36:36,00:36:37,No.
00:36:37,00:36:39,"Because everyone knows that you're not really,"
00:36:39,00:36:41,"you're in the front row, you're sitting there."
00:36:41,00:36:42,So they'll say nice things.
00:36:42,00:36:43,But you'll think...
00:36:43,00:36:45,"Yeah, but in fairness, Andy,"
00:36:45,00:36:47,no people don't go to funerals in general
00:36:47,00:36:49,"and say, ""Oh, he was a complete idiot."""
00:36:49,00:36:53,Thank God I can let loose now that he's not
00:36:53,00:36:54,quite this evil.
00:36:54,00:36:56,"If he was here, I wouldn't say this."
00:36:56,00:36:57,But what an asshole.
00:36:57,00:37:03,"It's probably pretty similar before and after,"
00:37:03,00:37:05,"and they're both lies, I think, is what we're saying."
00:37:05,00:37:09,"I've definitely read, and this..."
00:37:09,00:37:10,I might have said this before.
00:37:10,00:37:12,I've definitely read a funeral director say
00:37:12,00:37:16,that it's really common when bodies are cremated
00:37:16,00:37:18,that you end up with metal implements
00:37:18,00:37:20,that have been left in their body during surgery.
00:37:20,00:37:22,And I've always been so skeptical
00:37:22,00:37:24,about the fact that surgeons are so careless.
00:37:24,00:37:25,They're just dropping things
00:37:25,00:37:26,"on our bodies left, right, and centre."
00:37:26,00:37:28,"But apparently, that's quite a thing."
00:37:28,00:37:30,"You pop in, you get a scalpel and a knife pair of scissors."
00:37:30,00:37:31,Really?
00:37:31,00:37:33,"Gossipiboma, it's called, isn't it?"
00:37:33,00:37:34,Supposedly.
00:37:34,00:37:35,A what?
00:37:35,00:37:37,It's called gossipiboma.
00:37:37,00:37:37,The...
00:37:37,00:37:37,Sorry?
00:37:37,00:37:40,"If someone leaves stuff in your body during surgery,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,that's the technical word for it.
00:37:42,00:37:44,"And it comes from gossipimus,"
00:37:44,00:37:47,which means cloth or something.
00:37:47,00:37:48,Okay.
00:37:48,00:37:49,Which word do you think is rarer?
00:37:49,00:37:51,Gossipiboma or jugum?
00:37:51,00:37:54,I'd never heard of jugum before today.
00:37:54,00:37:55,I must admit.
00:37:55,00:37:56,I think you might be right.
00:37:56,00:38:00,You know when you're being cremated?
00:38:00,00:38:01,Yeah.
00:38:01,00:38:04,And you go through the curtains?
00:38:04,00:38:04,Yeah.
00:38:04,00:38:05,There's a lot of French politicians.
00:38:05,00:38:08,Nightmare.
00:38:08,00:38:10,What's the next thing that happens?
00:38:10,00:38:11,Fire.
00:38:11,00:38:12,Right.
00:38:12,00:38:12,"Well, I didn't..."
00:38:12,00:38:13,Not necessarily.
00:38:13,00:38:14,"Yeah, I didn't think there was fire."
00:38:14,00:38:16,I thought it was deep heat.
00:38:16,00:38:16,Not deep heat.
00:38:16,00:38:17,"No, that's fine."
00:38:17,00:38:20,They love you with that thumb.
00:38:20,00:38:21,"Yeah, it's just a little bomb."
00:38:21,00:38:23,There's just a muscular masseur
00:38:23,00:38:24,on the other side of the curtain view.
00:38:24,00:38:26,I told you it was just a sprain.
00:38:26,00:38:27,I don't know what it fusses about.
00:38:27,00:38:29,What are you all about?
00:38:29,00:38:30,Deep heat.
00:38:30,00:38:32,"What, Dan, what is..."
00:38:32,00:38:34,"I thought it was an intensive heat,"
00:38:34,00:38:37,which instead of a physical fire...
00:38:37,00:38:41,It turns out that you don't automatically
00:38:41,00:38:42,immediately go into the furnace.
00:38:42,00:38:45,"Just to be clear, it is not deep heat,"
00:38:45,00:38:47,whatever Dan means.
00:38:47,00:38:47,It's flame.
00:38:47,00:38:48,"Oh, it is flame."
00:38:48,00:38:49,"Gas, power flame."
00:38:49,00:38:49,"Yeah, yeah."
00:38:49,00:38:52,"But legally, they have 72 hours"
00:38:52,00:38:54,before they have to cremate you.
00:38:54,00:38:55,What does that mean?
00:38:55,00:38:57,So do they do fun stuff with your body
00:38:57,00:38:58,in that three days?
00:38:58,00:39:01,"No, they're not allowed to interfere."
00:39:01,00:39:03,"But they aim to do it on the same day,"
00:39:03,00:39:05,but sometimes it's busy
00:39:05,00:39:07,and they don't get around to cremating you.
00:39:07,00:39:10,I suppose they might want to do a few people at once.
00:39:10,00:39:12,I don't think they're allowed to.
00:39:12,00:39:13,"No, you're not."
00:39:13,00:39:13,I don't think...
00:39:13,00:39:16,"Well, I think because they're getting your remains"
00:39:16,00:39:17,for your family.
00:39:17,00:39:21,"I didn't mean just put everyone in the same box,"
00:39:21,00:39:24,but I thought maybe just not turn the fire on
00:39:24,00:39:25,"and then turn it off again,"
00:39:25,00:39:26,"and then turn it on, then turn it off again."
00:39:26,00:39:26,Maybe.
00:39:26,00:39:28,It's incredibly energy intensive.
00:39:28,00:39:32,"I mean, it uses so much energy."
00:39:32,00:39:33,"And in fact, there's a..."
00:39:33,00:39:34,You guys have heard of Redditch?
00:39:34,00:39:35,The town.
00:39:35,00:39:36,The place.
00:39:36,00:39:37,"Yeah, the town."
00:39:37,00:39:38,It's the Birmingham.
00:39:38,00:39:41,"Yeah, relatively large cultivation."
00:39:41,00:39:44,"Yeah, well, there's a swimming pool in Redditch"
00:39:44,00:39:48,which is heated by the local crematorium's spare heat.
00:39:48,00:39:49,I love that.
00:39:49,00:39:51,They voted for it in 2013.
00:39:51,00:39:52,And the council voted for it.
00:39:52,00:39:54,They won an award for it from some green group.
00:39:54,00:39:56,There were lots of protests at the time.
00:39:56,00:39:56,"Oh, really?"
00:39:56,00:39:58,"And ironically, whenever I use deep heat,"
00:39:58,00:40:01,"because I've seemed to be allergic to capsaicin,"
00:40:01,00:40:02,I get a Redditch.
00:40:02,00:40:08,"That proves something, doesn't it?"
00:40:08,00:40:10,It's hard to tell what.
00:40:10,00:40:12,It shows that the whole universe is connected in some way.
00:40:19,00:40:22,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:40:22,00:40:24,and that is James.
00:40:24,00:40:29,"Okay, my fact this week is that the actor, Peter O'Toole,"
00:40:29,00:40:32,once smuggled a pair of earrings out of grease
00:40:32,00:40:34,by hiding them in his foreskin.
00:40:34,00:40:40,"And I must say, I came up with this fact"
00:40:40,00:40:42,"before we talked about all the, you know,"
00:40:42,00:40:44,curtain rings and penises and stuff.
00:40:44,00:40:46,That's just a coincidence that those two things
00:40:46,00:40:48,came up in the same show.
00:40:48,00:40:48,Yeah.
00:40:49,00:40:51,I completely forgot that I had that fact
00:40:51,00:40:53,in relation to this fact.
00:40:53,00:40:54,"What an extraordinary thing,"
00:40:54,00:40:56,an outer and inner ring in one show.
00:40:56,00:40:59,What an object to smuggle under your foreskin?
00:40:59,00:41:00,A pair of earrings.
00:41:00,00:41:01,"Traditionally, quite sharp."
00:41:01,00:41:04,"Well, unless they were they clip on?"
00:41:04,00:41:05,I think that would actually be more painful.
00:41:05,00:41:06,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:06,00:41:08,I think not.
00:41:08,00:41:09,"I think because these were ancient,"
00:41:09,00:41:11,"so I think before the invention of clip on,"
00:41:11,00:41:13,"not that I know when clip on's were invented,"
00:41:13,00:41:15,but I assume they're more modern.
00:41:15,00:41:18,The Etruscans didn't have clip on their rings.
00:41:18,00:41:20,We'd have to rethink a lot of our assumptions.
00:41:20,00:41:21,Seems unlikely.
00:41:21,00:41:24,So we are currently just coming to the end
00:41:24,00:41:26,"of the T series of QI,"
00:41:26,00:41:28,and we're doing a section on tools.
00:41:28,00:41:30,"And I thought when I was looking at the scripts,"
00:41:30,00:41:31,I would flesh one of them out
00:41:31,00:41:33,with an anecdote about Peter O'Toole.
00:41:33,00:41:35,So I thought if I'd find any anecdotes about him.
00:41:35,00:41:38,"And I found this one in the telegraph,"
00:41:38,00:41:42,and then it was also in a biography of him
00:41:42,00:41:44,by Nicholas Wapshot.
00:41:45,00:41:47,And he said that while Peter O'Toole
00:41:47,00:41:50,"was filming Lawrence of Arabia,"
00:41:50,00:41:53,he developed a love of exotic antiquities.
00:41:53,00:41:56,And so knowing that he wasn't allowed
00:41:56,00:41:58,"to take these things out of Greece legally,"
00:41:58,00:42:00,"he thought, ""Where can I hide them?"""
00:42:00,00:42:02,And no one would think of looking.
00:42:02,00:42:05,"And he said, ""Nicholas Wapshot says"
00:42:05,00:42:06,it was an act of daring
00:42:06,00:42:09,"which caused him pain for weeks afterwards."""
00:42:09,00:42:10,Wow.
00:42:10,00:42:11,"Okay, so this wasn't a classic."
00:42:11,00:42:13,This wasn't like how we got the Elgin marbles here.
00:42:13,00:42:18,This is a very unique smuggling use.
00:42:18,00:42:18,They were actually-
00:42:18,00:42:20,"That's a big brag, isn't it?"
00:42:20,00:42:23,"If you say, ""Oh, I smuggled the Elgin marbles out of mine."""
00:42:23,00:42:25,They were smuggled in an elephant's foreskin
00:42:25,00:42:28,all the way through the roads of Cornwall.
00:42:28,00:42:34,Do we know if he weaved them through
00:42:34,00:42:36,or just tucked them under?
00:42:36,00:42:38,"I don't know for certain,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,but it can only be tucked under.
00:42:40,00:42:41,It could be tucked under.
00:42:41,00:42:42,He didn't pierce his voice.
00:42:42,00:42:43,How do we weave them through?
00:42:43,00:42:44,"No, if he pierced his voice."
00:42:44,00:42:45,You would not do that.
00:42:45,00:42:47,The only other way I can think of doing it
00:42:47,00:42:50,is you kind of sellotape them to your penis
00:42:50,00:42:52,and wait for the foreskin to grow over them
00:42:52,00:42:53,"over many, many years."
00:42:53,00:42:56,That's the only other positive.
00:42:56,00:42:57,"Come on, game with those."
00:42:57,00:43:01,"Well, he was out there filming it for two years."
00:43:01,00:43:02,"Maybe the filming only took a month,"
00:43:02,00:43:05,but he had to wait the remaining year and three quarters
00:43:05,00:43:06,for the skin to grow.
00:43:06,00:43:09,There is scant more information about this
00:43:09,00:43:10,that I managed to find.
00:43:10,00:43:11,"I don't know if you guys did,"
00:43:11,00:43:14,but it's just an anecdote in his anecdote filled life.
00:43:14,00:43:16,"Yes, I do."
00:43:16,00:43:18,"Actually, I do have a related anecdote"
00:43:18,00:43:19,just before we get into Petro Tool.
00:43:19,00:43:22,I do on this subject have a similar story.
00:43:22,00:43:25,"A friend of mine, I don't know if I should say this,"
00:43:25,00:43:27,"but in the dressing room before each show,"
00:43:27,00:43:29,one of his colleagues would play a game
00:43:29,00:43:32,"with all of them called Guess What's Under the Foreskin,"
00:43:32,00:43:35,"where he would hide something beneath his foreskin,"
00:43:35,00:43:36,"show everyone the foreskin,"
00:43:36,00:43:39,and the rest of the cast would have to guess what it was.
00:43:40,00:43:42,"Okay, and so the idea is you can see the outline."
00:43:42,00:43:44,"So if it was like a mountain bike,"
00:43:44,00:43:47,you'd be able to tell the shape of the wheels and stuff.
00:43:47,00:43:50,That's a fucked up Christmas.
00:43:50,00:43:53,That's how your presents are wrapped.
00:43:53,00:43:58,So I asked for the kind of things that he said.
00:43:58,00:44:00,"He said once it was an old-fashioned penny,"
00:44:00,00:44:02,once it was seven jelly beans.
00:44:02,00:44:06,How are you supposed to identify an old-fashioned penny?
00:44:06,00:44:09,You can't read the date inscribed on a penny
00:44:09,00:44:11,through a foreskin. That's too much to ask.
00:44:11,00:44:13,You can tell which monarch is depicted.
00:44:13,00:44:18,That is a hell of a brass rubbing to work that out.
00:44:18,00:44:22,He was extremely eccentric.
00:44:22,00:44:25,"I mean, there are so many stories about him."
00:44:25,00:44:28,"So for example, his wife got him some ping-pong balls"
00:44:28,00:44:30,to throw at the TV screen when he didn't like it.
00:44:30,00:44:31,"That doesn't sound very rock and roll,"
00:44:31,00:44:33,but apparently she only did this
00:44:33,00:44:36,because he broke their previous TV set
00:44:36,00:44:38,by throwing a smaller TV through it.
00:44:39,00:44:42,Right. That's amazing.
00:44:42,00:44:43,Isn't that rock and roll?
00:44:43,00:44:44,That's impressive.
00:44:44,00:44:47,That's like one of those kids games
00:44:47,00:44:50,where you have to fit the appropriate shape into itself.
00:44:50,00:44:52,And he's done it right.
00:44:52,00:44:54,"We should say really quickly,"
00:44:54,00:44:57,"because a lot of people will be a lot younger,"
00:44:57,00:44:58,"might not have even heard of Peter at all,"
00:44:58,00:45:00,but this guy was a ginormous actor
00:45:00,00:45:03,in the day of old Hollywood.
00:45:03,00:45:06,So Lawrence of Arabia probably has seminal role.
00:45:06,00:45:09,"The big epic, some three hours and a bit long,"
00:45:09,00:45:11,he played the role of Lawrence.
00:45:11,00:45:14,And he was part of that crew of Hollywood
00:45:14,00:45:16,"that were the sort of hellraisers,"
00:45:16,00:45:19,these people that just didn't care about what they were doing.
00:45:19,00:45:24,And he was nominated eight times for best actor in the Oscars.
00:45:24,00:45:27,So he was a huge player.
00:45:27,00:45:29,"I never won an acting Oscar, did he?"
00:45:29,00:45:32,"And that's, I think, the record with Glenn Close,"
00:45:32,00:45:35,"both him and Glenn Close, eight times nominated no wins."
00:45:35,00:45:36,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:45:36,00:45:38,"And at least Glenn Close can say, ""Oh, so close."""
00:45:38,00:45:40,He doesn't even have that.
00:45:40,00:45:43,"Yeah, he was quite pissed off about that, I think."
00:45:43,00:45:48,"In fact, he was offered an honorary Oscar in 2003,"
00:45:48,00:45:51,and that was when he'd had seven nominations for best actor.
00:45:51,00:45:52,And he didn't want to take it.
00:45:52,00:45:54,"He said, ""I'd like to defer that for at least 10 years"
00:45:54,00:45:57,"'cause I might yet win the lovely bugger outright,"" he said."
00:45:57,00:46:00,And the only reason he did go and accept the honorary Oscar
00:46:00,00:46:02,was 'cause his daughter wanted a jaunt in LA.
00:46:02,00:46:03,So he went and did it.
00:46:03,00:46:06,And then he got nominated an eighth time in 2007.
00:46:06,00:46:07,Didn't win that either. - Didn't win it.
00:46:07,00:46:09,- Poor guy. - Hmm.
00:46:09,00:46:11,"- There are worse fates, but... - There are."
00:46:11,00:46:17,"He was friends with Samuel Beckett, who we mentioned before."
00:46:17,00:46:20,"Yeah, there's a story, it's not much of a story, really,"
00:46:20,00:46:24,that he kind of had a big night out with Samuel Beckett and Soho.
00:46:24,00:46:28,"I'm sitting in the hallway drinking whiskey until the early hours,"
00:46:28,00:46:30,getting the policemen involved and having drinks with them.
00:46:31,00:46:36,"His second Oscar nomination was for Beckett, the movie Beckett,"
00:46:36,00:46:41,"in which he played Henry II, so that was about Thomas Beckett."
00:46:41,00:46:43,"So he was friends with Samuel Beckett,"
00:46:43,00:46:45,"he was nominated for the movie Beckett,"
00:46:45,00:46:49,and he was born on Beckett Street in Leeds.
00:46:49,00:46:50,- Wow. - Wow.
00:46:50,00:46:52,- Amazing. - Very cool.
00:46:52,00:46:56,"He had lots, as I suppose everyone has,"
00:46:56,00:46:58,"who's been a jobbing actor for ages,"
00:46:58,00:47:00,had lots of other jobs to actually pay the bills.
00:47:00,00:47:04,"But he worked, I think, quite a good expression of his personality"
00:47:04,00:47:06,"was the fact that he worked as a steeplejack,"
00:47:06,00:47:08,"and he worked as a demolition man,"
00:47:08,00:47:12,"and this was in his early twenties, I think, when he was in Leeds."
00:47:12,00:47:13,And he loved it.
00:47:13,00:47:16,"He said, ""Blowing things up and knocking things down"
00:47:16,00:47:17,"""with a bloody great hammer."
00:47:17,00:47:20,"""Nobody gave a flying shit for health and safety in those days."
00:47:20,00:47:21,"""It was glorious."""
00:47:21,00:47:22,And he loved that.
00:47:22,00:47:25,"And I think he also loved being in the Navy, didn't he?"
00:47:25,00:47:27,"- Yes. - Sorry, what were you gonna say?"
00:47:27,00:47:28,A steeplejack.
00:47:28,00:47:30,"That's somebody who climbs up very tall buildings,"
00:47:30,00:47:32,"isn't it, a steeplejack?"
00:47:32,00:47:34,- Yeah. - What do they do when they're up there?
00:47:34,00:47:35,I thought they kind of fixed them.
00:47:35,00:47:38,"Although, this implies that he's knocking it down,"
00:47:38,00:47:39,so it sounds like he's doing it wrong.
00:47:39,00:47:43,"- Yeah, yeah. - It's one of those old jobs."
00:47:43,00:47:45,"- Yeah, oldy jobs, yeah. - Yeah."
00:47:45,00:47:46,The robots can do it now.
00:47:46,00:47:50,Just an irrelevant thing about climbing up tall buildings.
00:47:50,00:47:52,"I learned the word ""flaunching"" the other day."
00:47:52,00:47:53,"- Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah."
00:47:53,00:47:56,"- ""Flaunching."" - Is it ""launching"" yourself off a flock?"
00:47:56,00:47:58,(laughing)
00:47:58,00:48:01,"It's, this is very, it's actually extremely boring,"
00:48:01,00:48:03,"but you know the chimney pot at the top of a,"
00:48:03,00:48:04,"there's a chimney stack,"
00:48:04,00:48:06,and then there's a tiny bit right at the top
00:48:06,00:48:07,with the round chimney pot.
00:48:07,00:48:08,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:48:08,00:48:10,The little layer of cement mortar
00:48:10,00:48:13,"between the stack and the pot is called the ""flaunching."""
00:48:13,00:48:14,- Okay. - Right.
00:48:14,00:48:17,"- Quite a niche thing to have a word for, really."
00:48:17,00:48:19,"- I know, but if you have a roof around,"
00:48:19,00:48:21,"you can knock them dead by saying,"
00:48:21,00:48:23,"""Have you considered the ""flaunching?"""
00:48:23,00:48:25,(laughing)
00:48:25,00:48:26,"- Is it maybe a problem with the ""flaunching?"""
00:48:26,00:48:29,- That was like when I learned that brickwork
00:48:29,00:48:31,had to be pointed.
00:48:31,00:48:32,"I still don't know what it means,"
00:48:32,00:48:34,"but I used to whenever a builder came around,"
00:48:34,00:48:36,"I was like, ""Oh, I think these bricks need to be pointed."""
00:48:36,00:48:38,"- Mm, yeah, yeah."
00:48:38,00:48:41,"- Wow, God, that is a useful word."
00:48:41,00:48:42,Like.
00:48:42,00:48:43,"- Anyway, what are we learning today?"
00:48:43,00:48:45,"We've learned ""Jugum, Flaunching,"""
00:48:45,00:48:47,and what was the curtains one?
00:48:47,00:48:48,- It's a lambroquin.
00:48:48,00:48:50,- Lambroquin. - Wow.
00:48:50,00:48:53,- Like a harlequin who's drunk on lambrini.
00:48:53,00:48:54,That's how you remember it.
00:48:54,00:48:55,- Flaunching.
00:48:55,00:48:57,"- First, there's a problem with my ""flaunching,"""
00:48:57,00:48:58,then the lambroquins fall over.
00:48:58,00:49:02,"I tell you, if something happens to my ""Jugum"" next,"
00:49:02,00:49:03,that's gonna be the full set.
00:49:03,00:49:05,(laughing)
00:49:05,00:49:07,- When they were delivering that bowl of whiskey
00:49:07,00:49:09,"to that New Zealand guy,"
00:49:09,00:49:13,"was the ""flaunching"" an issue in getting the bottle down?"
00:49:13,00:49:15,- Great question.
00:49:15,00:49:18,"- I don't think the ""flaunching"" usually gets in the way,"
00:49:18,00:49:20,"sounds like, unless it's very badly done."
00:49:20,00:49:21,- Okay.
00:49:21,00:49:23,"- And you don't want bad ""flaunching"" on a house,"
00:49:23,00:49:25,that'll ruin the valley.
00:49:25,00:49:25,- No.
00:49:25,00:49:26,(laughing)
00:49:26,00:49:27,"- Yes, I'm so sorry."
00:49:27,00:49:28,- Peter O'Toole?
00:49:28,00:49:30,- We were talking about Peter O'Toole.
00:49:30,00:49:31,I'm sorry for distracting you.
00:49:31,00:49:35,"- In 1980, he did Macbeth, the old Vic,"
00:49:35,00:49:38,and it was absolutely hammered.
00:49:38,00:49:39,The critics hated it.
00:49:39,00:49:42,They said he was as subtle as a battering ram.
00:49:42,00:49:47,"The Observer said there are chances that he likes to play,"
00:49:47,00:49:48,but his performance suggests
00:49:48,00:49:51,that he is taking some kind of personal revenge on it.
00:49:52,00:49:54,"So he's like, ""Really, really, really hated."""
00:49:54,00:49:56,"But the people loved it,"
00:49:56,00:49:58,"because it was Peter O'Toole, he's very famous."
00:49:58,00:50:01,It was almost kind of fun to go and watch something
00:50:01,00:50:03,"that was so bad, it was good kind of thing."
00:50:03,00:50:05,"But it could have been so much better,"
00:50:05,00:50:08,"because originally he was the director,"
00:50:08,00:50:12,and he was basically allowed to do what he wanted.
00:50:12,00:50:16,And so he decided it was going to be an inflatable Macbeth.
00:50:16,00:50:20,And he had a friend who was working for a company
00:50:20,00:50:22,"called Labuta Limited,"
00:50:22,00:50:24,which was making inflatables
00:50:24,00:50:26,that you could keep in the boot of your car.
00:50:26,00:50:30,And he decided that he was going to commission this person
00:50:30,00:50:33,"to do all of the scenery in Macbeth,"
00:50:33,00:50:36,and it was going to be a massive inflatable Macbeth.
00:50:36,00:50:38,"And in the first time they tried to do the rehearsals,"
00:50:38,00:50:40,"someone said that,"
00:50:40,00:50:43,"""The curtain rose to reveal a dimly-lit collection"
00:50:43,00:50:46,"of black plastic fallacies swaying in the wind."""
00:50:46,00:50:47,- Nice.
00:50:47,00:50:50,"- And on top of that, no one could hear"
00:50:50,00:50:50,"what anyone was saying,"
00:50:50,00:50:52,because these were inflatables
00:50:52,00:50:53,that had to be constantly blown up.
00:50:53,00:50:55,So it was just like the air compression
00:50:55,00:50:57,was just like the whole time.
00:50:57,00:50:59,No one could hear anything that they were saying.
00:50:59,00:51:01,"And so in the end, he scrapped the inflatables,"
00:51:01,00:51:04,"but it was still a terrible, terrible play."
00:51:04,00:51:08,"- Peter, it's all sort of started acting by mistake."
00:51:08,00:51:12,"- He was steeple-jacking one day, wasn't he?"
00:51:12,00:51:14,And there was accidentally an audience
00:51:14,00:51:17,at the top of the flaunching he was climbing up towards.
00:51:17,00:51:19,"- Yes, it flaunched his career, didn't it?"
00:51:20,00:51:22,(laughing)
00:51:22,00:51:26,"- No, it wasn't that."
00:51:26,00:51:28,"He was doing, he was in Leeds,"
00:51:28,00:51:29,he was doing a poetry course.
00:51:29,00:51:31,He actually always wanted to do something in poetry.
00:51:31,00:51:34,He loved literature and poetry.
00:51:34,00:51:36,"He was doing a poetry course in Leeds,"
00:51:36,00:51:37,and there was a professional production
00:51:37,00:51:39,"of ""Fathers and Sons"" going on down the road,"
00:51:39,00:51:42,and the lead actor in that production
00:51:42,00:51:45,fell down some stairs and broke some bones.
00:51:45,00:51:47,"And in fact, O'Toole remembered,"
00:51:47,00:51:49,his name was Gordon Luck.
00:51:49,00:51:52,"So, ouch, doubly painful for him."
00:51:52,00:51:53,"Parole Gordon, Gordon."
00:51:53,00:51:54,- It suffered some bad luck.
00:51:54,00:51:56,"- Gordon, unlucky."
00:51:56,00:51:58,Fell down some stairs.
00:51:58,00:52:00,And they'd seen Peter O'Toole
00:52:00,00:52:02,do some sort of little skit for fun
00:52:02,00:52:04,on an amateur stage in the area the year before.
00:52:04,00:52:06,"So they said, ""Look, do you want to play the lead"
00:52:06,00:52:08,"in ""Fathers and Sons?"""
00:52:08,00:52:09,"And he said, ""Yes."""
00:52:09,00:52:10,And he played it for two weeks.
00:52:10,00:52:10,"He said, ""I played it for two weeks,"
00:52:10,00:52:13,"and then I got the bug, and there was no going back."""
00:52:13,00:52:15,- What's interesting is that it is bad luck
00:52:15,00:52:18,"to say ""Gord Luck"" in the theatre, isn't it?"
00:52:18,00:52:19,You're not supposed to say that.
00:52:19,00:52:20,"You're supposed to say ""Break a leg."""
00:52:20,00:52:21,"- Oh my God, of course."
00:52:21,00:52:23,He should have changed.
00:52:23,00:52:24,What could you change your name to
00:52:24,00:52:25,"that sounds like ""Break a leg."""
00:52:25,00:52:26,"Like, but..."
00:52:26,00:52:27,"- If you change your name to Macbeth,"
00:52:27,00:52:29,no one will ever call you for anything
00:52:29,00:52:30,in the theatre at all.
00:52:30,00:52:32,- Why am I not booking any gigs?
00:52:32,00:52:38,"- He once took a double bed on the northern line,"
00:52:38,00:52:39,Peter O'Toole.
00:52:39,00:52:40,- Yeah.
00:52:40,00:52:41,- Where did he take it?
00:52:41,00:52:41,- Okay.
00:52:41,00:52:43,"- To another, to a different stop on the northern line."
00:52:43,00:52:44,- Why?
00:52:44,00:52:45,- Why?
00:52:45,00:52:47,"- Did he just not, he'd thought"
00:52:47,00:52:49,the seats were uncomfortable.
00:52:49,00:52:51,"- No, he had to move the bed from one place to another."
00:52:51,00:52:53,It was in 1954 and it was an anecdote
00:52:53,00:52:54,in his autobiography.
00:52:54,00:52:56,- I think the interesting part about the anecdote
00:52:56,00:52:57,"is he didn't pay, right?"
00:52:57,00:52:59,And he sneaked it on and sneaked it off
00:52:59,00:53:02,"and he managed to sneak it through the turnstiles,"
00:53:02,00:53:04,a double bed without anyone noticing.
00:53:04,00:53:06,- I think there were no turnstiles at the time.
00:53:06,00:53:07,"He says at the start of the earlier,"
00:53:07,00:53:10,"""This is before the bad days of turnstiles."""
00:53:10,00:53:12,"But still, it's very impressive."
00:53:12,00:53:14,"- Yeah, I mean, how big was his foreskin?"
00:53:15,00:53:16,(laughing)
00:53:16,00:53:19,- It's extraordinary.
00:53:19,00:53:26,"- Okay, that's it."
00:53:26,00:53:27,That is all of our facts.
00:53:27,00:53:28,Thank you so much for listening.
