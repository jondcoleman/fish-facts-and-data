00:00:11,00:00:18,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing"""
00:00:18,00:00:21,is a Fish A Weekly Podcast this week coming to you
00:00:21,00:00:24,from Up the Creek in Greenwich London!
00:00:24,00:00:27,[CHEERING]
00:00:27,00:00:29,[CHEERING]
00:00:29,00:00:39,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anaczynski,"
00:00:39,00:00:41,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:41,00:00:44,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones."
00:00:44,00:00:46,"But this time, with our four favorite Christmas"
00:00:46,00:00:48,"facts, because it's our Christmas special."
00:00:48,00:00:51,And we're up again.
00:00:51,00:00:55,"And in no particular order, here we go, starting with my facts."
00:00:55,00:00:58,"My fact this week is that, as well as getting a visit"
00:00:58,00:01:01,"from Santa Claus at Christmas, Icelanders also get a visit"
00:01:01,00:01:07,"from the spoon liquor, the door snapper, and the sausage"
00:01:07,00:01:08,swiper.
00:01:08,00:01:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:10,00:01:11,Yeah.
00:01:11,00:01:14,"So these-- they do have Santa there, but they also have--"
00:01:14,00:01:17,"and this is what Wikipedia says they're called, your lads."
00:01:17,00:01:18,They're like lads.
00:01:18,00:01:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:24,00:01:25,"And they-- I think the reason Wikipedia calls them that is,"
00:01:25,00:01:27,because that's what they are called.
00:01:27,00:01:28,Yeah.
00:01:28,00:01:28,"Oh, OK."
00:01:28,00:01:29,"OK, cool."
00:01:29,00:01:31,Yeah.
00:01:31,00:01:34,"I mean, so I know you've fallen for fake Wikipedia facts a lot"
00:01:34,00:01:35,in the past.
00:01:35,00:01:36,But this is real.
00:01:36,00:01:38,I just thought that was called Casualingo.
00:01:38,00:01:40,"I was like, yeah, I'm cool with you, Wiki."
00:01:40,00:01:42,"So yeah, they're called the your lads."
00:01:42,00:01:44,And there's 13 of them in total.
00:01:44,00:01:45,Spoon liquor is one.
00:01:45,00:01:47,He licks bowls.
00:01:47,00:01:48,"No, he licks spoons."
00:01:48,00:01:49,But there is a bowl liquor.
00:01:49,00:01:51,"There is actually a bowl liquor, yeah."
00:01:51,00:01:53,I misread my note there.
00:01:53,00:01:57,And then cover it up like it was a joke.
00:01:57,00:02:00,There's the sausage swiper who licks spoons.
00:02:00,00:02:02,And then there--
00:02:02,00:02:06,"So does a sausage swiper-- he swipes sausages, does he?"
00:02:06,00:02:08,"Yeah, so he hides in the rafters of your house."
00:02:08,00:02:11,"And while he goes and check for your spoons,"
00:02:11,00:02:12,so someone's licked the spoons.
00:02:12,00:02:15,You quickly head into the kitchen.
00:02:15,00:02:16,He lowers himself.
00:02:16,00:02:19,"I think Tom Cruise style from ""Mission Impossible"""
00:02:19,00:02:23,gets your sausages and then gets pulled back up to the roof.
00:02:23,00:02:25,"And then you come back in and go, ah, the spoons now,"
00:02:25,00:02:27,"the sausages, what's going on?"
00:02:27,00:02:28,We've had three.
00:02:28,00:02:30,What are the other 10 light?
00:02:30,00:02:32,There's a guy who--
00:02:32,00:02:34,he harasses sheep.
00:02:34,00:02:35,No.
00:02:35,00:02:37,Yeah.
00:02:37,00:02:40,"What's his-- they all have very expressive names, don't they?"
00:02:40,00:02:44,"Yeah, his one's not so sheepcoatclod is his name."
00:02:44,00:02:44,Yeah.
00:02:44,00:02:46,There's meat hook.
00:02:46,00:02:48,"They're all thieves, basically, aren't they?"
00:02:48,00:02:48,Yeah.
00:02:48,00:02:51,"Just in Iceland, you just have to accept that people"
00:02:51,00:02:53,will come and steal all your stuff.
00:02:53,00:02:55,There's pot scraper.
00:02:55,00:02:58,The doorway sniffer is not someone who likes doorways.
00:02:58,00:03:00,It's just someone who's smelling beyond the doorway
00:03:00,00:03:02,to try and steal your food later.
00:03:02,00:03:03,But they used to be way more of them.
00:03:03,00:03:05,So they used to be more than 80-year-olds.
00:03:05,00:03:05,Whoa.
00:03:05,00:03:07,Which is a lot to descend upon you.
00:03:07,00:03:10,"And there are ones that were, you know,"
00:03:10,00:03:15,"kiboshed about mid-century, were falda fakeir, which"
00:03:15,00:03:18,is skirt sweeper.
00:03:18,00:03:21,"He got the shop and literally pungo, which"
00:03:21,00:03:24,are small testicles.
00:03:24,00:03:26,What did he do?
00:03:26,00:03:28,He just went around flattering people.
00:03:28,00:03:32,Those are bigger than mine.
00:03:32,00:03:38,"I've got small ones, so it's, yeah."
00:03:38,00:03:40,So do these guys bring you anything?
00:03:40,00:03:41,They just take things away.
00:03:41,00:03:43,"They take things-- well, they used to take things away."
00:03:43,00:03:47,"And back in the day, in 1746, the stories"
00:03:47,00:03:48,became so scary that they actually
00:03:48,00:03:49,"banned them from telling them to children,"
00:03:49,00:03:53,because they brought them into such a sort of Stephen King-esque
00:03:53,00:03:56,territory of fear that they said this is too much.
00:03:56,00:03:57,"It was the Danish, wasn't it, who did that?"
00:03:57,00:04:01,"And not only that, they banned using any stories"
00:04:01,00:04:02,to scare children.
00:04:02,00:04:03,Yeah.
00:04:03,00:04:04,And it was because of these guys.
00:04:04,00:04:04,Really?
00:04:04,00:04:05,It wasn't only because of them.
00:04:05,00:04:08,So have you heard of Iceland's famous Christmas child
00:04:08,00:04:15,"eating cat, who prowls around the country, eating children?"
00:04:15,00:04:19,"Oh, Christmas day."
00:04:19,00:04:21,"And the terrible thing is, so you know, if you're naughty or nice,"
00:04:21,00:04:24,you'll get presents or you get a lump of coal.
00:04:24,00:04:28,The child has no control over whether it's eaten or not.
00:04:28,00:04:30,The only thing that controls whether the child is eaten or not
00:04:30,00:04:33,is whether the child got any new clothes for Christmas
00:04:33,00:04:34,from his parents.
00:04:34,00:04:36,"And if your parents didn't give you some socks,"
00:04:36,00:04:38,you're going to be eaten.
00:04:38,00:04:40,"There is a slight thing with that with,"
00:04:40,00:04:42,"if you've done all of your chores by Christmas day,"
00:04:42,00:04:44,then they're supposed to give you some clothes.
00:04:44,00:04:46,But they could not.
00:04:46,00:04:50,"I just, I'm saying, it really would be a pretty harsh bit"
00:04:50,00:04:53,"of parenting, isn't it?"
00:04:53,00:04:54,Just think it-- yeah.
00:04:54,00:04:56,"It's insult to injury, isn't it?"
00:04:56,00:04:58,"A, you're not getting a new t-shirt and B,"
00:04:58,00:05:00,you're about to be eaten by a giant cat.
00:05:00,00:05:01,"Yeah, it was a big cat, though, isn't it?"
00:05:01,00:05:03,It was like the size of a house.
00:05:03,00:05:05,"And it belonged to a troll, right?"
00:05:05,00:05:06,So it was like--
00:05:06,00:05:06,Katie Hopkins.
00:05:06,00:05:08,"This is all still, I say."
00:05:08,00:05:15,"Satire, we don't do that, Dave's come on."
00:05:15,00:05:18,We welcome all people in our pockets.
00:05:18,00:05:19,"She-- no, there's no--"
00:05:19,00:05:22,We honestly do not.
00:05:22,00:05:25,She is not invited to anything that would--
00:05:25,00:05:28,"I'd like to publicly state, Katie Hopkins."
00:05:28,00:05:28,Fuck you.
00:05:28,00:05:29,That's a--
00:05:29,00:05:33,[APPLAUSE]
00:05:33,00:05:34,Was that Satire or was that--
00:05:34,00:05:36,"No, it's not Satire."
00:05:36,00:05:40,My satirical show is not going down.
00:05:40,00:05:41,"Hey, Trump, fuck you."
00:05:41,00:05:43,"Hey, front, fuck you."
00:05:43,00:05:46,"Catch you next week on ""Settlers Today."""
00:05:46,00:05:47,"What were we talking about, Iceland?"
00:05:47,00:05:48,Yeah.
00:05:48,00:05:52,"So these, these UL ads, their mother is called ""Gruler."""
00:05:52,00:05:54,"She's been married three times, but she"
00:05:54,00:05:59,killed all of her husbands because they bought her.
00:05:59,00:05:59,Wow.
00:05:59,00:06:00,"My wife is in the audience, and I just"
00:06:00,00:06:04,like to say that's not the right way to behave like that.
00:06:04,00:06:06,And she is the mother of the UL ads?
00:06:06,00:06:07,"No, she's just my wife."
00:06:07,00:06:08,No.
00:06:08,00:06:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:14,00:06:16,"And she is half-oga, half-troll."
00:06:16,00:06:23,"And I am referring here to ""Gruler"" and their cat is Christmas"
00:06:23,00:06:24,cat.
00:06:24,00:06:26,The family cat is Christmas cat.
00:06:26,00:06:28,"And the cat brings-- oh, the UL ads sometimes"
00:06:28,00:06:31,grab to children and brought them back to be turned into stew.
00:06:31,00:06:33,But this is all just to deter children from misbehaving.
00:06:33,00:06:36,"It's not anything worse than what we do, which is Santa"
00:06:36,00:06:38,won't bring you presents if you're banned.
00:06:38,00:06:40,Should we talk about Father Christmas?
00:06:40,00:06:40,"Yeah, sure."
00:06:40,00:06:42,Because you know he is leaking.
00:06:42,00:06:43,Sorry.
00:06:43,00:06:43,Wow.
00:06:43,00:06:45,"His bones, Father Christmas, has bones."
00:06:45,00:06:48,"So this is St. Nicholas, and he has some relics."
00:06:48,00:06:50,"And it's kind of debatable which relics are his,"
00:06:50,00:06:53,but it's generally accepted that he has some in Italy.
00:06:53,00:06:54,And they leak.
00:06:54,00:06:56,It's a clear liquid that is called
00:06:56,00:06:58,sort of manner by the priest who guard the tomb.
00:06:58,00:07:01,And it can sell for a good manner.
00:07:01,00:07:04,"Oh, camera, it's surprising, wow."
00:07:04,00:07:06,But I think it's because he's in this place called
00:07:06,00:07:08,"Barry in Italy, which is a harbour town."
00:07:08,00:07:10,"So it's below sea level, in fact."
00:07:10,00:07:13,So the harbour water tends to seep into where he's entombed.
00:07:13,00:07:16,And then every year they have this festival where he will come.
00:07:16,00:07:20,"Oh, holy fish has come in this morning."
00:07:20,00:07:21,"Yeah, exactly."
00:07:21,00:07:23,It's like the great story of Jesus.
00:07:23,00:07:26,He makes fish out of the Santa.
00:07:26,00:07:32,"There is a place where, I think it's South America."
00:07:32,00:07:35,"Yeah, it's part of Latin America."
00:07:35,00:07:39,"Father, baby, the bot, hang on."
00:07:39,00:07:43,The models of baby Jesus are dressed up like Father Christmas.
00:07:43,00:07:44,"Yeah, there's this weird synergy"
00:07:44,00:07:47,between Jesus and Father Christmas.
00:07:47,00:07:48,Really?
00:07:48,00:07:51,"Yeah, I can't find it in my 19th century."
00:07:51,00:07:55,I am panicking like crazy.
00:07:55,00:07:57,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:57,00:07:59,I've seen the words magic helicopter.
00:07:59,00:08:01,"Yeah, well, no."
00:08:01,00:08:08,"So basically, you get presents from the baby Jesus."
00:08:08,00:08:10,You don't get them from Father Christmas.
00:08:10,00:08:12,So that's why they've dressed up the two traditions together.
00:08:12,00:08:15,"But people ask children, how exactly does that work?"
00:08:15,00:08:16,How are you getting presents from this baby?
00:08:16,00:08:20,"And they variously explained, a) that he has a magic helicopter."
00:08:20,00:08:23,"Or b) that he just hasn't, he owns all the toy shops."
00:08:23,00:08:25,He's just a massive toy magnate.
00:08:25,00:08:28,And he can afford to give them to children.
00:08:28,00:08:30,"Do you know how the reason he exists, though,"
00:08:30,00:08:32,is because it's too difficult for Jesus on his own
00:08:32,00:08:34,to deliver all those presents.
00:08:34,00:08:36,"So, what?"
00:08:36,00:08:41,"So, so Nicholas was like a common thing."
00:08:41,00:08:44,Everyone knew about the Nicholas until about the 1500s.
00:08:44,00:08:47,And then the Reformation came in and Protestantism came in
00:08:47,00:08:49,"and they said, Jesus is the only thing."
00:08:49,00:08:51,And then it was established that there should be a festival
00:08:51,00:08:54,"where Jesus brings everyone presents on Christmas day,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,on the day of his birth.
00:08:56,00:08:59,And then it was established that a tiny newborn baby
00:08:59,00:09:03,can't handle all these presents and all this present giving.
00:09:03,00:09:07,And so Father Christmas initially was the sidekick to Jesus.
00:09:07,00:09:08,"This was like, no."
00:09:08,00:09:11,Post Reformation was the first time he became
00:09:11,00:09:12,his co-deliverer of gifts.
00:09:12,00:09:14,"Because it was like, well, he's a tiny baby."
00:09:14,00:09:15,He can't actually carry all these presents.
00:09:15,00:09:17,"So, um, so Nicholas joined him."
00:09:17,00:09:21,"But a tiny baby would be, could fit down a chimney much more easily"
00:09:21,00:09:23,than a massive man.
00:09:23,00:09:25,"So, that was why Father Christmas brought Jesus."
00:09:25,00:09:28,It was a symbiotic relationship.
00:09:28,00:09:31,"But so, are there actual historical stories of the two of them?"
00:09:31,00:09:34,"Like Batman Robyn's Star, which is travelling."
00:09:34,00:09:39,"I refer you to the word ""historical"" in that sense."
00:09:39,00:09:41,All right. Shall we move on to our second first?
00:09:41,00:09:43,Sure. Okay. It is time for our second fact of the show.
00:09:43,00:09:44,And that is Anna.
00:09:44,00:09:47,Yep. My fact this week is that an ancient Greek form
00:09:47,00:09:51,"of contraception was a suppository made of frankincense,"
00:09:51,00:09:55,"mure, and blister beetles."
00:09:55,00:09:56,This is the thing.
00:09:56,00:09:58,"And blister beetles, by the way, if you don't know what they are,"
00:09:58,00:10:00,they're beetles that cause blisters.
00:10:00,00:10:03,"Um, no, they're, so blister beetles are these things"
00:10:03,00:10:05,"that secrete something called cantharidin,"
00:10:05,00:10:07,"which I probably mispronounced, but it's this poison."
00:10:07,00:10:11,"And the reason they secrete it is because they give it to their,"
00:10:11,00:10:14,"their, the male gives it to the female during mating,"
00:10:14,00:10:17,"as a gift, as like a mating gift, but during sex,"
00:10:17,00:10:21,"which is a bit weird, um, and then it's to cover her eggs with it."
00:10:21,00:10:24,"And that stops predators from, you know, getting hold of it,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,but it's actually very poisonous.
00:10:26,00:10:29,"Um, so a tenth of a milligram can blister your skin really badly,"
00:10:29,00:10:32,"but this was a very common medicine,"
00:10:32,00:10:33,so it was used as a contraception.
00:10:33,00:10:36,"You shove it up the bum, and you don't get pregnant."
00:10:36,00:10:40,That is what traditionally happens when you shove it up the bum.
00:10:40,00:10:52,LAUGHTER
00:10:52,00:10:56,"Oh, that blister beetle stuff is called Spanish fly, I think."
00:10:56,00:10:59,Yeah. And it was an aphrodisiac as well.
00:10:59,00:10:59,Yeah.
00:10:59,00:11:03,And I think I've written down Casanova and Marquis de Sade.
00:11:03,00:11:04,"I can't remember which one it was,"
00:11:04,00:11:08,"but one of them used it as a, um, as an aphrodisiac."
00:11:08,00:11:08,Marquis de Sade.
00:11:08,00:11:10,And that's what he got said to prison.
00:11:10,00:11:12,"Sorry, if you're using the blister beetles, think..."
00:11:12,00:11:13,"Yeah, I think so, whatever."
00:11:13,00:11:15,"I'm going off memory, but I think that's right."
00:11:15,00:11:16,Yeah. Yeah.
00:11:16,00:11:18,"And the idea was, it would make you itchy,"
00:11:18,00:11:20,"and you would put it down there, and you would itch yourself,"
00:11:20,00:11:21,and that would turn you off.
00:11:21,00:11:22,Mmm.
00:11:22,00:11:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:24,00:11:25,"Nice, eh?"
00:11:25,00:11:26,Just a bit of history.
00:11:26,00:11:27,It's just...
00:11:27,00:11:29,And a good tip for the room.
00:11:29,00:11:30,I think.
00:11:30,00:11:31,LAUGHTER
00:11:31,00:11:34,"But Frankincense and Merck, come on, let's talk about those."
00:11:34,00:11:35,Yes. Yes.
00:11:35,00:11:35,Yeah.
00:11:35,00:11:37,"Frankincense, a bit of a panacea."
00:11:37,00:11:39,People thought it kind of cured loads of different things.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Yeah.
00:11:40,00:11:42,"In Oman, it still is a little bit."
00:11:42,00:11:44,"It's been variously used as a stomach suitor,"
00:11:44,00:11:47,"a cough remover, a blood thinner, cold medicine,"
00:11:47,00:11:49,"wound cleaner, and fly repellent."
00:11:49,00:11:51,LAUGHTER
00:11:51,00:11:54,"And it was really, really popular in Oman."
00:11:54,00:11:56,It was basically made them one of the most
00:11:56,00:11:58,kind of rich countries in the world.
00:11:58,00:12:00,"But not anymore, because the Roman Catholic church"
00:12:00,00:12:02,buys the cheap stuff from Somalia these days.
00:12:02,00:12:04,Oh.
00:12:04,00:12:06,"What, um, what is Frankincense?"
00:12:06,00:12:07,It's incense.
00:12:07,00:12:09,But it's like Frank of the front.
00:12:09,00:12:11,You're kidding.
00:12:11,00:12:12,Is that really what it is?
00:12:12,00:12:12,Yeah.
00:12:12,00:12:14,And Frank kind of means honest or whatever.
00:12:14,00:12:16,It just means really good.
00:12:16,00:12:17,Really good incense.
00:12:17,00:12:18,Don't listen.
00:12:18,00:12:20,It's true.
00:12:20,00:12:21,"I swear to God, that's true."
00:12:21,00:12:22,That is true.
00:12:22,00:12:23,Was the incense a bit true?
00:12:23,00:12:24,All of it's true.
00:12:24,00:12:25,The Frank bit as well?
00:12:25,00:12:26,Yeah.
00:12:26,00:12:27,Andy?
00:12:27,00:12:29,LAUGHTER
00:12:29,00:12:31,"Don, the reason I asked was because I had"
00:12:31,00:12:33,dramatically under-researched on this fact.
00:12:33,00:12:34,Yeah.
00:12:34,00:12:37,But it is. And the word Frank to mean sort of really good and honest
00:12:37,00:12:41,"came from Franks, meaning French people, as well, from the Roman times."
00:12:41,00:12:44,"And in fact, in Roman times, it was so important,"
00:12:44,00:12:48,"Frankincense, that Augustus Caesar sent 10,000 troops"
00:12:48,00:12:50,"to invade the area where Frankincense came from,"
00:12:50,00:12:52,because he thought it was so important.
00:12:52,00:12:53,Right.
00:12:53,00:12:54,It's so weird.
00:12:54,00:12:56,"It was so important, Frankincense."
00:12:56,00:12:59,And so it was medicinally thought to be so important.
00:12:59,00:13:01,And it wasn't incense.
00:13:01,00:13:03,"And it's from Treesat, basically, isn't it?"
00:13:03,00:13:06,"Which is like Mer, they're both, basically, from Treesap"
00:13:06,00:13:08,and they're turning to incense.
00:13:08,00:13:12,"But between 1,000 BC and 400 AD,"
00:13:12,00:13:15,Frankincense was the most lucrative trade in the world.
00:13:15,00:13:18,It was the most valuable thing in the world to be traded
00:13:18,00:13:20,"for, like, 1,500 years."
00:13:20,00:13:20,It's amazing.
00:13:20,00:13:23,"And in a man, it's still a really big deal to the extent"
00:13:23,00:13:27,"that they have, I think, roundabouts in a man are quite famous,"
00:13:27,00:13:29,so they're quite well decorated with giant versions of stuff.
00:13:29,00:13:32,"And in quite a lot of roundabouts in a man,"
00:13:32,00:13:35,"then they have giant, Frankincense dispensers,"
00:13:35,00:13:36,"like, properly huge."
00:13:36,00:13:39,The size of a building of Frankincense dispenser
00:13:39,00:13:41,in the centre of a roundabout.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"I did a little bit on gift giving, OK."
00:13:43,00:13:44,"So because these blister beetles,"
00:13:44,00:13:47,they give a present to their mates during sex.
00:13:47,00:13:48,And so I looked up--
00:13:48,00:13:51,And also called Frankincense and Mer were gifts
00:13:51,00:13:52,given to the baby Jesus.
00:13:52,00:13:55,There are so many links to the thing I've--
00:13:59,00:14:03,But you've heard of these spiders that give gifts to the females.
00:14:03,00:14:05,They're called paratrokelea ornata.
00:14:05,00:14:09,And they give silk wrapped parcels full of prey.
00:14:09,00:14:13,"And it's really interesting because 70% of them give rubbish gifts,"
00:14:13,00:14:14,which are worthless.
00:14:14,00:14:15,They're leftovers.
00:14:15,00:14:18,It's like basically giving someone an empty selection box.
00:14:18,00:14:20,"Selection box, exactly."
00:14:20,00:14:21,Because--
00:14:21,00:14:22,That's just the bouncy bar left in.
00:14:22,00:14:23,Exactly.
00:14:23,00:14:25,It is exactly like that.
00:14:25,00:14:28,"But basically, the male spiders, they can't help themselves"
00:14:28,00:14:30,from eating most of the present before they
00:14:30,00:14:31,give it to the female.
00:14:31,00:14:33,"But I just wrap this nice-- oh god, it's so--"
00:14:33,00:14:35,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
00:14:35,00:14:38,But the spiders-- it's really sensible for the spiders
00:14:38,00:14:40,to give a rubbish present to the female.
00:14:40,00:14:42,Because the females don't judge on what's inside the parcel.
00:14:42,00:14:44,"By the time they open the package,"
00:14:44,00:14:47,they've already pressed the button to go ahead or not
00:14:47,00:14:48,go ahead with the mating.
00:14:48,00:14:51,And what they judge on is how the male looks
00:14:51,00:14:52,is physical condition.
00:14:52,00:14:55,So the main thing is good body condition.
00:14:55,00:14:57,"So the males who ate their gift to a cleverer,"
00:14:57,00:15:01,"because it's better to turn up looking well-fed and in good shape,"
00:15:01,00:15:03,but with nothing in the box than it
00:15:03,00:15:06,"is to turn up with an actual meal in the box,"
00:15:06,00:15:07,but you look hungry.
00:15:07,00:15:11,"Yeah, and you do know that's not going to fly in your own life, do you?"
00:15:11,00:15:13,"The main thing, darling, is that I look good."
00:15:13,00:15:19,I read something really interesting today.
00:15:19,00:15:21,Have you guys heard the Jesus as an alien theory?
00:15:21,00:15:22,No.
00:15:22,00:15:24,"No, Jesus."
00:15:24,00:15:27,"No, no, hang in there."
00:15:27,00:15:30,This one's really interesting.
00:15:30,00:15:32,So the idea is that a lot of people think
00:15:32,00:15:34,that Jesus is an alien.
00:15:34,00:15:39,"And so because they describe in the Bible that the star,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,"they say, low the star, which they saw in the east,"
00:15:42,00:15:46,went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was.
00:15:46,00:15:48,"And everyone's like, how can a star move like that?"
00:15:48,00:15:49,That's insane.
00:15:49,00:15:50,Maybe it wasn't a star.
00:15:50,00:15:52,Maybe it was a UFO.
00:15:52,00:15:57,"Now, UFO comes guiding these three wise men"
00:15:57,00:16:00,and three kings from very separate places who all of a sudden are hanging out.
00:16:00,00:16:01,How's that happen?
00:16:01,00:16:02,Were they like a king conference?
00:16:02,00:16:05,"Like how one was from Persia, one was from India."
00:16:05,00:16:07,They were all over the shop and suddenly they were on this side.
00:16:07,00:16:08,They weren't three of them.
00:16:08,00:16:09,That's not in the Bible.
00:16:09,00:16:10,And I'm telling a story here.
00:16:10,00:16:16,"Then you go, OK, the immaculate conception."
00:16:16,00:16:18,How did she have the child inside of her?
00:16:18,00:16:21,"Well, that's very consistent, my friends, with an abduction,"
00:16:21,00:16:24,where they bring you up and they play something inside you.
00:16:24,00:16:24,Not my theory.
00:16:24,00:16:29,I'm just saying that the third you marry was anally probed.
00:16:29,00:16:33,"And that's the one time where the bum contraception would not work, Andy."
00:16:33,00:16:36,"Because look what she had, a Jesus."
00:16:36,00:16:38,So...
00:16:38,00:16:40,I cannot believe you've done this to our show.
00:16:40,00:16:41,What do you mean?
00:16:41,00:16:42,This is...
00:16:42,00:16:44,Can I tell you something about Jesus?
00:16:44,00:16:47,"Well, can I ask you something about Jesus?"
00:16:47,00:16:48,Where was he born?
00:16:48,00:16:50,Bethlehem.
00:16:50,00:16:52,Incorrect.
00:16:52,00:16:56,"Not Bethlehem, he was born in Bethlehem."
00:16:56,00:16:57,So...
00:16:57,00:16:59,What?
00:16:59,00:17:00,It's a different Bethlehem.
00:17:00,00:17:03,There's a Bethlehem in Israel where everyone goes
00:17:03,00:17:04,"and they're like, ""This is the birthplace of Jesus."""
00:17:04,00:17:07,But Israel has two Bethlehem's.
00:17:07,00:17:11,And it turns out that the one that is much closer to Nazareth
00:17:11,00:17:14,where Jesus was born is a totally different Bethlehem.
00:17:14,00:17:18,And archaeologists now are saying that actually we've got the wrong one.
00:17:18,00:17:21,So the place that everyone goes and celebrate the birth of Jesus
00:17:21,00:17:22,is completely wrong.
00:17:22,00:17:23,It's somewhere there.
00:17:23,00:17:24,"Yeah, they should be going to area 51."
00:17:24,00:17:25,Yeah.
00:17:25,00:17:27,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:27,00:17:32,"You know, I'm trying to raise the turn."
00:17:32,00:17:34,Whatever.
00:17:34,00:17:38,"Um, so, do you know what the names of the three wise men were?"
00:17:38,00:17:39,Yes.
00:17:39,00:17:40,Balthazar.
00:17:40,00:17:41,Melcule.
00:17:41,00:17:41,Balthazar.
00:17:41,00:17:42,Melcule.
00:17:42,00:17:43,"And Caspa, yeah."
00:17:43,00:17:44,Okay.
00:17:44,00:17:46,"And according to a survey by the British Christmas tree,"
00:17:46,00:17:47,Growers Association.
00:17:47,00:17:50,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:50,00:17:53,Your sourcing is getting worse.
00:17:53,00:17:57,There is only one place in the world or at least in the UK
00:17:57,00:18:01,where there are people with those surnames that all live in that place.
00:18:01,00:18:02,And it is.
00:18:02,00:18:03,It's eaten.
00:18:03,00:18:04,It's eaten in it.
00:18:04,00:18:05,It's Bedfordshire.
00:18:05,00:18:06,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:06,00:18:07,Bedfordshire.
00:18:07,00:18:08,Apparently there are people with that names.
00:18:08,00:18:13,"And they decided, because presumably it was the slow season for Christmas tree growing,"
00:18:13,00:18:16,that they'd look at all the different Christmassy names and see where people are.
00:18:16,00:18:19,There is only one Mr. Scrooge in the whole world.
00:18:19,00:18:21,And he lives in Canada.
00:18:21,00:18:22,No.
00:18:22,00:18:26,"There are 16 people in England called Grinch, the surname Grinch."
00:18:26,00:18:27,Really?
00:18:27,00:18:30,And there's only one person in the whole UK called Mr. Barbals.
00:18:30,00:18:33,(LAUGHTER)
00:18:33,00:18:35,That's right.
00:18:35,00:18:36,All right.
00:18:36,00:18:38,Let's move on to our next fact.
00:18:38,00:18:40,It is time for fact number three and that is Andy.
00:18:40,00:18:45,My factor is that Oregon has 12 times as many Christmas trees as humans.
00:18:45,00:18:49,Yeah. So this is just a fact about how many Christmas trees there are.
00:18:49,00:18:50,You've heard the fact.
00:18:50,00:18:51,It's about...
00:18:51,00:18:52,I can't believe that.
00:18:52,00:18:54,Just how few humans there are in Oregon.
00:18:54,00:18:55,That's true.
00:18:55,00:18:56,But it's not.
00:18:56,00:19:02,It's got reasonably healthy human population and just a shitload of Christmas trees.
00:19:02,00:19:06,So the amazing thing is how it harvests them.
00:19:06,00:19:07,So it harvests them.
00:19:07,00:19:10,You may have seen this by helicopter to where the...
00:19:10,00:19:12,Is that magic helicopter?
00:19:12,00:19:15,"No, by Jesus."
00:19:15,00:19:17,It's not about a helicopter.
00:19:17,00:19:20,I get lifted up in massive bundles and it's incredible to watch an action
00:19:20,00:19:24,because they're doing a constant zigzag between the...
00:19:24,00:19:26,where the Christmas trees are in bundles and where they need to be loaded.
00:19:26,00:19:30,And it takes about 26 seconds to fly a few hundred yards from one to the other.
00:19:30,00:19:32,And then they zip back.
00:19:32,00:19:35,"And one of the pilot trainers, the helicopter pilot, trainers said,"
00:19:35,00:19:38,"""It's similar to sprinting down a field, putting someone on your back,"
00:19:38,00:19:42,"piggyback, and then dropping them off, then running back across the field."""
00:19:42,00:19:47,Which is such an unhelpful energy.
00:19:47,00:19:50,But in America there's a massive shortage right now.
00:19:50,00:19:51,Of trees?
00:19:51,00:19:52,"Yeah, of Christmas trees."
00:19:52,00:19:53,Right.
00:19:53,00:19:54,And this is because of the recession.
00:19:54,00:19:57,When the recession happened was about that amount of time ago
00:19:57,00:19:59,that it takes to grow a Christmas tree.
00:19:59,00:20:01,So just on the ten years.
00:20:01,00:20:04,So now we've got a massive shortage because people's businesses went to pot
00:20:04,00:20:06,and they went into other industries.
00:20:06,00:20:10,"So actually an Oregon, which is one of the main Christmas tree industries,"
00:20:10,00:20:13,"pot growing, marijuana growing is a big industry as well."
00:20:13,00:20:16,And so a lot of Christmas tree farmers have gone on to marijuana instead.
00:20:16,00:20:19,"So you can't get a Christmas tree, you can get some weed."
00:20:19,00:20:22,"Which does that mean like in what, 15 years time?"
00:20:22,00:20:24,Everyone will have pot plants.
00:20:24,00:20:25,"Well, pot plants."
00:20:25,00:20:26,Yeah.
00:20:26,00:20:27,Really?
00:20:27,00:20:28,I guess so.
00:20:28,00:20:32,"Yeah, giant pot plants that they hang baubles and tinsel off and put an angel on top of."
00:20:32,00:20:33,Wow.
00:20:33,00:20:36,"But there is a shortage, it's a problem."
00:20:36,00:20:38,"Not a huge problem, but it's a problem."
00:20:38,00:20:44,Do you know where Britain has a Eurovision for Christmas trees?
00:20:44,00:20:45,I don't know.
00:20:45,00:20:46,Yeah.
00:20:46,00:20:47,What?
00:20:47,00:20:51,It's from the British Christmas tree growers association.
00:20:51,00:20:57,They have an annual Christmas tree grower of the year competition
00:20:57,00:21:01,"and they all compete on various metrics of, you know, height and, um,"
00:21:01,00:21:05,"so when you say Eurovision, sorry, is it all of Europe?"
00:21:05,00:21:06,It's not all of Europe.
00:21:06,00:21:09,It's all the British Christmas tree growers.
00:21:09,00:21:13,The only thing that even makes it slightly like Eurovision.
00:21:13,00:21:15,Is we all ring up to see who wins?
00:21:15,00:21:16,Yes.
00:21:16,00:21:17,"It's on BBC One, everyone."
00:21:17,00:21:20,It's hosted by Graham Nantes.
00:21:20,00:21:21,"It's right, yeah."
00:21:21,00:21:25,It's gone undercurrent of Cold War rivalry.
00:21:25,00:21:28,The determines the winner every year.
00:21:28,00:21:34,Is it that they get a vote on each other's trees?
00:21:34,00:21:37,That's so great.
00:21:37,00:21:42,"But anyway, what happens to the best tree?"
00:21:42,00:21:45,It's not interesting.
00:21:45,00:21:50,"Though it gets to go outside, downing streets."
00:21:50,00:21:52,Does it really?
00:21:52,00:21:54,"Yeah, do you not have us to the runner-up?"
00:21:54,00:21:55,Right out.
00:21:55,00:21:58,It's probably a pub.
00:21:58,00:22:04,"No, the runner-up gets to go inside downing streets."
00:22:04,00:22:06,Does it seem amazing?
00:22:06,00:22:07,That's the better...
00:22:07,00:22:09,That's the better prize.
00:22:09,00:22:12,You don't get seen by the public and stuff there.
00:22:12,00:22:16,"Yeah, but you get to hear all the juicy goss."
00:22:16,00:22:19,So you can buy half Christmas trees.
00:22:19,00:22:21,Have you seen these? They're pretty cool.
00:22:21,00:22:25,"They're plastic ones, but they're basically half a Christmas tree,"
00:22:25,00:22:27,and you lean it up against your wall.
00:22:27,00:22:29,That is so clever.
00:22:29,00:22:30,That is so clever.
00:22:30,00:22:34,"I mean, it's awful, but it is awfully clever."
00:22:34,00:22:37,"They put them up because if you live in a small flat,"
00:22:37,00:22:40,"let's say in London, for instance, you don't have that much space,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,"but you still want to see the Christmas tree,"
00:22:42,00:22:44,then you can have it just half of the wall.
00:22:44,00:22:45,That's great.
00:22:45,00:22:49,You can also have agar cells upside down Christmas trees.
00:22:49,00:22:52,"You can see bitters at the bottom, and the fat bitters at the top."
00:22:52,00:22:55,And that's if you don't have much floor space.
00:22:55,00:22:56,That's very cool.
00:22:56,00:22:59,And that used to happen in the 19th century.
00:22:59,00:23:00,Did it?
00:23:00,00:23:02,People hung it upside down from the rafters.
00:23:02,00:23:03,"Yeah, really."
00:23:03,00:23:05,"Yeah, because there was not much floor space."
00:23:05,00:23:06,Same reason.
00:23:06,00:23:08,"But actually, the Christmas tree industry in the 2000s"
00:23:08,00:23:10,really hated these plastic trees.
00:23:10,00:23:14,"In 2004, the National Christmas Tree Association of America"
00:23:14,00:23:17,launched a free online video game
00:23:17,00:23:21,called Attack of the Mutant Artificial Christmas Tree.
00:23:21,00:23:25,"And in it, you would throw snowballs at artificial trees"
00:23:25,00:23:29,that were blamed for sucking the spirit out of Christmas.
00:23:29,00:23:31,Where is actually artificial trees have been around
00:23:31,00:23:35,for almost as long as Christmas trees have been around in popular terms?
00:23:35,00:23:39,So feather trees were a thing from the late 19th century.
00:23:39,00:23:40,Feather trees?
00:23:40,00:23:42,"Yeah, so the first artificial Christmas trees"
00:23:42,00:23:43,were made of goose feather.
00:23:43,00:23:46,And they used to kind of like sort of back comb it.
00:23:46,00:23:48,So it looked like a tree.
00:23:48,00:23:50,And then they would paint it.
00:23:50,00:23:51,And that was an artificial tree
00:23:51,00:23:54,"because they were really worried about deforestation in the 19th century,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,which I think is quite interesting.
00:23:56,00:23:58,And it's still an argument about what's best for the environment
00:23:58,00:24:00,"like an artificial one or a real one, right?"
00:24:00,00:24:01,Yeah.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"I read one report and a few of them are kind of very,"
00:24:03,00:24:06,"but one of them says that it's better to use real ones,"
00:24:06,00:24:10,but not if you're going to use your artificial tree for 20 years or more.
00:24:10,00:24:11,20 years.
00:24:11,00:24:15,"Basically, 20 years worth of real trees is one plastic one as well."
00:24:15,00:24:17,But I throw away my plastic one every year.
00:24:17,00:24:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:20,00:24:24,Do you know how the Christmas tree was made popular worldwide
00:24:24,00:24:25,in the way it is today?
00:24:25,00:24:27,Like Martin Luther or something?
00:24:27,00:24:29,I'm thinking more like commercially popular.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"It was made popular by Queen Victoria, which--"
00:24:32,00:24:36,So it was in 1846 when Victorian Albert had a Christmas tree
00:24:36,00:24:38,"because in Germany, Christmas trees were way"
00:24:38,00:24:41,they celebrated Christmas and Albert came over
00:24:41,00:24:43,and he brought that over with him.
00:24:43,00:24:46,And then this image of their Christmas tree was published
00:24:46,00:24:48,in London Illustrated Magazine or something.
00:24:48,00:24:51,"And then it really caught on, because they had this decorated tree."
00:24:51,00:24:53,And so everyone got this decorated tree.
00:24:53,00:24:56,"But then it caught on in America a couple of years later,"
00:24:56,00:25:00,because it was in something called Godi's Lady Book.
00:25:00,00:25:05,"And it was totally innocent, by the way."
00:25:05,00:25:08,But what they did was they took this picture
00:25:08,00:25:10,and they popularized it in America.
00:25:10,00:25:13,They thought that Victoria's tiara and Albert's
00:25:13,00:25:16,"moustache were too British, so they removed them."
00:25:16,00:25:18,And this was like the early days of Photoshop.
00:25:18,00:25:21,And that's how the Christmas tree got popular in America.
00:25:21,00:25:23,Was a moustache-less Albert.
00:25:23,00:25:26,Can I give you a story from the New York herald
00:25:26,00:25:31,in the early 20th century about a cursed Christmas tree?
00:25:31,00:25:34,Someone's allergic to cursed Christmas trees over there.
00:25:34,00:25:38,"Chopping the butt of a Christmas tree in prospect this afternoon,"
00:25:38,00:25:42,"William Smith, a farmhand, nearly cut off his great toe."
00:25:42,00:25:47,"Angered, he threw an axe, and it broke a window with struck a child."
00:25:47,00:25:50,"In the face, inflicting a severe cut."
00:25:50,00:25:51,Wow.
00:25:51,00:25:53,"Can I just say, you're all laughing at a child."
00:25:53,00:25:55,It's a long time ago.
00:25:55,00:25:58,It's a different time. It was a different time.
00:25:58,00:26:03,"Trimming the tree later, Mrs. William Scoville fell and broke an ankle."
00:26:03,00:26:05,"Indignant over the chain of events,"
00:26:05,00:26:09,"Howard Scoville, son of the woman, insisted on doing the rest of the work himself,"
00:26:09,00:26:12,"and while testing the candles, set the tree afire,"
00:26:12,00:26:15,and nearly burned down the farmhouse.
00:26:15,00:26:19,"Believing the tree bewitched, the father, Ambrose Scoville,"
00:26:19,00:26:24,"threw it into the hog pen, where it fell on and killed a chicken."
00:26:24,00:26:28,"I find it amazing that people didn't die constantly from Christmas tree accidents,"
00:26:28,00:26:32,"because before electricity became a thing, they were all lit by candlelight."
00:26:32,00:26:36,"And that was 50, 60 years of just being candles strapped to a tree."
00:26:36,00:26:39,And they were decorated with snow made out of cotton.
00:26:39,00:26:40,Yeah.
00:26:40,00:26:41,So dangerous.
00:26:41,00:26:44,"You could get in the 50s, you could get, it was called flocking, wasn't it?"
00:26:44,00:26:48,"You could get an attachment for your vacuum cleaner,"
00:26:48,00:26:54,which was like a gun to fire artificial snow from your Hoover all over the tree.
00:26:54,00:26:55,Wow.
00:26:55,00:26:56,At the candles.
00:26:56,00:26:57,No way.
00:26:57,00:26:58,That's so cool.
00:26:58,00:26:59,"I know, isn't it good?"
00:26:59,00:27:03,"And you know, like you're saying, the Christmas tree with Albert and Victoria suddenly took off."
00:27:03,00:27:07,That was the same for electric Christmas lights that we all have now around our tree.
00:27:07,00:27:10,"That was invented by a guy called Edward Hiberd Johnson,"
00:27:10,00:27:13,who was the right-hand man to Thomas Edison.
00:27:13,00:27:15,People were putting candles on their tree.
00:27:15,00:27:19,"They kept burning down and he thought, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to try and make this a thing."
00:27:19,00:27:22,"And it just caught on in the next few years in America just so quickly,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,because it was just such a beautiful thing.
00:27:24,00:27:26,And he died of an electric shock.
00:27:26,00:27:27,No way.
00:27:27,00:27:28,No way.
00:27:28,00:27:31,It says citation needed on Wikipedia next to that.
00:27:31,00:27:32,But.
00:27:32,00:27:37,"But it sounds plausible, doesn't it?"
00:27:37,00:27:38,Sounds plausible.
00:27:38,00:27:40,Should we move on to the final fact?
00:27:40,00:27:41,To the show?
00:27:41,00:27:43,It is time for our final fact of the show.
00:27:43,00:27:45,And that is James Harkin.
00:27:45,00:27:49,"Okay, my fact this week is the man who brought the phrase Merry Christmas to English"
00:27:49,00:27:54,was also the first Englishman to use the word Prosecco.
00:27:54,00:27:57,Was it in the same card?
00:27:57,00:27:58,Merry Christmas.
00:27:58,00:28:01,I have invented Prosecco.
00:28:01,00:28:04,So he didn't invent it.
00:28:04,00:28:06,It was invented by some Italian people.
00:28:06,00:28:07,Sure.
00:28:07,00:28:08,But he was in Italy at the time.
00:28:08,00:28:11,He was a traveler called Feins Morrison.
00:28:11,00:28:14,And he wrote all about Italy and lots of different countries actually.
00:28:14,00:28:16,And he was traveling around the time.
00:28:16,00:28:18,"It was in the 16th century, late 16th century."
00:28:18,00:28:23,"And it was kind of dangerous to travel around the world really, but especially in Europe."
00:28:23,00:28:26,There was a time of kind of bad religious strife.
00:28:26,00:28:30,"And he would always, whenever anyone mentioned religion to him, especially around Easter,"
00:28:30,00:28:34,he would immediately move to another city to avoid inquiries.
00:28:34,00:28:37,"When it was in Spain, he pretended to be Czech."
00:28:37,00:28:40,"When he was in France, he pretended to be Polish."
00:28:40,00:28:42,"When he was in Netherlands, he pretended to be German."
00:28:42,00:28:45,"When he was in Italy, he pretended to be Dutch."
00:28:45,00:28:48,"Except when he was in Rome, and he pretended to be French."
00:28:48,00:28:50,And he traveled without any funds.
00:28:50,00:28:53,He didn't have any official protection.
00:28:53,00:28:59,"And so whenever there was any problems, he adopted a deferential posture and avoided eye contact."
00:28:59,00:29:00,That's great.
00:29:00,00:29:01,That's a good way to travel.
00:29:01,00:29:02,Yeah.
00:29:02,00:29:04,Sounds like me on a night out.
00:29:04,00:29:08,I read something about Feins Morrison.
00:29:08,00:29:10,This is from the Wikipedia entry on him.
00:29:10,00:29:12,And I'm quoting exactly here.
00:29:12,00:29:19,"His biographer, Charles Hughes, says he had a sane charity for all men except Turks and Irish priests."
00:29:19,00:29:26,Which is another way of saying that he was prejudiced against Turks and Irish priests.
00:29:26,00:29:28,"Yeah, he was."
00:29:28,00:29:30,He was a man of his time.
00:29:30,00:29:31,I'm sure.
00:29:31,00:29:34,"But also, no one had seen Prosecco before."
00:29:34,00:29:37,"This was, it was a drink that even Pliny drank."
00:29:37,00:29:40,And it was also known as Pukinum.
00:29:40,00:29:45,"And then he said it was called Pukinum, now called Prosecco, much celebrated by Pliny."
00:29:45,00:29:50,"And when we say it's celebrated by Pliny, we mean sparkling wine, presumably."
00:29:50,00:29:51,Yeah.
00:29:51,00:29:53,"No, I did the sparkling wine with that far back."
00:29:53,00:29:57,"Yeah, because with wine, its default position is often sparkling."
00:29:57,00:30:00,We get the stuff which they've taken the bubbles out.
00:30:00,00:30:01,Why?
00:30:01,00:30:06,Why do these people treat us like children?
00:30:06,00:30:09,Who doesn't want all wine to be sparkling wine?
00:30:09,00:30:11,The children love busy stuff.
00:30:11,00:30:15,Yeah. It's like grown-ups.
00:30:15,00:30:22,"But Prosecco, Christmas drink at the moment, the UK consumes 77 million litres of Prosecco last year."
00:30:22,00:30:31,And I worked out that's in the region of the amount of rain that falls on Wembley Stadium in a year.
00:30:31,00:30:40,"Also, my favourite thing about Brexit, and it's a long list, is..."
00:30:40,00:30:43,"Thank God, I've got a favourable audience."
00:30:43,00:30:48,"OK, so, no, but is that champagne can be sold by the pint again?"
00:30:48,00:30:50,So there's always been this weird...
00:30:50,00:30:58,"It's like, cos to me, which is that wine can only be sold in metric and beer can only be sold in imperial."
00:30:58,00:31:01,But poll Roger always used to sell champagne by the pint.
00:31:01,00:31:05,"It was a bottle that was the size of a pint, wrapping a pint glass."
00:31:05,00:31:07,"Yes, yeah, yeah, a bottle that was the size of the pint."
00:31:07,00:31:11,And Churchill loved poll Roger that was served in Pines. He said it was perfect for lunch.
00:31:11,00:31:14,"And actually, he..."
00:31:14,00:31:21,"He actually had poll Roger the champagne manufacturers deliver him a pint of champagne at 11 a.m. every morning,"
00:31:21,00:31:23,because he was so such a fan of it.
00:31:23,00:31:28,"And now, poll Roger have explicitly said, maybe one of the advantages of leaving the EU,"
00:31:28,00:31:31,"is that we'll be able to sell champagne by the pint again,"
00:31:31,00:31:34,and they're already preparing to sell champagne by the pint.
00:31:34,00:31:37,So if you want to be optimistic about the future...
00:31:37,00:31:39,This is it.
00:31:39,00:31:41,Is that one of the battle buses we didn't see?
00:31:41,00:31:47,"Did you know, one of the first battles of the First World War was called the Champagne Offensive?"
00:31:47,00:31:48,No.
00:31:48,00:31:53,So it was when the German armies were moving west through the Champagne region
00:31:53,00:31:57,and lots of people at the time fled underground to the wine cellars.
00:31:57,00:32:00,"But basically, they learn their lesson in the Champagne region"
00:32:00,00:32:04,"because when the German army arrived again in 1940,"
00:32:04,00:32:09,there were false walls built in the wine cellars to conceal the really good stuff.
00:32:09,00:32:16,"And supposedly, some houses like Bollinger mislabeled their really good bottles poison."
00:32:16,00:32:19,They did it.
00:32:19,00:32:23,It was a real front of the Second World War that we haven't acknowledged so far.
00:32:23,00:32:30,"I think there's a book called Wine and War, I think, which has first-hand accounts of winemakers in France"
00:32:30,00:32:33,who fought the Nazis by withholding their best wine.
00:32:33,00:32:35,And they're so proud of it.
00:32:35,00:32:36,So it's so sweet.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"So it was in the Champagne region,"
00:32:38,00:32:42,and there's one winemaker who bragged about the fact that he watered down his champagne
00:32:42,00:32:44,before giving it to the Nazis.
00:32:44,00:32:48,Or he would bottle his worst wines.
00:32:48,00:32:49,This is in the Champagne region.
00:32:49,00:32:55,"He bottle his worst wines and say, ""This is the special couvet for the Vermex."""
00:32:55,00:33:01,And there was one guy who said that we got orders from the Nazis to deliver them lots of wine
00:33:01,00:33:06,and they made the foolish mistake of not saying which vintage wine they would prefer.
00:33:06,00:33:15,"And so we sent them 1,000 bottles of our 1939, which was absolute rubbish."
00:33:15,00:33:18,And that absolutely taught them.
00:33:18,00:33:20,I have a fact about wishing people a Merry Christmas.
00:33:20,00:33:21,OK.
00:33:21,00:33:24,So this was an experiment that happened in 1974.
00:33:24,00:33:28,Sociological two sociologists called Philip Kuhns and Michael Walcott.
00:33:28,00:33:32,They posted nearly 600 Christmas cards to people they didn't know.
00:33:32,00:33:36,"They got the addresses out of the phone book and they sent some high status cards,"
00:33:36,00:33:40,"which were very lavish and fancy and somewhat low status,"
00:33:40,00:33:45,which were just plain white cards with Merry Christmas written in a red sharpie on the front.
00:33:45,00:33:50,And they were either signed from Dr. and Mrs. Philip Kuhns or from Philip and Joyce Kuhns.
00:33:50,00:33:53,"And they included a return address saying, ""Well, you can send them back to."""
00:33:53,00:33:56,So they were definitely for people they hadn't met.
00:33:56,00:34:03,"And over 20% of people sent a signed card back with varying degrees of detail,"
00:34:03,00:34:07,"some said Merry Christmas, some said pictures of their families to people they had never met,"
00:34:07,00:34:14,"some said letters of several pages saying, ""What have been going on with them for the last few years?"""
00:34:14,00:34:16,I know.
00:34:16,00:34:21,"But six people wrote back and directly asked, ""How do I know you?"""
00:34:21,00:34:24,Which is incredibly bauzy to me.
00:34:24,00:34:26,I wouldn't have the courage to do that.
00:34:26,00:34:27,What was that? 74.
00:34:27,00:34:30,"You can't imagine it would happen today, could you think?"
00:34:30,00:34:36,"If you got a random Christmas card through the post, guys, would you respond to it?"
00:34:36,00:34:39,"Well, a few liars, but most people say that."
00:34:39,00:34:45,"And my parents, they keep getting a card addressed to the caginaries, and we've no idea who they are."
00:34:45,00:34:48,But they're right. It arrives like clockwork every year.
00:34:48,00:34:52,Every year. And the family has grown. It's added several members in this time.
00:34:52,00:34:57,"And they never include the return address, and they keep saying, ""We'd love to see you in their new year."""
00:34:57,00:35:00,"Please, please get in touch with them."
00:35:00,00:35:04,"So Wendy, John, if you're listening."
00:35:04,00:35:08,"We need to wrap up, guys. Anything before we do?"
00:35:08,00:35:11,"Some stuff on wine or, as you might know, whatever."
00:35:11,00:35:20,"In 2015, Scotland made its first homegrown wine, and it was described as undrinkable by experts."
00:35:20,00:35:26,"The guy who produced it said, ""It has potential."""
00:35:26,00:35:30,It doesn't smell fresh.
00:35:30,00:35:36,"But I enjoyed it in a bizarre, masochistic way."
00:35:36,00:35:39,"OK, that is it. That is all of our facts."
