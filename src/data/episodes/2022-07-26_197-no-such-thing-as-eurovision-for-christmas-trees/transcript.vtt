 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing"

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 is a Fish A Weekly Podcast this week coming to you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000

 [CHEERING]

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.800
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anaczynski,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.760
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.320
 But this time, with our four favorite Christmas

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.360
 facts, because it's our Christmas special.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.280
 And we're up again.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.120
 And in no particular order, here we go, starting with my facts.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.040
 My fact this week is that, as well as getting a visit

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.480
 from Santa Claus at Christmas, Icelanders also get a visit

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.840
 from the spoon liquor, the door snapper, and the sausage

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.360
 swiper.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.360
 Yeah.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.320
 So these-- they do have Santa there, but they also have--

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.400
 and this is what Wikipedia says they're called, your lads.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.240
 They're like lads.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.720
 And they-- I think the reason Wikipedia calls them that is,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.240
 because that's what they are called.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.080
 Yeah.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.760
 Oh, OK.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.280
 OK, cool.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.760
 Yeah.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.760
 I mean, so I know you've fallen for fake Wikipedia facts a lot

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.880
 in the past.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.760
 But this is real.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.480
 I just thought that was called Casualingo.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.840
 I was like, yeah, I'm cool with you, Wiki.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.280
 So yeah, they're called the your lads.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.080
 And there's 13 of them in total.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.360
 Spoon liquor is one.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 He licks bowls.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.760
 No, he licks spoons.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.800
 But there is a bowl liquor.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.520
 There is actually a bowl liquor, yeah.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.840
 I misread my note there.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.560
 And then cover it up like it was a joke.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.080
 There's the sausage swiper who licks spoons.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.640
 And then there--

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.120
 So does a sausage swiper-- he swipes sausages, does he?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.360
 Yeah, so he hides in the rafters of your house.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.120
 And while he goes and check for your spoons,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.400
 so someone's licked the spoons.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.440
 You quickly head into the kitchen.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.640
 He lowers himself.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.760
 I think Tom Cruise style from "Mission Impossible"

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.320
 gets your sausages and then gets pulled back up to the roof.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.200
 And then you come back in and go, ah, the spoons now,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.920
 the sausages, what's going on?

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.920
 We've had three.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.640
 What are the other 10 light?

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.680
 There's a guy who--

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.600
 he harasses sheep.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.960
 No.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.120
 Yeah.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.440
 What's his-- they all have very expressive names, don't they?

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.160
 Yeah, his one's not so sheepcoatclod is his name.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.960
 Yeah.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.120
 There's meat hook.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.080
 They're all thieves, basically, aren't they?

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.560
 Yeah.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.320
 Just in Iceland, you just have to accept that people

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.320
 will come and steal all your stuff.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.240
 There's pot scraper.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.240
 The doorway sniffer is not someone who likes doorways.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.240
 It's just someone who's smelling beyond the doorway

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.040
 to try and steal your food later.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.360
 But they used to be way more of them.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.160
 So they used to be more than 80-year-olds.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.960
 Whoa.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.840
 Which is a lot to descend upon you.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.840
 And there are ones that were, you know,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.680
 kiboshed about mid-century, were falda fakeir, which

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.320
 is skirt sweeper.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.560
 He got the shop and literally pungo, which

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.800
 are small testicles.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.800
 What did he do?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.400
 He just went around flattering people.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.560
 Those are bigger than mine.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.000
 I've got small ones, so it's, yeah.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.400
 So do these guys bring you anything?

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.560
 They just take things away.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.720
 They take things-- well, they used to take things away.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.080
 And back in the day, in 1746, the stories

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.400
 became so scary that they actually

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.840
 banned them from telling them to children,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.960
 because they brought them into such a sort of Stephen King-esque

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.400
 territory of fear that they said this is too much.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.880
 It was the Danish, wasn't it, who did that?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.080
 And not only that, they banned using any stories

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.520
 to scare children.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.040
 Yeah.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.160
 And it was because of these guys.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.680
 Really?

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.600
 It wasn't only because of them.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.680
 So have you heard of Iceland's famous Christmas child

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.720
 eating cat, who prowls around the country, eating children?

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.120
 Oh, Christmas day.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.800
 And the terrible thing is, so you know, if you're naughty or nice,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.080
 you'll get presents or you get a lump of coal.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.000
 The child has no control over whether it's eaten or not.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.680
 The only thing that controls whether the child is eaten or not

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.600
 is whether the child got any new clothes for Christmas

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.320
 from his parents.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.640
 And if your parents didn't give you some socks,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.160
 you're going to be eaten.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
 There is a slight thing with that with,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.720
 if you've done all of your chores by Christmas day,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.800
 then they're supposed to give you some clothes.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.760
 But they could not.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.840
 I just, I'm saying, it really would be a pretty harsh bit

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.160
 of parenting, isn't it?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.200
 Just think it-- yeah.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.000
 It's insult to injury, isn't it?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 A, you're not getting a new t-shirt and B,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.600
 you're about to be eaten by a giant cat.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.800
 Yeah, it was a big cat, though, isn't it?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.840
 It was like the size of a house.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.280
 And it belonged to a troll, right?

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.200
 So it was like--

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.720
 Katie Hopkins.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.200
 This is all still, I say.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:15.520
 Satire, we don't do that, Dave's come on.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.400
 We welcome all people in our pockets.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.280
 She-- no, there's no--

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.640
 We honestly do not.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.600
 She is not invited to anything that would--

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.280
 I'd like to publicly state, Katie Hopkins.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.960
 Fuck you.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960
 That's a--

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.200
 [APPLAUSE]

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.440
 Was that Satire or was that--

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.800
 No, it's not Satire.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.080
 My satirical show is not going down.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.080
 Hey, Trump, fuck you.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.200
 Hey, front, fuck you.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.320
 Catch you next week on "Settlers Today."

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.880
 What were we talking about, Iceland?

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.400
 Yeah.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.720
 So these, these UL ads, their mother is called "Gruler."

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.800
 She's been married three times, but she

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.080
 killed all of her husbands because they bought her.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.600
 Wow.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.960
 My wife is in the audience, and I just

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.680
 like to say that's not the right way to behave like that.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.680
 And she is the mother of the UL ads?

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.840
 No, she's just my wife.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.640
 No.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.920
 And she is half-oga, half-troll.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.880
 And I am referring here to "Gruler" and their cat is Christmas

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.640
 cat.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.120
 The family cat is Christmas cat.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.320
 And the cat brings-- oh, the UL ads sometimes

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.040
 grab to children and brought them back to be turned into stew.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.880
 But this is all just to deter children from misbehaving.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.360
 It's not anything worse than what we do, which is Santa

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.280
 won't bring you presents if you're banned.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.000
 Should we talk about Father Christmas?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.520
 Yeah, sure.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.480
 Because you know he is leaking.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.000
 Sorry.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.520
 Wow.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.720
 His bones, Father Christmas, has bones.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.360
 So this is St. Nicholas, and he has some relics.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.680
 And it's kind of debatable which relics are his,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.400
 but it's generally accepted that he has some in Italy.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.480
 And they leak.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.280
 It's a clear liquid that is called

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.920
 sort of manner by the priest who guard the tomb.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.440
 And it can sell for a good manner.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.680
 Oh, camera, it's surprising, wow.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.240
 But I think it's because he's in this place called

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.360
 Barry in Italy, which is a harbour town.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.000
 So it's below sea level, in fact.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.480
 So the harbour water tends to seep into where he's entombed.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.040
 And then every year they have this festival where he will come.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.960
 Oh, holy fish has come in this morning.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.920
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.120
 It's like the great story of Jesus.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.800
 He makes fish out of the Santa.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.320
 There is a place where, I think it's South America.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.640
 Yeah, it's part of Latin America.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.080
 Father, baby, the bot, hang on.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.120
 The models of baby Jesus are dressed up like Father Christmas.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.800
 Yeah, there's this weird synergy

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.720
 between Jesus and Father Christmas.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.360
 Really?

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.680
 Yeah, I can't find it in my 19th century.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.640
 I am panicking like crazy.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.400
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.520
 I've seen the words magic helicopter.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.280
 Yeah, well, no.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:08.960
 So basically, you get presents from the baby Jesus.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.200
 You don't get them from Father Christmas.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.560
 So that's why they've dressed up the two traditions together.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.080
 But people ask children, how exactly does that work?

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.840
 How are you getting presents from this baby?

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.480
 And they variously explained, a) that he has a magic helicopter.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.160
 Or b) that he just hasn't, he owns all the toy shops.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.080
 He's just a massive toy magnate.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.440
 And he can afford to give them to children.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.160
 Do you know how the reason he exists, though,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.800
 is because it's too difficult for Jesus on his own

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.400
 to deliver all those presents.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.200
 So, what?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.000
 So, so Nicholas was like a common thing.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.440
 Everyone knew about the Nicholas until about the 1500s.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.400
 And then the Reformation came in and Protestantism came in

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.280
 and they said, Jesus is the only thing.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.320
 And then it was established that there should be a festival

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.760
 where Jesus brings everyone presents on Christmas day,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.080
 on the day of his birth.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.760
 And then it was established that a tiny newborn baby

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.120
 can't handle all these presents and all this present giving.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.040
 And so Father Christmas initially was the sidekick to Jesus.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.480
 This was like, no.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.160
 Post Reformation was the first time he became

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.720
 his co-deliverer of gifts.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.000
 Because it was like, well, he's a tiny baby.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.400
 He can't actually carry all these presents.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.960
 So, um, so Nicholas joined him.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.760
 But a tiny baby would be, could fit down a chimney much more easily

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.680
 than a massive man.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.760
 So, that was why Father Christmas brought Jesus.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.360
 It was a symbiotic relationship.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.440
 But so, are there actual historical stories of the two of them?

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.800
 Like Batman Robyn's Star, which is travelling.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.320
 I refer you to the word "historical" in that sense.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.080
 All right. Shall we move on to our second first?

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.440
 Sure. Okay. It is time for our second fact of the show.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.600
 And that is Anna.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.720
 Yep. My fact this week is that an ancient Greek form

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.960
 of contraception was a suppository made of frankincense,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.000
 mure, and blister beetles.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.800
 This is the thing.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.720
 And blister beetles, by the way, if you don't know what they are,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.440
 they're beetles that cause blisters.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.640
 Um, no, they're, so blister beetles are these things

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.960
 that secrete something called cantharidin,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.920
 which I probably mispronounced, but it's this poison.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.560
 And the reason they secrete it is because they give it to their,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.680
 their, the male gives it to the female during mating,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.520
 as a gift, as like a mating gift, but during sex,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.680
 which is a bit weird, um, and then it's to cover her eggs with it.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.640
 And that stops predators from, you know, getting hold of it,

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.080
 but it's actually very poisonous.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.920
 Um, so a tenth of a milligram can blister your skin really badly,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.160
 but this was a very common medicine,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.520
 so it was used as a contraception.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.560
 You shove it up the bum, and you don't get pregnant.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.480
 That is what traditionally happens when you shove it up the bum.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:52.640
 LAUGHTER

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.720
 Oh, that blister beetle stuff is called Spanish fly, I think.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.120
 Yeah. And it was an aphrodisiac as well.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.920
 Yeah.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.200
 And I think I've written down Casanova and Marquis de Sade.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.400
 I can't remember which one it was,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.080
 but one of them used it as a, um, as an aphrodisiac.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:08.880
 Marquis de Sade.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.640
 And that's what he got said to prison.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.720
 Sorry, if you're using the blister beetles, think...

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.920
 Yeah, I think so, whatever.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.600
 I'm going off memory, but I think that's right.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.880
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.880
 And the idea was, it would make you itchy,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.880
 and you would put it down there, and you would itch yourself,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.920
 and that would turn you off.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.920
 Mmm.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.280
 Nice, eh?

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.400
 Just a bit of history.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.600
 It's just...

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.040
 And a good tip for the room.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.080
 I think.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.520
 LAUGHTER

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.240
 But Frankincense and Merck, come on, let's talk about those.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.040
 Yes. Yes.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.680
 Yeah.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.440
 Frankincense, a bit of a panacea.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.920
 People thought it kind of cured loads of different things.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.560
 Yeah.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.640
 In Oman, it still is a little bit.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.880
 It's been variously used as a stomach suitor,

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.920
 a cough remover, a blood thinner, cold medicine,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.920
 wound cleaner, and fly repellent.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.520
 LAUGHTER

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.320
 And it was really, really popular in Oman.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.640
 It was basically made them one of the most

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.640
 kind of rich countries in the world.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.640
 But not anymore, because the Roman Catholic church

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.880
 buys the cheap stuff from Somalia these days.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.080
 Oh.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.480
 What, um, what is Frankincense?

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.840
 It's incense.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.200
 But it's like Frank of the front.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.200
 You're kidding.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.240
 Is that really what it is?

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:12.560
 Yeah.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.880
 And Frank kind of means honest or whatever.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.240
 It just means really good.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.600
 Really good incense.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.880
 Don't listen.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.080
 It's true.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.520
 I swear to God, that's true.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.560
 That is true.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.760
 Was the incense a bit true?

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.880
 All of it's true.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.760
 The Frank bit as well?

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.640
 Yeah.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.680
 Andy?

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.760
 LAUGHTER

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.280
 Don, the reason I asked was because I had

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.120
 dramatically under-researched on this fact.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.320
 Yeah.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.920
 But it is. And the word Frank to mean sort of really good and honest

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.920
 came from Franks, meaning French people, as well, from the Roman times.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.720
 And in fact, in Roman times, it was so important,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.480
 Frankincense, that Augustus Caesar sent 10,000 troops

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.880
 to invade the area where Frankincense came from,

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.480
 because he thought it was so important.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.360
 Right.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.480
 It's so weird.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.880
 It was so important, Frankincense.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.840
 And so it was medicinally thought to be so important.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.360
 And it wasn't incense.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.280
 And it's from Treesat, basically, isn't it?

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.000
 Which is like Mer, they're both, basically, from Treesap

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 and they're turning to incense.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.240
 But between 1,000 BC and 400 AD,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.600
 Frankincense was the most lucrative trade in the world.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.320
 It was the most valuable thing in the world to be traded

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.080
 for, like, 1,500 years.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.720
 It's amazing.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.360
 And in a man, it's still a really big deal to the extent

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.040
 that they have, I think, roundabouts in a man are quite famous,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.680
 so they're quite well decorated with giant versions of stuff.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.000
 And in quite a lot of roundabouts in a man,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.440
 then they have giant, Frankincense dispensers,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.880
 like, properly huge.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.440
 The size of a building of Frankincense dispenser

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.040
 in the centre of a roundabout.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.120
 I did a little bit on gift giving, OK.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.880
 So because these blister beetles,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.520
 they give a present to their mates during sex.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.800
 And so I looked up--

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.360
 And also called Frankincense and Mer were gifts

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.960
 given to the baby Jesus.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.200
 There are so many links to the thing I've--

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.120
 But you've heard of these spiders that give gifts to the females.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.840
 They're called paratrokelea ornata.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.120
 And they give silk wrapped parcels full of prey.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.360
 And it's really interesting because 70% of them give rubbish gifts,

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.560
 which are worthless.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.920
 They're leftovers.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.960
 It's like basically giving someone an empty selection box.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.800
 Selection box, exactly.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.320
 Because--

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.960
 That's just the bouncy bar left in.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.640
 Exactly.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.520
 It is exactly like that.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.000
 But basically, the male spiders, they can't help themselves

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.080
 from eating most of the present before they

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.600
 give it to the female.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.360
 But I just wrap this nice-- oh god, it's so--

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.520
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.760
 But the spiders-- it's really sensible for the spiders

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.640
 to give a rubbish present to the female.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.720
 Because the females don't judge on what's inside the parcel.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.440
 By the time they open the package,

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.360
 they've already pressed the button to go ahead or not

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.840
 go ahead with the mating.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.560
 And what they judge on is how the male looks

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.800
 is physical condition.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.480
 So the main thing is good body condition.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.640
 So the males who ate their gift to a cleverer,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.480
 because it's better to turn up looking well-fed and in good shape,

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.920
 but with nothing in the box than it

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.040
 is to turn up with an actual meal in the box,

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.000
 but you look hungry.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.160
 Yeah, and you do know that's not going to fly in your own life, do you?

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.280
 The main thing, darling, is that I look good.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:19.320
 I read something really interesting today.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.880
 Have you guys heard the Jesus as an alien theory?

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.400
 No.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.120
 No, Jesus.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.040
 No, no, hang in there.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.040
 This one's really interesting.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.920
 So the idea is that a lot of people think

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.240
 that Jesus is an alien.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.640
 And so because they describe in the Bible that the star,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.800
 they say, low the star, which they saw in the east,

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.720
 went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.920
 And everyone's like, how can a star move like that?

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.840
 That's insane.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.760
 Maybe it wasn't a star.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.400
 Maybe it was a UFO.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.000
 Now, UFO comes guiding these three wise men

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.360
 and three kings from very separate places who all of a sudden are hanging out.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.120
 How's that happen?

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.720
 Were they like a king conference?

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.280
 Like how one was from Persia, one was from India.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.560
 They were all over the shop and suddenly they were on this side.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.600
 They weren't three of them.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.680
 That's not in the Bible.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.720
 And I'm telling a story here.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:16.240
 Then you go, OK, the immaculate conception.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.560
 How did she have the child inside of her?

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.320
 Well, that's very consistent, my friends, with an abduction,

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.320
 where they bring you up and they play something inside you.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:24.920
 Not my theory.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.280
 I'm just saying that the third you marry was anally probed.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.720
 And that's the one time where the bum contraception would not work, Andy.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.200
 Because look what she had, a Jesus.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.040
 So...

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.440
 I cannot believe you've done this to our show.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.880
 What do you mean?

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.960
 This is...

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.680
 Can I tell you something about Jesus?

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.320
 Well, can I ask you something about Jesus?

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.840
 Where was he born?

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.280
 Bethlehem.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.240
 Incorrect.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.000
 Not Bethlehem, he was born in Bethlehem.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.080
 So...

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.280
 What?

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.720
 It's a different Bethlehem.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.320
 There's a Bethlehem in Israel where everyone goes

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.960
 and they're like, "This is the birthplace of Jesus."

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.480
 But Israel has two Bethlehem's.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.960
 And it turns out that the one that is much closer to Nazareth

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.840
 where Jesus was born is a totally different Bethlehem.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.600
 And archaeologists now are saying that actually we've got the wrong one.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.000
 So the place that everyone goes and celebrate the birth of Jesus

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.200
 is completely wrong.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200
 It's somewhere there.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.960
 Yeah, they should be going to area 51.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960
 Yeah.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.960
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.960
 You know, I'm trying to raise the turn.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.960
 Whatever.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.440
 Um, so, do you know what the names of the three wise men were?

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.440
 Yes.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.440
 Balthazar.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440
 Melcule.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:41.440
 Balthazar.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.440
 Melcule.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.440
 And Caspa, yeah.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.440
 Okay.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.440
 And according to a survey by the British Christmas tree,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.440
 Growers Association.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.440
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.440
 Your sourcing is getting worse.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.440
 There is only one place in the world or at least in the UK

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.440
 where there are people with those surnames that all live in that place.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.440
 And it is.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.440
 It's eaten.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.440
 It's eaten in it.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.440
 It's Bedfordshire.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.440
 Bedfordshire.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.440
 Apparently there are people with that names.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:13.440
 And they decided, because presumably it was the slow season for Christmas tree growing,

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.440
 that they'd look at all the different Christmassy names and see where people are.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.440
 There is only one Mr. Scrooge in the whole world.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.440
 And he lives in Canada.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.440
 No.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.440
 There are 16 people in England called Grinch, the surname Grinch.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.440
 Really?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.440
 And there's only one person in the whole UK called Mr. Barbals.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.440
 (LAUGHTER)

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.440
 That's right.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440
 All right.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.440
 Let's move on to our next fact.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.440
 It is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.440
 My factor is that Oregon has 12 times as many Christmas trees as humans.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.440
 Yeah. So this is just a fact about how many Christmas trees there are.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.440
 You've heard the fact.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.440
 It's about...

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.440
 I can't believe that.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.440
 Just how few humans there are in Oregon.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.440
 That's true.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.440
 But it's not.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:02.440
 It's got reasonably healthy human population and just a shitload of Christmas trees.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.440
 So the amazing thing is how it harvests them.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440
 So it harvests them.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.440
 You may have seen this by helicopter to where the...

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.440
 Is that magic helicopter?

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.440
 No, by Jesus.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.440
 It's not about a helicopter.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.440
 I get lifted up in massive bundles and it's incredible to watch an action

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.440
 because they're doing a constant zigzag between the...

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.440
 where the Christmas trees are in bundles and where they need to be loaded.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.440
 And it takes about 26 seconds to fly a few hundred yards from one to the other.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.440
 And then they zip back.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.440
 And one of the pilot trainers, the helicopter pilot, trainers said,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.440
 "It's similar to sprinting down a field, putting someone on your back,

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.440
 piggyback, and then dropping them off, then running back across the field."

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.440
 Which is such an unhelpful energy.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.440
 But in America there's a massive shortage right now.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.440
 Of trees?

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.440
 Yeah, of Christmas trees.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.440
 Right.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.440
 And this is because of the recession.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.440
 When the recession happened was about that amount of time ago

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.440
 that it takes to grow a Christmas tree.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.440
 So just on the ten years.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.440
 So now we've got a massive shortage because people's businesses went to pot

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.440
 and they went into other industries.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.440
 So actually an Oregon, which is one of the main Christmas tree industries,

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.440
 pot growing, marijuana growing is a big industry as well.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.440
 And so a lot of Christmas tree farmers have gone on to marijuana instead.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.440
 So you can't get a Christmas tree, you can get some weed.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.440
 Which does that mean like in what, 15 years time?

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.440
 Everyone will have pot plants.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.440
 Well, pot plants.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.440
 Yeah.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.440
 Really?

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.440
 I guess so.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.440
 Yeah, giant pot plants that they hang baubles and tinsel off and put an angel on top of.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.440
 Wow.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.440
 But there is a shortage, it's a problem.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.440
 Not a huge problem, but it's a problem.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:44.440
 Do you know where Britain has a Eurovision for Christmas trees?

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.440
 I don't know.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.440
 Yeah.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.440
 What?

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.440
 It's from the British Christmas tree growers association.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:57.440
 They have an annual Christmas tree grower of the year competition

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.440
 and they all compete on various metrics of, you know, height and, um,

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.440
 so when you say Eurovision, sorry, is it all of Europe?

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.440
 It's not all of Europe.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.440
 It's all the British Christmas tree growers.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.440
 The only thing that even makes it slightly like Eurovision.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.440
 Is we all ring up to see who wins?

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.440
 Yes.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.440
 It's on BBC One, everyone.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.440
 It's hosted by Graham Nantes.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.440
 It's right, yeah.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.440
 It's gone undercurrent of Cold War rivalry.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.440
 The determines the winner every year.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:34.440
 Is it that they get a vote on each other's trees?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.440
 That's so great.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.440
 But anyway, what happens to the best tree?

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.440
 It's not interesting.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.440
 Though it gets to go outside, downing streets.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.440
 Does it really?

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.440
 Yeah, do you not have us to the runner-up?

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.440
 Right out.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.440
 It's probably a pub.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:04.440
 No, the runner-up gets to go inside downing streets.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.440
 Does it seem amazing?

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.440
 That's the better...

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.440
 That's the better prize.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.440
 You don't get seen by the public and stuff there.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.440
 Yeah, but you get to hear all the juicy goss.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.440
 So you can buy half Christmas trees.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.440
 Have you seen these? They're pretty cool.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.440
 They're plastic ones, but they're basically half a Christmas tree,

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.440
 and you lean it up against your wall.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.440
 That is so clever.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.440
 That is so clever.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.440
 I mean, it's awful, but it is awfully clever.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.440
 They put them up because if you live in a small flat,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.440
 let's say in London, for instance, you don't have that much space,

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.440
 but you still want to see the Christmas tree,

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.440
 then you can have it just half of the wall.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.440
 That's great.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.440
 You can also have agar cells upside down Christmas trees.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.440
 You can see bitters at the bottom, and the fat bitters at the top.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.440
 And that's if you don't have much floor space.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.440
 That's very cool.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.440
 And that used to happen in the 19th century.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.440
 Did it?

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.440
 People hung it upside down from the rafters.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.440
 Yeah, really.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.440
 Yeah, because there was not much floor space.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.440
 Same reason.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.440
 But actually, the Christmas tree industry in the 2000s

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.440
 really hated these plastic trees.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.440
 In 2004, the National Christmas Tree Association of America

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.440
 launched a free online video game

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.440
 called Attack of the Mutant Artificial Christmas Tree.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.440
 And in it, you would throw snowballs at artificial trees

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.440
 that were blamed for sucking the spirit out of Christmas.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.440
 Where is actually artificial trees have been around

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.440
 for almost as long as Christmas trees have been around in popular terms?

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.440
 So feather trees were a thing from the late 19th century.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.440
 Feather trees?

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.440
 Yeah, so the first artificial Christmas trees

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.440
 were made of goose feather.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.440
 And they used to kind of like sort of back comb it.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.440
 So it looked like a tree.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.440
 And then they would paint it.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.440
 And that was an artificial tree

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.440
 because they were really worried about deforestation in the 19th century,

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.440
 which I think is quite interesting.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.440
 And it's still an argument about what's best for the environment

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.440
 like an artificial one or a real one, right?

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.440
 Yeah.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.440
 I read one report and a few of them are kind of very,

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.440
 but one of them says that it's better to use real ones,

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.440
 but not if you're going to use your artificial tree for 20 years or more.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.440
 20 years.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.440
 Basically, 20 years worth of real trees is one plastic one as well.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.440
 But I throw away my plastic one every year.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.440
 Do you know how the Christmas tree was made popular worldwide

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440
 in the way it is today?

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.440
 Like Martin Luther or something?

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.440
 I'm thinking more like commercially popular.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.440
 It was made popular by Queen Victoria, which--

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.440
 So it was in 1846 when Victorian Albert had a Christmas tree

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.440
 because in Germany, Christmas trees were way

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.440
 they celebrated Christmas and Albert came over

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.440
 and he brought that over with him.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.440
 And then this image of their Christmas tree was published

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.440
 in London Illustrated Magazine or something.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.440
 And then it really caught on, because they had this decorated tree.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.440
 And so everyone got this decorated tree.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.440
 But then it caught on in America a couple of years later,

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.440
 because it was in something called Godi's Lady Book.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:05.440
 And it was totally innocent, by the way.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.440
 But what they did was they took this picture

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.440
 and they popularized it in America.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.440
 They thought that Victoria's tiara and Albert's

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.440
 moustache were too British, so they removed them.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.440
 And this was like the early days of Photoshop.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.440
 And that's how the Christmas tree got popular in America.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.440
 Was a moustache-less Albert.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.440
 Can I give you a story from the New York herald

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.440
 in the early 20th century about a cursed Christmas tree?

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.440
 Someone's allergic to cursed Christmas trees over there.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.440
 Chopping the butt of a Christmas tree in prospect this afternoon,

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.440
 William Smith, a farmhand, nearly cut off his great toe.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.440
 Angered, he threw an axe, and it broke a window with struck a child.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.440
 In the face, inflicting a severe cut.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.440
 Wow.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.440
 Can I just say, you're all laughing at a child.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.440
 It's a long time ago.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.440
 It's a different time. It was a different time.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.440
 Trimming the tree later, Mrs. William Scoville fell and broke an ankle.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.440
 Indignant over the chain of events,

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.440
 Howard Scoville, son of the woman, insisted on doing the rest of the work himself,

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.440
 and while testing the candles, set the tree afire,

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.440
 and nearly burned down the farmhouse.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.440
 Believing the tree bewitched, the father, Ambrose Scoville,

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.440
 threw it into the hog pen, where it fell on and killed a chicken.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.440
 I find it amazing that people didn't die constantly from Christmas tree accidents,

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.440
 because before electricity became a thing, they were all lit by candlelight.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.440
 And that was 50, 60 years of just being candles strapped to a tree.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.440
 And they were decorated with snow made out of cotton.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.440
 Yeah.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.440
 So dangerous.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.440
 You could get in the 50s, you could get, it was called flocking, wasn't it?

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.440
 You could get an attachment for your vacuum cleaner,

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:54.440
 which was like a gun to fire artificial snow from your Hoover all over the tree.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.440
 Wow.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.440
 At the candles.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.440
 No way.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.440
 That's so cool.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.440
 I know, isn't it good?

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.440
 And you know, like you're saying, the Christmas tree with Albert and Victoria suddenly took off.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.440
 That was the same for electric Christmas lights that we all have now around our tree.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.440
 That was invented by a guy called Edward Hiberd Johnson,

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.440
 who was the right-hand man to Thomas Edison.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.440
 People were putting candles on their tree.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.440
 They kept burning down and he thought, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to try and make this a thing.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.440
 And it just caught on in the next few years in America just so quickly,

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.440
 because it was just such a beautiful thing.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.440
 And he died of an electric shock.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.440
 No way.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.440
 No way.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.440
 It says citation needed on Wikipedia next to that.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.440
 But.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.440
 But it sounds plausible, doesn't it?

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.440
 Sounds plausible.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.440
 Should we move on to the final fact?

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.440
 To the show?

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.440
 It is time for our final fact of the show.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.440
 And that is James Harkin.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.440
 Okay, my fact this week is the man who brought the phrase Merry Christmas to English

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.440
 was also the first Englishman to use the word Prosecco.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.440
 Was it in the same card?

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.440
 Merry Christmas.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.440
 I have invented Prosecco.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.440
 So he didn't invent it.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.440
 It was invented by some Italian people.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.440
 Sure.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.440
 But he was in Italy at the time.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.440
 He was a traveler called Feins Morrison.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.440
 And he wrote all about Italy and lots of different countries actually.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.440
 And he was traveling around the time.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.440
 It was in the 16th century, late 16th century.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.440
 And it was kind of dangerous to travel around the world really, but especially in Europe.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.440
 There was a time of kind of bad religious strife.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.440
 And he would always, whenever anyone mentioned religion to him, especially around Easter,

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:34.440
 he would immediately move to another city to avoid inquiries.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.440
 When it was in Spain, he pretended to be Czech.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.440
 When he was in France, he pretended to be Polish.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.440
 When he was in Netherlands, he pretended to be German.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.440
 When he was in Italy, he pretended to be Dutch.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.440
 Except when he was in Rome, and he pretended to be French.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.440
 And he traveled without any funds.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.440
 He didn't have any official protection.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.440
 And so whenever there was any problems, he adopted a deferential posture and avoided eye contact.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.440
 That's great.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.440
 That's a good way to travel.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.440
 Yeah.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.440
 Sounds like me on a night out.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.440
 I read something about Feins Morrison.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.440
 This is from the Wikipedia entry on him.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.440
 And I'm quoting exactly here.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:19.440
 His biographer, Charles Hughes, says he had a sane charity for all men except Turks and Irish priests.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:26.440
 Which is another way of saying that he was prejudiced against Turks and Irish priests.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.440
 Yeah, he was.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.440
 He was a man of his time.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.440
 I'm sure.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.440
 But also, no one had seen Prosecco before.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.440
 This was, it was a drink that even Pliny drank.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.440
 And it was also known as Pukinum.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:45.440
 And then he said it was called Pukinum, now called Prosecco, much celebrated by Pliny.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.440
 And when we say it's celebrated by Pliny, we mean sparkling wine, presumably.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440
 Yeah.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.440
 No, I did the sparkling wine with that far back.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.440
 Yeah, because with wine, its default position is often sparkling.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.440
 We get the stuff which they've taken the bubbles out.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.440
 Why?

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.440
 Why do these people treat us like children?

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.440
 Who doesn't want all wine to be sparkling wine?

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.440
 The children love busy stuff.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.440
 Yeah. It's like grown-ups.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:22.440
 But Prosecco, Christmas drink at the moment, the UK consumes 77 million litres of Prosecco last year.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:31.440
 And I worked out that's in the region of the amount of rain that falls on Wembley Stadium in a year.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:40.440
 Also, my favourite thing about Brexit, and it's a long list, is...

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.440
 Thank God, I've got a favourable audience.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.440
 OK, so, no, but is that champagne can be sold by the pint again?

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.440
 So there's always been this weird...

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:58.440
 It's like, cos to me, which is that wine can only be sold in metric and beer can only be sold in imperial.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.440
 But poll Roger always used to sell champagne by the pint.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.440
 It was a bottle that was the size of a pint, wrapping a pint glass.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.440
 Yes, yeah, yeah, a bottle that was the size of the pint.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:11.440
 And Churchill loved poll Roger that was served in Pines. He said it was perfect for lunch.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.440
 And actually, he...

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:21.440
 He actually had poll Roger the champagne manufacturers deliver him a pint of champagne at 11 a.m. every morning,

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.440
 because he was so such a fan of it.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.440
 And now, poll Roger have explicitly said, maybe one of the advantages of leaving the EU,

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.440
 is that we'll be able to sell champagne by the pint again,

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.440
 and they're already preparing to sell champagne by the pint.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.440
 So if you want to be optimistic about the future...

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.440
 This is it.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.440
 Is that one of the battle buses we didn't see?

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:47.440
 Did you know, one of the first battles of the First World War was called the Champagne Offensive?

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.440
 No.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.440
 So it was when the German armies were moving west through the Champagne region

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.440
 and lots of people at the time fled underground to the wine cellars.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.440
 But basically, they learn their lesson in the Champagne region

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:04.440
 because when the German army arrived again in 1940,

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:09.440
 there were false walls built in the wine cellars to conceal the really good stuff.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:16.440
 And supposedly, some houses like Bollinger mislabeled their really good bottles poison.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.440
 They did it.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.440
 It was a real front of the Second World War that we haven't acknowledged so far.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:30.440
 I think there's a book called Wine and War, I think, which has first-hand accounts of winemakers in France

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.440
 who fought the Nazis by withholding their best wine.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.440
 And they're so proud of it.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.440
 So it's so sweet.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.440
 So it was in the Champagne region,

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.440
 and there's one winemaker who bragged about the fact that he watered down his champagne

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.440
 before giving it to the Nazis.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:48.440
 Or he would bottle his worst wines.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.440
 This is in the Champagne region.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:55.440
 He bottle his worst wines and say, "This is the special couvet for the Vermex."

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:01.440
 And there was one guy who said that we got orders from the Nazis to deliver them lots of wine

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.440
 and they made the foolish mistake of not saying which vintage wine they would prefer.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:15.440
 And so we sent them 1,000 bottles of our 1939, which was absolute rubbish.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.440
 And that absolutely taught them.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.440
 I have a fact about wishing people a Merry Christmas.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.440
 OK.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.440
 So this was an experiment that happened in 1974.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.440
 Sociological two sociologists called Philip Kuhns and Michael Walcott.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.440
 They posted nearly 600 Christmas cards to people they didn't know.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.440
 They got the addresses out of the phone book and they sent some high status cards,

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.440
 which were very lavish and fancy and somewhat low status,

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.440
 which were just plain white cards with Merry Christmas written in a red sharpie on the front.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.440
 And they were either signed from Dr. and Mrs. Philip Kuhns or from Philip and Joyce Kuhns.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.440
 And they included a return address saying, "Well, you can send them back to."

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.440
 So they were definitely for people they hadn't met.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:03.440
 And over 20% of people sent a signed card back with varying degrees of detail,

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.440
 some said Merry Christmas, some said pictures of their families to people they had never met,

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:14.440
 some said letters of several pages saying, "What have been going on with them for the last few years?"

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.440
 I know.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.440
 But six people wrote back and directly asked, "How do I know you?"

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.440
 Which is incredibly bauzy to me.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.440
 I wouldn't have the courage to do that.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440
 What was that? 74.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.440
 You can't imagine it would happen today, could you think?

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:36.440
 If you got a random Christmas card through the post, guys, would you respond to it?

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.440
 Well, a few liars, but most people say that.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:45.440
 And my parents, they keep getting a card addressed to the caginaries, and we've no idea who they are.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.440
 But they're right. It arrives like clockwork every year.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.440
 Every year. And the family has grown. It's added several members in this time.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.440
 And they never include the return address, and they keep saying, "We'd love to see you in their new year."

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.440
 Please, please get in touch with them.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.440
 So Wendy, John, if you're listening.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.440
 We need to wrap up, guys. Anything before we do?

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.440
 Some stuff on wine or, as you might know, whatever.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:20.440
 In 2015, Scotland made its first homegrown wine, and it was described as undrinkable by experts.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:26.440
 The guy who produced it said, "It has potential."

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.440
 It doesn't smell fresh.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:36.440
 But I enjoyed it in a bizarre, masochistic way.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.440
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.440
 Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.440
 about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.440
 I'm on @Sriberland. Andy?

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:54.440
 @AduhondaM

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.440
 James?

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.440
 That's James Harkin.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.440
 And Anna?

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.440
 You can email pokos.qi.com.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.440
 Yep, or you can go to our group account, which is @nosuchthing, or you can go to our website.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.440
 Nosuchthing is a fish.com.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.440
 It's got all of our previous episodes. It's got a link to our book.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.440
 We usually give one away at the end of this show.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.440
 So what we're going to do tonight is take one away.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.440
 Thank you so much for being here, guys.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.440
 I was really fun. We'll see you again. Goodbye!

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.440
 (Applause)

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.440
