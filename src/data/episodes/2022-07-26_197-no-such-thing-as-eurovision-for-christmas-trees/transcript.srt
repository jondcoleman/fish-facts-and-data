 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing"

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anaczynski,

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,760
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
 But this time, with our four favorite Christmas

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,360
 facts, because it's our Christmas special.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,280
 And we're up again.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,120
 And in no particular order, here we go, starting with my facts.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,040
 My fact this week is that, as well as getting a visit

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,480
 from Santa Claus at Christmas, Icelanders also get a visit

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,840
 from the spoon liquor, the door snapper, and the sausage

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,360
 swiper.

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,680
 [LAUGHTER]

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,360
 Yeah.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,320
 So these-- they do have Santa there, but they also have--

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,400
 and this is what Wikipedia says they're called, your lads.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,240
 They're like lads.

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,240
 [LAUGHTER]

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,720
 And they-- I think the reason Wikipedia calls them that is,

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,240
 because that's what they are called.

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,080
 Yeah.

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,760
 Oh, OK.

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,280
 OK, cool.

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,760
 Yeah.

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,760
 I mean, so I know you've fallen for fake Wikipedia facts a lot

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,880
 in the past.

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,760
 But this is real.

36
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,480
 I just thought that was called Casualingo.

37
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,840
 I was like, yeah, I'm cool with you, Wiki.

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,280
 So yeah, they're called the your lads.

39
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,080
 And there's 13 of them in total.

40
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,360
 Spoon liquor is one.

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,200
 He licks bowls.

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,760
 No, he licks spoons.

43
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,800
 But there is a bowl liquor.

44
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,520
 There is actually a bowl liquor, yeah.

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,840
 I misread my note there.

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,560
 And then cover it up like it was a joke.

47
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,080
 There's the sausage swiper who licks spoons.

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,640
 And then there--

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,120
 So does a sausage swiper-- he swipes sausages, does he?

50
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,360
 Yeah, so he hides in the rafters of your house.

51
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,120
 And while he goes and check for your spoons,

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,400
 so someone's licked the spoons.

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,440
 You quickly head into the kitchen.

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,640
 He lowers himself.

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,760
 I think Tom Cruise style from "Mission Impossible"

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,320
 gets your sausages and then gets pulled back up to the roof.

57
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,200
 And then you come back in and go, ah, the spoons now,

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
 the sausages, what's going on?

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
 We've had three.

60
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,640
 What are the other 10 light?

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,680
 There's a guy who--

62
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,600
 he harasses sheep.

63
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,960
 No.

64
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,120
 Yeah.

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,440
 What's his-- they all have very expressive names, don't they?

66
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,160
 Yeah, his one's not so sheepcoatclod is his name.

67
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,960
 Yeah.

68
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,120
 There's meat hook.

69
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,080
 They're all thieves, basically, aren't they?

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,560
 Yeah.

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,320
 Just in Iceland, you just have to accept that people

72
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
 will come and steal all your stuff.

73
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,240
 There's pot scraper.

74
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,240
 The doorway sniffer is not someone who likes doorways.

75
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,240
 It's just someone who's smelling beyond the doorway

76
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,040
 to try and steal your food later.

77
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,360
 But they used to be way more of them.

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,160
 So they used to be more than 80-year-olds.

79
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,960
 Whoa.

80
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,840
 Which is a lot to descend upon you.

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,840
 And there are ones that were, you know,

82
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,680
 kiboshed about mid-century, were falda fakeir, which

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,320
 is skirt sweeper.

84
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,560
 He got the shop and literally pungo, which

85
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,800
 are small testicles.

86
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
 What did he do?

87
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,400
 He just went around flattering people.

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,560
 Those are bigger than mine.

89
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,000
 I've got small ones, so it's, yeah.

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
 So do these guys bring you anything?

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,560
 They just take things away.

92
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,720
 They take things-- well, they used to take things away.

93
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,080
 And back in the day, in 1746, the stories

94
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,400
 became so scary that they actually

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,840
 banned them from telling them to children,

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,960
 because they brought them into such a sort of Stephen King-esque

97
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,400
 territory of fear that they said this is too much.

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,880
 It was the Danish, wasn't it, who did that?

99
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,080
 And not only that, they banned using any stories

100
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,520
 to scare children.

101
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,040
 Yeah.

102
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,160
 And it was because of these guys.

103
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,680
 Really?

104
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,600
 It wasn't only because of them.

105
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,680
 So have you heard of Iceland's famous Christmas child

106
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,720
 eating cat, who prowls around the country, eating children?

107
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,120
 Oh, Christmas day.

108
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,800
 And the terrible thing is, so you know, if you're naughty or nice,

109
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,080
 you'll get presents or you get a lump of coal.

110
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,000
 The child has no control over whether it's eaten or not.

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,680
 The only thing that controls whether the child is eaten or not

112
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,600
 is whether the child got any new clothes for Christmas

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,320
 from his parents.

114
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,640
 And if your parents didn't give you some socks,

115
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,160
 you're going to be eaten.

116
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
 There is a slight thing with that with,

117
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,720
 if you've done all of your chores by Christmas day,

118
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
 then they're supposed to give you some clothes.

119
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,760
 But they could not.

120
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,840
 I just, I'm saying, it really would be a pretty harsh bit

121
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,160
 of parenting, isn't it?

122
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,200
 Just think it-- yeah.

123
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,000
 It's insult to injury, isn't it?

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 A, you're not getting a new t-shirt and B,

125
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,600
 you're about to be eaten by a giant cat.

126
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,800
 Yeah, it was a big cat, though, isn't it?

127
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,840
 It was like the size of a house.

128
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,280
 And it belonged to a troll, right?

129
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,200
 So it was like--

130
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,720
 Katie Hopkins.

131
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,200
 This is all still, I say.

132
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:15,520
 Satire, we don't do that, Dave's come on.

133
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,400
 We welcome all people in our pockets.

134
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,280
 She-- no, there's no--

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,640
 We honestly do not.

136
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,600
 She is not invited to anything that would--

137
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,280
 I'd like to publicly state, Katie Hopkins.

138
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,960
 Fuck you.

139
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
 That's a--

140
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,200
 [APPLAUSE]

141
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,440
 Was that Satire or was that--

142
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,800
 No, it's not Satire.

143
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,080
 My satirical show is not going down.

144
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
 Hey, Trump, fuck you.

145
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,200
 Hey, front, fuck you.

146
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,320
 Catch you next week on "Settlers Today."

147
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,880
 What were we talking about, Iceland?

148
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,400
 Yeah.

149
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,720
 So these, these UL ads, their mother is called "Gruler."

150
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
 She's been married three times, but she

151
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,080
 killed all of her husbands because they bought her.

152
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,600
 Wow.

153
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,960
 My wife is in the audience, and I just

154
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,680
 like to say that's not the right way to behave like that.

155
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
 And she is the mother of the UL ads?

156
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,840
 No, she's just my wife.

157
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,640
 No.

158
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,080
 [LAUGHTER]

159
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,920
 And she is half-oga, half-troll.

160
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:23,880
 And I am referring here to "Gruler" and their cat is Christmas

161
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,640
 cat.

162
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,120
 The family cat is Christmas cat.

163
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,320
 And the cat brings-- oh, the UL ads sometimes

164
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,040
 grab to children and brought them back to be turned into stew.

165
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,880
 But this is all just to deter children from misbehaving.

166
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,360
 It's not anything worse than what we do, which is Santa

167
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,280
 won't bring you presents if you're banned.

168
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,000
 Should we talk about Father Christmas?

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,520
 Yeah, sure.

170
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,480
 Because you know he is leaking.

171
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,000
 Sorry.

172
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,520
 Wow.

173
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,720
 His bones, Father Christmas, has bones.

174
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,360
 So this is St. Nicholas, and he has some relics.

175
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,680
 And it's kind of debatable which relics are his,

176
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,400
 but it's generally accepted that he has some in Italy.

177
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,480
 And they leak.

178
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,280
 It's a clear liquid that is called

179
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,920
 sort of manner by the priest who guard the tomb.

180
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,440
 And it can sell for a good manner.

181
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,680
 Oh, camera, it's surprising, wow.

182
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,240
 But I think it's because he's in this place called

183
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,360
 Barry in Italy, which is a harbour town.

184
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,000
 So it's below sea level, in fact.

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,480
 So the harbour water tends to seep into where he's entombed.

186
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,040
 And then every year they have this festival where he will come.

187
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,960
 Oh, holy fish has come in this morning.

188
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,920
 Yeah, exactly.

189
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,120
 It's like the great story of Jesus.

190
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,800
 He makes fish out of the Santa.

191
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,320
 There is a place where, I think it's South America.

192
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,640
 Yeah, it's part of Latin America.

193
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,080
 Father, baby, the bot, hang on.

194
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,120
 The models of baby Jesus are dressed up like Father Christmas.

195
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,800
 Yeah, there's this weird synergy

196
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,720
 between Jesus and Father Christmas.

197
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,360
 Really?

198
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,680
 Yeah, I can't find it in my 19th century.

199
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,640
 I am panicking like crazy.

200
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,400
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

201
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,520
 I've seen the words magic helicopter.

202
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
 Yeah, well, no.

203
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,960
 So basically, you get presents from the baby Jesus.

204
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,200
 You don't get them from Father Christmas.

205
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,560
 So that's why they've dressed up the two traditions together.

206
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,080
 But people ask children, how exactly does that work?

207
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,840
 How are you getting presents from this baby?

208
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,480
 And they variously explained, a) that he has a magic helicopter.

209
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,160
 Or b) that he just hasn't, he owns all the toy shops.

210
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,080
 He's just a massive toy magnate.

211
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,440
 And he can afford to give them to children.

212
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,160
 Do you know how the reason he exists, though,

213
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,800
 is because it's too difficult for Jesus on his own

214
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,400
 to deliver all those presents.

215
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,200
 So, what?

216
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,000
 So, so Nicholas was like a common thing.

217
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,440
 Everyone knew about the Nicholas until about the 1500s.

218
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,400
 And then the Reformation came in and Protestantism came in

219
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,280
 and they said, Jesus is the only thing.

220
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,320
 And then it was established that there should be a festival

221
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,760
 where Jesus brings everyone presents on Christmas day,

222
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,080
 on the day of his birth.

223
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,760
 And then it was established that a tiny newborn baby

224
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,120
 can't handle all these presents and all this present giving.

225
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,040
 And so Father Christmas initially was the sidekick to Jesus.

226
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,480
 This was like, no.

227
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,160
 Post Reformation was the first time he became

228
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,720
 his co-deliverer of gifts.

229
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,000
 Because it was like, well, he's a tiny baby.

230
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,400
 He can't actually carry all these presents.

231
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,960
 So, um, so Nicholas joined him.

232
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,760
 But a tiny baby would be, could fit down a chimney much more easily

233
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
 than a massive man.

234
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
 So, that was why Father Christmas brought Jesus.

235
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,360
 It was a symbiotic relationship.

236
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,440
 But so, are there actual historical stories of the two of them?

237
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,800
 Like Batman Robyn's Star, which is travelling.

238
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,320
 I refer you to the word "historical" in that sense.

239
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,080
 All right. Shall we move on to our second first?

240
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,440
 Sure. Okay. It is time for our second fact of the show.

241
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,600
 And that is Anna.

242
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,720
 Yep. My fact this week is that an ancient Greek form

243
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,960
 of contraception was a suppository made of frankincense,

244
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,000
 mure, and blister beetles.

245
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
 This is the thing.

246
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,720
 And blister beetles, by the way, if you don't know what they are,

247
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,440
 they're beetles that cause blisters.

248
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,640
 Um, no, they're, so blister beetles are these things

249
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,960
 that secrete something called cantharidin,

250
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,920
 which I probably mispronounced, but it's this poison.

251
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,560
 And the reason they secrete it is because they give it to their,

252
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,680
 their, the male gives it to the female during mating,

253
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,520
 as a gift, as like a mating gift, but during sex,

254
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,680
 which is a bit weird, um, and then it's to cover her eggs with it.

255
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,640
 And that stops predators from, you know, getting hold of it,

256
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,080
 but it's actually very poisonous.

257
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,920
 Um, so a tenth of a milligram can blister your skin really badly,

258
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,160
 but this was a very common medicine,

259
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,520
 so it was used as a contraception.

260
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,560
 You shove it up the bum, and you don't get pregnant.

261
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,480
 That is what traditionally happens when you shove it up the bum.

262
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:52,640
 LAUGHTER

263
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,720
 Oh, that blister beetle stuff is called Spanish fly, I think.

264
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
 Yeah. And it was an aphrodisiac as well.

265
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,920
 Yeah.

266
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,200
 And I think I've written down Casanova and Marquis de Sade.

267
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
 I can't remember which one it was,

268
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,080
 but one of them used it as a, um, as an aphrodisiac.

269
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,880
 Marquis de Sade.

270
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,640
 And that's what he got said to prison.

271
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,720
 Sorry, if you're using the blister beetles, think...

272
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,920
 Yeah, I think so, whatever.

273
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,600
 I'm going off memory, but I think that's right.

274
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,880
 Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
 And the idea was, it would make you itchy,

276
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
 and you would put it down there, and you would itch yourself,

277
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,920
 and that would turn you off.

278
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
 Mmm.

279
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,320
 Oh, yeah.

280
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,280
 Nice, eh?

281
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,400
 Just a bit of history.

282
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,600
 It's just...

283
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,040
 And a good tip for the room.

284
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,080
 I think.

285
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,520
 LAUGHTER

286
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,240
 But Frankincense and Merck, come on, let's talk about those.

287
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,040
 Yes. Yes.

288
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,680
 Yeah.

289
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
 Frankincense, a bit of a panacea.

290
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
 People thought it kind of cured loads of different things.

291
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,560
 Yeah.

292
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
 In Oman, it still is a little bit.

293
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
 It's been variously used as a stomach suitor,

294
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,920
 a cough remover, a blood thinner, cold medicine,

295
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
 wound cleaner, and fly repellent.

296
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,520
 LAUGHTER

297
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,320
 And it was really, really popular in Oman.

298
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,640
 It was basically made them one of the most

299
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
 kind of rich countries in the world.

300
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
 But not anymore, because the Roman Catholic church

301
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,880
 buys the cheap stuff from Somalia these days.

302
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,080
 Oh.

303
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,480
 What, um, what is Frankincense?

304
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,840
 It's incense.

305
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,200
 But it's like Frank of the front.

306
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
 You're kidding.

307
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,240
 Is that really what it is?

308
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,560
 Yeah.

309
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,880
 And Frank kind of means honest or whatever.

310
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,240
 It just means really good.

311
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,600
 Really good incense.

312
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,880
 Don't listen.

313
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,080
 It's true.

314
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,520
 I swear to God, that's true.

315
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,560
 That is true.

316
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,760
 Was the incense a bit true?

317
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,880
 All of it's true.

318
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,760
 The Frank bit as well?

319
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,640
 Yeah.

320
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,680
 Andy?

321
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,760
 LAUGHTER

322
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,280
 Don, the reason I asked was because I had

323
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,120
 dramatically under-researched on this fact.

324
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,320
 Yeah.

325
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,920
 But it is. And the word Frank to mean sort of really good and honest

326
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,920
 came from Franks, meaning French people, as well, from the Roman times.

327
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,720
 And in fact, in Roman times, it was so important,

328
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,480
 Frankincense, that Augustus Caesar sent 10,000 troops

329
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,880
 to invade the area where Frankincense came from,

330
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,480
 because he thought it was so important.

331
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,360
 Right.

332
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,480
 It's so weird.

333
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,880
 It was so important, Frankincense.

334
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,840
 And so it was medicinally thought to be so important.

335
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,360
 And it wasn't incense.

336
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,280
 And it's from Treesat, basically, isn't it?

337
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,000
 Which is like Mer, they're both, basically, from Treesap

338
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 and they're turning to incense.

339
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,240
 But between 1,000 BC and 400 AD,

340
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,600
 Frankincense was the most lucrative trade in the world.

341
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,320
 It was the most valuable thing in the world to be traded

342
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,080
 for, like, 1,500 years.

343
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,720
 It's amazing.

344
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,360
 And in a man, it's still a really big deal to the extent

345
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,040
 that they have, I think, roundabouts in a man are quite famous,

346
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,680
 so they're quite well decorated with giant versions of stuff.

347
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,000
 And in quite a lot of roundabouts in a man,

348
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,440
 then they have giant, Frankincense dispensers,

349
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,880
 like, properly huge.

350
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,440
 The size of a building of Frankincense dispenser

351
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,040
 in the centre of a roundabout.

352
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
 I did a little bit on gift giving, OK.

353
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,880
 So because these blister beetles,

354
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,520
 they give a present to their mates during sex.

355
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,800
 And so I looked up--

356
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,360
 And also called Frankincense and Mer were gifts

357
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,960
 given to the baby Jesus.

358
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,200
 There are so many links to the thing I've--

359
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,120
 But you've heard of these spiders that give gifts to the females.

360
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,840
 They're called paratrokelea ornata.

361
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,120
 And they give silk wrapped parcels full of prey.

362
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,360
 And it's really interesting because 70% of them give rubbish gifts,

363
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,560
 which are worthless.

364
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,920
 They're leftovers.

365
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,960
 It's like basically giving someone an empty selection box.

366
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,800
 Selection box, exactly.

367
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,320
 Because--

368
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,960
 That's just the bouncy bar left in.

369
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,640
 Exactly.

370
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,520
 It is exactly like that.

371
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,000
 But basically, the male spiders, they can't help themselves

372
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,080
 from eating most of the present before they

373
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,600
 give it to the female.

374
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,360
 But I just wrap this nice-- oh god, it's so--

375
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,520
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

376
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,760
 But the spiders-- it's really sensible for the spiders

377
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,640
 to give a rubbish present to the female.

378
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,720
 Because the females don't judge on what's inside the parcel.

379
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,440
 By the time they open the package,

380
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,360
 they've already pressed the button to go ahead or not

381
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,840
 go ahead with the mating.

382
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,560
 And what they judge on is how the male looks

383
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,800
 is physical condition.

384
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,480
 So the main thing is good body condition.

385
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,640
 So the males who ate their gift to a cleverer,

386
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,480
 because it's better to turn up looking well-fed and in good shape,

387
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,920
 but with nothing in the box than it

388
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,040
 is to turn up with an actual meal in the box,

389
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,000
 but you look hungry.

390
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,160
 Yeah, and you do know that's not going to fly in your own life, do you?

391
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,280
 The main thing, darling, is that I look good.

392
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,320
 I read something really interesting today.

393
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,880
 Have you guys heard the Jesus as an alien theory?

394
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,400
 No.

395
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,120
 No, Jesus.

396
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,040
 No, no, hang in there.

397
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,040
 This one's really interesting.

398
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,920
 So the idea is that a lot of people think

399
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,240
 that Jesus is an alien.

400
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,640
 And so because they describe in the Bible that the star,

401
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,800
 they say, low the star, which they saw in the east,

402
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,720
 went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was.

403
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,920
 And everyone's like, how can a star move like that?

404
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,840
 That's insane.

405
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,760
 Maybe it wasn't a star.

406
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,400
 Maybe it was a UFO.

407
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,000
 Now, UFO comes guiding these three wise men

408
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,360
 and three kings from very separate places who all of a sudden are hanging out.

409
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,120
 How's that happen?

410
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
 Were they like a king conference?

411
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,280
 Like how one was from Persia, one was from India.

412
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,560
 They were all over the shop and suddenly they were on this side.

413
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,600
 They weren't three of them.

414
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,680
 That's not in the Bible.

415
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,720
 And I'm telling a story here.

416
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,240
 Then you go, OK, the immaculate conception.

417
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,560
 How did she have the child inside of her?

418
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,320
 Well, that's very consistent, my friends, with an abduction,

419
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,320
 where they bring you up and they play something inside you.

420
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,920
 Not my theory.

421
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,280
 I'm just saying that the third you marry was anally probed.

422
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,720
 And that's the one time where the bum contraception would not work, Andy.

423
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,200
 Because look what she had, a Jesus.

424
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,040
 So...

425
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,440
 I cannot believe you've done this to our show.

426
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,880
 What do you mean?

427
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,960
 This is...

428
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,680
 Can I tell you something about Jesus?

429
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,320
 Well, can I ask you something about Jesus?

430
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,840
 Where was he born?

431
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,280
 Bethlehem.

432
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,240
 Incorrect.

433
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,000
 Not Bethlehem, he was born in Bethlehem.

434
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,080
 So...

435
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,280
 What?

436
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,720
 It's a different Bethlehem.

437
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,320
 There's a Bethlehem in Israel where everyone goes

438
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,960
 and they're like, "This is the birthplace of Jesus."

439
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,480
 But Israel has two Bethlehem's.

440
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,960
 And it turns out that the one that is much closer to Nazareth

441
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,840
 where Jesus was born is a totally different Bethlehem.

442
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,600
 And archaeologists now are saying that actually we've got the wrong one.

443
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,000
 So the place that everyone goes and celebrate the birth of Jesus

444
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,200
 is completely wrong.

445
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 It's somewhere there.

446
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,960
 Yeah, they should be going to area 51.

447
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
 Yeah.

448
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
 (LAUGHTER)

449
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,960
 You know, I'm trying to raise the turn.

450
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
 Whatever.

451
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,440
 Um, so, do you know what the names of the three wise men were?

452
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
 Yes.

453
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
 Balthazar.

454
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
 Melcule.

455
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:41,440
 Balthazar.

456
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
 Melcule.

457
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
 And Caspa, yeah.

458
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
 Okay.

459
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
 And according to a survey by the British Christmas tree,

460
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
 Growers Association.

461
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,440
 (LAUGHTER)

462
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,440
 Your sourcing is getting worse.

463
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,440
 There is only one place in the world or at least in the UK

464
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
 where there are people with those surnames that all live in that place.

465
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
 And it is.

466
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
 It's eaten.

467
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
 It's eaten in it.

468
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
 It's Bedfordshire.

469
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
 Oh, yeah.

470
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,440
 Bedfordshire.

471
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
 Apparently there are people with that names.

472
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,440
 And they decided, because presumably it was the slow season for Christmas tree growing,

473
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,440
 that they'd look at all the different Christmassy names and see where people are.

474
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,440
 There is only one Mr. Scrooge in the whole world.

475
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
 And he lives in Canada.

476
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
 No.

477
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,440
 There are 16 people in England called Grinch, the surname Grinch.

478
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
 Really?

479
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,440
 And there's only one person in the whole UK called Mr. Barbals.

480
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,440
 (LAUGHTER)

481
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
 That's right.

482
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
 All right.

483
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
 Let's move on to our next fact.

484
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
 It is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

485
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,440
 My factor is that Oregon has 12 times as many Christmas trees as humans.

486
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,440
 Yeah. So this is just a fact about how many Christmas trees there are.

487
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
 You've heard the fact.

488
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
 It's about...

489
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
 I can't believe that.

490
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
 Just how few humans there are in Oregon.

491
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
 That's true.

492
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
 But it's not.

493
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,440
 It's got reasonably healthy human population and just a shitload of Christmas trees.

494
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,440
 So the amazing thing is how it harvests them.

495
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
 So it harvests them.

496
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,440
 You may have seen this by helicopter to where the...

497
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
 Is that magic helicopter?

498
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,440
 No, by Jesus.

499
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
 It's not about a helicopter.

500
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,440
 I get lifted up in massive bundles and it's incredible to watch an action

501
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,440
 because they're doing a constant zigzag between the...

502
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
 where the Christmas trees are in bundles and where they need to be loaded.

503
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,440
 And it takes about 26 seconds to fly a few hundred yards from one to the other.

504
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,440
 And then they zip back.

505
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,440
 And one of the pilot trainers, the helicopter pilot, trainers said,

506
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,440
 "It's similar to sprinting down a field, putting someone on your back,

507
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,440
 piggyback, and then dropping them off, then running back across the field."

508
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,440
 Which is such an unhelpful energy.

509
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,440
 But in America there's a massive shortage right now.

510
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
 Of trees?

511
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
 Yeah, of Christmas trees.

512
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
 Right.

513
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
 And this is because of the recession.

514
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,440
 When the recession happened was about that amount of time ago

515
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
 that it takes to grow a Christmas tree.

516
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
 So just on the ten years.

517
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,440
 So now we've got a massive shortage because people's businesses went to pot

518
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
 and they went into other industries.

519
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,440
 So actually an Oregon, which is one of the main Christmas tree industries,

520
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,440
 pot growing, marijuana growing is a big industry as well.

521
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,440
 And so a lot of Christmas tree farmers have gone on to marijuana instead.

522
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,440
 So you can't get a Christmas tree, you can get some weed.

523
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,440
 Which does that mean like in what, 15 years time?

524
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,440
 Everyone will have pot plants.

525
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
 Well, pot plants.

526
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
 Yeah.

527
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
 Really?

528
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
 I guess so.

529
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,440
 Yeah, giant pot plants that they hang baubles and tinsel off and put an angel on top of.

530
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
 Wow.

531
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,440
 But there is a shortage, it's a problem.

532
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
 Not a huge problem, but it's a problem.

533
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,440
 Do you know where Britain has a Eurovision for Christmas trees?

534
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
 I don't know.

535
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
 Yeah.

536
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
 What?

537
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,440
 It's from the British Christmas tree growers association.

538
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,440
 They have an annual Christmas tree grower of the year competition

539
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,440
 and they all compete on various metrics of, you know, height and, um,

540
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,440
 so when you say Eurovision, sorry, is it all of Europe?

541
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
 It's not all of Europe.

542
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,440
 It's all the British Christmas tree growers.

543
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,440
 The only thing that even makes it slightly like Eurovision.

544
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
 Is we all ring up to see who wins?

545
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
 Yes.

546
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
 It's on BBC One, everyone.

547
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,440
 It's hosted by Graham Nantes.

548
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
 It's right, yeah.

549
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,440
 It's gone undercurrent of Cold War rivalry.

550
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,440
 The determines the winner every year.

551
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:34,440
 Is it that they get a vote on each other's trees?

552
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,440
 That's so great.

553
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,440
 But anyway, what happens to the best tree?

554
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,440
 It's not interesting.

555
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,440
 Though it gets to go outside, downing streets.

556
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
 Does it really?

557
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,440
 Yeah, do you not have us to the runner-up?

558
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
 Right out.

559
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,440
 It's probably a pub.

560
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,440
 No, the runner-up gets to go inside downing streets.

561
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,440
 Does it seem amazing?

562
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
 That's the better...

563
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
 That's the better prize.

564
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,440
 You don't get seen by the public and stuff there.

565
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,440
 Yeah, but you get to hear all the juicy goss.

566
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,440
 So you can buy half Christmas trees.

567
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
 Have you seen these? They're pretty cool.

568
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,440
 They're plastic ones, but they're basically half a Christmas tree,

569
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
 and you lean it up against your wall.

570
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
 That is so clever.

571
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
 That is so clever.

572
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,440
 I mean, it's awful, but it is awfully clever.

573
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,440
 They put them up because if you live in a small flat,

574
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,440
 let's say in London, for instance, you don't have that much space,

575
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
 but you still want to see the Christmas tree,

576
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,440
 then you can have it just half of the wall.

577
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
 That's great.

578
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,440
 You can also have agar cells upside down Christmas trees.

579
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,440
 You can see bitters at the bottom, and the fat bitters at the top.

580
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,440
 And that's if you don't have much floor space.

581
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
 That's very cool.

582
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,440
 And that used to happen in the 19th century.

583
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
 Did it?

584
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,440
 People hung it upside down from the rafters.

585
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
 Yeah, really.

586
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
 Yeah, because there was not much floor space.

587
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
 Same reason.

588
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
 But actually, the Christmas tree industry in the 2000s

589
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
 really hated these plastic trees.

590
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,440
 In 2004, the National Christmas Tree Association of America

591
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,440
 launched a free online video game

592
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,440
 called Attack of the Mutant Artificial Christmas Tree.

593
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,440
 And in it, you would throw snowballs at artificial trees

594
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,440
 that were blamed for sucking the spirit out of Christmas.

595
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
 Where is actually artificial trees have been around

596
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,440
 for almost as long as Christmas trees have been around in popular terms?

597
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,440
 So feather trees were a thing from the late 19th century.

598
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
 Feather trees?

599
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,440
 Yeah, so the first artificial Christmas trees

600
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
 were made of goose feather.

601
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,440
 And they used to kind of like sort of back comb it.

602
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
 So it looked like a tree.

603
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
 And then they would paint it.

604
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
 And that was an artificial tree

605
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,440
 because they were really worried about deforestation in the 19th century,

606
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
 which I think is quite interesting.

607
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,440
 And it's still an argument about what's best for the environment

608
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
 like an artificial one or a real one, right?

609
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
 Yeah.

610
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
 I read one report and a few of them are kind of very,

611
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,440
 but one of them says that it's better to use real ones,

612
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,440
 but not if you're going to use your artificial tree for 20 years or more.

613
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
 20 years.

614
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,440
 Basically, 20 years worth of real trees is one plastic one as well.

615
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
 But I throw away my plastic one every year.

616
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,440
 [LAUGHTER]

617
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,440
 Do you know how the Christmas tree was made popular worldwide

618
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
 in the way it is today?

619
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
 Like Martin Luther or something?

620
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
 I'm thinking more like commercially popular.

621
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,440
 It was made popular by Queen Victoria, which--

622
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,440
 So it was in 1846 when Victorian Albert had a Christmas tree

623
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
 because in Germany, Christmas trees were way

624
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,440
 they celebrated Christmas and Albert came over

625
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
 and he brought that over with him.

626
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,440
 And then this image of their Christmas tree was published

627
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
 in London Illustrated Magazine or something.

628
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,440
 And then it really caught on, because they had this decorated tree.

629
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
 And so everyone got this decorated tree.

630
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,440
 But then it caught on in America a couple of years later,

631
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,440
 because it was in something called Godi's Lady Book.

632
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,440
 And it was totally innocent, by the way.

633
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,440
 But what they did was they took this picture

634
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,440
 and they popularized it in America.

635
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,440
 They thought that Victoria's tiara and Albert's

636
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,440
 moustache were too British, so they removed them.

637
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
 And this was like the early days of Photoshop.

638
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,440
 And that's how the Christmas tree got popular in America.

639
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
 Was a moustache-less Albert.

640
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,440
 Can I give you a story from the New York herald

641
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,440
 in the early 20th century about a cursed Christmas tree?

642
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,440
 Someone's allergic to cursed Christmas trees over there.

643
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,440
 Chopping the butt of a Christmas tree in prospect this afternoon,

644
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,440
 William Smith, a farmhand, nearly cut off his great toe.

645
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,440
 Angered, he threw an axe, and it broke a window with struck a child.

646
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,440
 In the face, inflicting a severe cut.

647
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
 Wow.

648
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
 Can I just say, you're all laughing at a child.

649
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
 It's a long time ago.

650
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,440
 It's a different time. It was a different time.

651
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,440
 Trimming the tree later, Mrs. William Scoville fell and broke an ankle.

652
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
 Indignant over the chain of events,

653
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,440
 Howard Scoville, son of the woman, insisted on doing the rest of the work himself,

654
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,440
 and while testing the candles, set the tree afire,

655
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,440
 and nearly burned down the farmhouse.

656
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,440
 Believing the tree bewitched, the father, Ambrose Scoville,

657
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,440
 threw it into the hog pen, where it fell on and killed a chicken.

658
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,440
 I find it amazing that people didn't die constantly from Christmas tree accidents,

659
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,440
 because before electricity became a thing, they were all lit by candlelight.

660
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,440
 And that was 50, 60 years of just being candles strapped to a tree.

661
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,440
 And they were decorated with snow made out of cotton.

662
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,440
 Yeah.

663
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
 So dangerous.

664
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,440
 You could get in the 50s, you could get, it was called flocking, wasn't it?

665
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,440
 You could get an attachment for your vacuum cleaner,

666
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,440
 which was like a gun to fire artificial snow from your Hoover all over the tree.

667
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
 Wow.

668
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
 At the candles.

669
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
 No way.

670
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
 That's so cool.

671
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
 I know, isn't it good?

672
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,440
 And you know, like you're saying, the Christmas tree with Albert and Victoria suddenly took off.

673
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,440
 That was the same for electric Christmas lights that we all have now around our tree.

674
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,440
 That was invented by a guy called Edward Hiberd Johnson,

675
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,440
 who was the right-hand man to Thomas Edison.

676
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
 People were putting candles on their tree.

677
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,440
 They kept burning down and he thought, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to try and make this a thing.

678
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,440
 And it just caught on in the next few years in America just so quickly,

679
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
 because it was just such a beautiful thing.

680
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
 And he died of an electric shock.

681
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
 No way.

682
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
 No way.

683
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,440
 It says citation needed on Wikipedia next to that.

684
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
 But.

685
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,440
 But it sounds plausible, doesn't it?

686
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
 Sounds plausible.

687
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
 Should we move on to the final fact?

688
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
 To the show?

689
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,440
 It is time for our final fact of the show.

690
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
 And that is James Harkin.

691
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,440
 Okay, my fact this week is the man who brought the phrase Merry Christmas to English

692
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,440
 was also the first Englishman to use the word Prosecco.

693
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,440
 Was it in the same card?

694
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
 Merry Christmas.

695
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,440
 I have invented Prosecco.

696
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,440
 So he didn't invent it.

697
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,440
 It was invented by some Italian people.

698
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
 Sure.

699
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
 But he was in Italy at the time.

700
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,440
 He was a traveler called Feins Morrison.

701
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,440
 And he wrote all about Italy and lots of different countries actually.

702
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,440
 And he was traveling around the time.

703
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
 It was in the 16th century, late 16th century.

704
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,440
 And it was kind of dangerous to travel around the world really, but especially in Europe.

705
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,440
 There was a time of kind of bad religious strife.

706
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,440
 And he would always, whenever anyone mentioned religion to him, especially around Easter,

707
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,440
 he would immediately move to another city to avoid inquiries.

708
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,440
 When it was in Spain, he pretended to be Czech.

709
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,440
 When he was in France, he pretended to be Polish.

710
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,440
 When he was in Netherlands, he pretended to be German.

711
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,440
 When he was in Italy, he pretended to be Dutch.

712
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,440
 Except when he was in Rome, and he pretended to be French.

713
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,440
 And he traveled without any funds.

714
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,440
 He didn't have any official protection.

715
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,440
 And so whenever there was any problems, he adopted a deferential posture and avoided eye contact.

716
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
 That's great.

717
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
 That's a good way to travel.

718
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
 Yeah.

719
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,440
 Sounds like me on a night out.

720
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,440
 I read something about Feins Morrison.

721
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
 This is from the Wikipedia entry on him.

722
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,440
 And I'm quoting exactly here.

723
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:19,440
 His biographer, Charles Hughes, says he had a sane charity for all men except Turks and Irish priests.

724
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,440
 Which is another way of saying that he was prejudiced against Turks and Irish priests.

725
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
 Yeah, he was.

726
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
 He was a man of his time.

727
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
 I'm sure.

728
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,440
 But also, no one had seen Prosecco before.

729
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,440
 This was, it was a drink that even Pliny drank.

730
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,440
 And it was also known as Pukinum.

731
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,440
 And then he said it was called Pukinum, now called Prosecco, much celebrated by Pliny.

732
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,440
 And when we say it's celebrated by Pliny, we mean sparkling wine, presumably.

733
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
 Yeah.

734
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
 No, I did the sparkling wine with that far back.

735
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,440
 Yeah, because with wine, its default position is often sparkling.

736
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,440
 We get the stuff which they've taken the bubbles out.

737
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
 Why?

738
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,440
 Why do these people treat us like children?

739
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,440
 Who doesn't want all wine to be sparkling wine?

740
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
 The children love busy stuff.

741
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,440
 Yeah. It's like grown-ups.

742
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:22,440
 But Prosecco, Christmas drink at the moment, the UK consumes 77 million litres of Prosecco last year.

743
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:31,440
 And I worked out that's in the region of the amount of rain that falls on Wembley Stadium in a year.

744
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:40,440
 Also, my favourite thing about Brexit, and it's a long list, is...

745
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,440
 Thank God, I've got a favourable audience.

746
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,440
 OK, so, no, but is that champagne can be sold by the pint again?

747
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,440
 So there's always been this weird...

748
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:58,440
 It's like, cos to me, which is that wine can only be sold in metric and beer can only be sold in imperial.

749
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,440
 But poll Roger always used to sell champagne by the pint.

750
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,440
 It was a bottle that was the size of a pint, wrapping a pint glass.

751
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
 Yes, yeah, yeah, a bottle that was the size of the pint.

752
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,440
 And Churchill loved poll Roger that was served in Pines. He said it was perfect for lunch.

753
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,440
 And actually, he...

754
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:21,440
 He actually had poll Roger the champagne manufacturers deliver him a pint of champagne at 11 a.m. every morning,

755
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
 because he was so such a fan of it.

756
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,440
 And now, poll Roger have explicitly said, maybe one of the advantages of leaving the EU,

757
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,440
 is that we'll be able to sell champagne by the pint again,

758
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,440
 and they're already preparing to sell champagne by the pint.

759
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,440
 So if you want to be optimistic about the future...

760
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
 This is it.

761
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
 Is that one of the battle buses we didn't see?

762
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,440
 Did you know, one of the first battles of the First World War was called the Champagne Offensive?

763
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
 No.

764
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,440
 So it was when the German armies were moving west through the Champagne region

765
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,440
 and lots of people at the time fled underground to the wine cellars.

766
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,440
 But basically, they learn their lesson in the Champagne region

767
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,440
 because when the German army arrived again in 1940,

768
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,440
 there were false walls built in the wine cellars to conceal the really good stuff.

769
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,440
 And supposedly, some houses like Bollinger mislabeled their really good bottles poison.

770
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,440
 They did it.

771
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,440
 It was a real front of the Second World War that we haven't acknowledged so far.

772
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,440
 I think there's a book called Wine and War, I think, which has first-hand accounts of winemakers in France

773
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,440
 who fought the Nazis by withholding their best wine.

774
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
 And they're so proud of it.

775
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
 So it's so sweet.

776
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,440
 So it was in the Champagne region,

777
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,440
 and there's one winemaker who bragged about the fact that he watered down his champagne

778
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
 before giving it to the Nazis.

779
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,440
 Or he would bottle his worst wines.

780
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
 This is in the Champagne region.

781
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,440
 He bottle his worst wines and say, "This is the special couvet for the Vermex."

782
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,440
 And there was one guy who said that we got orders from the Nazis to deliver them lots of wine

783
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,440
 and they made the foolish mistake of not saying which vintage wine they would prefer.

784
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:15,440
 And so we sent them 1,000 bottles of our 1939, which was absolute rubbish.

785
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,440
 And that absolutely taught them.

786
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,440
 I have a fact about wishing people a Merry Christmas.

787
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
 OK.

788
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,440
 So this was an experiment that happened in 1974.

789
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,440
 Sociological two sociologists called Philip Kuhns and Michael Walcott.

790
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,440
 They posted nearly 600 Christmas cards to people they didn't know.

791
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,440
 They got the addresses out of the phone book and they sent some high status cards,

792
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,440
 which were very lavish and fancy and somewhat low status,

793
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,440
 which were just plain white cards with Merry Christmas written in a red sharpie on the front.

794
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,440
 And they were either signed from Dr. and Mrs. Philip Kuhns or from Philip and Joyce Kuhns.

795
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,440
 And they included a return address saying, "Well, you can send them back to."

796
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,440
 So they were definitely for people they hadn't met.

797
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:03,440
 And over 20% of people sent a signed card back with varying degrees of detail,

798
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,440
 some said Merry Christmas, some said pictures of their families to people they had never met,

799
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,440
 some said letters of several pages saying, "What have been going on with them for the last few years?"

800
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,440
 I know.

801
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,440
 But six people wrote back and directly asked, "How do I know you?"

802
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,440
 Which is incredibly bauzy to me.

803
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,440
 I wouldn't have the courage to do that.

804
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
 What was that? 74.

805
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,440
 You can't imagine it would happen today, could you think?

806
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,440
 If you got a random Christmas card through the post, guys, would you respond to it?

807
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,440
 Well, a few liars, but most people say that.

808
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,440
 And my parents, they keep getting a card addressed to the caginaries, and we've no idea who they are.

809
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,440
 But they're right. It arrives like clockwork every year.

810
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,440
 Every year. And the family has grown. It's added several members in this time.

811
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,440
 And they never include the return address, and they keep saying, "We'd love to see you in their new year."

812
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,440
 Please, please get in touch with them.

813
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,440
 So Wendy, John, if you're listening.

814
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,440
 We need to wrap up, guys. Anything before we do?

815
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,440
 Some stuff on wine or, as you might know, whatever.

816
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:20,440
 In 2015, Scotland made its first homegrown wine, and it was described as undrinkable by experts.

817
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:26,440
 The guy who produced it said, "It has potential."

818
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,440
 It doesn't smell fresh.

819
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,440
 But I enjoyed it in a bizarre, masochistic way.

820
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,440
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

821
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,440
 Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

822
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,440

823
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,440
 I'm on @Sriberland. Andy?

825
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440

826
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
 That's James Harkin.

827
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440

 Yep, or you can go to our group account, which is @nosuchthing, or you can go to our website.

830
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,440
 Nosuchthing is a fish.com.

831
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,440
 It's got all of our previous episodes. It's got a link to our book.

832
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,440
 We usually give one away at the end of this show.

833
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,440
 So what we're going to do tonight is take one away.

834
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,440
 Thank you so much for being here, guys.

835
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,440
 I was really fun. We'll see you again. Goodbye!

836
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
 (Applause)

837
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,440
