1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,500
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,460
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish, A Weekly Podcast"

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,620
 coming to you from the QI offices and covered guarded.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,020
 My name is Dad Shriver, and I'm sitting here

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,260
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter-Marie,

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,300
 and Adich Zinski.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,460
 And Adich Zinski, and once again,

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,060
 we have Gather Grown on my face.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,220
 And once again, we have Gather Grown on the microphones

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,980
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,740
 and in no particular order.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,060
 Here we go.

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,300
 - What even does that have to do with the sound of the microphone?

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,180
 - Very confusing.

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,380
 - Starting with my fact, my fact this week

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,340
 is that the man who popularized the high five

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,860
 only has four fingers.

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,860
 (laughing)

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,420
 And this was a basketball player

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,540
 called Wiley Brown.

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,820
 Back in 1978/79 season of basketball,

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,420
 he and his mate started high fiveing.

24
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,300
 And they talk about it really, really interestingly.

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,740
 Like I read an interview where he said,

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,140
 "No one was doing it, they all did it low.

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,100
 "There's all these low fives going on.

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,940
 "No one did it high."

29
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,580
 And then he said, "Then the first time we did it,

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,100
 "both of us looked at each other and said,

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,440
 "Did that just happen?"

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,700
 (laughing)

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,700
 - He really did to it.

34
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,780
 There's a magical moment.

35
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,900
 - Can I just ask, when you say four fingers,

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,140
 you mean on one of his hands?

37
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,460
 - Exactly, nine fingers.

38
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,300
 - Yes, exactly.

39
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,500
 So he had nine fingers in total.

40
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,380
 He was missing a thumb.

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,500
 He lost his thumb when he was four years old

42
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,580
 and prosthetic thumb was made,

43
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,540
 which meant that he could still become

44
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,780
 an amazing sports star

45
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,060
 'cause he played basketball and football.

46
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,700
 He was a bit sort of carefree about his thumb at times.

47
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,060
 He actually went to the finals of a basketball match,

48
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,380
 having left his thumb back at the hotel

49
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,780
 that he stayed at and they had to rescue it.

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,740
 - That would be awful if you had to hitchhike hold.

51
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,460
 (laughing)

52
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,140
 - Well, you could only do it on one side of the road.

53
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,860
 (laughing)

54
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,340
 - He actually hated his thumb, his prosthetic thumb.

55
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,460
 Yeah, he tried not to wear it.

56
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,820
 So he played basketball without the thumb for ages

57
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,860
 and then one of his coaches said,

58
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,020
 "You're really good without that.

59
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,340
 "But you'd be even better with it."

60
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,700
 And they made him wear one

61
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,780
 and it kept on flying off matches

62
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,220
 and he said it made him look like a freak

63
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,100
 'cause you know, it was someone would bash into his thumb

64
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,860
 and it would fly into the crowd.

65
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,500
 And so he tried not to wear it

66
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,060
 and the coach was adamant.

67
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,220
 And so much so that he said if he wasn't wearing his thumb,

68
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,380
 he wouldn't let the other teammates pass

69
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,860
 to his right hand, which really damaged the game.

70
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,860
 So they could only pass to his left hand.

71
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,700
 - Oh, so.

72
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,300
 - Yeah, he wasn't a fan.

73
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,100
 - I should say that I got this fact.

74
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,180
 It was sent into us by a guy called Michael Buccino.

75
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,900
 He's a listener and again, it's quickly up to say this.

76
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,140
 If you wanna see the finest interview ever, ever recorded,

77
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,740
 go to YouTube and put in Wiley Brown,

78
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,140
 talking about the high five.

79
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,460
 It is nine minutes of interview where they ask a question,

80
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,940
 which is, "So you invented the high five, how was it?"

81
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,140
 He says, "Yeah, it's great."

82
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,180
 And then they've got nine minutes more of interview.

83
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,540
 - It's too long.

84
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,540
 - It's not too long.

85
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,380
 - It is.

86
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,220
 - I watched it.

87
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,220
 - No, 'cause they run out of questions

88
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,900
 but he does not run out of answers.

89
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,740
 He is so enthusiastic.

90
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,700
 And he has a new tale for each time the high five started.

91
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,300
 So he did it with Derek Smith, who Wiley Brown says,

92
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,460
 "Is the actual creator of the high five?"

93
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,380
 Because in all the stories Smith is the one who instigates it.

94
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,500
 So for example, another story is that he said he was going up

95
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,780
 during practice to Derek Smith to give him a low five,

96
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,540
 classic low five, as they always did.

97
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,700
 And then he said, "Out of nowhere,

98
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,860
 "Smith looked brown in the eye and said, 'No, up high.'"

99
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,900
 I mean, that's what I can also do.

100
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,340
 - There was another theory about who invented the high five.

101
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,060
 - Yeah, it's very controversial, isn't it?

102
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,060
 - Yeah, so there's a baseball player called Dusty Baker,

103
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,620
 and another called Glenn Burke, and it's claimed that when Baker

104
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,780
 was getting back towards the dugout,

105
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,580
 Burke offered a raised hand and Baker,

106
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,180
 not knowing what to do, smacked it.

107
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,580
 Again, very much the same sort of amazing foundation moment.

108
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,100
 And then Burke went out and he got a home run

109
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,740
 and then on the way back he gave him another high five.

110
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,820
 And that was in 1977 that that supposedly happened.

111
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,820
 - So that's earlier?

112
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,140
 - It's earlier, so that predates.

113
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,140
 - Yes.

114
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,460
 - Maybe an origin.

115
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,740
 - Do you know Glenn Burke, who you were talking about?

116
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,580
 - Yeah.

117
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,340
 - He's famous because he was pretty much the first

118
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,820
 major league baseball player to come out as gay.

119
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,620
 And there was a documentary in 2010 called Out,

120
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,540
 The Glenn Burke Story, and they said that the Dodgers'

121
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,100
 executives offered him $75,000 to get married,

122
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,180
 because it would cause such a problem if people found out

123
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,540
 he was gay while he was still playing.

124
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,700
 - No way.

125
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,900
 - And apparently when they said,

126
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,540
 "Would you take $75,000 to get married?"

127
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,860
 He said, "I guess you mean to a woman?"

128
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,620
 It's just quite a good reply.

129
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,780
 - That's a great title for a movie, Out.

130
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,420
 I guess you mean to a woman?

131
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,900
 - Oh, right, no, no.

132
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,740
 Out.

133
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,660
 - Oh, the actual movie itself.

134
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,580
 - Do you think there was any confusion at the start

135
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,220
 when people would say, "Hey, how's Glenn?"

136
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,460
 And then you go, "Oh, he's out."

137
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,580
 And they go, "No, he's not, he's still out."

138
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,540
 Just years of playing.

139
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,460
 - Yeah, that's good.

140
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,300
 And then Dusty Baker, just one fact about him,

141
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,260
 he was famous for liking to chew toothpicks.

142
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,860
 He said toothpicks are an excellent source of protein,

143
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,020
 which he was wrong about.

144
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,860
 - No.

145
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,580
 - So on high fives, there is a basketball team

146
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,180
 called the Phoenix Sons.

147
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,020
 - Yes.

148
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,860
 - Has he heard of them?

149
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,700
 - Yeah.

150
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,900
 - Is that like saying, there is a football team

151
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,220
 called Manchester United.

152
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,460
 - Yes, it is.

153
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,300
 - You're on it.

154
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,900
 - Anyway, these Phoenix Sons in 2016,

155
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,140
 they announced that they were keeping track

156
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,780
 of all the high fives that their team passed to each other,

157
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,420
 hoping that they would create more camaraderie,

158
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,380
 like throughout the season they did this.

159
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,060
 And supposedly teams which embrace the most

160
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,180
 in terms of the high fives or other celebrations

161
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,180
 are more successful.

162
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,820
 - Yeah, I think it's surely more likely

163
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,420
 that if you're more successful,

164
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,500
 you score more points than you high fives each other more.

165
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,340
 - Yeah, that's true.

166
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,740
 There is a cause and effect thing there.

167
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,940
 But I've read articles saying that sports players

168
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,260
 who touch each other more are supposedly better

169
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,260
 at the spots.

170
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,500
 And I'm pretty sure that England cricket team

171
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,900
 always touch each other on the bum,

172
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,300
 whenever they do something good.

173
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,140
 - Yes.

174
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,460
 - And I think that kind of comes from that idea.

175
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,460
 - Sports, psychologists.

176
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,060
 - Most sports do, yeah, there's bum slaps all the time.

177
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,180
 - If we want to improve our performance on the podcast,

178
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,740
 should we start slapping each other's bum?

179
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,340
 - No, I don't think we should.

180
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,340
 I think we could just...

181
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,180
 (laughing)

182
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,060
 - That was a high five by the way, not a bum slap.

183
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,300
 - There is a machine that an artist has invented

184
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,780
 where you can, it does self high fives.

185
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,620
 Have you seen it?

186
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,460
 - No.

187
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,020
 - It's unbelievably disgusting looking.

188
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,660
 - It's the sound that the saddest loneliest machine in the world.

189
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,500
 - She's a Turkish-born artist.

190
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,340
 I think she lives in America.

191
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,180
 Good.

192
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,780
 Denise O'Zueger.

193
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,460
 Sorry, how does she pronounce her surname?

194
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,420
 I don't know, but I don't think it's like that.

195
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,580
 (laughing)

196
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,180
 I'm so sorry if I can just pronounce it,

197
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,700
 which I definitely have.

198
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,940
 So she cast her own arm, right?

199
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,620
 She made two cast of her arms,

200
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,700
 and then one of them is just sticking out of this machine.

201
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,580
 And the other one is like rotating very slowly,

202
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,020
 like a cabab thing.

203
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
 (laughing)

204
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,300
 And every minute, they come into contact

205
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,100
 'cause it's going around in a circle, the moving up,

206
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,700
 and it just slowly brushes the fingers of the other arm.

207
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
 - So that's not really a high f--

208
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,340
 That's how you would imagine Michael Gov would high-five.

209
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,300
 (laughing)

210
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,300
 - Yeah, it's really, it's really worth it.

211
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,700
 It only does one high-five per minute.

212
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,860
 I'm not sure what the point is.

213
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,700
 - One high-five per minute.

214
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,540
 - But it's hard, it's hard.

215
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,380
 That's the point.

216
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,140
 - It's not, it's okay.

217
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,460
 - The thumbs up that Donald Trump's gradually destroying

218
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,660
 for everyone else in the world.

219
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,660
 (laughing)

220
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,660
 Do you know what the origin of that is?

221
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,940
 - Apparently there were little theories.

222
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,540
 - In basketball, when someone got hit in the face

223
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,900
 by a stray thumb and they held it off and said,

224
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,900
 "Who's this?"

225
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,060
 (laughing)

226
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,420
 - It's a strong theory, but no.

227
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,260
 So apparently there's a--

228
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,100
 - Yeah, two other things.

229
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,820
 - Well, there's quite a strong myth that says

230
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,980
 that gladiators, you give the thumbs up for gladiators

231
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,420
 if you thought they should live in and the thumbs down.

232
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,780
 They should die, but I think that's not true.

233
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,860
 I think you just put your thumb out and that meant,

234
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,620
 I think we've got no evidence that the thumbs up

235
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,620
 meant live and thumbs down meant die.

236
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,580
 But, Desmond Morris says that it's from medieval times

237
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,500
 where if you were a businessman doing a deal,

238
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,340
 then the way you do it is you'd lick your thumb

239
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,220
 and then you press it up against someone else's

240
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,820
 licked thumb and that was really like,

241
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,980
 "Hey, deal is done."

242
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,140
 - Wow, that's like blood brothers,

243
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,060
 but slightly weirdly more disgusting.

244
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,660
 - What it reminds me of is,

245
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,540
 do you remember in the last QI meeting,

246
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,860
 Anna, when you were trying to show us some pick-up lines

247
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,540
 and you tried one on under, you missed this done?

248
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,380
 - Two.

249
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,980
 - She licked her thumb, wiped it on these clothes

250
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,060
 and said, "Let's get you out of these wet clothes."

251
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,060
 - Oh, that's, yeah, that's a good one.

252
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,180
 - He was smitten.

253
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,180
 - The single most erotic moment of my life.

254
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,940
 (laughing)

255
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,780
 - That's strong.

256
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,300
 - You know, couples,

257
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,620
 Marion couples used to shake hands at the altar.

258
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,460
 - Oh, really?

259
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,540
 - So this is a BBC History magazine claims this,

260
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,420
 but yeah, in the 17th century you got married

261
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,780
 and then you shake hands with the bride.

262
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,580
 - So because it's like a contract movie.

263
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,420
 - Yeah, exactly.

264
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,260
 - The kissing thing, when I got married in January,

265
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,900
 the priest told us that, you know, it's not a thing,

266
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,020
 you don't need to do it.

267
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,740
 It's like, it's just people just started doing it.

268
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,300
 It just caught on like the high five

269
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,540
 and just people decided to do it.

270
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,940
 But it's never been officially a part of the ceremony.

271
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,780
 - Yeah, I know.

272
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,900
 - You make his the bride is not a line

273
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,740
 a part of the ceremony.

274
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
 - He popularized it, don't.

275
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,220
 - I think it was a half-lipped amount.

276
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,020
 (laughing)

277
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,860
 - Yeah, I don't know.

278
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,700
 - It's quite American.

279
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,940
 I always think of it as not a--

280
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,940
 - What, you made out kiss the bride?

281
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,380
 - Yes, in fact, that's what he said to me.

282
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,740
 He said that it's something that was seen

283
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,700
 in American movies and then everyone thought,

284
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,300
 "Oh, there's meant to be that line."

285
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,780
 And then we started doing it.

286
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,540
 - So when I was looking at stuff about high fives,

287
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,940
 I came across an article about a lollipop man.

288
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,260
 He's quit because he was high five in the children

289
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,220
 as they walked across the road.

290
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,900
 And he was told not to do it.

291
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,100
 And he was like, "Right, fine, I'm gonna quit."

292
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,940
 - Okay.

293
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,620
 - So just very quickly, a lollipop man,

294
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,900
 'cause I didn't know this until I got to this country,

295
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,780
 is someone who stands by a zebra crossing

296
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,620
 and allows school children to walk across.

297
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,460
 - I had no idea.

298
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,020
 - He's holding a large lollipop shaped object

299
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,860
 to stop the cars.

300
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,340
 - But he doesn't sell lollipops.

301
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,380
 - And a zebra crossing is a road crossing

302
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,980
 with black and white stripes on it.

303
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,860
 - That the Beatles walked over on Abbey Road.

304
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,380
 - Yes, but there are thousands and thousands

305
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,220
 of zebra crossings.

306
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,700
 It's not like Britain has one zebra crossing

307
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,180
 and all school children have to cross that

308
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,140
 before they go to the school.

309
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,540
 - I was surprised I got the space to take that photo

310
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,180
 with all the kids. - Anyway, lollipop man.

311
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,780
 - So this guy, he was from a Plymouth City Council.

312
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,380
 And then I just carried on reading the rest

313
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,420
 of the Google searches on pages two and three

314
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,220
 that people don't normally go to.

315
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,140
 And there was also a lollipop man in Edinburgh

316
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,500
 who was told not to high five children.

317
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,980
 There was a lollipop lady in the Vale of Glamorgan

318
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,140
 who had the same.

319
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,140
 There was two lollipop men in Essex that I found.

320
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,220
 There was a guy in Weston, Batonshire,

321
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,300
 who's left his job because he wasn't allowed

322
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,860
 to high five kids.

323
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,900
 And there was a guy in Australia, in Bayside, Australia,

324
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,060
 who was also left his job because, well, he got told off

325
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,500
 because he was high five in children.

326
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,700
 So this seems to be a real problem.

327
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,020
 - Amazing that it's like a deal breaker for keeping your job.

328
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,100
 (laughing)

329
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
 - No high five?

330
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,020
 I'm out of here.

331
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,340
 - That is so weird.

332
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,180
 - It's weird.

333
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,700
 - It's just a thing that seems to be happening

334
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,540
 all over the world.

335
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,380
 - That's amazing.

336
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,660
 I bet no one else has made that connection in the world.

337
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,940
 I bet even they have not made that connection.

338
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,700
 - It's a lollipop. - I bet they mean.

339
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,540
 - The high five club.

340
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,580
 - They mean high five each other and that feels like it.

341
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,500
 (laughing)

342
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,660
 - It's because it's dangerous.

343
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,580
 - So the idea is, you're supposed to be concentrating

344
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,100
 on the road and not high five in kids as they go across.

345
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,100
 And presumably what's happened, I might be completely wrong

346
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,340
 about this, but it seems to me like a memo's gone out

347
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,700
 to all the different councils and they've all gone

348
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,780
 round checking that no one's high five in people.

349
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,540
 I don't know if that's right, but it's a real coincidence.

350
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,820
 - It doesn't take that much concentration to high five,

351
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,660
 does it?

352
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,260
 - I thought you could focus on the road as well as also.

353
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,100
 - Yeah.

354
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,020
 - But if someone was repeatedly high five

355
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,340
 in while driving, I would not be so comfortable

356
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,300
 as a passenger.

357
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,980
 - How would you do that so that you'll hand out the window?

358
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
 - I guess so, yeah.

359
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,860
 - But then you're driving too close to the paper.

360
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,540
 (laughing)

361
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,500
 - No, you would high five other drivers

362
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,900
 coming in the opposite direction.

363
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,740
 - Oh, of course.

364
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,500
 - What you can't see on the Abbey Road cover

365
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,820
 is a crest fall in lollipop van on the other side

366
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,780
 taking his P-45 slip with it.

367
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,620
 - Yeah.

368
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,660
 - I don't ever high five the Beatles again.

369
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,420
 (laughing)

370
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,020
 (upbeat music)

371
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,540
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

372
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,500
 And that is Chuzinski.

373
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,700
 - Yeah, my fact this week is that when the first American

374
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,820
 woman went into space, NASA designed a makeup kit for her.

375
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,060
 And this is an interview I was reading this week

376
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,300
 with Sally Ride, who was in the first group

377
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,100
 of female Americans who went into space.

378
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,340
 And yeah, she said that NASA called her in for a meeting

379
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,020
 and said, look, we're really worried about this,

380
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,860
 but we're sending women out there now.

381
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,460
 And we obviously need to design your makeup kit.

382
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,580
 So what kind of stuff should we be putting in there?

383
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,820
 'Cause we're a bit stuck with that.

384
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,660
 - What did she say?

385
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,860
 - And she said it was the last thing she wanted

386
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,900
 to be thinking about at that time.

387
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,020
 - Effectively, this fact is about the sort of slightly

388
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,020
 backward, massively backward sexism that happens

389
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,860
 to a lot of women to say.

390
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,740
 - We don't want people to look like a minger for the aliens,

391
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,300
 do you? (laughing)

392
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,660
 - So there was this interview with Sally Ride, too.

393
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,940
 It was quite sweet saying that when NASA came to her,

394
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,780
 they were a bit confused about various things,

395
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,460
 like they didn't know how many tampons they would want out

396
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,740
 in space, so they suggested a hundred tampons per person

397
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,220
 for a week and she was like, you know what I mean?

398
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,860
 (laughing)

399
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,900
 - What if you need to build a fort?

400
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,500
 (laughing)

401
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,780
 - Tampon fort, please put your child to do this.

402
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,580
 - It's like a pillow fort, but for a mouse.

403
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,220
 (laughing)

404
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,940
 - But some of them, I read an interview with another

405
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,660
 of the women who went up who said that

406
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,980
 when they came in and asked them do they want makeup,

407
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,980
 what kind of makeup do they want?

408
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,940
 They were loud gaffors by some of the women,

409
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,620
 but one of them said, look, these pictures taken in space

410
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,500
 will follow us around for the rest of our lives.

411
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,180
 And I don't want to disappear into the background.

412
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,340
 So a couple of them did take these makeup kits up.

413
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
 - Wow.

414
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,180
 - Yeah.

415
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,820
 - Well, they sort of specially tested makeup that would adhere

416
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,780
 to the skin, even in a microgravity.

417
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,860
 - But what doesn't happen with makeup, Andy,

418
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,420
 is women don't put makeup on at the start of the day,

419
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,220
 and by the end of the day, the gravity's just pulled it down

420
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,660
 to the bottom of their faces.

421
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,660
 (laughing)

422
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,540
 - Paul's is on your feet.

423
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,180
 (laughing)

424
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,540
 - That's a good point.

425
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,540
 - I'm a face-up crotch look at a freepier.

426
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,900
 (laughing)

427
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,540
 - No, it's extraordinary, though, that they sort of...

428
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,540
 - It is weird.

429
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,500
 What's also weird is how long NASA took to

430
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,940
 and send women into space, given how long

431
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,460
 the Soviet Union did not take, so it was 20 years after,

432
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,020
 it was an odd way of creating that space.

433
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,420
 (laughing)

434
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,620
 - They untucked a long time.

435
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,540
 (laughing)

436
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,340
 - So the Soviet Union sent Valentina Tereshkva up in 1963,

437
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,780
 and one NASA official was actually asked what he thought

438
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,660
 about this at the time, and he said it made him sit

439
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,940
 to his stomach to think of women in space.

440
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,340
 - But this is the weird thing about Tereshkva's trip.

441
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:05,020
 She was only allowed to go because she wasn't menstruating.

442
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,140
 - Oh, 'cause they were worried about what would happen

443
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,980
 with periods, don't they?

444
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,500
 - They were just didn't have enough payload

445
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,940
 to take 5,000 tampons of that.

446
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,260
 (laughing)

447
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,900
 - No, all these reports sort of worrying about it,

448
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,300
 and so basically all your blood sort of pools

449
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,460
 in your torso and in your head, 'cause there's no gravity,

450
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:26,140
 so that is something that on Earth is affected by gravity.

451
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,980
 And there was a report in America in 1964, which said,

452
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,220
 "It will be hard to match," I'm quoting here,

453
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,220
 "a temperamental psychophysiologic human

454
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,940
 and the complicated machine, either spacecraft,

455
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,100
 both need to be ready at the same time, i.e.,

456
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,020
 we think women will be too mad

457
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,820
 if they're menstruating to operate a spacecraft."

458
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,660
 - Wow.

459
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,100
 - And they also worried that the blood from that system

460
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,660
 would also float up and cause,

461
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,860
 it could cause theoretically a dangerous condition

462
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,380
 called peritonitis, which can be fatal,

463
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,220
 as they thought, well, what if that happens?

464
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,860
 But the reality is that normal blood circulation

465
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,300
 is completely different to menstrual blood,

466
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,660
 so it was in every risk.

467
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,460
 - And actually, women going up in space is very sensible

468
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,700
 and a good idea because they can do everything

469
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,180
 that the men can do, but they're smaller,

470
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,220
 generally speaking.

471
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,060
 You just need less power to get women up there.

472
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,300
 - Oh, I thought you'd be...

473
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
 - Every bit counts.

474
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,460
 - You don't have to send them as far because they're smaller,

475
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,340
 so they'll look the same size even when they're a bit closer.

476
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,180
 - That's the whole point.

477
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,860
 That's why we send people in space, so they look smaller.

478
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,940
 - See what humans would look like

479
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,540
 if they were one sent to me to school.

480
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,980
 - That's one small step.

481
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,820
 No, it's a double step.

482
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,900
 It's just a long way away.

483
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:40,820
 - There's another astronaut called Svetlana Savitskaya,

484
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,540
 and she went up in 1984.

485
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,780
 She didn't mention first women to fly in space twice.

486
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,340
 In 1995, she gave an interview,

487
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,980
 and she was talking about the sort of sexism

488
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,220
 that was going on with being a female astronaut.

489
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,180
 When she arrived at the salue seven,

490
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,380
 as she came in, there was another astronaut there

491
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,220
 who handed her an apron and told her to get to work.

492
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,900
 That was her arrival in space, yeah.

493
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,980
 - Was that a tongue-in-cheek thing?

494
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,660
 - No, no, it was very much...

495
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,500
 - It seems like, well, women shouldn't be up here,

496
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,860
 so I'm going to say something extremely offensive.

497
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,540
 - Oh, so it was a deliberate, like, you shouldn't be here.

498
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,500
 - You shouldn't be here, put the apron on,

499
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,740
 if you're going to be here and clean up the eye of Shuttle.

500
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,580
 - Wow.

501
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,260
 - Yeah, they've been deliberately letting dirt build up

502
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,460
 on the Shuttle and jeopardising the entire mission

503
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,060
 to make this incredibly petty point.

504
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,100
 - Where'd he get the apron from?

505
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,940
 Who has an apron in space?

506
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,900
 - He would have had to smuggle an apron.

507
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,300
 We would have had to craft an apron,

508
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,420
 probably from vital bits of the spaceship.

509
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,660
 - On the ISS, do you know they have to vacuum every day?

510
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,500
 - Really?

511
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,940
 - Yeah, 'cause they need to keep it clean

512
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,700
 and they need to keep it clear of germs and bacteria.

513
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,900
 And, yeah, so they have to vacuum every day.

514
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,860
 - It's quite ironic the fact that they're bringing

515
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,340
 the vacuum into space.

516
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,180
 - Oh, yeah.

517
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,020
 (all laughing)

518
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,180
 - Do they, 'cause the stuff isn't adhering to the ground,

519
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,780
 'cause of the absence of gravity in the lab.

520
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,660
 So do they just wave a vacuum in the air?

521
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,740
 - I think they must do.

522
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,580
 - They must do, right?

523
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,580
 - That is so easy.

524
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,860
 - I guess what happens is it kind of floats around

525
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,620
 and then it'll just stick to things.

526
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,300
 - Yeah, I think it does, that's complete.

527
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,780
 - We mentioned before, you know you get calluses

528
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,020
 on your feet, 'cause you're not walking around

529
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,580
 on the ground, so your underside of your feet gets soft.

530
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,740
 And then the top of your feet,

531
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,060
 'cause you're hooking your feet around

532
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,860
 railing to things gets very hard.

533
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,220
 Those calluses break off.

534
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,860
 And then they're just floating around this base station,

535
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,740
 bits of your own footskin.

536
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,660
 So you have to vacuum those up.

537
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,700
 - Turn the wear socks first times.

538
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,660
 - You should be wearing space socks.

539
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,260
 - I guess so, yeah I guess so.

540
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,980
 - But it is cool they have reverse feet in space.

541
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,380
 (laughing)

542
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,220
 - I do love that.

543
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,060
 - Is that what we're saying?

544
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
 - That's what we're saying.

545
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,260
 - If you live in space you have reverse feet.

546
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,980
 - Do you know what happened on the,

547
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,820
 the Maiden Space Shuttle Columbia Mission in 1981?

548
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,700
 The toilet got clogged when they were up in space

549
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,340
 and they had to use these tube-shaped bags

550
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,300
 which attached to your bottom with a sticky seal

551
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,300
 to go to the loo.

552
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,580
 It's very unpleasant.

553
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,620
 And then as they were re-entering the Earth's atmosphere,

554
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,740
 the toilet was broken and the vacuum dried excrement

555
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,780
 got into the ventilation system

556
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,140
 and then started floating around in the main cabin.

557
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,980
 - No.

558
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
 - Bad times.

559
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,220
 - That's, see you really need the vacuum cleaner

560
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,060
 then.

561
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,900
 - Yeah you do, yeah.

562
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,740
 - You suck that up.

563
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,180
 - You can't suck up poo in a vacuum cleaner.

564
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,100
 - I wouldn't use it again after I'd done it.

565
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,940
 - Yeah.

566
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,900
 - If it's vacuum dried.

567
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,740
 - Okay.

568
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,580
 - If it's vacuum dried you can.

569
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,100
 Which is why I always vacuum dry.

570
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,980
 (laughing)

571
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,140
 - With a more like a little bit.

572
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,500
 (laughing)

573
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,740
 - Just one more thing on the extreme sexism and space theme.

574
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,580
 - Yeah.

575
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,420
 - Great theme.

576
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:43,220
 - It's such a strong theme, it's just a real laugh a minute.

577
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,740
 So in 1971 there's a NASA memo

578
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,740
 which is about psychological issues with long space flights.

579
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,180
 And so this is in '71 and this is about how men

580
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,620
 can suffer in various ways.

581
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,100
 And one of the ways that they'll suffer

582
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,180
 is that they don't have a direct sexual release

583
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,500
 'cause they're up in space, all a bunch of men on their own.

584
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,100
 And this NASA memo says,

585
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,700
 the question of direct sexual release

586
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,580
 on a long duration space mission must be considered.

587
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,660
 Practical considerations preclude men taking their wives.

588
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,900
 So it is possible that a woman qualified

589
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,300
 from a scientific viewpoint might be persuaded

590
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,060
 to donate her time and energies

591
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,180
 for the sake of improving crew morale.

592
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,020
 - No, whoa.

593
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,340
 - No.

594
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,500
 - Space prostitutes.

595
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 - I said, say yeah.

596
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,300
 - That sounds like a movie doesn't it?

597
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,060
 (laughing)

598
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,900
 - Star Wars.

599
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,740
 - So they want a star.

600
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,580
 - Star Wars.

601
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,420
 - No.

602
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,260
 - No.

603
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,780
 - They weren't suggesting that.

604
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,700
 They were suggesting that providing a woman

605
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,860
 puts, they talk about sublimation,

606
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,060
 which is the idea that men will be sexually relieved

607
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,140
 by just being around a woman.

608
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,100
 It will improve them around rather than being on their own

609
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,660
 'cause it pointed out that masturbation isn't,

610
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,380
 is messy and that homosexual behavior

611
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,540
 shouldn't be encouraged.

612
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,780
 - Pointed out masturbation is messy.

613
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,100
 - I would say as long as it's freeze-dried.

614
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,380
 (laughing)

615
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,620
 - Do you ever go to add these house, you'll notice.

616
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,460
 (laughing)

617
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,300
 - It's not safe.

618
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,780
 (laughing)

619
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,860
 - Oh, deary me.

620
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,440
 (upbeat music)

621
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,420
 - Okay, it is time for back number three

622
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,140
 and that is James.

623
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,140
 - Okay, my fat this week is that the Indian Justice System

624
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,660
 has a backlog of 31 million cases.

625
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,820
 - Ah.

626
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,820
 - 31 million.

627
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,660
 - Yeah, that's nuts.

628
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,500
 - Oh my goodness.

629
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
 - So terrifying.

630
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,140
 - And if all of the judges,

631
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,420
 managed to deal with 100 cases an hour

632
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,140
 and didn't take any breaks,

633
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,700
 it would take them 35 years to get rid of the backlog

634
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,180
 'cause there's hardly any judges.

635
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,700
 - But it's like, it's between 13 and 15 judges,

636
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,180
 per million people in India.

637
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,100
 - And in America it's more than 100.

638
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,940
 - Is it?

639
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,780
 - Wow.

640
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,100
 - And so I saw this in a review of a book

641
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,300
 called When Crime Pays, Money and Muscle in Indian Politics

642
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,580
 in the Economist magazine a few weeks ago.

643
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,940
 And what it was really, it's an article

644
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,660
 about how corrupt politicians are in India.

645
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,940
 And they said in this article that if you are a politician

646
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,740
 with serious charges hanging over you,

647
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,260
 you have an 18% chance of winning your race

648
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,220
 and that's compared with 6% for someone

649
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,980
 who doesn't have any charges against them.

650
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,180
 So you're three times more likely to get into parliament

651
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,180
 if you have a serious crime against you

652
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,420
 than if you have no crime, which is insane.

653
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,580
 - Where's the causation correlation linked then?

654
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,740
 Do they speculate?

655
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,940
 - Yeah, because I can't believe people

656
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,620
 are voting people in just on the grounds

657
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,620
 of their criminal history.

658
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,140
 - Well, the speculation is that getting the Indian states

659
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,340
 do things is very difficult because it's just

660
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,100
 there's so much bureaucracy.

661
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,420
 And sometimes you just have to bang a few heads together

662
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
 to get things done.

663
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,300
 And so people think, well, this criminal knows

664
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,100
 how to get things done, specifically crimes.

665
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,060
 But if he can do crimes, he can probably

666
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,900
 sort out the roads and the railways

667
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,060
 and stuff like that as well.

668
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,380
 - So is it only the people who've done crimes well

669
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,780
 that are getting elected?

670
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,140
 - Well, if you do crimes that well,

671
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,420
 you tend not to get a prison.

672
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,100
 - Well, indeed, they've been caught.

673
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,940
 So I would have thought.

674
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,540
 - Well, a lot of these people haven't been found guilty

675
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,700
 or anything because there's still 31 million--

676
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,100
 - Oh yeah, it's two cases.

677
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,860
 - Two thirds of all people in prison in India

678
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,500
 have not been convicted of anything.

679
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,860
 They're waiting for the trial.

680
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,300
 - So they still put them in jail though.

681
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,900
 - Yeah, there are 400,000 people in India in prison.

682
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,020
 Which is actually, I think, a bit lower

683
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,700
 than the British proportion.

684
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,380
 Because Britain's got about 80,000 people in prison.

685
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,460
 So they've got five times as many,

686
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,900
 but the population's way higher.

687
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,220
 - But yeah, so you might have to wait 10 years

688
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,500
 for your case to be brought to court.

689
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,020
 And you might be innocent at all times.

690
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,740
 - And some people can't afford bail

691
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,620
 or some people don't know that bail is available to them.

692
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,620
 So they're just sort of left-moldering in jail

693
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,620
 for years and years and years.

694
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,460
 - Wow.

695
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,820
 - And in the lower house in India, the lock sabber,

696
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,820
 34% of the MPs have got criminal charges filed against them.

697
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,540
 So that's more than the third.

698
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,060
 And according to this article,

699
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,860
 you can pretty much walk from Mumbai to Kolkata

700
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,340
 without stepping foot outside a constituency

701
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,380
 whose MP isn't facing a charge.

702
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,220
 - Oh my God.

703
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,700
 - And that's about 2,000 kilometers.

704
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,540
 - Yeah.

705
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,380
 - Wasn't there a thing in the American election this year

706
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,580
 that you told me about, Anna,

707
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,940
 where there was one of the people running

708
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,380
 had a warrant out for their arrest?

709
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,580
 - Oh yeah, the green candidate.

710
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,180
 - That's why they were running.

711
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,020
 (laughing)

712
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,620
 - Oh, well, for me, you're not going to go as she let her life.

713
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,460
 But for Green.

714
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,460
 (laughing)

715
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,460
 - Yeah, Jill Stein, wasn't it?

716
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,300
 - Jill Stein.

717
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,700
 - And it was for protesting.

718
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,020
 - Yeah, it was for a vandalism

719
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,580
 'cause she'd graffitied something

720
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,740
 and it was a mental protest.

721
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,980
 - It was in a particular state, wasn't it?

722
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,820
 - Yeah.

723
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,260
 - So she just didn't campaign very much there.

724
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,100
 - Yeah.

725
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,940
 - Of course.

726
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,780
 - Or really anywhere else.

727
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,100
 - Wow.

728
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,380
 - So obviously there are people who have to wait a very long time

729
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,660
 to get their cases heard.

730
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,660
 One example is a guy, an 85 year old man who in 2014

731
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,820
 was granted a divorce that he'd filed for 32 years.

732
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,660
 (laughing)

733
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,500
 - Wow.

734
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,820
 You're probably made up by then, haven't you?

735
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,660
 - Yeah.

736
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,660
 - Yeah.

737
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,420
 - Well, you'd hope so.

738
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,620
 Otherwise, that's a lot of resentment

739
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,460
 that's festering for third volume, isn't it?

740
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,300
 - Yeah, true.

741
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,140
 - Yeah.

742
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,660
 In 2018, in the government whips, sprung six MPs

743
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,620
 out of prison so that they could vote.

744
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,820
 (laughing)

745
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,900
 Yeah.

746
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,380
 - Oh, if anyone else was with that cool,

747
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,620
 the most rebellious thing they do

748
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,500
 is not a Bay Jeremy Corbyn.

749
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,620
 Imagine if they were springing people out of jail.

750
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,580
 - So it was gonna be a really tight vote

751
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,820
 and they decided, oh, we're gonna need these six people

752
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,340
 so they got them out of prison.

753
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,180
 (laughing)

754
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,180
 - That's amazing.

755
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,580
 Like on a day trip or just altogether out of prison?

756
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,140
 - I think they put them back in.

757
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,960
 - Oh, yeah.

758
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,940
 But that's like during John Major's government in the UK

759
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,020
 'cause he had this wafer thin majority, didn't he?

760
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,700
 And they kept on having to bring in, you know,

761
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,940
 they were MPs who were really seriously ill

762
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,020
 to get legislation through,

763
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,820
 they were practically bringing in stretchers, you know?

764
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,800
 - Oh, sort of pushing them through, yeah, yeah, yeah.

765
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,580
 - Do we know how they sprung them out of prison?

766
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,460
 Was it a great escape style tunnel digging sort of endeavor?

767
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,660
 - The tunnel digging, you'd need to know

768
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,980
 that the vote's coming up a long time advance.

769
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,060
 (laughing)

770
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,860
 - Order 12 bulldozers on tax payers expense.

771
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,300
 (laughing)

772
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,820
 - There's one court case in India

773
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,500
 that's been going on since 1878.

774
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,540
 (laughing)

775
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,180
 I think this was the oldest I could find.

776
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,860
 - That's a long divorce, isn't it?

777
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,860
 (laughing)

778
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,580
 - Great grandchildren are getting divorced.

779
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,020
 It's a replot of land that's less than two acres

780
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,780
 and it's a fight between a sheer Muslim family

781
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,260
 and a Sunni Muslim family.

782
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,380
 And one side argues that their graves are on it

783
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,940
 and so they need to keep it at the other side argues

784
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,060
 that belongs to them, it's beginning on since 1878.

785
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,740
 - The election commission of India says

786
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,660
 that no person should have to travel more than two kilometers

787
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,500
 to cast a vote.

788
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,460
 So in the state of Goodgerat, there's a temple caretaker

789
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,500
 who lives in a temple in the middle of a forest

790
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,140
 who is the only person who votes in his special voting booth.

791
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,100
 Okay, so the police come in whenever there's an election,

792
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,220
 they have to go through this massive forest

793
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,900
 with snakes and lions and stuff like that

794
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,660
 and then they put the voting booth in the middle of the forest

795
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,140
 and they sit there and they wait for him to come.

796
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,260
 And he says in the morning, he has his breakfast

797
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,980
 and he has a cup of tea and he works out

798
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,700
 who he's gonna vote for.

799
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,660
 And then about 11 o'clock he wanders down

800
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,940
 and puts his vote in and they can go home.

801
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,100
 - That is amazing.

802
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,940
 - Is that cool?

803
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,780
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

804
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,900
 - That's hilarious that they haven't specified a time.

805
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,940
 They've just got a seat.

806
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,420
 (laughing)

807
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,820
 - Turn out very low this year.

808
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,540
 (laughing)

809
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,340
 - Just one thing we've never talked about actually,

810
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,060
 that's another weird thing about the Indian justice system

811
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,620
 is the case of Laan Bihari

812
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,140
 who set up the Otar Pradesh group of dead people.

813
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,980
 - Oh yeah.

814
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,300
 - I've never mentioned this,

815
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,060
 but this is totally bizarre.

816
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,860
 He's this guy who in 1975 wanted to apply for a bank loan

817
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,820
 and so he went to try and get proof of identity

818
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,220
 from the revenue office and he found out that he was dead

819
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,180
 because his uncle had declared him dead

820
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,020
 so we could claim the land that he had inherited.

821
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,740
 And it turned out this is a massive problem

822
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,220
 and he set up his organization,

823
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,220
 which is to represent people who have been declared dead

824
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,940
 and indeed even though they're alive.

825
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,700
 And he eventually in 2004,

826
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,140
 he eventually in '99.

827
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,260
 (laughing)

828
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,660
 - I told you he was dead, I told you and I'm right.

829
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,540
 (laughing)

830
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,460
 - In 1994, sorry, he finally managed to get himself

831
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,460
 declared alive, but his organization,

832
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,180
 which is the Otar Pradesh Dead People Association,

833
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,900
 has over 20,000 members and by 2004,

834
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,100
 they only managed to declare four of them alive.

835
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,300
 - Wow.

836
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,540
 I remember reading about him where all the times

837
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,060
 he tried to prove that he was alive.

838
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,380
 So he started doing things like illegal stuff,

839
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,900
 like robbing a bank.

840
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,460
 They'd be like, "We can't arrest you, you're not alive,

841
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,860
 we can't arrest a dead man."

842
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,340
 - So do you think he was robbing the bank

843
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,060
 and they're like, "Oh, it's a ghost."

844
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,060
 (laughing)

845
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,700
 - He would just move mugs around.

846
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,060
 (laughing)

847
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,220
 - Just walk into sayances.

848
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,820
 (laughing)

849
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,100
 - There was a sorry, on sayances,

850
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,500
 there was a legal case in the UK

851
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,220
 that had to be redone because it turned out the jury.

852
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,820
 This is in 1994, it turned out the jury

853
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,820
 had made their decision based on a say-on.

854
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,220
 - What?

855
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,700
 - Yeah, it was a double murder case

856
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,460
 and they had to spend the night in a hotel

857
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,620
 because the case was going on a while

858
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,700
 and they all got really drunk

859
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,660
 and then one of them entered their wine glass turned over

860
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,140
 and went, "All right, let's ask a ghost

861
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,900
 whether he's guilty or not."

862
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,220
 And they did and then they had to redo the case

863
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,220
 because that isn't allowed.

864
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,220
 - Why would the ghost know?

865
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,060
 Like what was the...

866
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,460
 (laughing)

867
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,420
 - I'm not sure the ghost did, though.

868
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,940
 (laughing)

869
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,940
 - Who was the ghost?

870
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,780
 - They're right up there.

871
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,940
 - Just the ghost of the murdered.

872
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,780
 - Man.

873
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,620
 - Oh.

874
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,700
 - Who killed you?

875
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,540
 Did he do it?

876
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,660
 - Oh, so it's specifically, it wasn't just a ghost.

877
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,660
 - Well, it might because ghosts can talk to each other, right?

878
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,020
 So the ghost, whoever it was,

879
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,460
 could have gotten asked the murder person they thought.

880
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,300
 - So the ghost went to each other?

881
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,140
 - I'll get back to you.

882
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,100
 I'm seeing him next week for a ghost lunch.

883
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,940
 I will...

884
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,780
 (laughing)

885
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,940
 - I don't know who did that one.

886
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,020
 (laughing)

887
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,900
 - Mrs. Doubtful is that.

888
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,460
 - Oh, I'll ask her.

889
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,500
 (laughing)

890
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,740
 (upbeat music)

891
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,500
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

892
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,940
 and that is Andy.

893
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,740
 - My fact is that scientists are building a special bunker

894
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,420
 in Antarctica to store bits of glassier from the Alps.

895
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,180
 - It's so exciting.

896
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,500
 - Yeah, it's amazing.

897
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,900
 - It's because glassiers are melting all over the world.

898
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,060
 And I didn't notice that this is a job.

899
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,500
 There's a job of being a paleoclimatologist.

900
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,660
 So like a paleoclimatologist does dinosaurs.

901
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,340
 A paleoclimatologist does ancient weather, basically.

902
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,900
 And all these glassiers,

903
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,460
 they're really old ice,

904
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,380
 and it contains lots of data about what was in the atmosphere,

905
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,580
 how much of which kind of gas,

906
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,860
 what the weather would have been like, what the climate was.

907
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,980
 So if they melt, you suddenly are losing

908
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,660
 tens of thousands of years of data.

909
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,180
 So what kind of weather did they learn?

910
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,780
 It's like, oh, it was snowing.

911
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,340
 - Yeah, it was snowing before that.

912
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,020
 It's snowing before that.

913
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,220
 - Cold, cold, cold, still cold.

914
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
 (laughing)

915
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,700
 - They learn about the gases in the atmosphere.

916
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,020
 But they have collecting cross sections of ice.

917
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,180
 They have these circular drills.

918
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,060
 They're like cookie cutters,

919
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,460
 and they just bore right down into the ice,

920
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,580
 and then they'd bring it up,

921
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,140
 slice it into one meter sections, label them,

922
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,020
 and they're currently building this massive bunker,

923
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,420
 which is going to be in Antarctica.

924
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,820
 - Is this, is their research group,

925
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,540
 are they the ones called protecting ice memory project?

926
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,380
 - Yes.

927
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,180
 - Okay, so this is this big international pen.

928
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,340
 - Wait a minute.

929
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,180
 - Oh, yeah.

930
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,100
 (laughing)

931
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,620
 - Did they call themselves Pemps?

932
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,420
 - I think it's Pem project, I think it's just a...

933
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,500
 - I can see why they didn't bother with the project.

934
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,140
 (laughing)

935
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,380
 - They make a big deal of that space.

936
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,260
 With a PIM project.

937
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,500
 (laughing)

938
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,020
 PIM pause project.

939
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,980
 (laughing)

940
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,380
 - Yeah, it's unbelievably cool though.

941
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,820
 Actually, so these ice cores that they pull out,

942
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,500
 just the idea that all of this stuff that's happened

943
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
 for hundreds of thousands of years

944
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,060
 is literally frozen in time, and we can look at it.

945
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,900
 - Yeah.

946
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,300
 - So find volcanic ash, or find when carbon dioxide

947
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
 was in the atmosphere, and how much of it.

948
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,740
 And that's how they get a lot of climate data,

949
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,660
 which I hadn't realized.

950
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,060
 So when we say, you know, when you have those graphs,

951
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,820
 which show how much CO2 was in the atmosphere,

952
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,700
 X number of years ago, very often,

953
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,140
 that's because they've studied an ice core

954
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,260
 and they found a little bubble of it somewhere beneath.

955
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,660
 It's been reserved for hundreds of thousands of years.

956
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,500
 It's always bubbles.

957
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,220
 - It's always the bubbles, isn't it?

958
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,500
 And they just keep the bubbles.

959
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,420
 That's true, 'cause it'd be easier to store, wouldn't it?

960
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,700
 And the reason it's an endoccticate

961
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,740
 is that even if the power fails,

962
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,620
 it's still minus 50 degrees outside.

963
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,180
 Whereas if you have it somewhere warmer, right?

964
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,340
 And the power fails, obviously,

965
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,660
 all your precious data melts.

966
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,900
 - Do you guys know about Project Ice Worm?

967
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,260
 - Project Ice Worm.

968
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,660
 I know what Ice Worms are.

969
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,140
 - What are Ice Worms?

970
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,100
 - They're worms that live in ice.

971
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,740
 - All right, yeah, that's amazing, James.

972
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,580
 - Wait, is that true?

973
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,420
 - That can't be true.

974
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,940
 - They have worms that live on glaciers,

975
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,380
 but Anna can tell us about her thing,

976
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,620
 and then I'll tell you about Ice Worms.

977
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,460
 - Yeah, okay, cool.

978
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,980
 - Let's compare Ice Worms.

979
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,540
 So this is an endoccticate.

980
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,820
 This is in Greenland.

981
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,620
 But Project Ice Worm was this American plan in the Cold War

982
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,380
 to build this massive underground network of tunnels

983
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,340
 below the ice in Greenland.

984
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,820
 And then that would be, they would be missile launch sites.

985
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,700
 So that way, if they went via Greenland,

986
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,940
 then they could get easy access to the Soviet Union.

987
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,100
 And we actually did this.

988
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,140
 So if you go to Greenland, way, way under the ice,

989
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,340
 there's this network of tunnels

990
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,980
 that they started building that's full of stuff like sewage

991
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,540
 and loads of diesel fuel apparently,

992
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,020
 some pollutants and radiological waste.

993
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,700
 And I think 21 tunnels were dug under the ground in Greenland.

994
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,420
 And then they decided it wasn't actually going to work

995
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,460
 because it wasn't viable for people to live under

996
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,860
 the ice for long periods of time.

997
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,580
 They had hospitals, they had a cinema,

998
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,780
 they had shops.

999
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,940
 - Shops, yeah, yeah.

1000
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,540
 - What's all this sewage, therefore?

1001
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,860
 - Yeah, I don't know why all the sewage is there.

1002
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,060
 Maybe it made you have a funny tummy

1003
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,300
 if you're living on a freezer.

1004
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,660
 - Makes it easy to freeze, try.

1005
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,580
 - Yeah, that's true.

1006
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,220
 But it's a problem because the ice sheet might melt

1007
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,060
 on Greenland.

1008
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,460
 And then you've got all the radioactive sludge,

1009
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,300
 which is going to.

1010
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,940
 - No, but bad news, the ice sheet melts,

1011
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,860
 the seas kind of rise and stuff like that.

1012
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
 Good news, we find a new cinema.

1013
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,860
 - Yeah.

1014
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,860
 - Oh, yeah.

1015
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,220
 - Imagine that day when the ice melt said there's a,

1016
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,300
 like an, you know, an Odin.

1017
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,100
 - Yeah, covered in radioactive waste.

1018
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,500
 And sewage.

1019
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,820
 - I can imagine it being a hipster destination cinema,

1020
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
 actually.

1021
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,420
 People look like it's going to be great.

1022
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,860
 - You have to dig through 12 meters of ice together.

1023
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,340
 (laughing)

1024
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,980
 - Okay, okay, I can't wait anymore.

1025
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,820
 - What's an ice worm?

1026
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,060
 - Oh, yeah, sorry.

1027
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,140
 (laughing)

1028
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,340
 - That's why you've been quiet all this time.

1029
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,460
 - It took so long, oh my God.

1030
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,100
 - Well, an ice worm, like I say,

1031
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,740
 it is just a worm that lives on ice.

1032
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,780
 They live in glaciers and they eat little bits of pollen

1033
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,820
 that have been trapped in the glacier.

1034
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,660
 They're little black things.

1035
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,060
 So you can see them really easily.

1036
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,540
 - And do they burrow through the ice

1037
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,780
 and live when they're under ice?

1038
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,700
 - Well, sometimes they do.

1039
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,900
 So if it's warm on the outside,

1040
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,460
 if it's above, like, say, two degrees,

1041
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,540
 they'll go into the ice.

1042
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,380
 Because if they get above five degrees, they melt.

1043
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,380
 And they literally melt, they turn to liquid, these worms.

1044
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,180
 It's like an enzyme in their body,

1045
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,020
 which starts to liquefy the whole body.

1046
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,100
 So if they go above, like, say, two or three degrees,

1047
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,540
 they will melt.

1048
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,620
 And you see them on glaciers, the little black things.

1049
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,860
 - Wow.

1050
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,260
 - That's so terrifying thing, then.

1051
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,340
 For some reason, I feel it's like speed,

1052
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,780
 where you can't go over a certain amount.

1053
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,420
 - And they're obsessively watching

1054
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,980
 that the moment you're at the time.

1055
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,620
 - Yeah.

1056
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,860
 - Sometimes glaciers enter this super fast state.

1057
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,140
 And they go-- - How fast?

1058
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,580
 - Not very fast.

1059
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,060
 - So not super fast.

1060
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:36,100
 It's, well, they're called them glaciers surges.

1061
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,100
 And they move at 100 times their normal speed.

1062
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,700
 - When I read that the fastest that they've ever gone

1063
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,580
 is 11 miles per year.

1064
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,820
 - That's pretty fast.

1065
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,580
 Is it that? - Is it?

1066
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,140
 - Well, it's about 45 meters per day.

1067
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,860
 - Sure, it's like southern rail.

1068
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,820
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

1069
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,820
 But they are moving four times faster than they were

1070
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,980
 in the '90s, in the summer's speed of glaciers.

1071
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,140
 - Which is, that's big.

1072
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,860
 Where they're going?

1073
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,700
 - Well, they're melting.

1074
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,340
 - Down hill, down hill, and towards the--

1075
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,220
 - Oh, okay, right, okay.

1076
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,820
 - So that's what a glacier is, basically.

1077
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,260
 It's loads and loads of snow that's fallen over,

1078
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,380
 loads and loads of years.

1079
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,620
 And it's just slowly with gravity moving down

1080
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,860
 as well to see like a river, but it's made of ice.

1081
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,460
 - So it's on land?

1082
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,300
 - Yes.

1083
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,740
 - Okay. - Yeah.

1084
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,820
 - Otherwise it'd be an iceberg.

1085
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,220
 - Yes, okay, so that's the difference.

1086
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,780
 That's what I didn't understand.

1087
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,180
 - Yeah, and actually, a fox's glacier mint

1088
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,820
 chose a polar bear standing on an iceberg.

1089
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,660
 - You're right.

1090
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,020
 - So as a completely inaccurate mint.

1091
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,860
 - It should be an iceberg mint.

1092
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,860
 - Yes.

1093
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,500
 - Or they need to change their design.

1094
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,340
 - Either way.

1095
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,020
 - Until they do one of those two things,

1096
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,820
 I'm gonna buy one of those mints.

1097
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,620
 - I mean, to be honest, if we've been really pedantic,

1098
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,420
 they should show a fox standing on a glacier.

1099
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,260
 - So they've got it going in a couple of ways.

1100
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,740
 - It's in a polar bear on iceberg.

1101
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,980
 What are you guys doing?

1102
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,140
 (laughing)

1103
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,740
 - I'm in a bear iceberg mint.

1104
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
 (laughing)

1105
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,100
 It should be.

1106
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,140
 - There are towns in the Alps

1107
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,500
 who are still burying soldiers from the First World War,

1108
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
 thanks to Glacier melt.

1109
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,340
 - What do you mean by that?

1110
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,580
 - Well, loads of soldiers were posted

1111
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,940
 in the Alps during the First World War,

1112
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,780
 and it was incredibly, obviously,

1113
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,900
 very cold, extremely harsh conditions to live in,

1114
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,460
 and they were fighting very fiercely

1115
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,340
 over almost no territory, basically.

1116
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,220
 But lots of soldiers froze to death,

1117
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,940
 got caught in the Glaciers,

1118
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,260
 they didn't get caught by the Glaciers,

1119
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,100
 but they...

1120
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,500
 - Incredibly slow, like that Austin Powers scene,

1121
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,140
 edging away from the slow moving Glacier.

1122
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,260
 - Well, no, we've established that they're super fast,

1123
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,300
 so maybe they weren't ready for the speed of a...

1124
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,300
 - Okay.

1125
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,540
 - Of a Glacier, about 11 miles per year.

1126
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,540
 - 11 miles per year.

1127
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,940
 (laughing)

1128
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,700
 - How did these guys get into the army?

1129
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,620
 - Anyway, they were caught.

1130
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,340
 - They're now being discovered

1131
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,140
 as the Glaciers retreat as they melt.

1132
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,260
 Bodies are being discovered, and they're being buried.

1133
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,660
 So there was a funeral for two of them

1134
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,300
 in 2013, and 500 people turned up to pay their respect.

1135
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,820
 - Were their bodies preserved properly?

1136
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,980
 Like, 'cause I remember when they found

1137
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,140
 Mallory on Everest, you know,

1138
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,740
 a lot of his skin was there.

1139
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,980
 His body was there, 'cause they...

1140
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,220
 - Yeah. - You're properly preserved, aren't you?

1141
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,940
 - I don't know how well preserved they were,

1142
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,220
 but there is a particular town called Peo

1143
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,780
 where they do a lot of these barrels,

1144
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,100
 'cause they're near a lot of the battlefield sites,

1145
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,060
 and that's where the bodies are being discovered.

1146
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,220
 - Wow. - Amazing.

1147
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,380
 - It is kind of a...

1148
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,740
 If you're looking on the bright side of Clover Warming,

1149
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,420
 it is good for glacial archaeology, isn't it?

1150
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,260
 Because these...

1151
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,980
 Like you say, it's suddenly revealing all this amazing stuff.

1152
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,620
 So melting glaciers have suddenly revealed

1153
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,820
 like lots of Roman coins, some Iron Age horses.

1154
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,900
 There's a glass you call the Meadow Hall Glacier.

1155
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,060
 - I'm not sure, I don't know.

1156
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,620
 Like, a couple of coins in a horse

1157
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,900
 makes up for losing the entire Netherlands.

1158
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,220
 - No, no, no, no, no.

1159
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,500
 - What if you want your children to go

1160
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,260
 into the same line of work as you when there's no more ice?

1161
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,860
 It's only good in the very short term.

1162
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,140
 - Well, I think we've established that this view

1163
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,300
 is a very short term view, isn't it?

1164
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,300
 That's already about the long term.

1165
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,980
 I would be concerned about climate change.

1166
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,300
 (laughing)

1167
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,380
 As it is, I'm very excited about these Roman coins.

1168
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,140
 (laughing)

1169
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,620
 And a forest, so there's a thousand-year-old...

1170
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,460
 (laughing)

1171
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,580
 We could always do it more forest,

1172
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,100
 and there's a thousand-year-old forest

1173
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,260
 that's been revealed by a melting glacier in Alaska.

1174
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,060
 - I bet it's a rubbish forest after all the time

1175
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,300
 on a glacier, it can't be good.

1176
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,300
 - It's a bit stumpy, but there is indeed.

1177
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,820
 - A bit depressing, it's a dead squirrels everywhere.

1178
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,660
 (laughing)

1179
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,020
 - Yeah, that's strange, isn't it?

1180
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,260
 'Cause you do want more trees as well.

1181
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,140
 You want more forests, but you also want more ice,

1182
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,820
 so which do you choose?

1183
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,860
 - Oh, it's so easy to choose, isn't it?

1184
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,700
 - Yeah.

1185
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,020
 - But the ice, I think we'll keep the ice.

1186
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,860
 - Okay, yeah.

1187
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,780
 - Great, 'cause you can go forests elsewhere

1188
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,820
 where there's no ice, but you can't put ice.

1189
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,820
 - You can make ice.

1190
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:34,460
 - You can't keep it in the Amazon.

1191
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,460
 (laughing)

1192
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,780
 If you have a refrigerator, you can.

1193
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,020
 - You can't turn the hours into a fridge.

1194
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,700
 - Dad, but you can put a lot of refrigerators

1195
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,540
 into the Amazon.

1196
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,460
 - It's not a refrigerator, it's a freezer.

1197
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,300
 - Why?

1198
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,140
 (laughing)

1199
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,580
 - A refrigerator's just gonna slow down the melting.

1200
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,420
 (laughing)

1201
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,620
 That's why my ice tray's always full of water.

1202
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,860
 (laughing)

1203
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,180
 I'm living.

1204
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,700
 That's why my pasties are never any good.

1205
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,940
 - Do you want some ice, or do you think?

1206
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,020
 - Dribble, dribble, dribble.

1207
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,020
 (laughing)

1208
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,460
 - Have a bite, we'll have an ice cream instead.

1209
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,460
 - Oh no.

1210
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,580
 (laughing)

1211
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,180
 (upbeat music)

1212
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,940
 - Okay, that's it.

1213
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,980
 That is all of our facts.

1214
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,260
 Thank you so much for listening.

1215
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,940
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1216
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,060
 about the things that we have said

1217
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,140
 over the course of this podcast,

1218
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,820
 we can be found on our Twitter account.

1219
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,660
 So I'm on @Streiberland, James.

1220
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
 - @XShakes.

1221
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,500
 - Andy.

1222
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,340
 - @AndruHunterM.

1223
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,180
 - And Anna.

1224
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,940
 - You can email podcast@QI.com.

1225
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,580
 - Yep, or you can go to our group account.

1226
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,540
 It's @QIPodcast, or you can go to our website.

1227
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,140
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1228
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,500
 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

1229
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,740
 We'll be back again next week.

1230
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,540
 See you then, guys.

1231
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,380
 Goodbye.

1232
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,980
 (upbeat music)

1233
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,560
 (upbeat music)

1234
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:56,560
 (upbeat music)
