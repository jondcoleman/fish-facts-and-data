00:00:02,00:00:16,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:16,00:00:19,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish, A Weekly Podcast"""
00:00:19,00:00:22,coming to you from the QI offices and covered guarded.
00:00:22,00:00:26,"My name is Dad Shriver, and I'm sitting here"
00:00:26,00:00:28,"with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter-Marie,"
00:00:28,00:00:30,and Adich Zinski.
00:00:30,00:00:32,"And Adich Zinski, and once again,"
00:00:32,00:00:35,we have Gather Grown on my face.
00:00:35,00:00:37,"And once again, we have Gather Grown on the microphones"
00:00:37,00:00:39,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:39,00:00:41,and in no particular order.
00:00:41,00:00:43,Here we go.
00:00:43,00:00:47,- What even does that have to do with the sound of the microphone?
00:00:47,00:00:48,- Very confusing.
00:00:48,00:00:50,"- Starting with my fact, my fact this week"
00:00:50,00:00:53,is that the man who popularized the high five
00:00:53,00:00:54,only has four fingers.
00:00:54,00:00:55,(laughing)
00:00:55,00:00:57,And this was a basketball player
00:00:57,00:00:59,called Wiley Brown.
00:00:59,00:01:03,"Back in 1978/79 season of basketball,"
00:01:03,00:01:07,he and his mate started high fiveing.
00:01:07,00:01:11,"And they talk about it really, really interestingly."
00:01:11,00:01:13,"Like I read an interview where he said,"
00:01:13,00:01:16,"""No one was doing it, they all did it low."
00:01:16,00:01:18,"""There's all these low fives going on."
00:01:18,00:01:18,"""No one did it high."""
00:01:18,00:01:20,"And then he said, ""Then the first time we did it,"
00:01:20,00:01:23,"""both of us looked at each other and said,"
00:01:23,00:01:24,"""Did that just happen?"""
00:01:24,00:01:26,(laughing)
00:01:26,00:01:27,- He really did to it.
00:01:27,00:01:28,There's a magical moment.
00:01:28,00:01:30,"- Can I just ask, when you say four fingers,"
00:01:30,00:01:32,you mean on one of his hands?
00:01:32,00:01:33,"- Exactly, nine fingers."
00:01:33,00:01:34,"- Yes, exactly."
00:01:34,00:01:36,So he had nine fingers in total.
00:01:36,00:01:37,He was missing a thumb.
00:01:37,00:01:39,He lost his thumb when he was four years old
00:01:39,00:01:41,"and prosthetic thumb was made,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,which meant that he could still become
00:01:43,00:01:44,an amazing sports star
00:01:44,00:01:47,'cause he played basketball and football.
00:01:47,00:01:50,He was a bit sort of carefree about his thumb at times.
00:01:50,00:01:54,"He actually went to the finals of a basketball match,"
00:01:54,00:01:56,having left his thumb back at the hotel
00:01:56,00:01:57,that he stayed at and they had to rescue it.
00:01:57,00:01:59,- That would be awful if you had to hitchhike hold.
00:01:59,00:02:01,(laughing)
00:02:01,00:02:03,"- Well, you could only do it on one side of the road."
00:02:03,00:02:04,(laughing)
00:02:04,00:02:08,"- He actually hated his thumb, his prosthetic thumb."
00:02:08,00:02:09,"Yeah, he tried not to wear it."
00:02:09,00:02:11,So he played basketball without the thumb for ages
00:02:11,00:02:12,"and then one of his coaches said,"
00:02:12,00:02:14,"""You're really good without that."
00:02:14,00:02:15,"""But you'd be even better with it."""
00:02:15,00:02:16,And they made him wear one
00:02:16,00:02:18,and it kept on flying off matches
00:02:18,00:02:20,and he said it made him look like a freak
00:02:20,00:02:22,"'cause you know, it was someone would bash into his thumb"
00:02:22,00:02:23,and it would fly into the crowd.
00:02:23,00:02:25,And so he tried not to wear it
00:02:25,00:02:27,and the coach was adamant.
00:02:27,00:02:30,"And so much so that he said if he wasn't wearing his thumb,"
00:02:30,00:02:32,he wouldn't let the other teammates pass
00:02:32,00:02:35,"to his right hand, which really damaged the game."
00:02:35,00:02:37,So they could only pass to his left hand.
00:02:37,00:02:38,"- Oh, so."
00:02:38,00:02:40,"- Yeah, he wasn't a fan."
00:02:40,00:02:42,- I should say that I got this fact.
00:02:42,00:02:45,It was sent into us by a guy called Michael Buccino.
00:02:45,00:02:48,"He's a listener and again, it's quickly up to say this."
00:02:48,00:02:52,"If you wanna see the finest interview ever, ever recorded,"
00:02:52,00:02:54,"go to YouTube and put in Wiley Brown,"
00:02:54,00:02:56,talking about the high five.
00:02:56,00:02:59,"It is nine minutes of interview where they ask a question,"
00:02:59,00:03:01,"which is, ""So you invented the high five, how was it?"""
00:03:01,00:03:03,"He says, ""Yeah, it's great."""
00:03:03,00:03:05,And then they've got nine minutes more of interview.
00:03:05,00:03:06,- It's too long.
00:03:06,00:03:07,- It's not too long.
00:03:07,00:03:08,- It is.
00:03:08,00:03:09,- I watched it.
00:03:09,00:03:10,"- No, 'cause they run out of questions"
00:03:10,00:03:11,but he does not run out of answers.
00:03:11,00:03:13,He is so enthusiastic.
00:03:13,00:03:16,And he has a new tale for each time the high five started.
00:03:16,00:03:19,"So he did it with Derek Smith, who Wiley Brown says,"
00:03:19,00:03:21,"""Is the actual creator of the high five?"""
00:03:21,00:03:24,Because in all the stories Smith is the one who instigates it.
00:03:24,00:03:27,"So for example, another story is that he said he was going up"
00:03:27,00:03:30,"during practice to Derek Smith to give him a low five,"
00:03:30,00:03:32,"classic low five, as they always did."
00:03:32,00:03:33,"And then he said, ""Out of nowhere,"
00:03:33,00:03:38,"""Smith looked brown in the eye and said, 'No, up high.'"""
00:03:38,00:03:41,"I mean, that's what I can also do."
00:03:41,00:03:44,- There was another theory about who invented the high five.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"- Yeah, it's very controversial, isn't it?"
00:03:46,00:03:51,"- Yeah, so there's a baseball player called Dusty Baker,"
00:03:51,00:03:54,"and another called Glenn Burke, and it's claimed that when Baker"
00:03:54,00:03:55,"was getting back towards the dugout,"
00:03:55,00:03:57,"Burke offered a raised hand and Baker,"
00:03:57,00:04:00,"not knowing what to do, smacked it."
00:04:00,00:04:03,"Again, very much the same sort of amazing foundation moment."
00:04:03,00:04:05,And then Burke went out and he got a home run
00:04:05,00:04:06,and then on the way back he gave him another high five.
00:04:06,00:04:09,And that was in 1977 that that supposedly happened.
00:04:09,00:04:10,- So that's earlier?
00:04:10,00:04:12,"- It's earlier, so that predates."
00:04:12,00:04:13,- Yes.
00:04:13,00:04:14,- Maybe an origin.
00:04:14,00:04:16,"- Do you know Glenn Burke, who you were talking about?"
00:04:16,00:04:17,- Yeah.
00:04:17,00:04:19,- He's famous because he was pretty much the first
00:04:19,00:04:21,major league baseball player to come out as gay.
00:04:21,00:04:24,"And there was a documentary in 2010 called Out,"
00:04:24,00:04:28,"The Glenn Burke Story, and they said that the Dodgers'"
00:04:28,00:04:33,"executives offered him $75,000 to get married,"
00:04:33,00:04:36,because it would cause such a problem if people found out
00:04:36,00:04:38,he was gay while he was still playing.
00:04:38,00:04:39,- No way.
00:04:39,00:04:41,"- And apparently when they said,"
00:04:41,00:04:44,"""Would you take $75,000 to get married?"""
00:04:44,00:04:46,"He said, ""I guess you mean to a woman?"""
00:04:46,00:04:49,It's just quite a good reply.
00:04:49,00:04:51,"- That's a great title for a movie, Out."
00:04:51,00:04:53,I guess you mean to a woman?
00:04:53,00:04:54,"- Oh, right, no, no."
00:04:54,00:04:55,Out.
00:04:55,00:04:57,"- Oh, the actual movie itself."
00:04:57,00:04:59,- Do you think there was any confusion at the start
00:04:59,00:05:01,"when people would say, ""Hey, how's Glenn?"""
00:05:01,00:05:02,"And then you go, ""Oh, he's out."""
00:05:02,00:05:05,"And they go, ""No, he's not, he's still out."""
00:05:05,00:05:07,Just years of playing.
00:05:07,00:05:08,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:05:08,00:05:11,"And then Dusty Baker, just one fact about him,"
00:05:11,00:05:15,he was famous for liking to chew toothpicks.
00:05:15,00:05:18,"He said toothpicks are an excellent source of protein,"
00:05:18,00:05:20,which he was wrong about.
00:05:20,00:05:20,- No.
00:05:20,00:05:23,"- So on high fives, there is a basketball team"
00:05:23,00:05:25,called the Phoenix Sons.
00:05:25,00:05:26,- Yes.
00:05:26,00:05:26,- Has he heard of them?
00:05:26,00:05:27,- Yeah.
00:05:27,00:05:28,"- Is that like saying, there is a football team"
00:05:28,00:05:30,called Manchester United.
00:05:30,00:05:31,"- Yes, it is."
00:05:31,00:05:32,- You're on it.
00:05:32,00:05:38,"- Anyway, these Phoenix Sons in 2016,"
00:05:38,00:05:40,they announced that they were keeping track
00:05:40,00:05:43,"of all the high fives that their team passed to each other,"
00:05:43,00:05:45,"hoping that they would create more camaraderie,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,like throughout the season they did this.
00:05:47,00:05:51,And supposedly teams which embrace the most
00:05:51,00:05:53,in terms of the high fives or other celebrations
00:05:53,00:05:54,are more successful.
00:05:54,00:05:55,"- Yeah, I think it's surely more likely"
00:05:55,00:05:57,"that if you're more successful,"
00:05:57,00:05:59,you score more points than you high fives each other more.
00:05:59,00:06:00,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:06:00,00:06:01,There is a cause and effect thing there.
00:06:01,00:06:05,But I've read articles saying that sports players
00:06:05,00:06:09,who touch each other more are supposedly better
00:06:09,00:06:10,at the spots.
00:06:10,00:06:12,And I'm pretty sure that England cricket team
00:06:12,00:06:13,"always touch each other on the bum,"
00:06:13,00:06:15,whenever they do something good.
00:06:15,00:06:16,- Yes.
00:06:16,00:06:17,- And I think that kind of comes from that idea.
00:06:17,00:06:18,"- Sports, psychologists."
00:06:18,00:06:21,"- Most sports do, yeah, there's bum slaps all the time."
00:06:21,00:06:23,"- If we want to improve our performance on the podcast,"
00:06:23,00:06:24,should we start slapping each other's bum?
00:06:24,00:06:26,"- No, I don't think we should."
00:06:26,00:06:27,I think we could just...
00:06:27,00:06:28,(laughing)
00:06:28,00:06:31,"- That was a high five by the way, not a bum slap."
00:06:31,00:06:34,- There is a machine that an artist has invented
00:06:34,00:06:36,"where you can, it does self high fives."
00:06:36,00:06:37,Have you seen it?
00:06:37,00:06:38,- No.
00:06:38,00:06:40,- It's unbelievably disgusting looking.
00:06:40,00:06:42,- It's the sound that the saddest loneliest machine in the world.
00:06:42,00:06:44,- She's a Turkish-born artist.
00:06:44,00:06:45,I think she lives in America.
00:06:45,00:06:46,Good.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Denise O'Zueger.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"Sorry, how does she pronounce her surname?"
00:06:49,00:06:51,"I don't know, but I don't think it's like that."
00:06:51,00:06:52,(laughing)
00:06:52,00:06:54,"I'm so sorry if I can just pronounce it,"
00:06:54,00:06:55,which I definitely have.
00:06:55,00:06:57,"So she cast her own arm, right?"
00:06:57,00:06:59,"She made two cast of her arms,"
00:06:59,00:07:02,and then one of them is just sticking out of this machine.
00:07:02,00:07:05,"And the other one is like rotating very slowly,"
00:07:05,00:07:07,like a cabab thing.
00:07:07,00:07:08,(laughing)
00:07:08,00:07:10,"And every minute, they come into contact"
00:07:10,00:07:12,"'cause it's going around in a circle, the moving up,"
00:07:12,00:07:16,and it just slowly brushes the fingers of the other arm.
00:07:16,00:07:17,- So that's not really a high f--
00:07:17,00:07:20,That's how you would imagine Michael Gov would high-five.
00:07:20,00:07:22,(laughing)
00:07:22,00:07:24,"- Yeah, it's really, it's really worth it."
00:07:24,00:07:25,It only does one high-five per minute.
00:07:25,00:07:26,I'm not sure what the point is.
00:07:26,00:07:27,- One high-five per minute.
00:07:27,00:07:28,"- But it's hard, it's hard."
00:07:28,00:07:29,That's the point.
00:07:29,00:07:30,"- It's not, it's okay."
00:07:30,00:07:33,- The thumbs up that Donald Trump's gradually destroying
00:07:33,00:07:34,for everyone else in the world.
00:07:34,00:07:35,(laughing)
00:07:35,00:07:37,Do you know what the origin of that is?
00:07:37,00:07:38,- Apparently there were little theories.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"- In basketball, when someone got hit in the face"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"by a stray thumb and they held it off and said,"
00:07:43,00:07:44,"""Who's this?"""
00:07:44,00:07:47,(laughing)
00:07:47,00:07:50,"- It's a strong theory, but no."
00:07:50,00:07:51,So apparently there's a--
00:07:51,00:07:52,"- Yeah, two other things."
00:07:52,00:07:53,"- Well, there's quite a strong myth that says"
00:07:53,00:07:55,"that gladiators, you give the thumbs up for gladiators"
00:07:55,00:07:57,if you thought they should live in and the thumbs down.
00:07:57,00:07:58,"They should die, but I think that's not true."
00:07:58,00:08:00,"I think you just put your thumb out and that meant,"
00:08:00,00:08:02,I think we've got no evidence that the thumbs up
00:08:02,00:08:05,meant live and thumbs down meant die.
00:08:05,00:08:08,"But, Desmond Morris says that it's from medieval times"
00:08:08,00:08:10,"where if you were a businessman doing a deal,"
00:08:10,00:08:12,then the way you do it is you'd lick your thumb
00:08:12,00:08:14,and then you press it up against someone else's
00:08:14,00:08:16,"licked thumb and that was really like,"
00:08:16,00:08:17,"""Hey, deal is done."""
00:08:17,00:08:20,"- Wow, that's like blood brothers,"
00:08:20,00:08:23,but slightly weirdly more disgusting.
00:08:23,00:08:24,"- What it reminds me of is,"
00:08:24,00:08:26,"do you remember in the last QI meeting,"
00:08:26,00:08:30,"Anna, when you were trying to show us some pick-up lines"
00:08:30,00:08:33,"and you tried one on under, you missed this done?"
00:08:33,00:08:34,- Two.
00:08:34,00:08:36,"- She licked her thumb, wiped it on these clothes"
00:08:36,00:08:40,"and said, ""Let's get you out of these wet clothes."""
00:08:40,00:08:41,"- Oh, that's, yeah, that's a good one."
00:08:41,00:08:43,- He was smitten.
00:08:43,00:08:45,- The single most erotic moment of my life.
00:08:45,00:08:47,(laughing)
00:08:47,00:08:48,- That's strong.
00:08:48,00:08:50,"- You know, couples,"
00:08:50,00:08:53,Marion couples used to shake hands at the altar.
00:08:53,00:08:54,"- Oh, really?"
00:08:54,00:08:57,"- So this is a BBC History magazine claims this,"
00:08:57,00:08:59,"but yeah, in the 17th century you got married"
00:08:59,00:09:00,and then you shake hands with the bride.
00:09:00,00:09:02,- So because it's like a contract movie.
00:09:02,00:09:03,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:09:03,00:09:05,"- The kissing thing, when I got married in January,"
00:09:05,00:09:07,"the priest told us that, you know, it's not a thing,"
00:09:07,00:09:09,you don't need to do it.
00:09:09,00:09:11,"It's like, it's just people just started doing it."
00:09:11,00:09:13,It just caught on like the high five
00:09:13,00:09:14,and just people decided to do it.
00:09:14,00:09:16,But it's never been officially a part of the ceremony.
00:09:16,00:09:17,"- Yeah, I know."
00:09:17,00:09:18,- You make his the bride is not a line
00:09:18,00:09:19,a part of the ceremony.
00:09:19,00:09:20,"- He popularized it, don't."
00:09:20,00:09:23,- I think it was a half-lipped amount.
00:09:23,00:09:25,(laughing)
00:09:25,00:09:25,"- Yeah, I don't know."
00:09:25,00:09:26,- It's quite American.
00:09:26,00:09:27,I always think of it as not a--
00:09:27,00:09:28,"- What, you made out kiss the bride?"
00:09:28,00:09:30,"- Yes, in fact, that's what he said to me."
00:09:30,00:09:31,He said that it's something that was seen
00:09:31,00:09:33,"in American movies and then everyone thought,"
00:09:33,00:09:35,"""Oh, there's meant to be that line."""
00:09:35,00:09:36,And then we started doing it.
00:09:36,00:09:39,"- So when I was looking at stuff about high fives,"
00:09:39,00:09:42,I came across an article about a lollipop man.
00:09:42,00:09:46,He's quit because he was high five in the children
00:09:46,00:09:48,as they walked across the road.
00:09:48,00:09:49,And he was told not to do it.
00:09:49,00:09:52,"And he was like, ""Right, fine, I'm gonna quit."""
00:09:52,00:09:52,- Okay.
00:09:52,00:09:54,"- So just very quickly, a lollipop man,"
00:09:54,00:09:56,"'cause I didn't know this until I got to this country,"
00:09:56,00:09:59,is someone who stands by a zebra crossing
00:09:59,00:10:01,and allows school children to walk across.
00:10:01,00:10:02,- I had no idea.
00:10:02,00:10:05,- He's holding a large lollipop shaped object
00:10:05,00:10:05,to stop the cars.
00:10:05,00:10:07,- But he doesn't sell lollipops.
00:10:07,00:10:09,- And a zebra crossing is a road crossing
00:10:09,00:10:10,with black and white stripes on it.
00:10:10,00:10:12,- That the Beatles walked over on Abbey Road.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"- Yes, but there are thousands and thousands"
00:10:14,00:10:15,of zebra crossings.
00:10:15,00:10:16,It's not like Britain has one zebra crossing
00:10:16,00:10:18,and all school children have to cross that
00:10:18,00:10:20,before they go to the school.
00:10:20,00:10:22,- I was surprised I got the space to take that photo
00:10:22,00:10:24,"with all the kids. - Anyway, lollipop man."
00:10:24,00:10:27,"- So this guy, he was from a Plymouth City Council."
00:10:27,00:10:30,And then I just carried on reading the rest
00:10:30,00:10:32,of the Google searches on pages two and three
00:10:32,00:10:34,that people don't normally go to.
00:10:34,00:10:37,And there was also a lollipop man in Edinburgh
00:10:37,00:10:39,who was told not to high five children.
00:10:39,00:10:41,There was a lollipop lady in the Vale of Glamorgan
00:10:41,00:10:43,who had the same.
00:10:43,00:10:46,There was two lollipop men in Essex that I found.
00:10:46,00:10:50,"There was a guy in Weston, Batonshire,"
00:10:50,00:10:53,who's left his job because he wasn't allowed
00:10:53,00:10:54,to high five kids.
00:10:54,00:10:58,"And there was a guy in Australia, in Bayside, Australia,"
00:10:58,00:11:03,"who was also left his job because, well, he got told off"
00:11:03,00:11:04,because he was high five in children.
00:11:04,00:11:06,So this seems to be a real problem.
00:11:06,00:11:10,- Amazing that it's like a deal breaker for keeping your job.
00:11:10,00:11:11,(laughing)
00:11:11,00:11:12,- No high five?
00:11:12,00:11:13,I'm out of here.
00:11:13,00:11:15,- That is so weird.
00:11:15,00:11:16,- It's weird.
00:11:16,00:11:17,- It's just a thing that seems to be happening
00:11:17,00:11:18,all over the world.
00:11:18,00:11:19,- That's amazing.
00:11:19,00:11:21,I bet no one else has made that connection in the world.
00:11:21,00:11:23,I bet even they have not made that connection.
00:11:23,00:11:25,- It's a lollipop. - I bet they mean.
00:11:25,00:11:27,- The high five club.
00:11:27,00:11:29,- They mean high five each other and that feels like it.
00:11:29,00:11:30,(laughing)
00:11:30,00:11:31,- It's because it's dangerous.
00:11:31,00:11:34,"- So the idea is, you're supposed to be concentrating"
00:11:34,00:11:39,on the road and not high five in kids as they go across.
00:11:39,00:11:42,"And presumably what's happened, I might be completely wrong"
00:11:42,00:11:44,"about this, but it seems to me like a memo's gone out"
00:11:44,00:11:47,to all the different councils and they've all gone
00:11:47,00:11:49,round checking that no one's high five in people.
00:11:49,00:11:52,"I don't know if that's right, but it's a real coincidence."
00:11:52,00:11:54,"- It doesn't take that much concentration to high five,"
00:11:54,00:11:55,does it?
00:11:55,00:11:58,- I thought you could focus on the road as well as also.
00:11:58,00:11:59,- Yeah.
00:11:59,00:12:01,- But if someone was repeatedly high five
00:12:01,00:12:04,"in while driving, I would not be so comfortable"
00:12:04,00:12:05,as a passenger.
00:12:05,00:12:06,- How would you do that so that you'll hand out the window?
00:12:06,00:12:07,"- I guess so, yeah."
00:12:07,00:12:09,- But then you're driving too close to the paper.
00:12:09,00:12:11,(laughing)
00:12:11,00:12:13,"- No, you would high five other drivers"
00:12:13,00:12:14,coming in the opposite direction.
00:12:14,00:12:15,"- Oh, of course."
00:12:15,00:12:17,- What you can't see on the Abbey Road cover
00:12:17,00:12:20,is a crest fall in lollipop van on the other side
00:12:20,00:12:22,taking his P-45 slip with it.
00:12:22,00:12:23,- Yeah.
00:12:23,00:12:25,- I don't ever high five the Beatles again.
00:12:25,00:12:27,(laughing)
00:12:27,00:12:30,(upbeat music)
00:12:30,00:12:33,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:12:33,00:12:35,And that is Chuzinski.
00:12:35,00:12:37,"- Yeah, my fact this week is that when the first American"
00:12:37,00:12:41,"woman went into space, NASA designed a makeup kit for her."
00:12:41,00:12:45,And this is an interview I was reading this week
00:12:45,00:12:47,"with Sally Ride, who was in the first group"
00:12:47,00:12:50,of female Americans who went into space.
00:12:50,00:12:53,"And yeah, she said that NASA called her in for a meeting"
00:12:53,00:12:55,"and said, look, we're really worried about this,"
00:12:55,00:12:56,but we're sending women out there now.
00:12:56,00:12:59,And we obviously need to design your makeup kit.
00:12:59,00:13:01,So what kind of stuff should we be putting in there?
00:13:01,00:13:02,'Cause we're a bit stuck with that.
00:13:02,00:13:03,- What did she say?
00:13:03,00:13:05,- And she said it was the last thing she wanted
00:13:05,00:13:07,to be thinking about at that time.
00:13:07,00:13:11,"- Effectively, this fact is about the sort of slightly"
00:13:11,00:13:14,"backward, massively backward sexism that happens"
00:13:14,00:13:14,to a lot of women to say.
00:13:14,00:13:16,"- We don't want people to look like a minger for the aliens,"
00:13:16,00:13:19,do you? (laughing)
00:13:19,00:13:21,"- So there was this interview with Sally Ride, too."
00:13:21,00:13:24,"It was quite sweet saying that when NASA came to her,"
00:13:24,00:13:26,"they were a bit confused about various things,"
00:13:26,00:13:28,like they didn't know how many tampons they would want out
00:13:28,00:13:30,"in space, so they suggested a hundred tampons per person"
00:13:30,00:13:33,"for a week and she was like, you know what I mean?"
00:13:33,00:13:34,(laughing)
00:13:34,00:13:36,- What if you need to build a fort?
00:13:36,00:13:38,(laughing)
00:13:38,00:13:41,"- Tampon fort, please put your child to do this."
00:13:41,00:13:43,"- It's like a pillow fort, but for a mouse."
00:13:43,00:13:45,(laughing)
00:13:45,00:13:46,"- But some of them, I read an interview with another"
00:13:46,00:13:48,of the women who went up who said that
00:13:48,00:13:50,"when they came in and asked them do they want makeup,"
00:13:50,00:13:51,what kind of makeup do they want?
00:13:51,00:13:53,"They were loud gaffors by some of the women,"
00:13:53,00:13:56,"but one of them said, look, these pictures taken in space"
00:13:56,00:13:58,will follow us around for the rest of our lives.
00:13:58,00:14:01,And I don't want to disappear into the background.
00:14:01,00:14:03,So a couple of them did take these makeup kits up.
00:14:03,00:14:04,- Wow.
00:14:04,00:14:05,- Yeah.
00:14:05,00:14:06,"- Well, they sort of specially tested makeup that would adhere"
00:14:06,00:14:08,"to the skin, even in a microgravity."
00:14:08,00:14:10,"- But what doesn't happen with makeup, Andy,"
00:14:10,00:14:13,"is women don't put makeup on at the start of the day,"
00:14:13,00:14:16,"and by the end of the day, the gravity's just pulled it down"
00:14:16,00:14:17,to the bottom of their faces.
00:14:17,00:14:18,(laughing)
00:14:18,00:14:19,- Paul's is on your feet.
00:14:19,00:14:21,(laughing)
00:14:21,00:14:22,- That's a good point.
00:14:22,00:14:24,- I'm a face-up crotch look at a freepier.
00:14:24,00:14:26,(laughing)
00:14:26,00:14:30,"- No, it's extraordinary, though, that they sort of..."
00:14:30,00:14:31,- It is weird.
00:14:31,00:14:34,What's also weird is how long NASA took to
00:14:34,00:14:36,"and send women into space, given how long"
00:14:36,00:14:40,"the Soviet Union did not take, so it was 20 years after,"
00:14:40,00:14:42,it was an odd way of creating that space.
00:14:42,00:14:43,(laughing)
00:14:43,00:14:45,- They untucked a long time.
00:14:45,00:14:46,(laughing)
00:14:46,00:14:51,"- So the Soviet Union sent Valentina Tereshkva up in 1963,"
00:14:51,00:14:53,and one NASA official was actually asked what he thought
00:14:53,00:14:55,"about this at the time, and he said it made him sit"
00:14:55,00:14:57,to his stomach to think of women in space.
00:14:57,00:15:00,- But this is the weird thing about Tereshkva's trip.
00:15:00,00:15:05,She was only allowed to go because she wasn't menstruating.
00:15:05,00:15:07,"- Oh, 'cause they were worried about what would happen"
00:15:07,00:15:07,"with periods, don't they?"
00:15:07,00:15:09,- They were just didn't have enough payload
00:15:09,00:15:11,"to take 5,000 tampons of that."
00:15:11,00:15:14,(laughing)
00:15:14,00:15:16,"- No, all these reports sort of worrying about it,"
00:15:16,00:15:19,and so basically all your blood sort of pools
00:15:19,00:15:21,"in your torso and in your head, 'cause there's no gravity,"
00:15:21,00:15:26,so that is something that on Earth is affected by gravity.
00:15:26,00:15:28,"And there was a report in America in 1964, which said,"
00:15:28,00:15:31,"""It will be hard to match,"" I'm quoting here,"
00:15:31,00:15:34,"""a temperamental psychophysiologic human"
00:15:34,00:15:36,"and the complicated machine, either spacecraft,"
00:15:36,00:15:39,"both need to be ready at the same time, i.e.,"
00:15:39,00:15:41,we think women will be too mad
00:15:41,00:15:43,"if they're menstruating to operate a spacecraft."""
00:15:43,00:15:44,- Wow.
00:15:44,00:15:48,- And they also worried that the blood from that system
00:15:48,00:15:49,"would also float up and cause,"
00:15:49,00:15:52,it could cause theoretically a dangerous condition
00:15:52,00:15:55,"called peritonitis, which can be fatal,"
00:15:55,00:15:57,"as they thought, well, what if that happens?"
00:15:57,00:15:59,But the reality is that normal blood circulation
00:15:59,00:16:01,"is completely different to menstrual blood,"
00:16:01,00:16:02,so it was in every risk.
00:16:02,00:16:05,"- And actually, women going up in space is very sensible"
00:16:05,00:16:07,and a good idea because they can do everything
00:16:07,00:16:09,"that the men can do, but they're smaller,"
00:16:09,00:16:10,generally speaking.
00:16:10,00:16:13,You just need less power to get women up there.
00:16:13,00:16:14,"- Oh, I thought you'd be..."
00:16:14,00:16:15,- Every bit counts.
00:16:15,00:16:17,"- You don't have to send them as far because they're smaller,"
00:16:17,00:16:20,so they'll look the same size even when they're a bit closer.
00:16:20,00:16:21,- That's the whole point.
00:16:21,00:16:23,"That's why we send people in space, so they look smaller."
00:16:23,00:16:26,- See what humans would look like
00:16:26,00:16:29,if they were one sent to me to school.
00:16:29,00:16:30,- That's one small step.
00:16:30,00:16:31,"No, it's a double step."
00:16:31,00:16:32,It's just a long way away.
00:16:32,00:16:40,"- There's another astronaut called Svetlana Savitskaya,"
00:16:40,00:16:43,and she went up in 1984.
00:16:43,00:16:46,She didn't mention first women to fly in space twice.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"In 1995, she gave an interview,"
00:16:48,00:16:50,and she was talking about the sort of sexism
00:16:50,00:16:53,that was going on with being a female astronaut.
00:16:53,00:16:56,"When she arrived at the salue seven,"
00:16:56,00:16:59,"as she came in, there was another astronaut there"
00:16:59,00:17:04,who handed her an apron and told her to get to work.
00:17:04,00:17:06,"That was her arrival in space, yeah."
00:17:06,00:17:08,- Was that a tongue-in-cheek thing?
00:17:08,00:17:10,"- No, no, it was very much..."
00:17:10,00:17:12,"- It seems like, well, women shouldn't be up here,"
00:17:12,00:17:14,so I'm going to say something extremely offensive.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"- Oh, so it was a deliberate, like, you shouldn't be here."
00:17:17,00:17:18,"- You shouldn't be here, put the apron on,"
00:17:18,00:17:20,if you're going to be here and clean up the eye of Shuttle.
00:17:20,00:17:21,- Wow.
00:17:21,00:17:23,"- Yeah, they've been deliberately letting dirt build up"
00:17:23,00:17:25,on the Shuttle and jeopardising the entire mission
00:17:25,00:17:28,to make this incredibly petty point.
00:17:28,00:17:30,- Where'd he get the apron from?
00:17:30,00:17:31,Who has an apron in space?
00:17:31,00:17:33,- He would have had to smuggle an apron.
00:17:33,00:17:35,"We would have had to craft an apron,"
00:17:35,00:17:37,probably from vital bits of the spaceship.
00:17:37,00:17:40,"- On the ISS, do you know they have to vacuum every day?"
00:17:40,00:17:41,- Really?
00:17:41,00:17:42,"- Yeah, 'cause they need to keep it clean"
00:17:42,00:17:46,and they need to keep it clear of germs and bacteria.
00:17:46,00:17:48,"And, yeah, so they have to vacuum every day."
00:17:48,00:17:50,- It's quite ironic the fact that they're bringing
00:17:50,00:17:52,the vacuum into space.
00:17:52,00:17:53,"- Oh, yeah."
00:17:53,00:17:56,(all laughing)
00:17:56,00:17:58,"- Do they, 'cause the stuff isn't adhering to the ground,"
00:17:58,00:18:00,'cause of the absence of gravity in the lab.
00:18:00,00:18:02,So do they just wave a vacuum in the air?
00:18:02,00:18:03,- I think they must do.
00:18:03,00:18:04,"- They must do, right?"
00:18:04,00:18:05,- That is so easy.
00:18:05,00:18:07,- I guess what happens is it kind of floats around
00:18:07,00:18:09,and then it'll just stick to things.
00:18:09,00:18:11,"- Yeah, I think it does, that's complete."
00:18:11,00:18:12,"- We mentioned before, you know you get calluses"
00:18:12,00:18:15,"on your feet, 'cause you're not walking around"
00:18:15,00:18:17,"on the ground, so your underside of your feet gets soft."
00:18:17,00:18:18,"And then the top of your feet,"
00:18:18,00:18:20,'cause you're hooking your feet around
00:18:20,00:18:21,railing to things gets very hard.
00:18:21,00:18:24,Those calluses break off.
00:18:24,00:18:26,"And then they're just floating around this base station,"
00:18:26,00:18:28,bits of your own footskin.
00:18:28,00:18:30,So you have to vacuum those up.
00:18:30,00:18:32,- Turn the wear socks first times.
00:18:32,00:18:34,- You should be wearing space socks.
00:18:34,00:18:37,"- I guess so, yeah I guess so."
00:18:37,00:18:39,- But it is cool they have reverse feet in space.
00:18:39,00:18:41,(laughing)
00:18:41,00:18:42,- I do love that.
00:18:42,00:18:43,- Is that what we're saying?
00:18:43,00:18:45,- That's what we're saying.
00:18:45,00:18:47,- If you live in space you have reverse feet.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"- Do you know what happened on the,"
00:18:48,00:18:51,the Maiden Space Shuttle Columbia Mission in 1981?
00:18:51,00:18:54,The toilet got clogged when they were up in space
00:18:54,00:18:57,and they had to use these tube-shaped bags
00:18:57,00:18:59,which attached to your bottom with a sticky seal
00:18:59,00:19:00,to go to the loo.
00:19:00,00:19:01,It's very unpleasant.
00:19:01,00:19:04,"And then as they were re-entering the Earth's atmosphere,"
00:19:04,00:19:07,the toilet was broken and the vacuum dried excrement
00:19:07,00:19:09,got into the ventilation system
00:19:09,00:19:12,and then started floating around in the main cabin.
00:19:12,00:19:12,- No.
00:19:12,00:19:13,- Bad times.
00:19:13,00:19:16,"- That's, see you really need the vacuum cleaner"
00:19:16,00:19:17,then.
00:19:17,00:19:17,"- Yeah you do, yeah."
00:19:17,00:19:18,- You suck that up.
00:19:18,00:19:21,- You can't suck up poo in a vacuum cleaner.
00:19:21,00:19:23,- I wouldn't use it again after I'd done it.
00:19:23,00:19:23,- Yeah.
00:19:23,00:19:24,- If it's vacuum dried.
00:19:24,00:19:25,- Okay.
00:19:25,00:19:26,- If it's vacuum dried you can.
00:19:26,00:19:28,Which is why I always vacuum dry.
00:19:28,00:19:28,(laughing)
00:19:28,00:19:30,- With a more like a little bit.
00:19:30,00:19:32,(laughing)
00:19:32,00:19:36,- Just one more thing on the extreme sexism and space theme.
00:19:36,00:19:37,- Yeah.
00:19:37,00:19:38,- Great theme.
00:19:38,00:19:43,"- It's such a strong theme, it's just a real laugh a minute."
00:19:43,00:19:46,So in 1971 there's a NASA memo
00:19:46,00:19:49,which is about psychological issues with long space flights.
00:19:49,00:19:52,And so this is in '71 and this is about how men
00:19:52,00:19:53,can suffer in various ways.
00:19:53,00:19:55,And one of the ways that they'll suffer
00:19:55,00:19:58,is that they don't have a direct sexual release
00:19:58,00:20:00,"'cause they're up in space, all a bunch of men on their own."
00:20:00,00:20:02,"And this NASA memo says,"
00:20:02,00:20:03,the question of direct sexual release
00:20:03,00:20:06,on a long duration space mission must be considered.
00:20:06,00:20:09,Practical considerations preclude men taking their wives.
00:20:09,00:20:11,So it is possible that a woman qualified
00:20:11,00:20:14,from a scientific viewpoint might be persuaded
00:20:14,00:20:16,to donate her time and energies
00:20:16,00:20:18,for the sake of improving crew morale.
00:20:18,00:20:19,"- No, whoa."
00:20:19,00:20:20,- No.
00:20:20,00:20:21,- Space prostitutes.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"- I said, say yeah."
00:20:23,00:20:25,- That sounds like a movie doesn't it?
00:20:25,00:20:27,(laughing)
00:20:27,00:20:27,- Star Wars.
00:20:27,00:20:28,- So they want a star.
00:20:28,00:20:29,- Star Wars.
00:20:29,00:20:30,- No.
00:20:30,00:20:31,- No.
00:20:31,00:20:32,- They weren't suggesting that.
00:20:32,00:20:34,They were suggesting that providing a woman
00:20:34,00:20:36,"puts, they talk about sublimation,"
00:20:36,00:20:39,which is the idea that men will be sexually relieved
00:20:39,00:20:41,by just being around a woman.
00:20:41,00:20:44,It will improve them around rather than being on their own
00:20:44,00:20:46,"'cause it pointed out that masturbation isn't,"
00:20:46,00:20:49,is messy and that homosexual behavior
00:20:49,00:20:50,shouldn't be encouraged.
00:20:50,00:20:52,- Pointed out masturbation is messy.
00:20:52,00:20:55,- I would say as long as it's freeze-dried.
00:20:55,00:20:57,(laughing)
00:21:00,00:21:02,"- Do you ever go to add these house, you'll notice."
00:21:02,00:21:03,(laughing)
00:21:03,00:21:04,- It's not safe.
00:21:04,00:21:05,(laughing)
00:21:05,00:21:06,"- Oh, deary me."
00:21:06,00:21:09,(upbeat music)
00:21:09,00:21:13,"- Okay, it is time for back number three"
00:21:13,00:21:15,and that is James.
00:21:15,00:21:18,"- Okay, my fat this week is that the Indian Justice System"
00:21:18,00:21:21,has a backlog of 31 million cases.
00:21:21,00:21:22,- Ah.
00:21:22,00:21:23,- 31 million.
00:21:23,00:21:24,"- Yeah, that's nuts."
00:21:24,00:21:25,- Oh my goodness.
00:21:25,00:21:26,- So terrifying.
00:21:26,00:21:30,"- And if all of the judges,"
00:21:30,00:21:33,managed to deal with 100 cases an hour
00:21:33,00:21:35,"and didn't take any breaks,"
00:21:35,00:21:38,it would take them 35 years to get rid of the backlog
00:21:38,00:21:40,'cause there's hardly any judges.
00:21:40,00:21:42,"- But it's like, it's between 13 and 15 judges,"
00:21:42,00:21:45,per million people in India.
00:21:45,00:21:47,- And in America it's more than 100.
00:21:47,00:21:47,- Is it?
00:21:47,00:21:48,- Wow.
00:21:48,00:21:52,- And so I saw this in a review of a book
00:21:52,00:21:56,"called When Crime Pays, Money and Muscle in Indian Politics"
00:21:56,00:21:58,in the Economist magazine a few weeks ago.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"And what it was really, it's an article"
00:22:00,00:22:04,about how corrupt politicians are in India.
00:22:04,00:22:08,And they said in this article that if you are a politician
00:22:08,00:22:11,"with serious charges hanging over you,"
00:22:11,00:22:14,you have an 18% chance of winning your race
00:22:14,00:22:16,and that's compared with 6% for someone
00:22:16,00:22:17,who doesn't have any charges against them.
00:22:17,00:22:21,So you're three times more likely to get into parliament
00:22:21,00:22:23,if you have a serious crime against you
00:22:23,00:22:26,"than if you have no crime, which is insane."
00:22:26,00:22:29,- Where's the causation correlation linked then?
00:22:29,00:22:30,Do they speculate?
00:22:30,00:22:31,"- Yeah, because I can't believe people"
00:22:31,00:22:33,are voting people in just on the grounds
00:22:33,00:22:34,of their criminal history.
00:22:34,00:22:38,"- Well, the speculation is that getting the Indian states"
00:22:38,00:22:40,do things is very difficult because it's just
00:22:40,00:22:42,there's so much bureaucracy.
00:22:42,00:22:44,And sometimes you just have to bang a few heads together
00:22:44,00:22:45,to get things done.
00:22:45,00:22:48,"And so people think, well, this criminal knows"
00:22:48,00:22:51,"how to get things done, specifically crimes."
00:22:51,00:22:53,"But if he can do crimes, he can probably"
00:22:53,00:22:54,sort out the roads and the railways
00:22:54,00:22:56,and stuff like that as well.
00:22:56,00:22:58,- So is it only the people who've done crimes well
00:22:58,00:22:59,that are getting elected?
00:22:59,00:23:01,"- Well, if you do crimes that well,"
00:23:01,00:23:02,you tend not to get a prison.
00:23:02,00:23:04,"- Well, indeed, they've been caught."
00:23:04,00:23:04,So I would have thought.
00:23:04,00:23:07,"- Well, a lot of these people haven't been found guilty"
00:23:07,00:23:09,or anything because there's still 31 million--
00:23:09,00:23:11,"- Oh yeah, it's two cases."
00:23:11,00:23:13,- Two thirds of all people in prison in India
00:23:13,00:23:15,have not been convicted of anything.
00:23:15,00:23:16,They're waiting for the trial.
00:23:16,00:23:18,- So they still put them in jail though.
00:23:18,00:23:21,"- Yeah, there are 400,000 people in India in prison."
00:23:21,00:23:23,"Which is actually, I think, a bit lower"
00:23:23,00:23:24,than the British proportion.
00:23:24,00:23:26,"Because Britain's got about 80,000 people in prison."
00:23:26,00:23:27,"So they've got five times as many,"
00:23:27,00:23:28,but the population's way higher.
00:23:28,00:23:31,"- But yeah, so you might have to wait 10 years"
00:23:31,00:23:33,for your case to be brought to court.
00:23:33,00:23:35,And you might be innocent at all times.
00:23:35,00:23:36,- And some people can't afford bail
00:23:36,00:23:39,or some people don't know that bail is available to them.
00:23:39,00:23:41,So they're just sort of left-moldering in jail
00:23:41,00:23:42,for years and years and years.
00:23:42,00:23:43,- Wow.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"- And in the lower house in India, the lock sabber,"
00:23:46,00:23:51,34% of the MPs have got criminal charges filed against them.
00:23:51,00:23:53,So that's more than the third.
00:23:53,00:23:55,"And according to this article,"
00:23:55,00:23:57,you can pretty much walk from Mumbai to Kolkata
00:23:57,00:24:00,without stepping foot outside a constituency
00:24:00,00:24:02,whose MP isn't facing a charge.
00:24:02,00:24:03,- Oh my God.
00:24:03,00:24:05,"- And that's about 2,000 kilometers."
00:24:05,00:24:06,- Yeah.
00:24:06,00:24:10,- Wasn't there a thing in the American election this year
00:24:10,00:24:11,"that you told me about, Anna,"
00:24:11,00:24:13,where there was one of the people running
00:24:13,00:24:16,had a warrant out for their arrest?
00:24:16,00:24:17,"- Oh yeah, the green candidate."
00:24:17,00:24:19,- That's why they were running.
00:24:19,00:24:22,(laughing)
00:24:22,00:24:25,"- Oh, well, for me, you're not going to go as she let her life."
00:24:25,00:24:26,But for Green.
00:24:26,00:24:28,(laughing)
00:24:28,00:24:29,"- Yeah, Jill Stein, wasn't it?"
00:24:29,00:24:30,- Jill Stein.
00:24:30,00:24:32,- And it was for protesting.
00:24:32,00:24:34,"- Yeah, it was for a vandalism"
00:24:34,00:24:35,'cause she'd graffitied something
00:24:35,00:24:36,and it was a mental protest.
00:24:36,00:24:37,"- It was in a particular state, wasn't it?"
00:24:37,00:24:38,- Yeah.
00:24:38,00:24:40,- So she just didn't campaign very much there.
00:24:40,00:24:41,- Yeah.
00:24:41,00:24:41,- Of course.
00:24:41,00:24:43,- Or really anywhere else.
00:24:43,00:24:45,- Wow.
00:24:45,00:24:47,- So obviously there are people who have to wait a very long time
00:24:47,00:24:48,to get their cases heard.
00:24:48,00:24:53,"One example is a guy, an 85 year old man who in 2014"
00:24:53,00:24:57,was granted a divorce that he'd filed for 32 years.
00:24:57,00:24:58,(laughing)
00:24:58,00:24:59,- Wow.
00:24:59,00:25:00,"You're probably made up by then, haven't you?"
00:25:00,00:25:01,- Yeah.
00:25:01,00:25:02,- Yeah.
00:25:02,00:25:03,"- Well, you'd hope so."
00:25:03,00:25:05,"Otherwise, that's a lot of resentment"
00:25:05,00:25:07,"that's festering for third volume, isn't it?"
00:25:07,00:25:08,"- Yeah, true."
00:25:08,00:25:09,- Yeah.
00:25:09,00:25:12,"In 2018, in the government whips, sprung six MPs"
00:25:12,00:25:14,out of prison so that they could vote.
00:25:14,00:25:15,(laughing)
00:25:15,00:25:16,Yeah.
00:25:16,00:25:18,"- Oh, if anyone else was with that cool,"
00:25:18,00:25:19,the most rebellious thing they do
00:25:19,00:25:21,is not a Bay Jeremy Corbyn.
00:25:21,00:25:23,Imagine if they were springing people out of jail.
00:25:23,00:25:25,- So it was gonna be a really tight vote
00:25:25,00:25:27,"and they decided, oh, we're gonna need these six people"
00:25:27,00:25:29,so they got them out of prison.
00:25:29,00:25:30,(laughing)
00:25:30,00:25:31,- That's amazing.
00:25:31,00:25:33,Like on a day trip or just altogether out of prison?
00:25:33,00:25:35,- I think they put them back in.
00:25:35,00:25:35,"- Oh, yeah."
00:25:35,00:25:38,But that's like during John Major's government in the UK
00:25:38,00:25:41,"'cause he had this wafer thin majority, didn't he?"
00:25:41,00:25:42,"And they kept on having to bring in, you know,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,they were MPs who were really seriously ill
00:25:44,00:25:46,"to get legislation through,"
00:25:46,00:25:47,"they were practically bringing in stretchers, you know?"
00:25:47,00:25:50,"- Oh, sort of pushing them through, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:50,00:25:52,- Do we know how they sprung them out of prison?
00:25:52,00:25:56,Was it a great escape style tunnel digging sort of endeavor?
00:25:56,00:25:57,"- The tunnel digging, you'd need to know"
00:25:57,00:25:59,that the vote's coming up a long time advance.
00:25:59,00:26:02,(laughing)
00:26:02,00:26:04,- Order 12 bulldozers on tax payers expense.
00:26:04,00:26:06,(laughing)
00:26:06,00:26:07,- There's one court case in India
00:26:07,00:26:10,that's been going on since 1878.
00:26:10,00:26:11,(laughing)
00:26:11,00:26:14,I think this was the oldest I could find.
00:26:14,00:26:15,"- That's a long divorce, isn't it?"
00:26:15,00:26:17,(laughing)
00:26:17,00:26:19,- Great grandchildren are getting divorced.
00:26:19,00:26:23,It's a replot of land that's less than two acres
00:26:23,00:26:25,and it's a fight between a sheer Muslim family
00:26:25,00:26:27,and a Sunni Muslim family.
00:26:27,00:26:30,And one side argues that their graves are on it
00:26:30,00:26:31,and so they need to keep it at the other side argues
00:26:31,00:26:35,"that belongs to them, it's beginning on since 1878."
00:26:35,00:26:37,- The election commission of India says
00:26:37,00:26:40,that no person should have to travel more than two kilometers
00:26:40,00:26:42,to cast a vote.
00:26:42,00:26:46,"So in the state of Goodgerat, there's a temple caretaker"
00:26:46,00:26:49,who lives in a temple in the middle of a forest
00:26:49,00:26:54,who is the only person who votes in his special voting booth.
00:26:54,00:26:57,"Okay, so the police come in whenever there's an election,"
00:26:57,00:26:59,they have to go through this massive forest
00:26:59,00:27:01,with snakes and lions and stuff like that
00:27:01,00:27:04,and then they put the voting booth in the middle of the forest
00:27:04,00:27:07,and they sit there and they wait for him to come.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"And he says in the morning, he has his breakfast"
00:27:09,00:27:10,and he has a cup of tea and he works out
00:27:10,00:27:12,who he's gonna vote for.
00:27:12,00:27:14,And then about 11 o'clock he wanders down
00:27:14,00:27:16,and puts his vote in and they can go home.
00:27:16,00:27:18,- That is amazing.
00:27:18,00:27:18,- Is that cool?
00:27:18,00:27:19,"- Yeah, that's really cool."
00:27:19,00:27:21,- That's hilarious that they haven't specified a time.
00:27:21,00:27:22,They've just got a seat.
00:27:22,00:27:24,(laughing)
00:27:24,00:27:25,- Turn out very low this year.
00:27:25,00:27:27,(laughing)
00:27:27,00:27:29,"- Just one thing we've never talked about actually,"
00:27:29,00:27:32,that's another weird thing about the Indian justice system
00:27:32,00:27:34,is the case of Laan Bihari
00:27:34,00:27:38,who set up the Otar Pradesh group of dead people.
00:27:38,00:27:38,- Oh yeah.
00:27:38,00:27:40,"- I've never mentioned this,"
00:27:40,00:27:42,but this is totally bizarre.
00:27:42,00:27:44,He's this guy who in 1975 wanted to apply for a bank loan
00:27:44,00:27:46,and so he went to try and get proof of identity
00:27:46,00:27:50,from the revenue office and he found out that he was dead
00:27:50,00:27:52,because his uncle had declared him dead
00:27:52,00:27:54,so we could claim the land that he had inherited.
00:27:54,00:27:55,And it turned out this is a massive problem
00:27:55,00:27:57,"and he set up his organization,"
00:27:57,00:28:00,which is to represent people who have been declared dead
00:28:00,00:28:01,and indeed even though they're alive.
00:28:01,00:28:04,"And he eventually in 2004,"
00:28:04,00:28:07,he eventually in '99.
00:28:07,00:28:09,(laughing)
00:28:09,00:28:11,"- I told you he was dead, I told you and I'm right."
00:28:11,00:28:13,(laughing)
00:28:13,00:28:16,"- In 1994, sorry, he finally managed to get himself"
00:28:16,00:28:18,"declared alive, but his organization,"
00:28:18,00:28:21,"which is the Otar Pradesh Dead People Association,"
00:28:21,00:28:24,"has over 20,000 members and by 2004,"
00:28:24,00:28:27,they only managed to declare four of them alive.
00:28:27,00:28:28,- Wow.
00:28:28,00:28:31,I remember reading about him where all the times
00:28:31,00:28:34,he tried to prove that he was alive.
00:28:34,00:28:36,"So he started doing things like illegal stuff,"
00:28:36,00:28:37,like robbing a bank.
00:28:37,00:28:40,"They'd be like, ""We can't arrest you, you're not alive,"
00:28:40,00:28:41,"we can't arrest a dead man."""
00:28:41,00:28:43,- So do you think he was robbing the bank
00:28:43,00:28:45,"and they're like, ""Oh, it's a ghost."""
00:28:45,00:28:46,(laughing)
00:28:46,00:28:47,- He would just move mugs around.
00:28:47,00:28:50,(laughing)
00:28:50,00:28:54,- Just walk into sayances.
00:28:54,00:28:56,(laughing)
00:28:56,00:28:59,"- There was a sorry, on sayances,"
00:28:59,00:29:00,there was a legal case in the UK
00:29:00,00:29:03,that had to be redone because it turned out the jury.
00:29:03,00:29:04,"This is in 1994, it turned out the jury"
00:29:04,00:29:06,had made their decision based on a say-on.
00:29:06,00:29:08,- What?
00:29:08,00:29:09,"- Yeah, it was a double murder case"
00:29:09,00:29:11,and they had to spend the night in a hotel
00:29:11,00:29:13,because the case was going on a while
00:29:13,00:29:14,and they all got really drunk
00:29:14,00:29:16,and then one of them entered their wine glass turned over
00:29:16,00:29:18,"and went, ""All right, let's ask a ghost"
00:29:18,00:29:19,"whether he's guilty or not."""
00:29:19,00:29:22,And they did and then they had to redo the case
00:29:22,00:29:24,because that isn't allowed.
00:29:24,00:29:25,- Why would the ghost know?
00:29:25,00:29:26,Like what was the...
00:29:26,00:29:27,(laughing)
00:29:27,00:29:29,"- I'm not sure the ghost did, though."
00:29:29,00:29:30,(laughing)
00:29:30,00:29:31,- Who was the ghost?
00:29:31,00:29:32,- They're right up there.
00:29:32,00:29:33,- Just the ghost of the murdered.
00:29:33,00:29:34,- Man.
00:29:34,00:29:35,- Oh.
00:29:35,00:29:36,- Who killed you?
00:29:36,00:29:37,Did he do it?
00:29:37,00:29:39,"- Oh, so it's specifically, it wasn't just a ghost."
00:29:39,00:29:41,"- Well, it might because ghosts can talk to each other, right?"
00:29:41,00:29:43,"So the ghost, whoever it was,"
00:29:43,00:29:44,could have gotten asked the murder person they thought.
00:29:44,00:29:45,- So the ghost went to each other?
00:29:45,00:29:46,- I'll get back to you.
00:29:46,00:29:48,I'm seeing him next week for a ghost lunch.
00:29:48,00:29:48,I will...
00:29:48,00:29:49,(laughing)
00:29:49,00:29:51,- I don't know who did that one.
00:29:51,00:29:54,(laughing)
00:29:54,00:29:55,- Mrs. Doubtful is that.
00:29:55,00:29:58,"- Oh, I'll ask her."
00:29:58,00:30:00,(laughing)
00:30:00,00:30:03,(upbeat music)
00:30:03,00:30:06,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:30:06,00:30:07,and that is Andy.
00:30:07,00:30:10,- My fact is that scientists are building a special bunker
00:30:10,00:30:15,in Antarctica to store bits of glassier from the Alps.
00:30:15,00:30:17,- It's so exciting.
00:30:17,00:30:18,"- Yeah, it's amazing."
00:30:18,00:30:20,- It's because glassiers are melting all over the world.
00:30:20,00:30:23,And I didn't notice that this is a job.
00:30:23,00:30:25,There's a job of being a paleoclimatologist.
00:30:25,00:30:27,So like a paleoclimatologist does dinosaurs.
00:30:27,00:30:31,"A paleoclimatologist does ancient weather, basically."
00:30:31,00:30:32,"And all these glassiers,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,"they're really old ice,"
00:30:34,00:30:37,"and it contains lots of data about what was in the atmosphere,"
00:30:37,00:30:38,"how much of which kind of gas,"
00:30:38,00:30:40,"what the weather would have been like, what the climate was."
00:30:40,00:30:43,"So if they melt, you suddenly are losing"
00:30:43,00:30:45,tens of thousands of years of data.
00:30:45,00:30:47,So what kind of weather did they learn?
00:30:47,00:30:48,"It's like, oh, it was snowing."
00:30:48,00:30:50,"- Yeah, it was snowing before that."
00:30:50,00:30:52,It's snowing before that.
00:30:52,00:30:55,"- Cold, cold, cold, still cold."
00:30:55,00:30:56,(laughing)
00:30:56,00:30:59,- They learn about the gases in the atmosphere.
00:30:59,00:31:03,But they have collecting cross sections of ice.
00:31:03,00:31:05,They have these circular drills.
00:31:05,00:31:06,"They're like cookie cutters,"
00:31:06,00:31:08,"and they just bore right down into the ice,"
00:31:08,00:31:09,"and then they'd bring it up,"
00:31:09,00:31:12,"slice it into one meter sections, label them,"
00:31:12,00:31:14,"and they're currently building this massive bunker,"
00:31:14,00:31:15,which is going to be in Antarctica.
00:31:15,00:31:16,"- Is this, is their research group,"
00:31:16,00:31:19,are they the ones called protecting ice memory project?
00:31:19,00:31:20,- Yes.
00:31:20,00:31:22,"- Okay, so this is this big international pen."
00:31:22,00:31:23,- Wait a minute.
00:31:23,00:31:24,"- Oh, yeah."
00:31:24,00:31:26,(laughing)
00:31:26,00:31:27,- Did they call themselves Pemps?
00:31:27,00:31:30,"- I think it's Pem project, I think it's just a..."
00:31:30,00:31:32,- I can see why they didn't bother with the project.
00:31:32,00:31:34,(laughing)
00:31:34,00:31:35,- They make a big deal of that space.
00:31:35,00:31:37,With a PIM project.
00:31:37,00:31:38,(laughing)
00:31:38,00:31:41,PIM pause project.
00:31:41,00:31:43,(laughing)
00:31:43,00:31:45,"- Yeah, it's unbelievably cool though."
00:31:45,00:31:47,"Actually, so these ice cores that they pull out,"
00:31:47,00:31:50,just the idea that all of this stuff that's happened
00:31:50,00:31:51,for hundreds of thousands of years
00:31:51,00:31:54,"is literally frozen in time, and we can look at it."
00:31:54,00:31:54,- Yeah.
00:31:54,00:31:57,"- So find volcanic ash, or find when carbon dioxide"
00:31:57,00:31:59,"was in the atmosphere, and how much of it."
00:31:59,00:32:00,"And that's how they get a lot of climate data,"
00:32:00,00:32:01,which I hadn't realized.
00:32:01,00:32:04,"So when we say, you know, when you have those graphs,"
00:32:04,00:32:05,"which show how much CO2 was in the atmosphere,"
00:32:05,00:32:07,"X number of years ago, very often,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,that's because they've studied an ice core
00:32:09,00:32:11,and they found a little bubble of it somewhere beneath.
00:32:11,00:32:13,It's been reserved for hundreds of thousands of years.
00:32:13,00:32:14,It's always bubbles.
00:32:14,00:32:16,"- It's always the bubbles, isn't it?"
00:32:16,00:32:17,And they just keep the bubbles.
00:32:17,00:32:20,"That's true, 'cause it'd be easier to store, wouldn't it?"
00:32:20,00:32:21,And the reason it's an endoccticate
00:32:21,00:32:23,"is that even if the power fails,"
00:32:23,00:32:25,it's still minus 50 degrees outside.
00:32:25,00:32:28,"Whereas if you have it somewhere warmer, right?"
00:32:28,00:32:29,"And the power fails, obviously,"
00:32:29,00:32:31,all your precious data melts.
00:32:31,00:32:33,- Do you guys know about Project Ice Worm?
00:32:33,00:32:37,- Project Ice Worm.
00:32:37,00:32:38,I know what Ice Worms are.
00:32:38,00:32:40,- What are Ice Worms?
00:32:40,00:32:42,- They're worms that live in ice.
00:32:42,00:32:44,"- All right, yeah, that's amazing, James."
00:32:44,00:32:45,"- Wait, is that true?"
00:32:45,00:32:46,- That can't be true.
00:32:46,00:32:47,"- They have worms that live on glaciers,"
00:32:47,00:32:49,"but Anna can tell us about her thing,"
00:32:49,00:32:50,and then I'll tell you about Ice Worms.
00:32:50,00:32:51,"- Yeah, okay, cool."
00:32:51,00:32:52,- Let's compare Ice Worms.
00:32:52,00:32:54,So this is an endoccticate.
00:32:54,00:32:55,This is in Greenland.
00:32:55,00:32:58,But Project Ice Worm was this American plan in the Cold War
00:32:58,00:33:01,to build this massive underground network of tunnels
00:33:01,00:33:03,below the ice in Greenland.
00:33:03,00:33:06,"And then that would be, they would be missile launch sites."
00:33:06,00:33:08,"So that way, if they went via Greenland,"
00:33:08,00:33:10,then they could get easy access to the Soviet Union.
00:33:10,00:33:12,And we actually did this.
00:33:12,00:33:15,"So if you go to Greenland, way, way under the ice,"
00:33:15,00:33:16,there's this network of tunnels
00:33:16,00:33:19,that they started building that's full of stuff like sewage
00:33:19,00:33:22,"and loads of diesel fuel apparently,"
00:33:22,00:33:25,some pollutants and radiological waste.
00:33:25,00:33:29,And I think 21 tunnels were dug under the ground in Greenland.
00:33:29,00:33:31,And then they decided it wasn't actually going to work
00:33:31,00:33:33,because it wasn't viable for people to live under
00:33:33,00:33:34,the ice for long periods of time.
00:33:34,00:33:37,"They had hospitals, they had a cinema,"
00:33:37,00:33:38,they had shops.
00:33:38,00:33:39,"- Shops, yeah, yeah."
00:33:39,00:33:41,"- What's all this sewage, therefore?"
00:33:41,00:33:42,"- Yeah, I don't know why all the sewage is there."
00:33:42,00:33:45,Maybe it made you have a funny tummy
00:33:45,00:33:46,if you're living on a freezer.
00:33:46,00:33:48,"- Makes it easy to freeze, try."
00:33:48,00:33:50,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:33:50,00:33:53,But it's a problem because the ice sheet might melt
00:33:53,00:33:54,on Greenland.
00:33:54,00:33:55,"And then you've got all the radioactive sludge,"
00:33:55,00:33:56,which is going to.
00:33:56,00:33:58,"- No, but bad news, the ice sheet melts,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,the seas kind of rise and stuff like that.
00:34:01,00:34:03,"Good news, we find a new cinema."
00:34:03,00:34:04,- Yeah.
00:34:04,00:34:05,"- Oh, yeah."
00:34:05,00:34:08,"- Imagine that day when the ice melt said there's a,"
00:34:08,00:34:10,"like an, you know, an Odin."
00:34:10,00:34:13,"- Yeah, covered in radioactive waste."
00:34:13,00:34:14,And sewage.
00:34:14,00:34:16,"- I can imagine it being a hipster destination cinema,"
00:34:16,00:34:17,actually.
00:34:17,00:34:19,People look like it's going to be great.
00:34:19,00:34:21,- You have to dig through 12 meters of ice together.
00:34:21,00:34:23,(laughing)
00:34:23,00:34:24,"- Okay, okay, I can't wait anymore."
00:34:24,00:34:25,- What's an ice worm?
00:34:25,00:34:27,"- Oh, yeah, sorry."
00:34:27,00:34:28,(laughing)
00:34:28,00:34:30,- That's why you've been quiet all this time.
00:34:30,00:34:32,"- It took so long, oh my God."
00:34:32,00:34:34,"- Well, an ice worm, like I say,"
00:34:34,00:34:35,it is just a worm that lives on ice.
00:34:35,00:34:39,They live in glaciers and they eat little bits of pollen
00:34:39,00:34:41,that have been trapped in the glacier.
00:34:41,00:34:42,They're little black things.
00:34:42,00:34:44,So you can see them really easily.
00:34:44,00:34:45,- And do they burrow through the ice
00:34:45,00:34:46,and live when they're under ice?
00:34:46,00:34:47,"- Well, sometimes they do."
00:34:47,00:34:49,"So if it's warm on the outside,"
00:34:49,00:34:52,"if it's above, like, say, two degrees,"
00:34:52,00:34:53,they'll go into the ice.
00:34:53,00:34:57,"Because if they get above five degrees, they melt."
00:34:57,00:35:01,"And they literally melt, they turn to liquid, these worms."
00:35:01,00:35:03,"It's like an enzyme in their body,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,which starts to liquefy the whole body.
00:35:05,00:35:08,"So if they go above, like, say, two or three degrees,"
00:35:08,00:35:09,they will melt.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"And you see them on glaciers, the little black things."
00:35:11,00:35:12,- Wow.
00:35:12,00:35:15,"- That's so terrifying thing, then."
00:35:15,00:35:17,"For some reason, I feel it's like speed,"
00:35:17,00:35:18,where you can't go over a certain amount.
00:35:18,00:35:20,- And they're obsessively watching
00:35:20,00:35:21,that the moment you're at the time.
00:35:21,00:35:23,- Yeah.
00:35:23,00:35:27,- Sometimes glaciers enter this super fast state.
00:35:27,00:35:29,And they go-- - How fast?
00:35:29,00:35:30,- Not very fast.
00:35:30,00:35:32,- So not super fast.
00:35:32,00:35:36,"It's, well, they're called them glaciers surges."
00:35:36,00:35:38,And they move at 100 times their normal speed.
00:35:38,00:35:40,- When I read that the fastest that they've ever gone
00:35:40,00:35:43,is 11 miles per year.
00:35:43,00:35:44,- That's pretty fast.
00:35:44,00:35:46,Is it that? - Is it?
00:35:46,00:35:49,"- Well, it's about 45 meters per day."
00:35:49,00:35:50,"- Sure, it's like southern rail."
00:35:50,00:35:52,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:35:52,00:35:54,But they are moving four times faster than they were
00:35:54,00:35:57,"in the '90s, in the summer's speed of glaciers."
00:35:57,00:35:59,"- Which is, that's big."
00:35:59,00:36:00,Where they're going?
00:36:00,00:36:01,"- Well, they're melting."
00:36:01,00:36:03,"- Down hill, down hill, and towards the--"
00:36:03,00:36:05,"- Oh, okay, right, okay."
00:36:05,00:36:06,"- So that's what a glacier is, basically."
00:36:06,00:36:09,"It's loads and loads of snow that's fallen over,"
00:36:09,00:36:10,loads and loads of years.
00:36:10,00:36:12,And it's just slowly with gravity moving down
00:36:12,00:36:14,"as well to see like a river, but it's made of ice."
00:36:14,00:36:16,- So it's on land?
00:36:16,00:36:17,- Yes.
00:36:17,00:36:18,- Okay. - Yeah.
00:36:18,00:36:19,- Otherwise it'd be an iceberg.
00:36:19,00:36:21,"- Yes, okay, so that's the difference."
00:36:21,00:36:22,That's what I didn't understand.
00:36:22,00:36:24,"- Yeah, and actually, a fox's glacier mint"
00:36:24,00:36:26,chose a polar bear standing on an iceberg.
00:36:26,00:36:27,- You're right.
00:36:27,00:36:29,- So as a completely inaccurate mint.
00:36:29,00:36:30,- It should be an iceberg mint.
00:36:30,00:36:31,- Yes.
00:36:31,00:36:34,- Or they need to change their design.
00:36:34,00:36:35,- Either way.
00:36:35,00:36:37,"- Until they do one of those two things,"
00:36:37,00:36:38,I'm gonna buy one of those mints.
00:36:38,00:36:40,"- I mean, to be honest, if we've been really pedantic,"
00:36:40,00:36:42,they should show a fox standing on a glacier.
00:36:42,00:36:44,- So they've got it going in a couple of ways.
00:36:44,00:36:45,- It's in a polar bear on iceberg.
00:36:45,00:36:46,What are you guys doing?
00:36:46,00:36:48,(laughing)
00:36:48,00:36:49,- I'm in a bear iceberg mint.
00:36:49,00:36:50,(laughing)
00:36:50,00:36:52,It should be.
00:36:52,00:36:53,- There are towns in the Alps
00:36:53,00:36:56,"who are still burying soldiers from the First World War,"
00:36:56,00:36:58,thanks to Glacier melt.
00:36:58,00:36:59,- What do you mean by that?
00:36:59,00:37:00,"- Well, loads of soldiers were posted"
00:37:00,00:37:01,"in the Alps during the First World War,"
00:37:01,00:37:03,"and it was incredibly, obviously,"
00:37:03,00:37:05,"very cold, extremely harsh conditions to live in,"
00:37:05,00:37:07,and they were fighting very fiercely
00:37:07,00:37:10,"over almost no territory, basically."
00:37:10,00:37:13,"But lots of soldiers froze to death,"
00:37:13,00:37:14,"got caught in the Glaciers,"
00:37:14,00:37:17,"they didn't get caught by the Glaciers,"
00:37:17,00:37:18,but they...
00:37:18,00:37:20,"- Incredibly slow, like that Austin Powers scene,"
00:37:20,00:37:22,edging away from the slow moving Glacier.
00:37:22,00:37:24,"- Well, no, we've established that they're super fast,"
00:37:24,00:37:26,so maybe they weren't ready for the speed of a...
00:37:26,00:37:27,- Okay.
00:37:27,00:37:29,"- Of a Glacier, about 11 miles per year."
00:37:29,00:37:30,- 11 miles per year.
00:37:30,00:37:31,(laughing)
00:37:31,00:37:33,- How did these guys get into the army?
00:37:33,00:37:36,"- Anyway, they were caught."
00:37:36,00:37:38,- They're now being discovered
00:37:38,00:37:40,as the Glaciers retreat as they melt.
00:37:40,00:37:42,"Bodies are being discovered, and they're being buried."
00:37:42,00:37:43,So there was a funeral for two of them
00:37:43,00:37:47,"in 2013, and 500 people turned up to pay their respect."
00:37:47,00:37:50,- Were their bodies preserved properly?
00:37:50,00:37:53,"Like, 'cause I remember when they found"
00:37:53,00:37:56,"Mallory on Everest, you know,"
00:37:56,00:37:58,a lot of his skin was there.
00:37:58,00:37:59,"His body was there, 'cause they..."
00:37:59,00:38:01,"- Yeah. - You're properly preserved, aren't you?"
00:38:01,00:38:02,"- I don't know how well preserved they were,"
00:38:02,00:38:05,but there is a particular town called Peo
00:38:05,00:38:06,"where they do a lot of these barrels,"
00:38:06,00:38:09,"'cause they're near a lot of the battlefield sites,"
00:38:09,00:38:11,and that's where the bodies are being discovered.
00:38:11,00:38:12,- Wow. - Amazing.
00:38:12,00:38:13,- It is kind of a...
00:38:13,00:38:15,"If you're looking on the bright side of Clover Warming,"
00:38:15,00:38:18,"it is good for glacial archaeology, isn't it?"
00:38:18,00:38:19,Because these...
00:38:19,00:38:21,"Like you say, it's suddenly revealing all this amazing stuff."
00:38:21,00:38:24,So melting glaciers have suddenly revealed
00:38:24,00:38:27,"like lots of Roman coins, some Iron Age horses."
00:38:27,00:38:29,There's a glass you call the Meadow Hall Glacier.
00:38:29,00:38:31,"- I'm not sure, I don't know."
00:38:31,00:38:33,"Like, a couple of coins in a horse"
00:38:33,00:38:35,makes up for losing the entire Netherlands.
00:38:35,00:38:37,"- No, no, no, no, no."
00:38:37,00:38:38,- What if you want your children to go
00:38:38,00:38:41,into the same line of work as you when there's no more ice?
00:38:41,00:38:42,It's only good in the very short term.
00:38:42,00:38:44,"- Well, I think we've established that this view"
00:38:44,00:38:46,"is a very short term view, isn't it?"
00:38:46,00:38:47,That's already about the long term.
00:38:47,00:38:48,I would be concerned about climate change.
00:38:48,00:38:50,(laughing)
00:38:50,00:38:52,"As it is, I'm very excited about these Roman coins."
00:38:52,00:38:54,(laughing)
00:38:54,00:38:56,"And a forest, so there's a thousand-year-old..."
00:38:56,00:38:58,(laughing)
00:38:58,00:38:59,"We could always do it more forest,"
00:38:59,00:39:01,and there's a thousand-year-old forest
00:39:01,00:39:03,that's been revealed by a melting glacier in Alaska.
00:39:03,00:39:05,- I bet it's a rubbish forest after all the time
00:39:05,00:39:07,"on a glacier, it can't be good."
00:39:07,00:39:09,"- It's a bit stumpy, but there is indeed."
00:39:09,00:39:11,"- A bit depressing, it's a dead squirrels everywhere."
00:39:11,00:39:13,(laughing)
00:39:13,00:39:15,"- Yeah, that's strange, isn't it?"
00:39:15,00:39:17,'Cause you do want more trees as well.
00:39:17,00:39:20,"You want more forests, but you also want more ice,"
00:39:20,00:39:21,so which do you choose?
00:39:21,00:39:23,"- Oh, it's so easy to choose, isn't it?"
00:39:23,00:39:24,- Yeah.
00:39:24,00:39:26,"- But the ice, I think we'll keep the ice."
00:39:26,00:39:26,"- Okay, yeah."
00:39:26,00:39:28,"- Great, 'cause you can go forests elsewhere"
00:39:28,00:39:30,"where there's no ice, but you can't put ice."
00:39:30,00:39:31,- You can make ice.
00:39:31,00:39:34,- You can't keep it in the Amazon.
00:39:34,00:39:35,(laughing)
00:39:35,00:39:36,"If you have a refrigerator, you can."
00:39:36,00:39:39,- You can't turn the hours into a fridge.
00:39:39,00:39:41,"- Dad, but you can put a lot of refrigerators"
00:39:41,00:39:42,into the Amazon.
00:39:42,00:39:44,"- It's not a refrigerator, it's a freezer."
00:39:44,00:39:45,- Why?
00:39:45,00:39:46,(laughing)
00:39:46,00:39:48,- A refrigerator's just gonna slow down the melting.
00:39:48,00:39:49,(laughing)
00:39:49,00:39:51,That's why my ice tray's always full of water.
00:39:51,00:39:52,(laughing)
00:39:52,00:39:54,I'm living.
00:39:54,00:39:56,That's why my pasties are never any good.
00:39:56,00:39:58,"- Do you want some ice, or do you think?"
00:39:58,00:40:00,"- Dribble, dribble, dribble."
00:40:00,00:40:03,(laughing)
00:40:03,00:40:05,"- Have a bite, we'll have an ice cream instead."
00:40:05,00:40:06,- Oh no.
00:40:06,00:40:08,(laughing)
00:40:08,00:40:11,(upbeat music)
00:40:11,00:40:14,"- Okay, that's it."
00:40:14,00:40:15,That is all of our facts.
