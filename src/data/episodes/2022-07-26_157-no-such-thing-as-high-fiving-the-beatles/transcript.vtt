00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.500
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.460
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish, A Weekly Podcast"

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.620
 coming to you from the QI offices and covered guarded.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.020
 My name is Dad Shriver, and I'm sitting here

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.260
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter-Marie,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.300
 and Adich Zinski.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.460
 And Adich Zinski, and once again,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.060
 we have Gather Grown on my face.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.220
 And once again, we have Gather Grown on the microphones

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.980
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.740
 and in no particular order.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.060
 Here we go.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.300
 - What even does that have to do with the sound of the microphone?

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.180
 - Very confusing.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.380
 - Starting with my fact, my fact this week

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.340
 is that the man who popularized the high five

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860
 only has four fingers.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 (laughing)

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.420
 And this was a basketball player

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.540
 called Wiley Brown.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.820
 Back in 1978/79 season of basketball,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.420
 he and his mate started high fiveing.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.300
 And they talk about it really, really interestingly.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.740
 Like I read an interview where he said,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.140
 "No one was doing it, they all did it low.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.100
 "There's all these low fives going on.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.940
 "No one did it high."

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.580
 And then he said, "Then the first time we did it,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.100
 "both of us looked at each other and said,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.440
 "Did that just happen?"

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.700
 (laughing)

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.700
 - He really did to it.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.780
 There's a magical moment.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.900
 - Can I just ask, when you say four fingers,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.140
 you mean on one of his hands?

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.460
 - Exactly, nine fingers.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.300
 - Yes, exactly.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.500
 So he had nine fingers in total.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.380
 He was missing a thumb.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.500
 He lost his thumb when he was four years old

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.580
 and prosthetic thumb was made,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.540
 which meant that he could still become

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.780
 an amazing sports star

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.060
 'cause he played basketball and football.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.700
 He was a bit sort of carefree about his thumb at times.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.060
 He actually went to the finals of a basketball match,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.380
 having left his thumb back at the hotel

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.780
 that he stayed at and they had to rescue it.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.740
 - That would be awful if you had to hitchhike hold.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.460
 (laughing)

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.140
 - Well, you could only do it on one side of the road.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.860
 (laughing)

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.340
 - He actually hated his thumb, his prosthetic thumb.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.460
 Yeah, he tried not to wear it.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.820
 So he played basketball without the thumb for ages

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.860
 and then one of his coaches said,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.020
 "You're really good without that.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.340
 "But you'd be even better with it."

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.700
 And they made him wear one

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.780
 and it kept on flying off matches

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.220
 and he said it made him look like a freak

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.100
 'cause you know, it was someone would bash into his thumb

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.860
 and it would fly into the crowd.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.500
 And so he tried not to wear it

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.060
 and the coach was adamant.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.220
 And so much so that he said if he wasn't wearing his thumb,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.380
 he wouldn't let the other teammates pass

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.860
 to his right hand, which really damaged the game.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.860
 So they could only pass to his left hand.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.700
 - Oh, so.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.300
 - Yeah, he wasn't a fan.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.100
 - I should say that I got this fact.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.180
 It was sent into us by a guy called Michael Buccino.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.900
 He's a listener and again, it's quickly up to say this.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.140
 If you wanna see the finest interview ever, ever recorded,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.740
 go to YouTube and put in Wiley Brown,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.140
 talking about the high five.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.460
 It is nine minutes of interview where they ask a question,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.940
 which is, "So you invented the high five, how was it?"

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.140
 He says, "Yeah, it's great."

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.180
 And then they've got nine minutes more of interview.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.540
 - It's too long.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.540
 - It's not too long.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.380
 - It is.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.220
 - I watched it.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.220
 - No, 'cause they run out of questions

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.900
 but he does not run out of answers.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.740
 He is so enthusiastic.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.700
 And he has a new tale for each time the high five started.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.300
 So he did it with Derek Smith, who Wiley Brown says,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.460
 "Is the actual creator of the high five?"

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.380
 Because in all the stories Smith is the one who instigates it.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.500
 So for example, another story is that he said he was going up

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.780
 during practice to Derek Smith to give him a low five,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.540
 classic low five, as they always did.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.700
 And then he said, "Out of nowhere,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.860
 "Smith looked brown in the eye and said, 'No, up high.'"

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.900
 I mean, that's what I can also do.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.340
 - There was another theory about who invented the high five.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.060
 - Yeah, it's very controversial, isn't it?

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.060
 - Yeah, so there's a baseball player called Dusty Baker,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.620
 and another called Glenn Burke, and it's claimed that when Baker

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.780
 was getting back towards the dugout,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.580
 Burke offered a raised hand and Baker,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.180
 not knowing what to do, smacked it.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.580
 Again, very much the same sort of amazing foundation moment.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.100
 And then Burke went out and he got a home run

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.740
 and then on the way back he gave him another high five.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.820
 And that was in 1977 that that supposedly happened.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.820
 - So that's earlier?

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.140
 - It's earlier, so that predates.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.140
 - Yes.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.460
 - Maybe an origin.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.740
 - Do you know Glenn Burke, who you were talking about?

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.580
 - Yeah.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.340
 - He's famous because he was pretty much the first

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.820
 major league baseball player to come out as gay.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.620
 And there was a documentary in 2010 called Out,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.540
 The Glenn Burke Story, and they said that the Dodgers'

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.100
 executives offered him $75,000 to get married,

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.180
 because it would cause such a problem if people found out

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.540
 he was gay while he was still playing.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.700
 - No way.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.900
 - And apparently when they said,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.540
 "Would you take $75,000 to get married?"

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.860
 He said, "I guess you mean to a woman?"

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.620
 It's just quite a good reply.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.780
 - That's a great title for a movie, Out.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.420
 I guess you mean to a woman?

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.900
 - Oh, right, no, no.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.740
 Out.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.660
 - Oh, the actual movie itself.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.580
 - Do you think there was any confusion at the start

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.220
 when people would say, "Hey, how's Glenn?"

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.460
 And then you go, "Oh, he's out."

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.580
 And they go, "No, he's not, he's still out."

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.540
 Just years of playing.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.460
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.300
 And then Dusty Baker, just one fact about him,

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.260
 he was famous for liking to chew toothpicks.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.860
 He said toothpicks are an excellent source of protein,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.020
 which he was wrong about.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.860
 - No.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.580
 - So on high fives, there is a basketball team

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.180
 called the Phoenix Sons.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.020
 - Yes.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.860
 - Has he heard of them?

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.700
 - Yeah.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.900
 - Is that like saying, there is a football team

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.220
 called Manchester United.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.460
 - Yes, it is.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.300
 - You're on it.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.900
 - Anyway, these Phoenix Sons in 2016,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.140
 they announced that they were keeping track

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.780
 of all the high fives that their team passed to each other,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.420
 hoping that they would create more camaraderie,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.380
 like throughout the season they did this.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.060
 And supposedly teams which embrace the most

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.180
 in terms of the high fives or other celebrations

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.180
 are more successful.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.820
 - Yeah, I think it's surely more likely

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.420
 that if you're more successful,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.500
 you score more points than you high fives each other more.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.340
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.740
 There is a cause and effect thing there.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.940
 But I've read articles saying that sports players

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.260
 who touch each other more are supposedly better

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.260
 at the spots.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.500
 And I'm pretty sure that England cricket team

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.900
 always touch each other on the bum,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.300
 whenever they do something good.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.140
 - Yes.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.460
 - And I think that kind of comes from that idea.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.460
 - Sports, psychologists.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.060
 - Most sports do, yeah, there's bum slaps all the time.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.180
 - If we want to improve our performance on the podcast,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.740
 should we start slapping each other's bum?

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.340
 - No, I don't think we should.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.340
 I think we could just...

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.180
 (laughing)

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.060
 - That was a high five by the way, not a bum slap.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.300
 - There is a machine that an artist has invented

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.780
 where you can, it does self high fives.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.620
 Have you seen it?

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.460
 - No.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.020
 - It's unbelievably disgusting looking.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.660
 - It's the sound that the saddest loneliest machine in the world.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.500
 - She's a Turkish-born artist.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.340
 I think she lives in America.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.180
 Good.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.780
 Denise O'Zueger.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.460
 Sorry, how does she pronounce her surname?

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.420
 I don't know, but I don't think it's like that.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.580
 (laughing)

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.180
 I'm so sorry if I can just pronounce it,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.700
 which I definitely have.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.940
 So she cast her own arm, right?

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.620
 She made two cast of her arms,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.700
 and then one of them is just sticking out of this machine.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.580
 And the other one is like rotating very slowly,

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.020
 like a cabab thing.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.020
 (laughing)

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.300
 And every minute, they come into contact

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.100
 'cause it's going around in a circle, the moving up,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.700
 and it just slowly brushes the fingers of the other arm.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.700
 - So that's not really a high f--

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.340
 That's how you would imagine Michael Gov would high-five.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.300
 (laughing)

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.300
 - Yeah, it's really, it's really worth it.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.700
 It only does one high-five per minute.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.860
 I'm not sure what the point is.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.700
 - One high-five per minute.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.540
 - But it's hard, it's hard.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.380
 That's the point.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.140
 - It's not, it's okay.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.460
 - The thumbs up that Donald Trump's gradually destroying

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.660
 for everyone else in the world.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.660
 (laughing)

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.660
 Do you know what the origin of that is?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.940
 - Apparently there were little theories.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.540
 - In basketball, when someone got hit in the face

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.900
 by a stray thumb and they held it off and said,

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.900
 "Who's this?"

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.060
 (laughing)

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.420
 - It's a strong theory, but no.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.260
 So apparently there's a--

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.100
 - Yeah, two other things.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.820
 - Well, there's quite a strong myth that says

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.980
 that gladiators, you give the thumbs up for gladiators

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.420
 if you thought they should live in and the thumbs down.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.780
 They should die, but I think that's not true.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.860
 I think you just put your thumb out and that meant,

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.620
 I think we've got no evidence that the thumbs up

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.620
 meant live and thumbs down meant die.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.580
 But, Desmond Morris says that it's from medieval times

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.500
 where if you were a businessman doing a deal,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.340
 then the way you do it is you'd lick your thumb

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.220
 and then you press it up against someone else's

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.820
 licked thumb and that was really like,

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.980
 "Hey, deal is done."

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.140
 - Wow, that's like blood brothers,

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.060
 but slightly weirdly more disgusting.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.660
 - What it reminds me of is,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.540
 do you remember in the last QI meeting,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.860
 Anna, when you were trying to show us some pick-up lines

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.540
 and you tried one on under, you missed this done?

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.380
 - Two.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.980
 - She licked her thumb, wiped it on these clothes

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.060
 and said, "Let's get you out of these wet clothes."

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.060
 - Oh, that's, yeah, that's a good one.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.180
 - He was smitten.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.180
 - The single most erotic moment of my life.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.940
 (laughing)

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.780
 - That's strong.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.300
 - You know, couples,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.620
 Marion couples used to shake hands at the altar.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.460
 - Oh, really?

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.540
 - So this is a BBC History magazine claims this,

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.420
 but yeah, in the 17th century you got married

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.780
 and then you shake hands with the bride.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.580
 - So because it's like a contract movie.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.420
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.260
 - The kissing thing, when I got married in January,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.900
 the priest told us that, you know, it's not a thing,

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.020
 you don't need to do it.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.740
 It's like, it's just people just started doing it.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.300
 It just caught on like the high five

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.540
 and just people decided to do it.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.940
 But it's never been officially a part of the ceremony.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.780
 - Yeah, I know.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.900
 - You make his the bride is not a line

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.740
 a part of the ceremony.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.740
 - He popularized it, don't.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.220
 - I think it was a half-lipped amount.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.020
 (laughing)

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.860
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.700
 - It's quite American.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.940
 I always think of it as not a--

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:28.940
 - What, you made out kiss the bride?

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.380
 - Yes, in fact, that's what he said to me.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.740
 He said that it's something that was seen

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.700
 in American movies and then everyone thought,

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.300
 "Oh, there's meant to be that line."

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.780
 And then we started doing it.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.540
 - So when I was looking at stuff about high fives,

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.940
 I came across an article about a lollipop man.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.260
 He's quit because he was high five in the children

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.220
 as they walked across the road.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.900
 And he was told not to do it.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.100
 And he was like, "Right, fine, I'm gonna quit."

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.940
 - Okay.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.620
 - So just very quickly, a lollipop man,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.900
 'cause I didn't know this until I got to this country,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.780
 is someone who stands by a zebra crossing

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.620
 and allows school children to walk across.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.460
 - I had no idea.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.020
 - He's holding a large lollipop shaped object

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.860
 to stop the cars.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.340
 - But he doesn't sell lollipops.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.380
 - And a zebra crossing is a road crossing

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.980
 with black and white stripes on it.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.860
 - That the Beatles walked over on Abbey Road.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.380
 - Yes, but there are thousands and thousands

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.220
 of zebra crossings.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.700
 It's not like Britain has one zebra crossing

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.180
 and all school children have to cross that

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.140
 before they go to the school.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.540
 - I was surprised I got the space to take that photo

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.180
 with all the kids. - Anyway, lollipop man.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.780
 - So this guy, he was from a Plymouth City Council.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.380
 And then I just carried on reading the rest

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.420
 of the Google searches on pages two and three

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.220
 that people don't normally go to.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.140
 And there was also a lollipop man in Edinburgh

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.500
 who was told not to high five children.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.980
 There was a lollipop lady in the Vale of Glamorgan

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.140
 who had the same.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.140
 There was two lollipop men in Essex that I found.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.220
 There was a guy in Weston, Batonshire,

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.300
 who's left his job because he wasn't allowed

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.860
 to high five kids.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.900
 And there was a guy in Australia, in Bayside, Australia,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.060
 who was also left his job because, well, he got told off

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.500
 because he was high five in children.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.700
 So this seems to be a real problem.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.020
 - Amazing that it's like a deal breaker for keeping your job.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.100
 (laughing)

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.100
 - No high five?

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.020
 I'm out of here.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.340
 - That is so weird.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.180
 - It's weird.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.700
 - It's just a thing that seems to be happening

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.540
 all over the world.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.380
 - That's amazing.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.660
 I bet no one else has made that connection in the world.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.940
 I bet even they have not made that connection.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.700
 - It's a lollipop. - I bet they mean.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.540
 - The high five club.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.580
 - They mean high five each other and that feels like it.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.500
 (laughing)

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.660
 - It's because it's dangerous.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.580
 - So the idea is, you're supposed to be concentrating

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.100
 on the road and not high five in kids as they go across.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.100
 And presumably what's happened, I might be completely wrong

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.340
 about this, but it seems to me like a memo's gone out

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.700
 to all the different councils and they've all gone

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.780
 round checking that no one's high five in people.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.540
 I don't know if that's right, but it's a real coincidence.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.820
 - It doesn't take that much concentration to high five,

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.660
 does it?

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.260
 - I thought you could focus on the road as well as also.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.100
 - Yeah.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.020
 - But if someone was repeatedly high five

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.340
 in while driving, I would not be so comfortable

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.300
 as a passenger.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.980
 - How would you do that so that you'll hand out the window?

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.980
 - I guess so, yeah.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.860
 - But then you're driving too close to the paper.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.540
 (laughing)

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.500
 - No, you would high five other drivers

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.900
 coming in the opposite direction.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.740
 - Oh, of course.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.500
 - What you can't see on the Abbey Road cover

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.820
 is a crest fall in lollipop van on the other side

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.780
 taking his P-45 slip with it.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.620
 - Yeah.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.660
 - I don't ever high five the Beatles again.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.420
 (laughing)

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.020
 (upbeat music)

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.540
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.500
 And that is Chuzinski.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.700
 - Yeah, my fact this week is that when the first American

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.820
 woman went into space, NASA designed a makeup kit for her.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.060
 And this is an interview I was reading this week

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.300
 with Sally Ride, who was in the first group

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.100
 of female Americans who went into space.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.340
 And yeah, she said that NASA called her in for a meeting

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.020
 and said, look, we're really worried about this,

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.860
 but we're sending women out there now.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.460
 And we obviously need to design your makeup kit.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.580
 So what kind of stuff should we be putting in there?

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.820
 'Cause we're a bit stuck with that.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.660
 - What did she say?

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.860
 - And she said it was the last thing she wanted

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.900
 to be thinking about at that time.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.020
 - Effectively, this fact is about the sort of slightly

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.020
 backward, massively backward sexism that happens

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:14.860
 to a lot of women to say.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.740
 - We don't want people to look like a minger for the aliens,

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.300
 do you? (laughing)

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.660
 - So there was this interview with Sally Ride, too.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.940
 It was quite sweet saying that when NASA came to her,

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.780
 they were a bit confused about various things,

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.460
 like they didn't know how many tampons they would want out

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.740
 in space, so they suggested a hundred tampons per person

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.220
 for a week and she was like, you know what I mean?

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.860
 (laughing)

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.900
 - What if you need to build a fort?

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.500
 (laughing)

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.780
 - Tampon fort, please put your child to do this.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.580
 - It's like a pillow fort, but for a mouse.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.220
 (laughing)

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.940
 - But some of them, I read an interview with another

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.660
 of the women who went up who said that

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.980
 when they came in and asked them do they want makeup,

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.980
 what kind of makeup do they want?

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.940
 They were loud gaffors by some of the women,

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.620
 but one of them said, look, these pictures taken in space

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.500
 will follow us around for the rest of our lives.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.180
 And I don't want to disappear into the background.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.340
 So a couple of them did take these makeup kits up.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.340
 - Wow.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.180
 - Yeah.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.820
 - Well, they sort of specially tested makeup that would adhere

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.780
 to the skin, even in a microgravity.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.860
 - But what doesn't happen with makeup, Andy,

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.420
 is women don't put makeup on at the start of the day,

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.220
 and by the end of the day, the gravity's just pulled it down

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.660
 to the bottom of their faces.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.660
 (laughing)

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.540
 - Paul's is on your feet.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.180
 (laughing)

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.540
 - That's a good point.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.540
 - I'm a face-up crotch look at a freepier.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.900
 (laughing)

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.540
 - No, it's extraordinary, though, that they sort of...

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.540
 - It is weird.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.500
 What's also weird is how long NASA took to

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.940
 and send women into space, given how long

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.460
 the Soviet Union did not take, so it was 20 years after,

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.020
 it was an odd way of creating that space.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.420
 (laughing)

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.620
 - They untucked a long time.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.540
 (laughing)

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.340
 - So the Soviet Union sent Valentina Tereshkva up in 1963,

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.780
 and one NASA official was actually asked what he thought

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.660
 about this at the time, and he said it made him sit

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.940
 to his stomach to think of women in space.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.340
 - But this is the weird thing about Tereshkva's trip.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.020
 She was only allowed to go because she wasn't menstruating.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.140
 - Oh, 'cause they were worried about what would happen

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:07.980
 with periods, don't they?

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.500
 - They were just didn't have enough payload

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.940
 to take 5,000 tampons of that.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.260
 (laughing)

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.900
 - No, all these reports sort of worrying about it,

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.300
 and so basically all your blood sort of pools

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.460
 in your torso and in your head, 'cause there's no gravity,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:26.140
 so that is something that on Earth is affected by gravity.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.980
 And there was a report in America in 1964, which said,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.220
 "It will be hard to match," I'm quoting here,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.220
 "a temperamental psychophysiologic human

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.940
 and the complicated machine, either spacecraft,

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.100
 both need to be ready at the same time, i.e.,

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.020
 we think women will be too mad

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.820
 if they're menstruating to operate a spacecraft."

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.660
 - Wow.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.100
 - And they also worried that the blood from that system

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.660
 would also float up and cause,

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.860
 it could cause theoretically a dangerous condition

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.380
 called peritonitis, which can be fatal,

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.220
 as they thought, well, what if that happens?

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.860
 But the reality is that normal blood circulation

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.300
 is completely different to menstrual blood,

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.660
 so it was in every risk.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.460
 - And actually, women going up in space is very sensible

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.700
 and a good idea because they can do everything

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.180
 that the men can do, but they're smaller,

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.220
 generally speaking.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.060
 You just need less power to get women up there.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.300
 - Oh, I thought you'd be...

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.300
 - Every bit counts.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.460
 - You don't have to send them as far because they're smaller,

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.340
 so they'll look the same size even when they're a bit closer.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.180
 - That's the whole point.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.860
 That's why we send people in space, so they look smaller.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.940
 - See what humans would look like

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.540
 if they were one sent to me to school.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.980
 - That's one small step.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.820
 No, it's a double step.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.900
 It's just a long way away.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:40.820
 - There's another astronaut called Svetlana Savitskaya,

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.540
 and she went up in 1984.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.780
 She didn't mention first women to fly in space twice.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.340
 In 1995, she gave an interview,

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.980
 and she was talking about the sort of sexism

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.220
 that was going on with being a female astronaut.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.180
 When she arrived at the salue seven,

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.380
 as she came in, there was another astronaut there

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.220
 who handed her an apron and told her to get to work.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.900
 That was her arrival in space, yeah.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.980
 - Was that a tongue-in-cheek thing?

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.660
 - No, no, it was very much...

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.500
 - It seems like, well, women shouldn't be up here,

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.860
 so I'm going to say something extremely offensive.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.540
 - Oh, so it was a deliberate, like, you shouldn't be here.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.500
 - You shouldn't be here, put the apron on,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.740
 if you're going to be here and clean up the eye of Shuttle.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.580
 - Wow.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.260
 - Yeah, they've been deliberately letting dirt build up

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.460
 on the Shuttle and jeopardising the entire mission

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.060
 to make this incredibly petty point.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.100
 - Where'd he get the apron from?

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.940
 Who has an apron in space?

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.900
 - He would have had to smuggle an apron.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.300
 We would have had to craft an apron,

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.420
 probably from vital bits of the spaceship.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.660
 - On the ISS, do you know they have to vacuum every day?

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.500
 - Really?

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.940
 - Yeah, 'cause they need to keep it clean

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.700
 and they need to keep it clear of germs and bacteria.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.900
 And, yeah, so they have to vacuum every day.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.860
 - It's quite ironic the fact that they're bringing

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.340
 the vacuum into space.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.180
 - Oh, yeah.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.020
 (all laughing)

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.180
 - Do they, 'cause the stuff isn't adhering to the ground,

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.780
 'cause of the absence of gravity in the lab.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.660
 So do they just wave a vacuum in the air?

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.740
 - I think they must do.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.580
 - They must do, right?

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:05.580
 - That is so easy.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.860
 - I guess what happens is it kind of floats around

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.620
 and then it'll just stick to things.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.300
 - Yeah, I think it does, that's complete.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.780
 - We mentioned before, you know you get calluses

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.020
 on your feet, 'cause you're not walking around

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.580
 on the ground, so your underside of your feet gets soft.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.740
 And then the top of your feet,

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.060
 'cause you're hooking your feet around

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.860
 railing to things gets very hard.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.220
 Those calluses break off.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.860
 And then they're just floating around this base station,

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.740
 bits of your own footskin.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.660
 So you have to vacuum those up.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.700
 - Turn the wear socks first times.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.660
 - You should be wearing space socks.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.260
 - I guess so, yeah I guess so.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.980
 - But it is cool they have reverse feet in space.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.380
 (laughing)

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.220
 - I do love that.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.060
 - Is that what we're saying?

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.060
 - That's what we're saying.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.260
 - If you live in space you have reverse feet.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.980
 - Do you know what happened on the,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.820
 the Maiden Space Shuttle Columbia Mission in 1981?

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.700
 The toilet got clogged when they were up in space

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.340
 and they had to use these tube-shaped bags

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.300
 which attached to your bottom with a sticky seal

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.300
 to go to the loo.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.580
 It's very unpleasant.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.620
 And then as they were re-entering the Earth's atmosphere,

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.740
 the toilet was broken and the vacuum dried excrement

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.780
 got into the ventilation system

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.140
 and then started floating around in the main cabin.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:12.980
 - No.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:13.980
 - Bad times.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.220
 - That's, see you really need the vacuum cleaner

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.060
 then.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.900
 - Yeah you do, yeah.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.740
 - You suck that up.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.180
 - You can't suck up poo in a vacuum cleaner.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.100
 - I wouldn't use it again after I'd done it.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:23.940
 - Yeah.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.900
 - If it's vacuum dried.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.740
 - Okay.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.580
 - If it's vacuum dried you can.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.100
 Which is why I always vacuum dry.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:28.980
 (laughing)

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.140
 - With a more like a little bit.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.500
 (laughing)

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.740
 - Just one more thing on the extreme sexism and space theme.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.580
 - Yeah.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.420
 - Great theme.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:43.220
 - It's such a strong theme, it's just a real laugh a minute.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.740
 So in 1971 there's a NASA memo

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.740
 which is about psychological issues with long space flights.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.180
 And so this is in '71 and this is about how men

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.620
 can suffer in various ways.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.100
 And one of the ways that they'll suffer

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.180
 is that they don't have a direct sexual release

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.500
 'cause they're up in space, all a bunch of men on their own.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.100
 And this NASA memo says,

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.700
 the question of direct sexual release

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.580
 on a long duration space mission must be considered.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.660
 Practical considerations preclude men taking their wives.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.900
 So it is possible that a woman qualified

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.300
 from a scientific viewpoint might be persuaded

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.060
 to donate her time and energies

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.180
 for the sake of improving crew morale.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.020
 - No, whoa.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.340
 - No.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.500
 - Space prostitutes.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.500
 - I said, say yeah.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.300
 - That sounds like a movie doesn't it?

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.060
 (laughing)

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:27.900
 - Star Wars.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.740
 - So they want a star.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.580
 - Star Wars.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.420
 - No.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.260
 - No.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.780
 - They weren't suggesting that.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.700
 They were suggesting that providing a woman

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.860
 puts, they talk about sublimation,

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.060
 which is the idea that men will be sexually relieved

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.140
 by just being around a woman.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.100
 It will improve them around rather than being on their own

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.660
 'cause it pointed out that masturbation isn't,

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.380
 is messy and that homosexual behavior

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.540
 shouldn't be encouraged.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.780
 - Pointed out masturbation is messy.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.100
 - I would say as long as it's freeze-dried.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.380
 (laughing)

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.620
 - Do you ever go to add these house, you'll notice.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.460
 (laughing)

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.300
 - It's not safe.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.780
 (laughing)

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.860
 - Oh, deary me.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.440
 (upbeat music)

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.420
 - Okay, it is time for back number three

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.140
 and that is James.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.140
 - Okay, my fat this week is that the Indian Justice System

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.660
 has a backlog of 31 million cases.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.820
 - Ah.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.820
 - 31 million.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.660
 - Yeah, that's nuts.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.500
 - Oh my goodness.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.500
 - So terrifying.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.140
 - And if all of the judges,

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.420
 managed to deal with 100 cases an hour

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.140
 and didn't take any breaks,

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.700
 it would take them 35 years to get rid of the backlog

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.180
 'cause there's hardly any judges.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.700
 - But it's like, it's between 13 and 15 judges,

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.180
 per million people in India.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.100
 - And in America it's more than 100.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:47.940
 - Is it?

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.780
 - Wow.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.100
 - And so I saw this in a review of a book

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.300
 called When Crime Pays, Money and Muscle in Indian Politics

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.580
 in the Economist magazine a few weeks ago.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.940
 And what it was really, it's an article

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.660
 about how corrupt politicians are in India.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.940
 And they said in this article that if you are a politician

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.740
 with serious charges hanging over you,

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.260
 you have an 18% chance of winning your race

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.220
 and that's compared with 6% for someone

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.980
 who doesn't have any charges against them.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.180
 So you're three times more likely to get into parliament

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.180
 if you have a serious crime against you

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.420
 than if you have no crime, which is insane.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.580
 - Where's the causation correlation linked then?

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.740
 Do they speculate?

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.940
 - Yeah, because I can't believe people

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.620
 are voting people in just on the grounds

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.620
 of their criminal history.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.140
 - Well, the speculation is that getting the Indian states

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.340
 do things is very difficult because it's just

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.100
 there's so much bureaucracy.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.420
 And sometimes you just have to bang a few heads together

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.420
 to get things done.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.300
 And so people think, well, this criminal knows

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.100
 how to get things done, specifically crimes.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.060
 But if he can do crimes, he can probably

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.900
 sort out the roads and the railways

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.060
 and stuff like that as well.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.380
 - So is it only the people who've done crimes well

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.780
 that are getting elected?

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.140
 - Well, if you do crimes that well,

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.420
 you tend not to get a prison.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.100
 - Well, indeed, they've been caught.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:04.940
 So I would have thought.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.540
 - Well, a lot of these people haven't been found guilty

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.700
 or anything because there's still 31 million--

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.100
 - Oh yeah, it's two cases.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.860
 - Two thirds of all people in prison in India

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.500
 have not been convicted of anything.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.860
 They're waiting for the trial.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.300
 - So they still put them in jail though.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.900
 - Yeah, there are 400,000 people in India in prison.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.020
 Which is actually, I think, a bit lower

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.700
 than the British proportion.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.380
 Because Britain's got about 80,000 people in prison.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.460
 So they've got five times as many,

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.900
 but the population's way higher.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.220
 - But yeah, so you might have to wait 10 years

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.500
 for your case to be brought to court.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.020
 And you might be innocent at all times.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.740
 - And some people can't afford bail

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.620
 or some people don't know that bail is available to them.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.620
 So they're just sort of left-moldering in jail

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.620
 for years and years and years.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.460
 - Wow.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.820
 - And in the lower house in India, the lock sabber,

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.820
 34% of the MPs have got criminal charges filed against them.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.540
 So that's more than the third.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.060
 And according to this article,

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.860
 you can pretty much walk from Mumbai to Kolkata

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.340
 without stepping foot outside a constituency

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.380
 whose MP isn't facing a charge.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.220
 - Oh my God.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.700
 - And that's about 2,000 kilometers.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.540
 - Yeah.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.380
 - Wasn't there a thing in the American election this year

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.580
 that you told me about, Anna,

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.940
 where there was one of the people running

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.380
 had a warrant out for their arrest?

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.580
 - Oh yeah, the green candidate.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.180
 - That's why they were running.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.020
 (laughing)

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.620
 - Oh, well, for me, you're not going to go as she let her life.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.460
 But for Green.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.460
 (laughing)

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.460
 - Yeah, Jill Stein, wasn't it?

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.300
 - Jill Stein.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.700
 - And it was for protesting.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.020
 - Yeah, it was for a vandalism

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.580
 'cause she'd graffitied something

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.740
 and it was a mental protest.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.980
 - It was in a particular state, wasn't it?

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.820
 - Yeah.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.260
 - So she just didn't campaign very much there.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.100
 - Yeah.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.940
 - Of course.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.780
 - Or really anywhere else.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.100
 - Wow.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.380
 - So obviously there are people who have to wait a very long time

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.660
 to get their cases heard.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:53.660
 One example is a guy, an 85 year old man who in 2014

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.820
 was granted a divorce that he'd filed for 32 years.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:58.660
 (laughing)

00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:59.500
 - Wow.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.820
 You're probably made up by then, haven't you?

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.660
 - Yeah.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.660
 - Yeah.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.420
 - Well, you'd hope so.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.620
 Otherwise, that's a lot of resentment

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.460
 that's festering for third volume, isn't it?

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.300
 - Yeah, true.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.140
 - Yeah.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.660
 In 2018, in the government whips, sprung six MPs

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.620
 out of prison so that they could vote.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.820
 (laughing)

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.900
 Yeah.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.380
 - Oh, if anyone else was with that cool,

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.620
 the most rebellious thing they do

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.500
 is not a Bay Jeremy Corbyn.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.620
 Imagine if they were springing people out of jail.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.580
 - So it was gonna be a really tight vote

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.820
 and they decided, oh, we're gonna need these six people

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.340
 so they got them out of prison.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.180
 (laughing)

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.180
 - That's amazing.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.580
 Like on a day trip or just altogether out of prison?

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.140
 - I think they put them back in.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:35.960
 - Oh, yeah.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.940
 But that's like during John Major's government in the UK

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.020
 'cause he had this wafer thin majority, didn't he?

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.700
 And they kept on having to bring in, you know,

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.940
 they were MPs who were really seriously ill

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.020
 to get legislation through,

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.820
 they were practically bringing in stretchers, you know?

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.800
 - Oh, sort of pushing them through, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.580
 - Do we know how they sprung them out of prison?

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.460
 Was it a great escape style tunnel digging sort of endeavor?

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.660
 - The tunnel digging, you'd need to know

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.980
 that the vote's coming up a long time advance.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.060
 (laughing)

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.860
 - Order 12 bulldozers on tax payers expense.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.300
 (laughing)

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.820
 - There's one court case in India

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.500
 that's been going on since 1878.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.540
 (laughing)

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.180
 I think this was the oldest I could find.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.860
 - That's a long divorce, isn't it?

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.860
 (laughing)

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.580
 - Great grandchildren are getting divorced.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.020
 It's a replot of land that's less than two acres

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.780
 and it's a fight between a sheer Muslim family

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.260
 and a Sunni Muslim family.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.380
 And one side argues that their graves are on it

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.940
 and so they need to keep it at the other side argues

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.060
 that belongs to them, it's beginning on since 1878.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.740
 - The election commission of India says

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.660
 that no person should have to travel more than two kilometers

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.500
 to cast a vote.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.460
 So in the state of Goodgerat, there's a temple caretaker

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.500
 who lives in a temple in the middle of a forest

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.140
 who is the only person who votes in his special voting booth.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.100
 Okay, so the police come in whenever there's an election,

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.220
 they have to go through this massive forest

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.900
 with snakes and lions and stuff like that

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.660
 and then they put the voting booth in the middle of the forest

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.140
 and they sit there and they wait for him to come.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.260
 And he says in the morning, he has his breakfast

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.980
 and he has a cup of tea and he works out

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.700
 who he's gonna vote for.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.660
 And then about 11 o'clock he wanders down

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.940
 and puts his vote in and they can go home.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.100
 - That is amazing.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:18.940
 - Is that cool?

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.780
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.900
 - That's hilarious that they haven't specified a time.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.940
 They've just got a seat.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.420
 (laughing)

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.820
 - Turn out very low this year.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.540
 (laughing)

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.340
 - Just one thing we've never talked about actually,

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.060
 that's another weird thing about the Indian justice system

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.620
 is the case of Laan Bihari

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.140
 who set up the Otar Pradesh group of dead people.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:38.980
 - Oh yeah.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.300
 - I've never mentioned this,

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.060
 but this is totally bizarre.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.860
 He's this guy who in 1975 wanted to apply for a bank loan

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.820
 and so he went to try and get proof of identity

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.220
 from the revenue office and he found out that he was dead

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.180
 because his uncle had declared him dead

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.020
 so we could claim the land that he had inherited.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.740
 And it turned out this is a massive problem

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.220
 and he set up his organization,

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.220
 which is to represent people who have been declared dead

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.940
 and indeed even though they're alive.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.700
 And he eventually in 2004,

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.140
 he eventually in '99.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.260
 (laughing)

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.660
 - I told you he was dead, I told you and I'm right.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.540
 (laughing)

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.460
 - In 1994, sorry, he finally managed to get himself

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.460
 declared alive, but his organization,

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.180
 which is the Otar Pradesh Dead People Association,

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.900
 has over 20,000 members and by 2004,

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.100
 they only managed to declare four of them alive.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.300
 - Wow.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.540
 I remember reading about him where all the times

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.060
 he tried to prove that he was alive.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.380
 So he started doing things like illegal stuff,

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.900
 like robbing a bank.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.460
 They'd be like, "We can't arrest you, you're not alive,

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.860
 we can't arrest a dead man."

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.340
 - So do you think he was robbing the bank

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.060
 and they're like, "Oh, it's a ghost."

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.060
 (laughing)

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.700
 - He would just move mugs around.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.060
 (laughing)

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.220
 - Just walk into sayances.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.820
 (laughing)

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.100
 - There was a sorry, on sayances,

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.500
 there was a legal case in the UK

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.220
 that had to be redone because it turned out the jury.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.820
 This is in 1994, it turned out the jury

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.820
 had made their decision based on a say-on.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.220
 - What?

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.700
 - Yeah, it was a double murder case

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.460
 and they had to spend the night in a hotel

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.620
 because the case was going on a while

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.700
 and they all got really drunk

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.660
 and then one of them entered their wine glass turned over

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.140
 and went, "All right, let's ask a ghost

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.900
 whether he's guilty or not."

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.220
 And they did and then they had to redo the case

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.220
 because that isn't allowed.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.220
 - Why would the ghost know?

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.060
 Like what was the...

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.460
 (laughing)

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.420
 - I'm not sure the ghost did, though.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.940
 (laughing)

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:31.940
 - Who was the ghost?

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.780
 - They're right up there.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.940
 - Just the ghost of the murdered.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:34.780
 - Man.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:35.620
 - Oh.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.700
 - Who killed you?

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.540
 Did he do it?

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.660
 - Oh, so it's specifically, it wasn't just a ghost.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.660
 - Well, it might because ghosts can talk to each other, right?

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.020
 So the ghost, whoever it was,

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.460
 could have gotten asked the murder person they thought.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.300
 - So the ghost went to each other?

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.140
 - I'll get back to you.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.100
 I'm seeing him next week for a ghost lunch.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:48.940
 I will...

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.780
 (laughing)

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.940
 - I don't know who did that one.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.020
 (laughing)

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.900
 - Mrs. Doubtful is that.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.460
 - Oh, I'll ask her.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.500
 (laughing)

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.740
 (upbeat music)

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.500
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.940
 and that is Andy.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.740
 - My fact is that scientists are building a special bunker

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.420
 in Antarctica to store bits of glassier from the Alps.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.180
 - It's so exciting.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.500
 - Yeah, it's amazing.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.900
 - It's because glassiers are melting all over the world.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.060
 And I didn't notice that this is a job.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.500
 There's a job of being a paleoclimatologist.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.660
 So like a paleoclimatologist does dinosaurs.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.340
 A paleoclimatologist does ancient weather, basically.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.900
 And all these glassiers,

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.460
 they're really old ice,

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.380
 and it contains lots of data about what was in the atmosphere,

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.580
 how much of which kind of gas,

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.860
 what the weather would have been like, what the climate was.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.980
 So if they melt, you suddenly are losing

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.660
 tens of thousands of years of data.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.180
 So what kind of weather did they learn?

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.780
 It's like, oh, it was snowing.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.340
 - Yeah, it was snowing before that.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.020
 It's snowing before that.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.220
 - Cold, cold, cold, still cold.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.220
 (laughing)

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.700
 - They learn about the gases in the atmosphere.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.020
 But they have collecting cross sections of ice.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.180
 They have these circular drills.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.060
 They're like cookie cutters,

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.460
 and they just bore right down into the ice,

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.580
 and then they'd bring it up,

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.140
 slice it into one meter sections, label them,

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.020
 and they're currently building this massive bunker,

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.420
 which is going to be in Antarctica.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.820
 - Is this, is their research group,

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.540
 are they the ones called protecting ice memory project?

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.380
 - Yes.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.180
 - Okay, so this is this big international pen.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.340
 - Wait a minute.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.180
 - Oh, yeah.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.100
 (laughing)

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.620
 - Did they call themselves Pemps?

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.420
 - I think it's Pem project, I think it's just a...

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.500
 - I can see why they didn't bother with the project.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.140
 (laughing)

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.380
 - They make a big deal of that space.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.260
 With a PIM project.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.500
 (laughing)

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.020
 PIM pause project.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.980
 (laughing)

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.380
 - Yeah, it's unbelievably cool though.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.820
 Actually, so these ice cores that they pull out,

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.500
 just the idea that all of this stuff that's happened

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.500
 for hundreds of thousands of years

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.060
 is literally frozen in time, and we can look at it.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:54.900
 - Yeah.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.300
 - So find volcanic ash, or find when carbon dioxide

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.300
 was in the atmosphere, and how much of it.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.740
 And that's how they get a lot of climate data,

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.660
 which I hadn't realized.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.060
 So when we say, you know, when you have those graphs,

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.820
 which show how much CO2 was in the atmosphere,

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.700
 X number of years ago, very often,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.140
 that's because they've studied an ice core

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.260
 and they found a little bubble of it somewhere beneath.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.660
 It's been reserved for hundreds of thousands of years.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.500
 It's always bubbles.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.220
 - It's always the bubbles, isn't it?

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.500
 And they just keep the bubbles.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.420
 That's true, 'cause it'd be easier to store, wouldn't it?

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.700
 And the reason it's an endoccticate

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.740
 is that even if the power fails,

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.620
 it's still minus 50 degrees outside.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.180
 Whereas if you have it somewhere warmer, right?

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.340
 And the power fails, obviously,

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.660
 all your precious data melts.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.900
 - Do you guys know about Project Ice Worm?

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.260
 - Project Ice Worm.

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.660
 I know what Ice Worms are.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.140
 - What are Ice Worms?

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.100
 - They're worms that live in ice.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.740
 - All right, yeah, that's amazing, James.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.580
 - Wait, is that true?

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:46.420
 - That can't be true.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.940
 - They have worms that live on glaciers,

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.380
 but Anna can tell us about her thing,

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.620
 and then I'll tell you about Ice Worms.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.460
 - Yeah, okay, cool.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.980
 - Let's compare Ice Worms.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.540
 So this is an endoccticate.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:55.820
 This is in Greenland.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.620
 But Project Ice Worm was this American plan in the Cold War

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.380
 to build this massive underground network of tunnels

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.340
 below the ice in Greenland.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.820
 And then that would be, they would be missile launch sites.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.700
 So that way, if they went via Greenland,

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.940
 then they could get easy access to the Soviet Union.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.100
 And we actually did this.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.140
 So if you go to Greenland, way, way under the ice,

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.340
 there's this network of tunnels

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.980
 that they started building that's full of stuff like sewage

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.540
 and loads of diesel fuel apparently,

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.020
 some pollutants and radiological waste.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.700
 And I think 21 tunnels were dug under the ground in Greenland.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.420
 And then they decided it wasn't actually going to work

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.460
 because it wasn't viable for people to live under

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.860
 the ice for long periods of time.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.580
 They had hospitals, they had a cinema,

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.780
 they had shops.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.940
 - Shops, yeah, yeah.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.540
 - What's all this sewage, therefore?

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.860
 - Yeah, I don't know why all the sewage is there.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.060
 Maybe it made you have a funny tummy

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.300
 if you're living on a freezer.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.660
 - Makes it easy to freeze, try.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.580
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.220
 But it's a problem because the ice sheet might melt

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.060
 on Greenland.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.460
 And then you've got all the radioactive sludge,

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.300
 which is going to.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.940
 - No, but bad news, the ice sheet melts,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.860
 the seas kind of rise and stuff like that.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.860
 Good news, we find a new cinema.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.860
 - Yeah.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.860
 - Oh, yeah.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.220
 - Imagine that day when the ice melt said there's a,

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.300
 like an, you know, an Odin.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.100
 - Yeah, covered in radioactive waste.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.500
 And sewage.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.820
 - I can imagine it being a hipster destination cinema,

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:17.820
 actually.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.420
 People look like it's going to be great.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.860
 - You have to dig through 12 meters of ice together.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.340
 (laughing)

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.980
 - Okay, okay, I can't wait anymore.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:25.820
 - What's an ice worm?

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.060
 - Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.140
 (laughing)

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.340
 - That's why you've been quiet all this time.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.460
 - It took so long, oh my God.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.100
 - Well, an ice worm, like I say,

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.740
 it is just a worm that lives on ice.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.780
 They live in glaciers and they eat little bits of pollen

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.820
 that have been trapped in the glacier.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:42.660
 They're little black things.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.060
 So you can see them really easily.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.540
 - And do they burrow through the ice

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.780
 and live when they're under ice?

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.700
 - Well, sometimes they do.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.900
 So if it's warm on the outside,

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.460
 if it's above, like, say, two degrees,

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.540
 they'll go into the ice.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.380
 Because if they get above five degrees, they melt.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:01.380
 And they literally melt, they turn to liquid, these worms.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.180
 It's like an enzyme in their body,

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.020
 which starts to liquefy the whole body.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.100
 So if they go above, like, say, two or three degrees,

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.540
 they will melt.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.620
 And you see them on glaciers, the little black things.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.860
 - Wow.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.260
 - That's so terrifying thing, then.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.340
 For some reason, I feel it's like speed,

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.780
 where you can't go over a certain amount.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.420
 - And they're obsessively watching

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.980
 that the moment you're at the time.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.620
 - Yeah.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.860
 - Sometimes glaciers enter this super fast state.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.140
 And they go-- - How fast?

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.580
 - Not very fast.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.060
 - So not super fast.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:36.100
 It's, well, they're called them glaciers surges.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.100
 And they move at 100 times their normal speed.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.700
 - When I read that the fastest that they've ever gone

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.580
 is 11 miles per year.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.820
 - That's pretty fast.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.580
 Is it that? - Is it?

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.140
 - Well, it's about 45 meters per day.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.860
 - Sure, it's like southern rail.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.820
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.820
 But they are moving four times faster than they were

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.980
 in the '90s, in the summer's speed of glaciers.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.140
 - Which is, that's big.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:00.860
 Where they're going?

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:01.700
 - Well, they're melting.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.340
 - Down hill, down hill, and towards the--

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.220
 - Oh, okay, right, okay.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.820
 - So that's what a glacier is, basically.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.260
 It's loads and loads of snow that's fallen over,

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.380
 loads and loads of years.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.620
 And it's just slowly with gravity moving down

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.860
 as well to see like a river, but it's made of ice.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.460
 - So it's on land?

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.300
 - Yes.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.740
 - Okay. - Yeah.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.820
 - Otherwise it'd be an iceberg.

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.220
 - Yes, okay, so that's the difference.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.780
 That's what I didn't understand.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.180
 - Yeah, and actually, a fox's glacier mint

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.820
 chose a polar bear standing on an iceberg.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.660
 - You're right.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.020
 - So as a completely inaccurate mint.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.860
 - It should be an iceberg mint.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.860
 - Yes.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.500
 - Or they need to change their design.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.340
 - Either way.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.020
 - Until they do one of those two things,

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.820
 I'm gonna buy one of those mints.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.620
 - I mean, to be honest, if we've been really pedantic,

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.420
 they should show a fox standing on a glacier.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.260
 - So they've got it going in a couple of ways.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.740
 - It's in a polar bear on iceberg.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:46.980
 What are you guys doing?

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.140
 (laughing)

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.740
 - I'm in a bear iceberg mint.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.740
 (laughing)

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.100
 It should be.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.140
 - There are towns in the Alps

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.500
 who are still burying soldiers from the First World War,

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.500
 thanks to Glacier melt.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.340
 - What do you mean by that?

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.580
 - Well, loads of soldiers were posted

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.940
 in the Alps during the First World War,

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.780
 and it was incredibly, obviously,

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.900
 very cold, extremely harsh conditions to live in,

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.460
 and they were fighting very fiercely

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.340
 over almost no territory, basically.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.220
 But lots of soldiers froze to death,

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.940
 got caught in the Glaciers,

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.260
 they didn't get caught by the Glaciers,

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.100
 but they...

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.500
 - Incredibly slow, like that Austin Powers scene,

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.140
 edging away from the slow moving Glacier.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.260
 - Well, no, we've established that they're super fast,

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.300
 so maybe they weren't ready for the speed of a...

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.300
 - Okay.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.540
 - Of a Glacier, about 11 miles per year.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.540
 - 11 miles per year.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.940
 (laughing)

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.700
 - How did these guys get into the army?

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.620
 - Anyway, they were caught.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.340
 - They're now being discovered

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.140
 as the Glaciers retreat as they melt.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.260
 Bodies are being discovered, and they're being buried.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.660
 So there was a funeral for two of them

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:47.300
 in 2013, and 500 people turned up to pay their respect.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.820
 - Were their bodies preserved properly?

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.980
 Like, 'cause I remember when they found

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.140
 Mallory on Everest, you know,

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.740
 a lot of his skin was there.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.980
 His body was there, 'cause they...

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.220
 - Yeah. - You're properly preserved, aren't you?

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.940
 - I don't know how well preserved they were,

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.220
 but there is a particular town called Peo

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.780
 where they do a lot of these barrels,

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.100
 'cause they're near a lot of the battlefield sites,

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.060
 and that's where the bodies are being discovered.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.220
 - Wow. - Amazing.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.380
 - It is kind of a...

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.740
 If you're looking on the bright side of Clover Warming,

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.420
 it is good for glacial archaeology, isn't it?

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.260
 Because these...

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.980
 Like you say, it's suddenly revealing all this amazing stuff.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.620
 So melting glaciers have suddenly revealed

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.820
 like lots of Roman coins, some Iron Age horses.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.900
 There's a glass you call the Meadow Hall Glacier.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.060
 - I'm not sure, I don't know.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.620
 Like, a couple of coins in a horse

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.900
 makes up for losing the entire Netherlands.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.220
 - No, no, no, no, no.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.500
 - What if you want your children to go

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.260
 into the same line of work as you when there's no more ice?

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.860
 It's only good in the very short term.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.140
 - Well, I think we've established that this view

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.300
 is a very short term view, isn't it?

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.300
 That's already about the long term.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.980
 I would be concerned about climate change.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.300
 (laughing)

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.380
 As it is, I'm very excited about these Roman coins.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.140
 (laughing)

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.620
 And a forest, so there's a thousand-year-old...

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.460
 (laughing)

00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.580
 We could always do it more forest,

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.100
 and there's a thousand-year-old forest

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.260
 that's been revealed by a melting glacier in Alaska.

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.060
 - I bet it's a rubbish forest after all the time

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.300
 on a glacier, it can't be good.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.300
 - It's a bit stumpy, but there is indeed.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.820
 - A bit depressing, it's a dead squirrels everywhere.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.660
 (laughing)

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.020
 - Yeah, that's strange, isn't it?

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.260
 'Cause you do want more trees as well.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.140
 You want more forests, but you also want more ice,

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.820
 so which do you choose?

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.860
 - Oh, it's so easy to choose, isn't it?

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.700
 - Yeah.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.020
 - But the ice, I think we'll keep the ice.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:26.860
 - Okay, yeah.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.780
 - Great, 'cause you can go forests elsewhere

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.820
 where there's no ice, but you can't put ice.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.820
 - You can make ice.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.460
 - You can't keep it in the Amazon.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.460
 (laughing)

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.780
 If you have a refrigerator, you can.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.020
 - You can't turn the hours into a fridge.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.700
 - Dad, but you can put a lot of refrigerators

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:42.540
 into the Amazon.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.460
 - It's not a refrigerator, it's a freezer.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.300
 - Why?

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.140
 (laughing)

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.580
 - A refrigerator's just gonna slow down the melting.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.420
 (laughing)

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.620
 That's why my ice tray's always full of water.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.860
 (laughing)

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.180
 I'm living.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.700
 That's why my pasties are never any good.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.940
 - Do you want some ice, or do you think?

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.020
 - Dribble, dribble, dribble.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:03.020
 (laughing)

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.460
 - Have a bite, we'll have an ice cream instead.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.460
 - Oh no.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.580
 (laughing)

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.180
 (upbeat music)

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.940
 - Okay, that's it.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:15.980
 That is all of our facts.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.260
 Thank you so much for listening.
