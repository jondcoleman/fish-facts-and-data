00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.980
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.940
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.100
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.980
 My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.500
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshensky,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.780
 and James Harkin.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.140
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.980
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.020
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.940
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.300
 - My fact this week is that it's a common misconception

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.720
 that face mites don't have an anus.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.140
 - How common?

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.580
 - Oh well, I know that I've blown it wide open

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.260
 for all of you guys and everyone listening.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.260
 (laughing)

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.540
 - If I, honestly, if I had a quid for every time

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.860
 I'd heard someone on the bus saying,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.660
 you know that face mites don't have an anus.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.500
 - No, right?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.620
 - It's exhausting.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.740
 - So we did think they were anus-less for a long time?

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.860
 - We did think they were.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.660
 - And also, sorry, face mites, what are they?

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.860
 - Oh right, sorry, yeah, I suppose I better start

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.420
 from the beginning of this story.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.540
 So face mites are something that almost everyone

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.980
 with normal faces-- - Face mites, yeah.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.100
 (laughing)

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.540
 - If you've got a face, you've got the mites,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.240
 probably about 90% of people, and they're very small,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.320
 about between 1/10th and 1/3 of a millimeter,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.460
 and so you can't really see them,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.780
 and they're living sort of like inside your pores

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.560
 in the daytime, so you couldn't see them anyway.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.240
 But there's been this thing, and honestly,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.140
 if you look up face mites and you do a website search

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.400
 of new scientists, of national geographic,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.120
 very reputable sources, they all say,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.440
 interesting thing is, they don't have an anus,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.800
 and so what they do is, they store all their fecal waste

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.200
 in their bodies until they reach death,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.220
 which does only happen after a few days,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.660
 and then they just explode it all out,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.500
 and this is why they're bad,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.140
 because they explode feces on your face.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.060
 Now, this isn't true, and what's more,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.540
 we've kind of known this isn't true since the '60s,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.980
 so there was an electron microscope in the '60s

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.700
 that did identify a face mites anus, but--

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.780
 (laughing)

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.820
 - No one believed him.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.360
 - I wonder, would you rather have face mites

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.960
 on your face that had an anus,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.340
 and were constantly pooing on your face,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.200
 or one that only pooed as a one-off at the end of its life?

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.680
 - Well, I think there was an idea, sorry,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.500
 that it's worse to have them storing up all the poo,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.900
 because this is where a lot of the bad rep

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.980
 of the face mite comes from.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.380
 People will put various skin diseases

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.420
 down to face mite infestations,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.540
 and it's partly because they'd say,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.700
 oh, do you know, they build up with poo, so much poo,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.060
 and then it explodes everywhere, and it's not true,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.540
 and actually, we don't really have evidence

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.500
 that they do any harm to us at all.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.100
 - Although, I found one thing that they might be doing to us,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.140
 so they've got no protection from ultraviolet light,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.580
 which is why they have to hide inside the pores,

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.480
 and they can't produce melanin,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.360
 which is related to tanning and so on,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.240
 but they do have the ability to eat our melanin.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.120
 So, human's grin secretes melanin,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.440
 and then they gobble it up.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.800
 - That's good, so basically,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.400
 they get a suntanth through eating,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.200
 as opposed to through sunbathing.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.600
 - Exactly, that's exactly what they do.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.440
 - Oh, that's great.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.280
 Imagine if we could do that.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.660
 It's like a biscuit that tanned us.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.680
 - They're eating our suntanths, don't you find that?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.160
 - Oh, they're eating away our suntanths.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.160
 - I think they're eating our suntanths.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.000
 - That's so interesting.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.200
 - And they're using our suntanths

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.900
 to fuel all night sex sessions on our faces.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.900
 - I know, this is the most amazing fact.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.700
 - This sounds like a Tory party expose.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.060
 (all laughing)

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.140
 - Can I ask about this massive poo?

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.140
 Is it like fake tan coming onto your face?

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.380
 'Cause it's what they've eaten, right?

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.660
 - There is no massive poo.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.500
 It's all small poo.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.700
 - It's all small poo.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.620
 - So, let's just quickly mention

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.020
 something you dropped in a second ago,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.620
 which is the fact that every night,

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.580
 when we go to bed,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.340
 they crawl out of our little pores,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.740
 and they have a big old sex party on our face.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.540
 And this is happening every night

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.440
 on our children, on our grandparents.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.880
 It's happening everywhere.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.880
 - It's quite a cool idea,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.200
 'cause nighttime is when humans often have sex.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.440
 So the idea that when you're having sex,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.440
 it's likely that loads of face mites are also having sex.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.560
 - Oh, so they're not even waiting for you to sleep.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.400
 It's just nighttime.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400
 - I think it's just darkness.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.400
 - Yeah, 'cause they don't--

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.640
 - Away from the UV, isn't it?

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.800
 - Yeah, right.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.800
 But also they find that couples pass each other's mites.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.680
 So, while you're having sex,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.600
 you might pass a mite that's now having sex

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.720
 with another you mite.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.820
 - I think that's quite unusual

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.860
 for you to pass your mites onto another person, actually.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.700
 - Yeah, oh yeah.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.620
 - I think babies normally get them from their mothers.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.780
 - For breastfeeding, yeah.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.500
 - And I think any other way of me giving you one of my mites

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.460
 is quite unlikely.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.300
 - Oh, really?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.860
 - But it is weird, the idea that our face mites

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.180
 are basically our own.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.420
 Because, as you say,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.220
 mostly they come from either vaginal childbirth

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.980
 or breastfeeding because you get face mites hanging around

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.380
 sometimes in the genitals and the nipples.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.880
 And then they don't really change

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.160
 unless you are living face to face with someone,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.000
 like cheek to cheek with someone for years on end.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.560
 Like, my colony is totally different

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.400
 to your guy's colonies this stage, I guess, right?

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.160
 - Yeah, that is amazing.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.280
 So, you'll have got some mites from your mother

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.200
 from breastfeeding, perhaps, or vaginally.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.480
 And then they obviously won't live for your whole life.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.000
 They'll have children,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.360
 and their children will have children,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.000
 and their children will have children.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.840
 - The cycle of life.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.840
 - So, it's a circle of life.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.220
 - Well, it's more like a straight line of life.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.780
 Because by the time you die,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.940
 if you live to an average human age,

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.660
 it will be 1200 generations from the start.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.500
 - Really?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.400
 - Okay, so the ones that are living as you die

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.420
 will be the great, great, great, great, great, great,

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.980
 1200 times from the ones that you got from your mother.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.900
 And that's the equivalent in humans

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.900
 of when rope was invented and ovens were invented

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.340
 and pottery were invented.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.340
 - So, why aren't they achieving more by the end of my life?

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.100
 Why haven't they got many laptops on my face?

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.900
 They're working on it.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.560
 - On the sex, face mites, is quite interesting

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.600
 because their penis is on their back.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.000
 So, the male has to sort of get underneath the female

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.400
 to have sex.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.240
 But his--

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.080
 - So, give her a piggyback?

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.440
 - Yeah, like a piggyback.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.600
 And it's really interesting because this is a gene

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.000
 which has changed in the genome called the hox gene.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.220
 And if you, you know the facts which all mammals

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.540
 have got nine neck bones.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.380
 - Yeah.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.580
 - Even a giraffe has got the same number of bones

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.180
 as a shrew or whatever.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.780
 That's because of the hox gene.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.620
 And the hox gene is the thing

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.300
 which tells you where all your body parts grow

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.620
 so that your arms are here and your legs are there

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.620
 and your necks here and all that kind of stuff.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.700
 And really, very, very few animals.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.340
 In fact, this is the first one I've ever seen

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.260
 where they changed the hox gene

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.060
 because it's really a hard thing to change

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.980
 'cause you need all your bits in the right place.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.700
 - So, evolutionarily at some point,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.000
 their gene just changed and now their penis is on their back.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.840
 - Exactly.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.600
 - And are you suggesting that if we harness this power,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.480
 we'll be able to have penises wherever we like?

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.440
 - We could, but then the problem would be

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.280
 that our other body parts would grow in weird places.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.120
 - Okay, so we've got to find a way of isolating it

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.280
 to give each other a very sexy piggyback, yeah.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.480
 - What changed for them when their penis went on their back?

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.120
 - Well, actually, the mice have been in the news

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.100
 in the last few weeks 'cause they've checked the genome

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.060
 and they found that the genome has changed quite a lot

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.100
 and the reason is because they are having sex,

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.960
 but they're having sex with their own cousins

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.980
 and brothers and sisters and stuff like that.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.980
 And what they're finding is that they're changing

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.340
 in the way that I said,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.260
 but also in a way that they're losing lots

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
 of their useful powers, if you know what I mean.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.020
 So, things that could save them from ultraviolet,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.220
 they might have had that in the past,

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.620
 but they're losing it 'cause they don't need it

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.700
 'cause they have such a nice environment in your face.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.000
 - They're basically becoming completely dependent on us.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.980
 They're very clingy.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.820
 It's like having a partner who suddenly,

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.280
 they ditch their whole friendship group,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.720
 they can't even cook for themselves

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.560
 and they're developing a completely symbiotic relationship.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.100
 - They do have a penis on the back though.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.660
 - It is worth it.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.400
 - I think the definition is they're currently

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.580
 classed as external parasites on us,

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.440
 but soon, if this process continues,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.340
 they will be classed as internal symbiotes.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.300
 - Yeah, and also, they might be classed as extinct

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.680
 because if they lose all of these skills to stay alive,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.280
 then it makes it much more difficult

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.500
 when they get passed on to the next generation.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.940
 - They also have a seven-clawed organ around their mouth,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.900
 which when they do eat your sea bum,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.120
 they kind of latch their claws,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.020
 these claws around their mouth into you.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.860
 - Right.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.700
 - Which is quite cool to imagine.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.660
 - Just when I was warming to them a little bit.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.320
 (all laughing)

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.060
 - I love those called sea bum,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.560
 yet we have not seen bum for brilliant of these years.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.500
 - Mmm, how did I not realise that?

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.080
 - So, just mites in general.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.340
 - There are five million different species of mites,

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.420
 I believe, as in everything's got one.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.100
 Humans have their own.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.020
 - At least one.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:45.860
 - At least one.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.980
 Every kind of beetle will have its own mites.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.520
 Every plant, soil, ocean, any mammal.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.500
 - I have a favourite mites,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.620
 which is the Adactolydium.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.300
 This is so amazing, it's a life cycle.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.540
 It's usually found in the Middle East,

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.720
 and they're basically born pregnant,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.180
 and they're born in order to die.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.020
 And so--

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.620
 - Aren't we all, aren't we all?

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.440
 - It's like human lifespan, but very, very fast.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.220
 So, basically, you've got the mother,

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.400
 and she only ever eats one meal in her whole life,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.240
 and it is always an egg.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.260
 - Hard boiled, or--

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.420
 - An egg, I think it's poached,

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.760
 and it's specifically a poached egg of the Thunderfly,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.480
 or I think in America you call them a thrip.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.200
 And so yeah, it just eats one Thunderfly egg,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.640
 and then she, this keeps her alive,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.780
 and she, Insider, has six to 10 fertilized eggs

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.180
 ready to go, and they hatch Insider.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.700
 So, all her offspring hatch Insider,

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.940
 and it's always one male, and then all the rest are females.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.060
 And then, inside the mother, all of her offspring,

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.660
 you know what's coming, we all know what's coming.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.460
 Obviously, the one brother shags all the sisters--

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.580
 - A mucky pup.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.380
 - Impregnates them all,

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.260
 and then once he's got all the sisters pregnant,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.180
 they eat their way out of the mother.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.500
 - Alpha heaven's sake.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.020
 - So, the mother gets eaten from the inside,

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.360
 and then the kids are born already pregnant, obviously.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.040
 And then I guess they just start again,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.560
 being eaten from the inside by the pregnant kids inside them.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.320
 - There are some animals which are just too different to us

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.840
 for us to have anything in common.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.520
 - Yeah, we wouldn't get along.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.360
 - No.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.120
 - Yeah, nothing to talk about at all.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.900
 - If one of them gained human sentience,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.240
 we just wouldn't like that.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.640
 (laughing)

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.800
 - Is that the dinner party?

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.880
 They start up their children bursting through their chest.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.160
 - At least at the dinner party, all they're eating is an egg.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.000
 - What egg?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.820
 - Are you gonna have that bread?

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.660
 - All right, I'll have that.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.240
 (upbeat music)

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.180
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.220
 and that is Andy.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.660
 - My fact is that a robot version of the Mayflower

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.420
 has just completed a human free void

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.800
 from England to America.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.500
 It went really well, except that it took three goes,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.940
 had to be towed in manually,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.100
 and first hit land 400 miles from where the original landed.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.300
 (laughing)

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.340
 - Still cool.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.820
 - Still cool.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:04.820
 - Still wants for effort.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.960
 - Totally disastrous.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.040
 It was a disaster.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.140
 So this is a ship.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.380
 It was a robot ship.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.220
 It was built by IBM and an organization called Pro Mare.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.460
 I think that's how it's pronounced,

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.920
 'cause it's Mare like the C.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.100
 And it was called the Mayflower Autonomous Ship,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.660
 and it was piloted by AI technology,

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.620
 and apparently the technology worked perfectly.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.660
 But the really funny thing,

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.500
 I just find it funny,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.980
 the original Mayflower voyage in 1620

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.700
 took 10 weeks to get from England to the Americas.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.100
 And this was expected to take three weeks,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.020
 'cause they said this is so fast, it's so efficient,

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.300
 it's so AI, it's amazing.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.300
 And it's first set off in, I think, June 2021,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.060
 and eventually landed in, I think, May or June 2022.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.580
 It took about 60 weeks, basically.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.400
 (laughing)

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.980
 Any time longer than the original Mayflower.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.620
 - But I had to come back and start it again

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.460
 at that point, right?

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.860
 - Yeah, most of those 60 weeks,

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.460
 it was just waiting to try again for a mechanic.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.900
 - In fairness, it was a research thing, right?

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.700
 And in some ways, it's a way to prove

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.380
 that you can do this for research in the future.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.780
 So the idea is that a normal boat, like the Mayflower,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.860
 most of the boat you're using to keep the people alive

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.160
 who are on the boat.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.940
 So you need to keep food, you need to give them shelter,

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.260
 you need all this kind of stuff.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.740
 But if it's an AI boat, you don't need any of that stuff.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.740
 All you need to do is get from A to B.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.480
 And so you have loads of extra space

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.500
 to do loads of experiments and put loads of electronics in

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.020
 and loads of scanners and all that kind of stuff.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.900
 And in that respect, I think it was something of a success.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.820
 They managed to get quite a lot of data out of it.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.100
 - Oh yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.180
 And the whole thing is, what a cool idea as well.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.700
 Like, yeah, it took a bit longer,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.900
 it landed in the wrong spot.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.460
 Sure, my factory's not.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.300
 - Broke down a lot.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.740
 - Broke down a lot, cause nightmares,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.060
 but the boat has got--

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:54.900
 - Absolute mess.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.740
 - Absolute mess.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.580
 - Called pro mess.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.420
 - Oh, there we go.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.260
 - Sorry.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.380
 (laughing)

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.900
 - But it's got a great website as well, should say.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.340
 - Well, it did crash three times.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.380
 And then you ended up on bbc.co.uk.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.260
 - The boat itself had microphones on the hull

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.660
 with the part of the research capacity.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.500
 So it was listening for whales as it traveled.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.500
 And it also has a smart tongue.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.700
 It had a tongue on the bottom.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.820
 - That sounds like someone's Tinder profile.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.660
 Or--

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.500
 - I got a smart tongue.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.340
 - No, that's too rude, isn't it?

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.740
 - No, it sounds more like a mites penis.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.700
 - It's sort of migrated from the wrong side

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.180
 to sort of under the keel.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.700
 - It was recording the chemical composition of the ocean.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.820
 So I think in that sense it wasn't the right place.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.660
 - Right.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.980
 (laughing)

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.980
 So before we invented the stove,

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.620
 there used to be sailors who would have to lay

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.580
 at the bottom of the boat

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.540
 (laughing)

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.780
 with their tongue out through a hole.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.620
 - Scratch on.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.180
 (laughing)

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.420
 Still salty, I would say.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.740
 - We're not in the river yet.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.580
 (laughing)

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.660
 - I think it seemed like the conclusion of this voyage was,

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.380
 AI works quite well,

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.260
 but it turns out humans still don't know how to make boats.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.100
 Right?

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.940
 - I think that's boats to call.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:01.780
 - Boats break down all the time.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.620
 - Boats break hard, yeah.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.700
 - Boats really crap, they're always breaking.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.140
 And this seems to be a problem with AI generally,

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.740
 is that it can work very well,

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.220
 but if stuff goes wrong around it, it can't fix it.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.900
 And it made me think next time I go on a ferry,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.340
 I'll have new fan respect for the people

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.620
 I think are doing nothing.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.300
 'Cause stuff just, stuff just breaks all the time.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.460
 - So you'll stop telling them.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.660
 - I'll stop saying.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.340
 - Name and shame these people who you think are doing nothing.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.540
 - Are you talking about the people manning like the kiosk

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.140
 for snacks, 'cause they're doing an important job,

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.460
 keeping the people out of their lives.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.300
 - Like health and safety officers.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.700
 - They're crucial, the health and safety guys,

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.260
 the mechanics aren't necessary.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.940
 - The guys in the car parking bit who are saying,

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.180
 no, bring it in, left, left, left, left, left, left.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.940
 - No, no, that's my left.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.060
 - They're doing a really important thing.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.620
 - Reverse, reverse, oh, it's in.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.380
 - Those are some of the most skilled people on the planet,

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.220
 I would say.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.060
 - Do you know what?

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:45.900
 - People who can fill a ferry.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.820
 - That bit of the ferry where you drive into,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.700
 is one of my favorite smells.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.100
 - Oh, that oil. - It's oily and petrally,

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.340
 and it smells like trucks.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.500
 - Yeah. - It's very petrally.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.900
 - I really like that smell anyway,

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.460
 but it reminds me of holidays as a child and stuff.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.300
 - As a result of that smell,

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.500
 the guys who were doing the car parking,

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.260
 they're as high as cars for the whole time.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.660
 Like they're in an altered consciousness

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.300
 where they can see Tetris.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.220
 - That's what the thing is,

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.100
 I thought I'd run over this guy,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.420
 but it turned out he had his tongue

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.420
 through a hole in the water.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.540
 (laughing)

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.060
 - Did you guys see the picture of the robot Mayflower

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.580
 when it was pulling in?

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.420
 - Yeah.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.220
 - When it finally landed at Plymouth,

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.140
 which it did eventually.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.900
 So it left from Plymouth, as the original Mayflower did.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.740
 - England Plymouth.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.420
 - England Plymouth, England, yep.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.100
 And then it ended up accidentally somewhere in Canada

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.420
 where Halifax. - Halifax.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.300
 - But then it did get to Plymouth in the end,

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.620
 but it looks so pathetic,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.740
 because it pulls in next to the Mayflower 2,

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.340
 which is the exact replica of the Mayflower

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.500
 that was built in the 1950s, which I didn't know about,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.860
 but that's obviously stunning.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.540
 It's got all this stuff, like, you know,

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.660
 it's all got all the rigging, it's like triple-masted,

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.300
 and then it's got this crappy,

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.060
 it's like a cat moran, really, isn't it?

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.900
 - It is. - It's a trimoran.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.980
 Outrigger, tiny thing, looks like Thunderbird 3, I thought.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.220
 - Yeah, they didn't make much of an effort, yeah.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.140
 - I think there was a suggestion before they made it

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.980
 that, oh, should we make another replica

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.300
 of the Mayflower and send it across?

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.620
 And then they decided, no, let's try and do something

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.020
 for the next few centuries.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.780
 You know, that's looking to the past

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.340
 if we did that, another replica.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.740
 So I think it is a really, it's a brilliant project,

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.980
 and you know, well done, everyone involved.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.180
 - It is really cool. - Yeah, it is really cool.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.300
 - The Mayflower 2, when that originally went out

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.940
 in the '50s, they had problems as well on the way,

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.260
 and they had to divert, and during the diversion,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.660
 they went across Bermuda, and they almost sank

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.700
 in the Bermuda ocean. - Really?

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.580
 - So it could have been a Bermuda triangle casualty,

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.540
 but they didn't, and so it's not a good story.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.100
 - How almost are we talking?

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.500
 - Oh, they just had, yeah, they had a bit of trouble.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.140
 - Like, they had to bucket out a bit of water.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.700
 - No, there was a big storm, and so it was, you know,

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.580
 you could go.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.260
 - Oh, yes, there was, wasn't there?

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.080
 - Yeah.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.100
 - That journey, it was in, it was in 1957, they went,

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.180
 and it was this entrepreneur called Warwick Charlton,

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.460
 was a great name, and he was full of crazy schemes,

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.500
 I guess, all through his life, and he wanted to thank

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.540
 the Americans for their help during the Second World War,

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.860
 so he said, let's build another version of the Mayflower,

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:03.700
 and sail it across.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.060
 And they did it in quite an authentic way,

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.700
 so they had one radio only.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.300
 That was the only concession to modernity, I guess.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.340
 You know, they had no radar, they had no supplies dropped in,

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.220
 they wore pilgrim outfits on Sundays.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.580
 - On their journey. - Just on Sunday, isn't it?

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.420
 - Yeah, just on Sunday.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.180
 Yeah, they didn't want to do the whole thing as a cosplay.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.020
 - Yeah.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.940
 - And then, after it was arrived,

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.500
 it was officially welcomed by Richard Nixon.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.740
 - Oh, that sounds so frustrating,

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.740
 recreating it like hand forging the individual nails

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.820
 with which they make it, hand sewing the canvas sails,

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.820
 'cause that's how they did it.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.140
 They must have thought at some points,

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.540
 is this, what the fuck's the point in this?

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.580
 And apparently, according to the Wikipedia page,

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.060
 and this is taken from a pamphlet

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.940
 that's issued by the Plymouth Museum in Massachusetts,

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.980
 which is where it is now.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.460
 When they built this replica in England,

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.460
 they employed the skills of elderly, traditional workmen

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.620
 so that they could build a vessel

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.900
 that reflected the original.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.220
 - How old were they?

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.220
 - That's interesting.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.060
 You look like you're alive in 16, 20.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.980
 (laughing)

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.820
 - And do you know the one difference between the,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.300
 it's not the one difference, there are others,

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.220
 but a difference between the Mayflower Original

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.060
 and Mayflower Two.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.020
 - Oh, toilet facilities, I would guess.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.420
 - Oh, that's a good one.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.260
 - Yeah.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.100
 - Would you?

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.460
 I bet the toilets weren't that much more up to date.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.060
 - Electricity.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.620
 - No, although that, I think there was a little bit

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.060
 of electricity on the top of my mind.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.780
 - To power the radio, which I'm going to say is the other.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.380
 - So there were lots of differences.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.260
 One of them was, no women allowed on Mayflower Two.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.580
 - Oh, really?

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.700
 - Yeah, that feels a bit regressive.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.540
 - Well, I'm not--

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.380
 - No, not allowed?

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.540
 - Not allowed, wasn't.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.940
 Not allowed because the captain,

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.140
 who's a guy called Alan Villiers.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.460
 - Bad luck, maybe.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.260
 'Cause they used to be thought that women on boats

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.100
 was bad luck, wasn't it?

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.940
 - Yeah.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.860
 - Sort of, he basically said that we won't be

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.700
 having any women because there's no place for,

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.180
 this is 1957, but there's no place for glamour pusses.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.980
 And he said, "Look, the reason women came--"

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.820
 - Llamour pusses?

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.660
 - The women.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.220
 - Was the original Mayflower absolutely stuffed

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.340
 with, you know, Raquel Welch and a fur bikini?

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.140
 - Yeah, and that's why it ended up so badly

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.140
 when they arrived at the other end.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.420
 They were all shagged out.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.940
 No, he said the reason the Mayflower original worked,

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.100
 and they had women on board and it was fine,

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.300
 was because back in those days, women were chattels,

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.140
 you know, you just owned them.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.300
 And they're not now.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.460
 They talk back and you can't handle them.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.780
 No, no women.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.620
 - Wow, Alan.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.580
 So there were thousands of women who applied

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.660
 to help sail the boat over,

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.780
 and they were not able to go on the trip.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.140
 But aside from that, it was a really great mission.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.980
 - I found it amazing on the original Mayflower

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.580
 that you had three women who were pregnant

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.140
 and knew that they would have a baby on the boat.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.660
 - Yeah, which I think that's hardcore, isn't it?

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.820
 'Cause you know how long it's gonna take.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.820
 It's gonna take you six months to get there.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.580
 You're less than six months pregnant,

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.100
 or less than six months to go.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.420
 Would you do that?

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.940
 - I don't know, medical facilities were so shit.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.300
 I think the further away you can get from them

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.620
 in those days, the better.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.660
 - Middle of the sea is better than anywhere else, yeah.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.940
 - Really interesting, 'cause you might,

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.700
 were any of the babies born on the new continent,

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.940
 or were they all born on board?

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.260
 - There was one that was born when the ship was anchored,

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.500
 I think, in Cape Cod.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.060
 So they called him like the first baby in North America,

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.500
 ignoring thousands and thousands of years.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.740
 - Waiting for them on shore.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:07.580
 - Hey!

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.220
 - But yeah.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.740
 You would've thought that they might've said to the mother,

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.580
 if you just hold on a little bit longer,

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.100
 this'll be the first pilgrim baby born actually on.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.140
 - Exactly, a bit like how we tried to have our cesarean

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.820
 on the 22nd of the 2nd, 2022.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.660
 - Yes.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.500
 - How'd that work out?

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.980
 - When you say we, you mean you and your wife, not you.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.020
 - You and I, I was looking at you dead in the eye

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.980
 when I said that, Andy.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.980
 Yeah, not me and my wife, yeah.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.140
 - Doesn't always work out, does it?

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:32.980
 - I'm afraid not.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.780
 - But then, much like, I think you, you know,

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.420
 named your child partly after the day they were born,

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.940
 one of the children who was born on the Mayflower

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.220
 was called Oceania, I think.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.060
 - Oh, cool.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:43.900
 - Oh.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.740
 - That is a cool name.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.900
 - After the Oceania. - That's a brilliant name.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.740
 - Yeah.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.060
 - Better than 14th of February that we called ours.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.300
 (laughing)

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.260
 - There's been another Mayflower controversy recently.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.100
 - Okay.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.460
 - In 2019, in Devon, there was this group

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.260
 which announced that they were planning to build

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.940
 a 400th anniversary Mayflower, so in 1620, 2020,

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.620
 and then they were gonna set it on fire.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.460
 - Oh yes.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.400
 - And this prompted a row in America,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.500
 people saying it's very disrespectful.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.340
 - I can see why.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.460
 - Yeah, yeah, you know, but it wasn't intended

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.420
 as a disrespectful move at all.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.020
 It was this group in Devon who I want to go and meet.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.940
 They're called the Great Torrington Cavaliers,

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.580
 and every five years, they build a big old structure

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.420
 and then set fire to it.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.260
 - Right.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.180
 - They've done it with loads of different things,

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.580
 and it's just their way of raising money for charity.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.780
 - Yeah, I saw a photo of it, 'cause they did do it in the end.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.180
 They did light it up, and yeah.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.060
 - And it had knitted rats.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.820
 They had a ye olde one-stop knob shop on board,

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.320
 which I am pretty sure was an original feature

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.160
 of the Mayflower.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.220
 - One-stop knob shop.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.120
 - One-stop knob shop, what's that mean?

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:45.960
 - I don't know.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.800
 - What kind of knobs is it?

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.640
 Door knobs?

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.460
 - I imagine door knobs.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.520
 - No, it'll be old knobs, 'cause it's only one stop.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.300
 So for all your knob needs.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.880
 (laughing)

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.680
 I'd like to buy a packet of hub knobs, a door knob.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.020
 - And Piers Morgan there in the corner.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.280
 (laughing)

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.360
 - Anyway, they set it on fire.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.200
 - That was very cool.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.440
 - Another controversial one was the town of Horwich,

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.280
 which is where the Mayflower was originally constructed.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.280
 So this is an Essex.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.080
 They wanted to build a replica Mayflower

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.280
 and send it across again.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.560
 So this was in 2009.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.960
 They had a town meeting.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.400
 They said, "How do we commemorate

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.560
 "this big 400th anniversary?"

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.540
 Someone said, "Why don't we put up some bunting?"

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.380
 (laughing)

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.460
 And then another person, a dentist called Tom Daley,

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.420
 said, "Why don't we rebuild the Mayflower

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.800
 "and we send it across?"

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.060
 And so they all agreed to it.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.960
 And they started raising money for it.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.280
 And it sounds like it was quite a doomed project

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.600
 from the get-go because first off,

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.360
 they needed to build a shipyard,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.240
 which they didn't have in order to build the ship.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.720
 And so that took up a lot of funds.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.440
 They raised millions and millions

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.080
 in order to get this done.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.720
 They hired lots of interns to come and build the ship,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.720
 but they had no training.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.440
 So I think they went through hundreds and hundreds

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.800
 of these interns that just didn't know

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.640
 what they were doing.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.160
 - Meanwhile, the guy suggested putting up some buntings,

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.400
 just watching the whole thing going.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.300
 - I told them, I told them.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.140
 - So what happened?

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.740
 - Well, they just kept trying to,

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.100
 they were investing the money that they kept bringing in.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.380
 They kept building up more money

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.780
 and people were doing things like sponsoring ship bolts

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.460
 so that they could have their own ship bolts on the ship

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.300
 and so on.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.020
 And eventually they just ran out of money.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.900
 - So how much of the ship did they build?

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.620
 - I think they did the keel and like the bow

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.780
 and then that was it.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.220
 And then obviously all these people

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.380
 that had these plans anyway for the big anniversary

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.820
 couldn't do anything about it

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:31.660
 'cause COVID hit.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:35.260
 And so all these plans got put into the back seat.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.400
 So even if they had their ship

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.380
 it might not even, even gone at that point.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.220
 - Oh, that's quite good.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.760
 I feel like COVID conveniently disappeared

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.980
 a lot of doomed projects.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.080
 You could just say, well, then COVID, you know,

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.200
 also if that was a completely stupid idea in the first place.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.780
 (upbeat music)

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:56.720
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three, that is James.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.400
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.360
 when the first four minute Myla, Roger Bannister,

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.100
 met his future wife Myra, she knew he was a runner

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.940
 but thought he'd run four miles in one minute.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.380
 Many years later, their grandson bragged to his friends

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.740
 that his grandfather could run one mile in under four seconds.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.540
 - This is like the Dan process of telling anecdote.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.480
 It's exaggerated beyond plausibility.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.160
 - I should let you know, I am his grandson.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.580
 - Holding that back for years.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.020
 - Yeah, so this is Roger Bannister.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.000
 - And it's very stupid wife apparently.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.160
 (laughing)

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.160
 Come on Myra, you've run before.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.300
 - Four miles in one minute, that's pretty fast.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.140
 - That's silly.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.880
 - So Bannister was a medic as well as a runner,

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.200
 wasn't he?

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.700
 He became Sir Roger Bannister as well

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.680
 because of the load of work that he did

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.760
 for the sports council.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.340
 So he wasn't just a fast runner,

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.880
 he was an all round guy.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.280
 I find it amazing that he wasn't even a fast runner

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.000
 after the age of, I think it was 25 when he quit.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.200
 He just gave up, he said he wouldn't be taken seriously

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.840
 as a doctor, he wanted to be a neurologist

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.920
 and that's exactly what he became.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.520
 And the running he just completely left to one side.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.680
 - He said that it was only a small section of his life

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.680
 and if he had to give one or the other up,

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.360
 he would definitely have given running up

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.760
 and would have carried on being a medic

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.600
 'cause that was his main part of his life.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.440
 - It's amazing.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.280
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.400
 - It's quite striking if you read any interview

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.920
 with Roger Bannister.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.040
 - The pretty much the first thing he'll say is,

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.600
 I hate it how everyone bangs on about my running.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.800
 I don't even care about that.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.000
 All I wanna be known for is being a doctor.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.440
 - Yeah, I should have just run a bit slower, shouldn't he?

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.040
 - Yeah, that's pretty right.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.880
 (laughing)

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.720
 - We wouldn't have been talking about him.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.000
 - Just had a few seconds on

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.880
 and you'd be a complete footnote in his room.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.720
 (laughing)

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.560
 - Nobody would care.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.520
 - So this happened in Oxford at a place called Ifley Road

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.360
 and he was--

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.640
 - So that's his four minute mile.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.760
 - That's his four minute mile that he ran

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.680
 and the track that he ran it on

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.360
 was actually built partially by him

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.520
 when he was at university.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.040
 He helped lay that track down.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.360
 Yeah, when he did it--

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.880
 - Seems like a bit of a swiss.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.920
 - It does, doesn't it?

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.080
 It feels like something's going on.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:05.920
 - What do you think he's done?

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.320
 Made it very slippery or something.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.920
 - Yeah, let it downhill part of it.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.880
 - Yeah, a little spring.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.720
 (laughing)

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.840
 Lobs him forward.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.920
 But yeah, so he did this

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.040
 and it was an amazing thing

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.880
 that you can actually watch footage of online,

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.040
 which is pretty incredible.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.600
 And they talk a lot about his legs,

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.880
 which are very kind of weirdly spindly

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.440
 and the sort of big strides that he takes

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.440
 are really interesting.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.200
 And you can see how knackered he is coming into the end

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.040
 as he does it.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.720
 In fact, there's a whole crowd waiting for him

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.040
 as he comes right into the end

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.280
 and he basically collapses into someone's arms

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.960
 as if they knew that was gonna happen.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.280
 They're waiting there to capture him.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.680
 And then they all stood around to hear had he done it

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.640
 and there was an official announcement

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.600
 and the announcer went the time was three

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.000
 and then there was huge eruption

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 because that's what they needed to hear.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.840
 - Yeah, it was in McWherter.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.040
 - It was, it was Norris McWherter,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.720
 the founder of the Guinness World Records

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.960
 along with Hugh Beaver.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.280
 - Apparently we're in a pantomime.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.360
 (laughing)

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.240
 - Norris McWherter is a very pantomime as well.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.440
 - And he nearly didn't do it.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.280
 That morning he said he spent,

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.680
 'cause he was training to be a doctor at the time.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.880
 I think he was a junior doctor, a medical student.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.480
 And he, that morning was working

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.000
 and said it was really, really windy.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.960
 And it was only at the last minute,

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.800
 I think his friend about half an hour before said,

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.000
 "No, you gotta do it, Rog, come on."

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.840
 - And the wind went, that was the other thing.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.680
 - Oh, did it?

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.440
 - Yeah, so he went and he went, "Let's do it."

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.680
 But he did it in three minutes, 59.4 seconds.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.640
 So we've really taken it to the just under four minutes.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.080
 - In actual fact, I said he was the first four-minute miler,

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.280
 I should have said under four-minute miles, right?

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.040
 He didn't do it in exactly four minutes.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.120
 But there was someone a few years later,

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.400
 Derek Ibbotson, who in a mile race at White City

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.480
 ran in exactly four minutes and zero seconds.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.960
 So he became the first person

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.880
 to do an exact four-minute mile.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.440
 - Would that still have been as exciting to break the record

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.360
 or is the point that it has to be under four minutes?

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.240
 - Yeah, it just had to be under four minutes.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.440
 It was this invisible barrier that people thought

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.880
 that humans would never be able to get under.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.920
 But yeah, we got under it.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.960
 So getting four minutes, actually,

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.560
 if Ibbotson had done that four-minute mile,

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.640
 arguably he wouldn't have become famous

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.960
 'cause he hadn't beaten the four-minute mile.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.320
 - Yes, yeah.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.000
 And it's pretty, again, when you watch the footage,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.560
 I do wonder it's the '50s here that we're talking about.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.120
 What sort of accuracy are we talking about

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:23.960
 with the stopwatch?

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.480
 'Cause it was so crowded.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.320
 What did they have?

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.400
 It was a stopwatch, presumably.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.640
 - Yeah, I guess I would have imagined it was a stopwatch.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.960
 - I think that as well.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.800
 I was in quiz.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.400
 We accept this so blindly.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.040
 It's just all Norris sitting there jamming his thumb.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.520
 - Yeah, doubting.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.800
 Norris McWhorke.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.120
 - Good call.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.960
 - The first woman to run a five-minute mile, Diane Leather,

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.880
 it was only 23 days after Bannister's record,

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.320
 but didn't get any of the...

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.600
 - Diane Leather's a very good name.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.680
 - Run Hell for Leather.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.520
 - Okay.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.520
 - Yeah, that is good.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.200
 - By those days, basically women

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.160
 weren't really supposed to run middle distance running.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.080
 It was thought to be deleterous to their health.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.640
 - Was long distance running allowed?

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.200
 - Yeah, they were only allowed to run over 100 miles

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.640
 or under 100 meters.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.800
 (all laughing)

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.440
 - Yeah, the IAF just banned them

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.520
 for running anything more than, I think, 800 meters.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.880
 - I think we might have said,

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.520
 did we say once in an earlier episode

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.320
 about there was an 800 meter race in the '20s

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.200
 or something where all the women collapsed?

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.640
 - Collapsed, yeah, we've talked about that.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.040
 And so that put them off.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.320
 Just 'cause everyone collapses.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.160
 They collapse in the way

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.960
 that everyone at the end of a long distance race,

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.120
 like if you've ever seen Mo Farah or someone

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.320
 get to the end of a race,

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.840
 they fall onto the nearest person.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.680
 - Absolutely.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.520
 - They very often do.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.080
 And so these women kind of did some of them.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.400
 - The IAF, we should say who they are,

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.640
 the International Amateur Athletics Federation.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.480
 'Cause they did exercise quite a lot of power at the time.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.360
 'Cause they still do the IAAF.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.280
 - So Panister was running as an amateur.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.840
 That was part of the point, I think.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.360
 And so after he'd run the four minute mile,

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.640
 obviously incredibly famous,

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.120
 now one of the most famous people in the world, blah, blah,

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.440
 blah, he went to the USA on a kind of diplomatic,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.800
 you know, jolly, glad-handling celebrity trip.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.840
 He was sent by the foreign office.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.520
 But when he got there, the IAAF said

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.720
 that if he was on sponsored TV,

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.760
 that might risk his amateur status.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.000
 And therefore, you know, that would be in big trouble

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.760
 and I don't think he'd lose a record or whatever.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:20.480
 And he was offered a trophy, which was worth 178 pounds.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.560
 But when he was in America,

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.400
 'cause they wanted to reward him somehow.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.440
 And the IAAF said, absolutely not.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.560
 You can accept no gift worth more than 12 pounds

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.440
 as a result of this becoming the most famous program.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.240
 - Yeah, like you couldn't even have expenses

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.080
 to get to places.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:35.920
 - Really?

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.280
 - Yeah, maybe a bit earlier that,

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.200
 but yeah, the amateurism was really important.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.600
 - That was why most of the people

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.360
 who were quite successful runners back in the '50s

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.600
 were quite wealthy white men in Western countries.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.040
 'Cause you couldn't really afford to do anything like that.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:49.880
 - That's true.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.960
 And actually, there is a thought

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.160
 that there were people who were running

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.520
 sub-form minute miles before him,

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.000
 but they weren't Oxford graduates

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.800
 who had all the newspapers and everything like that.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.520
 So for instance, there's a guy called James Parrott,

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.120
 who is a costamonger.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.880
 And he supposedly ran a mile in under four minutes in 1770.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.200
 And there was in 1796 someone called Weller who did the same.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.000
 And the reason that we think it might be true

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 is because they were bets.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.440
 So it was like this costamonger said to his mate,

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.800
 "I bet you 10 pounds that I can run it

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.960
 "under four minute mile."

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.320
 And the other person paid up.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.800
 We know that they paid up.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.760
 So whether they did or not,

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.560
 certainly the person they did the bet with,

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.560
 you know, was happy.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.400
 - I couldn't say that they had, yeah.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.640
 - I didn't know that if we're not trusting

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.000
 Norris McWhorter to stopwatch,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.400
 I don't know if I'm trusting whatever grandfather clock

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.240
 they timed it by.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.240
 - But I'm so clever on these guys

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.880
 'cause I think they're really interesting claims.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.040
 I love the James Parrott one.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.520
 And there was also, soon after him in 1787,

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.120
 there was a runner called Powell,

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.200
 who wagered a thousand guineas,

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.640
 which is a lot of money.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.360
 Today that's nearly 800,000 pounds.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.200
 - Wow.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.960
 - That he could manage a four minute mile run.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.120
 And he claimed to have done it in four minutes '03

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.600
 when he did this time trial.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.400
 It was near Hampton Court in London.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.160
 And it was five days before Christmas.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.240
 And the really interesting detail

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.720
 is that he was naked at the time.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.800
 (laughing)

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.240
 Most serious runners would have been naked when they--

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.720
 - In the 1700s.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.080
 - It was kind of a harking back

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.040
 to ancient Greek athletic culture.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:14.880
 But still.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.720
 - And so what happened?

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.560
 Did he lose the money?

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.240
 - I actually don't know if he lost or won the money.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.080
 I actually apparently didn't decide

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.400
 it was worth writing down whether or not he managed.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.720
 - I did a similar thing.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.400
 The current record for what the four minute mile

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.400
 can be running, I've got all the other details.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.240
 Got the guy's name.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.680
 Just have to bring down what time he did it in.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.320
 So does anyone know the current?

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.160
 - It's about 350.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.000
 - It's about 350.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.840
 - Is that Al-Garouj?

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.320
 - Yes, Al-Garouj.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.480
 - I don't know how much it was.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.360
 I think it would be less than that, wouldn't it?

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.920
 - I think it's 340 something.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.760
 - 340.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.240
 - I know what he'd be banister by in meters.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.680
 As in, if the two of them were racing against each other,

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.440
 how much of a lead he had on him.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.640
 - That's so weird for you to have collected that.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.640
 - Okay, well, tell us about that, Al.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.480
 - Yeah, try and work it out.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.800
 - How many meters was it?

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.600
 - He beat him by 100 meters.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.480
 He would have crossed the line.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.040
 - Okay, well, if you think 10 seconds

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.080
 for a really fast runner to run 100 meters,

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.680
 they would have done it in 15 seconds, something like that.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.080
 So if you take that off four minutes,

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.680
 then that's, you know, 345, 346.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.840
 - You made it a bit complicated

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.840
 by mixing up meters and miles, obviously, but we can work it.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.800
 But just a home, do the calculation yourself.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.520
 - Or just Google HML Gurush and find out, 1999 it was.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.920
 It seems strange that we haven't beaten

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.920
 the world record since then.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.760
 - Yeah, century.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.440
 - Since 1999, a century.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.280
 - This century.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.120
 - Oh, this century.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.960
 (laughing)

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.720
 But yeah, the reason, according to Peter Weyand,

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.560
 who is a Southern Methodist University Professor

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.320
 of Applied Physiology and Biomechanics,

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.120
 he records that the reason it hasn't been beaten

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.320
 is because the next year we started testing for EPO,

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.720
 which is a banned steroid, which kind of gives you--

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.560
 - What year was that, sorry?

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.880
 - '99.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.720
 - Oh.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.140
 - And so the Olympics knew that people were taking EPO,

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.960
 but they didn't have a way of testing for it

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.760
 until a year later.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.360
 And El Gurush, I should say, has denied

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.200
 that he's ever taken any drugs,

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.800
 and he is quite vocal in the anti-drugs kind of campaign

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.160
 in sports, so no suggestion.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.600
 - 'Cause all the other ones go, "Yep, I was definitely on it."

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.440
 (laughing)

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.080
 - But the really interesting thing I think about El Gurush

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.320
 is that he was gonna be a football goalkeeper.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.040
 And as a kid, he was really, really good.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.880
 But his mum stopped him from doing it

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.800
 because he would dive around in the mud,

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.040
 and all of his clothes would get really dirty.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.480
 And so she said, "Oh, well, you know,

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.640
 "I have to clean them all the time.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.760
 "Can you not do something that's a bit less dirty?"

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.560
 And he went, "Okay, I'll be a runner instead."

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.640
 And he became the best miler ever.

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640
 - Wow.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.520
 - Do you know who came up with the first steroid test

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.920
 for athletes?

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.320
 - Is it someone we'll have heard of?

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.160
 - Norris.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.000
 Is it Norris?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.820
 - Yeah, you're really close.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.660
 - David Hartley.

00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:47.500
 - Oh, Hugh Beaver.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.840
 - No, it was a banister, wasn't it?

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.680
 - It was a banister.

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.520
 - Oh!

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.360
 - Yeah.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.560
 It was banister who developed the first steroid test

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.640
 as in 1973, 'cause he was big into, you know,

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.720
 calling out people who took steroids in sports.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.680
 And other stuff he did, other medical stuff he did,

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.960
 since that's all he wants us to know about him,

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.960
 is he was into self-experimenting.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.800
 He was one of those doctors.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.620
 - Oh, really?

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.460
 - Okay.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.300
 - Steroids.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.320
 (laughing)

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.060
 - Yeah, later at the age of 45,

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.400
 he ran out of two minutes.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.940
 (laughing)

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:19.280
 - He, not steroids, with pyrogens, actually.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.120
 - Okay.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.420
 - Which are less fun.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.720
 They are chemicals that induce fever.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.800
 So he wanted to study fever.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.560
 So he injected himself with pyrogens,

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.880
 and then he sat naked in a hot chamber for six hours,

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.040
 which spiked his temperature to very dangerous levels

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.400
 and turned him dark green.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.240
 - Wow.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.080
 - Dark green?

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:35.920
 - Yeah.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.760
 - Do we believe that?

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.520
 - We've got the story of the Accredible Hulk.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.580
 (laughing)

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.520
 - And he said, I wouldn't perhaps recommend it.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.620
 - What, Bruce Banner, stirrer?

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.460
 - We've passed.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.300
 - Oh my god.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.100
 - Oh, we blow this shit wide open.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:47.940
 (laughing)

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.660
 - So long since we blew something wide open.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.880
 I'm so glad about that.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.460
 (laughing)

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.300
 - Wow.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.900
 - Yeah, you'll see in a lot of his papers,

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.420
 he'll refer to the study participant, R.B.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.220
 And it's always him, obviously.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.620
 - You mentioned earlier, Anna,

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:05.620
 that he was quite tricky to interview sometimes,

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.520
 because obviously he had two very different aspects

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.440
 of his life.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.520
 So there was an interview by the Guardian,

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.720
 I think in the early 2000s.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.040
 So he was getting on them,

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.920
 but I just wanted to read you some of the--

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.760
 - Yeah, go for it.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.680
 - Okay, he was asked a few questions.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.760
 Then he said, right, is there anything else

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.800
 you want to know?

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.560
 And the interviewer said, well, I'll be honest, sir.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.580
 Yes, what's your favorite biscuit?

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.560
 Oh, I don't answer questions about biscuits.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.400
 (laughing)

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.320
 Why not?

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.640
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.840
 I'm not into biscuits.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.720
 (laughing)

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.360
 - Now, what is he hiding?

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.400
 That's the question.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.780
 The interviewer says, everybody likes a nice biscuit.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.380
 He says, well, I'm not sure what the purpose

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.740
 of that aspect of the interview is.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.860
 It's quirky, game showy, odd.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.100
 (laughing)

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.260
 All right, fair play to the Guardian interviewer.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.980
 He perseveres.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.300
 Cheese or chocolate?

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.620
 No, no, no.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.220
 All right, I think you've got more than enough there.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.860
 What about pie fillings, steak and kidney

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.280
 or chicken and mushroom?

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.900
 Banister just says, thank you so much.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:36:59.900
 All the best.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:00.740
 (laughing)

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.580
 Ends the interview.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.420
 - That's incredible.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.260
 What year is this?

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.520
 2004 it was.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.360
 - Okay.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.120
 I'm just wondering, is this like the era of like,

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.120
 you know, Dennis Penness and Ali G

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.960
 and everyone's been primed not to answer stupid questions.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.800
 - I think you just hated us.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.360
 - I think that's just the point that's questioned

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.200
 from a journalist.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.520
 In that journalist, I can really imagine doing

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.360
 what that journalist has done,

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.120
 which is not be able to remember anything else

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.200
 that you might have asked him.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.040
 (laughing)

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.400
 I'm just happy to keep going on.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.680
 - Or just quickly looking at, you know,

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.520
 it's going off.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.320
 Fuck, what's your favorite sandwich?

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.160
 (laughing)

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.000
 Would you rather?

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.820
 No, that's not going to work either.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:29.660
 Have you ever?

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:30.500
 No.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.240
 (laughing)

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.580
 I was, I was saying to you guys,

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.860
 bizarrely, my brother helped him write

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.780
 his last autobiography a few years ago,

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.620
 which came out.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.180
 I think it's called "Twinsumthings".

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.340
 And he said he was extremely nice.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.700
 And actually, particularly his wife,

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.580
 my brother absolutely loved Moira.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.860
 And she'd always bring them warm beer

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.220
 and sort of cold cuts for lunch.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.940
 - Any biscuits?

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.140
 - Well, I read through that book

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.840
 and there was no mention of Garibaldi.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.700
 So we went, "What's the matter?"

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:01.900
 - Every time she wore biscuits in,

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.120
 he'd flip the table.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.840
 (laughing)

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.080
 - I saw him once at a,

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.520
 the QI used to have a building in Oxford

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.880
 and he came to one of the parties in a QI.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.580
 - He just ran in, had a drink, ran out.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.420
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.240
 Yeah.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.480
 (laughing)

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.000
 Yeah, but it was kind of like,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.040
 I don't know, in a weird way,

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.280
 because he's someone who's a slightly obscure famous person.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.840
 It was sort of like spotting, you know, like a Bigfoot.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.040
 It was just like, "Wow, like look, a sighting of Bannister."

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:30.880
 Quite exciting.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.040
 - I mean, he didn't like it,

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.560
 but let's say he did like it.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.600
 Would you walk around even in your 80s

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.480
 wearing your shorts and your like-

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.320
 - Tank top thingy.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.040
 - Yeah, tank top thing.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.280
 - Carrying your record, what did he get?

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.120
 - Medal?

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:44.940
 - Must have got a medal or something.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:45.780
 - He was the year before you get

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:46.620
 the Guinness World Records.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.460
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.280
 - Poor guy.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.120
 - So he didn't even have the-

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:49.960
 - Missed it by a year.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.800
 - No proof.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.400
 - Because his record was then broken, wasn't it?

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.680
 46 days later by John Landy, the Aussie.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.200
 And they ended up having an amazing run together,

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.120
 which was part of a race,

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.100
 which was known as the Miracle Mile Race.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.080
 It had a few different names.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.560
 And they went up against each other.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.400
 I mean, how exciting.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.880
 Two guys who had the records

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.960
 trying to see who could beat them.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.220
 - I suppose that does happen

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.120
 in pretty much every race meeting in the world.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.840
 - I suppose, yeah, that's true,

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.320
 because you're always trying to break a record.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.160
 I guess this was-

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.280
 - Very rare, Mo Farrow just racing

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.760
 a bunch of primary school children's sports day.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.600
 Do you know what?

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.040
 You should try racing other good runners.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:26.880
 - Yeah.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.520
 - I think Bannister said his race against Landy

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.640
 was the thing he was really proudest of.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.480
 - Oh, really?

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.920
 - 'Cause it was watched by 40 million people

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.680
 when it was in Vancouver.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.920
 - And listened by a hundred million on the radio,

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.360
 apparently. - Listened to by a hundred million.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.480
 - Bizarrely boring.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.000
 Just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.440
 Is that what you hear when you listen to a race?

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.720
 - Commentary, probably true, it probably be.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.560
 - Commentary.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.680
 - It's not a good commentator

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.960
 if that's what they're saying the whole time.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.840
 Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.680
 So in that race, they were both, you know,

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.320
 neck for neck the entire time.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.240
 And Bannister's behind him.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.080
 And-

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.080
 - That's not what neck for neck.

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:02.920
 - Yeah.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.400
 So he was kind of like putting his neck out,

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.480
 touching the back of it.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.720
 - It's neck and neck, I think.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.560
 - Yeah.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.400
 - Not neck for neck.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.240
 - No, I've never-

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.000
 - And neck for neck and eye for eyes.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.200
 - That's the Bible, yeah.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.000
 I think they were neck and neck, I'm sorry too.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.840
 - No, no, that's fine.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.040
 I would not make a good commentator either.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.480
 - Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.320
 - Yep, they're neck for neck.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.560
 - They were neck and neck in front of one in front of the other.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.400
 Yeah.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:26.960
 - So Bannister's right behind him and he's covered up.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.520
 And on the final corner, Landy looks over left

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.600
 on his shoulder and as he looks over left,

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.240
 Bannister takes over on the right.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.800
 And that was the famous moment where-

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.640
 - He tapped him on the shoulder before he did it.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.680
 (all laughing)

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.200
 - I wanna put a ghost on the running track.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.400
 I think we need to redo it.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.600
 (all laughing)

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.200
 - So that was the big moment.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.240
 And this moment has been-

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.600
 - Then he stole his nose.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.400
 (all laughing)

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.240
 - And then his thumb came off and it was like,

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.080
 "Whoa!"

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.720
 (all laughing)

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.320
 - Anyway, the prize money that Landy got

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.040
 was retrieved from behind his ear actually.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.200
 (all laughing)

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.780
 (upbeat music)

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:10.480
 - Okay, it is time for fact number four.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.560
 And that is my fact.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.160
 My fact this week is that when the movie Ulysses

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.080
 was released in New Zealand in 1967,

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.280
 sensors were so worried about it

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.440
 that men and women weren't allowed to watch it

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.640
 at the same time.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.040
 So they literally had to be placed in different cinemas

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.840
 if they wanted to go and see it.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.320
 And that continued on for years.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.160
 So there was a showing of it at a university

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.760
 in New Zealand in 1972.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.720
 And even then they still had,

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.240
 they allowed men and women in the same room,

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.920
 but they had to sit on either side of the cinema.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.800
 - Okay, so is it because it's so sexy?

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.960
 - It's sexy, it's sweary, it was just debauched city.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.800
 It was-

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.960
 - You see, because I can see if it's sexy

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.240
 that you don't want men and women sat next to each other,

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.080
 right?

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:55.920
 - 'Cause they might have sex with each other.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.360
 - They might, just straight like that, you know.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.280
 That's what happened when I watched.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.440
 Stop on my mom.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.840
 (all laughing)

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.280
 - And you weren't on your own to sit on that movie,

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.000
 so that poor person next to you.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.560
 - I could see half way through that sense

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.640
 as that was going the other way.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.200
 But then like if it was a sweary part of it,

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.520
 it doesn't make sense if they're in the same room, right?

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.680
 - No, it was a mixture of the sexiness and of the swearing.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.280
 And in the room, there was a rope

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.800
 that went down the center of the audience.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.400
 And so you had the men and women still,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.920
 there was one row, like one line down the center

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.880
 where men and women could have had sex with a rope.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.160
 - Well, just like the rope was sort of,

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.840
 there was no aisle between them.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.160
 They were literally in a seat next to someone, yeah.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.320
 - If there's just a piece of rope in between you

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.440
 and a person, you can still have sex with them.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.800
 - It's a pretty weak barrier to ardor, I would say.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.400
 - Yeah, I got this fact, by the way,

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.040
 from a brilliant book called "The Land Before Avocado"

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.320
 and it's by a guy called Richard Glover,

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.640
 who I've met in Australia when we were on tour there.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.560
 He actually, I went on his radio show.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.720
 So he's a big journalist and broadcaster.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.640
 He's written a bunch of books.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.760
 - What's the title referring to?

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.040
 - Well, avocado is absolutely abundant in Australia

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.880
 as a breakfast item.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.880
 And he's talking about the old Australia.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.720
 So avocado is sort of the new world of Australia.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.560
 - Got it.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.400
 - And the book is all about all the olden days

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.480
 and how things used to be.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.280
 And Ulysses was actually banned in Australia,

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.760
 which is where it comes up, the book as well as the movie.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.960
 - So this is James Joyce's "Ulysses", I should say.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.840
 - Yeah, James Joyce's, you haven't read the book,

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.180
 now don't see the film.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.400
 (all laughing)

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.640
 But yeah, so he mentions that it was allowed in New Zealand,

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.960
 but then they had this segregation thing

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.080
 between the men and the women.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:34.920
 - Very funny.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.400
 - And you said that it was the film as well, wasn't it?

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.240
 There was one in Australia and South Africa, I think.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.200
 - Quite a lot of places, there was a band in Ireland.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.360
 - Yeah.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.600
 - The band in Ireland was only lifted in the year 2000.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.440
 - Yeah.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.840
 - That was a long band.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.720
 And I think Ireland's justice secretary

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.280
 sent his secretary to go and see the movie

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.920
 and reported back that if this film was allowed,

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.240
 it would discredit the Irish government,

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.460
 so it can't be permitted.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.300
 - Yeah.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.140
 - It was the first film shown in Britain

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:00.360
 to feature the F-word.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.200
 - Ooh.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.040
 - Ooh.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:02.880
 - Spicy.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.720
 - Yeah.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.560
 - It's really interesting.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.360
 It was made by a guy called Joseph Strick

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.520
 and he was a massive fan of the book.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.760
 So his initial pitch for making the movie

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.440
 was he wanted to do it verbatim,

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.520
 so it was gonna be 18 hours long.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.520
 He wanted every bit of dialogue

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.840
 that was in the book.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:17.680
 - Marley, Marley.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.520
 - Got talked out of it,

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.320
 so it eventually ended up being two hours long.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.400
 But then when it came out,

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.400
 he was very angry about the response of all these bannings

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.220
 in the way that people were treating the film.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.600
 And there was one famous incident

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.960
 where they showed the movie in Cannes

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.240
 at the film festival.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.220
 And this was at the 1967 one.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.340
 It had French titles along the bottom.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:36.960
 And during the film,

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.740
 where it got to a particularly spicy bit,

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.040
 they had, using their hands,

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.800
 scribbled out the translation

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.920
 in French subtitle of what was being said.

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.960
 So Strick saw this,

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.720
 thought, you're messing with my movie.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.800
 Ran up, ran to the projection booth,

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.760
 where he was met by the committee of the film festival

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.080
 who knew that he'd rush in there.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.560
 And then he was forcibly ejected, according to him.

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.920
 He said he was pushed down the steps

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.520
 and suffered a broken foot.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.960
 And so he withdrew the film from Cannes altogether.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.360
 - The reason that he loved the book

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:12.360
 is that his father had smuggled a copy into America

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.760
 because it was illegal in lots of countries

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.000
 at the start of the 20th century.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.400
 And his father smuggled this copy into America

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.720
 and would just keep it in the house

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.800
 and leave it on the table

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.280
 so that whenever anyone came around,

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.440
 they would say, oh, that's that dirty book, isn't it?

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.280
 Like Ulysses.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.140
 And then like, even though no one had read it,

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:31.400
 they would still argue about it,

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.080
 about censorship and stuff like that.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.160
 - Yeah, well, it was really,

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.680
 so I think 1920, the very early 20s,

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.760
 it was published, '23, I think.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.800
 And it was, you know, it was printed.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.720
 It was, 'cause he wrote it in '18, didn't he?

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.720
 And it was serialized,

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.360
 but maybe it was published in Britain in '23, do you mean?

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.520
 - Well, 500 copies were burnt at Folkstone in 1923.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.640
 So I think that was an attempt to import it.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.280
 - It was published in France in 1922.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.240
 That was in Paris by an American woman called Sylvia Beach.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.200
 She opened a shop and she had these copies of Ulysses

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.200
 that she managed to get.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.760
 And she sold them for 10 times more

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.040
 than any other book in the shop

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.240
 'cause she knew that everyone would want to get

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.760
 the hands on this book.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.160
 But still they managed to get them,

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.640
 still they paid for them.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.240
 And she removed the copy from the store window

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.320
 'cause she thought that people would start throwing bricks

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.640
 in her store and stuff like that.

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.440
 - Still none of the buyers ever read it.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.920
 I think we can guarantee all of these places,

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.760
 all of these people.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.600
 - Beach was really brave.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.320
 So the book was sued in New York

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.960
 by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice,

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.800
 and it was convicted for being obscene.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.640
 - They were fun people.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.000
 - Yeah, but then after that,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.240
 Beach published it in Paris.

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.400
 And part of the reason it was controversial

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.880
 was when it was printed in extract in the USA,

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.480
 even the printers themselves said,

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.600
 this is outrageous, we're not working on this.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.280
 And then when she was in Paris,

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.440
 French printers were obviously harder to offend

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.440
 with English filth

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.760
 because they don't understand the language

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.680
 that they're printing in.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.080
 - And that'd be French, like Madame Bovary.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.880
 - Web it through, web it through, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:00.920
 They're used to this sort of.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.440
 - Madame Bovary's not that sexy.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.280
 - Are you joking?

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.440
 - There's some shit in a carriage.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.960
 Come on, it's much more subtle

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.520
 than what Ulysses sounds like.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.600
 - Pretty raunchy stuff, Madame Bovary.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.920
 - Okay.

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.880
 - Andi's Bar is quite different to you.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.800
 - I'm still lobbying to ban Madame Bovary.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.120
 (all laughing)

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.440
 - But so, Norsica was the chapter in America

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.800
 that was seen from Ulysses.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.800
 So they were publishing these extracts.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.480
 And in the chapter that suddenly raised the concern,

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.680
 Leopold Bloom, one of the lead characters of the book,

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.760
 Ulysses. - He's the lead, I think.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.600
 - He leads the main guy.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.200
 - He's not sharing it with many people.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.840
 Maybe Molly.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.800
 - Yeah, I was thinking Molly.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.300
 So it's a scene in this chapter

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.280
 where he's masturbating on a beach

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:44.080
 while gazing at a 17-year-old girl called Goethe McDowell.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.080
 And that's what they took exception to.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.960
 Do they have scenes like that in Madame Bovary?

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.380
 - It's not quite that much, is it?

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.220
 - I don't remember.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.560
 - Or in fact, another scene.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.520
 And this is just saving anyone the trouble

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.360
 of actually reading it

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.200
 'cause we're just telling you

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.880
 the couple of fun bits, so you don't have to bother.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.560
 But apparently there's one scene in a, I haven't read it.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.320
 There's one scene in a Dublin brothel

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.880
 where Leopold Bloom transforms into a woman

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.180
 and then gives birth to octoplets

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:09.620
 before the brothel, Madame,

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.500
 who then turns into a man

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.940
 and starts auctioning off blooms

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:16.340
 like prostitution services and demonstrates.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.540
 So Bloom's now a woman with a vagina.

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.780
 And so the brothel, Madame,

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.400
 demonstrates how good a prostitute that he'd make

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.820
 by shoving her arm up his vagina.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:25.660
 - Yeah, okay.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.660
 - Also doesn't happen.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.060
 Oh, it shoves her arm up the vagina

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.740
 and then shoves it into the bidder's face

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.180
 to be like, look, how good is that?

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.180
 - There's another line.

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:36.460
 I actually started reading Ulysses at the start of the year

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.460
 when my daughter was born

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.140
 and I had a lot of time in the middle of the night

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:41.980
 sat there with nothing else to do.

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.300
 And I got through quite, no, not much of it,

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.220
 but then I started listening to the audio book,

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:48.700
 the RTE version, which actually I got through most of.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.140
 I didn't get through to the end.

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.780
 And it gets really racy at the end.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:53.740
 So I'm a bit gutted that I haven't got there yet.

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:54.800
 But anyway, there was this line,

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.260
 and I did tweet this at the time,

00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:00.660
 which is, "Haines helped himself and snapped the case too.

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:02.740
 He put it back in his side pocket

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.780
 and took from his waistcoat pocket

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:08.060
 a nickel tinder box, sprang it open too,

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.220
 and having lit his cigarette,

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.260
 held the flaming spunk towards Stephen

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.940
 in the shell of his hands."

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.220
 - What?

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.060
 - And so that's-

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.580
 - Sorry, when did the spunk come in before that move?

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.260
 - The reason is that the word spunk

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.220
 just doesn't mean what it means today.

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.060
 - Oh, really?

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.220
 - It meant like a little bit of flame

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.620
 or a little bit of, you know,

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.260
 if you like to match a little bit of flame

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.500
 sort of flies away.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.980
 That used to be called a spunk.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:33.820
 - Oh, okay.

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.780
 - Flaming spunk.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.820
 - I guess it is a sort of fly away thing.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:38.860
 It flies off and away.

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:39.700
 - Yeah.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:43.300
 - I'm sure there's some etymological reason, golly.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.860
 - Do you know the day Ulysses was set,

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:49.300
 which is famously one day, June the 16th, 1904,

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:52.100
 is the day that James Joyce first got a handjob

00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.420
 from his wife.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.260
 - Is it?

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.100
 - Yeah.

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:55.940
 - Bloom's day.

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:56.780
 - It's to commemorate that day, exactly.

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:57.620
 - Really?

00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.460
 So that's why it's to commemorate?

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.420
 - Yeah, he said it then.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:01.740
 It was their first date.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:02.940
 Is it to commemorate the first date?

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.340
 Is it to commemorate the handjob?

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:05.260
 Is there a difference?

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.060
 - Is, I don't know, but also Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.220
 married on that day.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.060
 - Did they?

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:10.940
 - In commemoration of Bloom's Day,

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.260
 not the handjob.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.660
 It looked more about when the day was set.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:15.500
 - Yeah.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.660
 - I wonder if she gave him a handjob

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:18.260
 in proper commemoration.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.740
 - You may now kiss the bride,

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:20.780
 and you may now...

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:21.620
 Oh.

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.180
 (laughing)

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.940
 The person who banned the book in the UK,

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.740
 this was in 1922.

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:31.900
 It was the government that banned it,

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.380
 but the person whose idea it was

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:36.260
 was a guy called Sir Archibald Bodkin.

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.460
 And he issued an official opinion

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:40.700
 saying that it was a filthy buck,

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.580
 and it should not be allowed to be imported

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:44.860
 into the country, and the government agreed.

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.620
 And I was reading about Sir Archibald Bodkin.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:51.940
 Apparently he was a man of unwavering Victorian sensibilities.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.180
 This is according to an author, Kevin Birmingham,

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.780
 who was writing about Ulysses.

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:59.260
 They said, "On the rare occasions that he told a body joke,

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.260
 "he drained away the humour by delivering the punchline

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.100
 "with a disapproving glare."

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.220
 (laughing)

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:06.340
 - Why are you looking at me, James?

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.180
 (laughing)

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.180
 I don't know what you're trying to say here.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.020
 - I love that.

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:10.860
 - That's so funny.

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.100
 - I'd love to see his live at the Apollo set.

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.980
 (laughing)

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:17.260
 - Furious when the audience laughs.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.100
 - Shut up.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.500
 - Just on films that are banned.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.340
 - Oh yeah.

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:21.180
 - Oh yeah.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.380
 - The Wikipedia film, which films are banned where,

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.220
 is great.

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:27.220
 So, 'cause it's quite nationally specific in lots of cases.

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:31.420
 So, "Cuba," for example, has banned the films,

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:36.420
 "Red Zone Cuba," "Cuba Crossing," "Red Dawn," "Cuban Love."

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.100
 - Any movie would "Cuba Gooding Jr."

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:40.260
 (laughing)

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.380
 - Without Havana.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:44.620
 And finally, "Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay."

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.100
 (laughing)

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.580
 - Okay, that's understandable.

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:50.060
 - There's one film called "Titanic" from 1943,

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.740
 it's a 1943 Titanic of the original,

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.700
 which was banned by the Nazi government,

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.060
 despite the fact that it had been made

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.780
 by the Nazi propaganda department.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:58.700
 - Oh, I remember that one, yeah.

00:51:58.700 --> 00:51:59.540
 - Yeah.

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.980
 - Why, was it like a practice run

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.180
 to check how well they banned stuff?

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.420
 - I think Goebbels decided it would weaken morale,

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:07.020
 because there was lots of bombing happening

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:07.860
 in Germany at the time.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.900
 And Goebbels decided that, because this film

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.460
 featured a lot of deaths on the Titanic,

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:12.700
 that it would weaken morale in Germany.

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.860
 So, there were some test screenings outside Germany,

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:15.980
 but it was never shown in Germany.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.580
 It was also then obviously banned by the Allies,

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:19.700
 because it was Nazi propaganda.

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.460
 - So, there was basically nowhere this film

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.860
 was allowed to be shown.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:23.780
 - Yeah.

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.380
 - Do you guys do the film "Too Cool for Christmas?"

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:27.220
 - No. - No.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:28.180
 - Not familiar with that.

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:30.980
 - Do you know the film "A Very Cool Christmas?"

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.820
 - No.

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.940
 - Right, well, they're both the same film.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.420
 They're about a girl who wants to go skiing

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.700
 instead of spending Christmas with her parents.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.700
 But in one of them, in "A Very Cool Christmas,"

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.500
 the girl's parents are a female and male

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.860
 heterosexual couple.

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.300
 And in "Too Cool for Christmas,"

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.860
 her parents are two male gay fathers.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:51.700
 - Right, okay.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:54.180
 - And it's exactly the same.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.220
 But the films are exactly the same as each other.

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.900
 They just re-filmed every single scene involving the parents,

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.220
 which I imagine is quite a lot of scenes.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.340
 - And they just show them in different parts of America.

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.380
 - Or different parts of the world.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.580
 - That was pretty much exactly it.

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.300
 It was for America, it was 2004.

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.660
 And it's this director who is called Sam Irvin,

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:12.180
 who's a gay director who wanted to do the plotline

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.620
 about the gay dads.

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:17.620
 But couldn't get the budget for the LGBTQ station

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:18.700
 that he wanted to put it on.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:21.380
 So he also sold it to Lifetime TV,

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.820
 a rather traditionalist TV station.

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.460
 So he also got a mom.

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.980
 - I want to go to like a traditional

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:31.700
 Orthodox American family and show them the first film,

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.540
 the one with the heterosexual couple,

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.900
 and then show them the other one and say,

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.220
 "You know what, they've done this for all the films."

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:52.220
 (all laughing)

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:53.220
 - Okay, that's it.

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:54.220
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.580

 You might just want to do that.

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.220
 You've been thinking of doing that for a while.

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.420

 don't worry, you don't need to,

00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:00.100
 because this podcast isn't going anywhere.

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:01.900
 We are not going behind a paywall.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.580

 for the rest of its days.

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:07.980
 So the best way you could support us,

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.060
 if you don't want to do Club Fish,

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.740
 is simply just keep listening.

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.540
 Just keep bringing your ears to the party

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:14.300
 and maybe tell your friends about it too.

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:15.740
 We want to be spreading these facts

00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.180
 to as many people as possible.

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.260
 And the only way we do that

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:21.140
 is by having listeners like you tell your friends about it.

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:24.420
 We will be back again next week with a very special guest.

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.140
 We'll see you then, goodbye.
