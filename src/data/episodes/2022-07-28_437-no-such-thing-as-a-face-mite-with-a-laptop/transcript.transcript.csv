00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:15,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:15,00:00:18,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:18,00:00:22,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:23,"My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here"
00:00:23,00:00:26,"with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshensky,"
00:00:26,00:00:27,and James Harkin.
00:00:27,00:00:30,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:30,00:00:32,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:32,00:00:36,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"Starting with fact number one, that is Anna."
00:00:38,00:00:42,- My fact this week is that it's a common misconception
00:00:42,00:00:44,that face mites don't have an anus.
00:00:44,00:00:47,- How common?
00:00:47,00:00:49,"- Oh well, I know that I've blown it wide open"
00:00:49,00:00:51,for all of you guys and everyone listening.
00:00:51,00:00:52,(laughing)
00:00:52,00:00:55,"- If I, honestly, if I had a quid for every time"
00:00:55,00:00:56,"I'd heard someone on the bus saying,"
00:00:56,00:00:58,you know that face mites don't have an anus.
00:00:58,00:00:59,"- No, right?"
00:00:59,00:01:00,- It's exhausting.
00:01:00,00:01:03,- So we did think they were anus-less for a long time?
00:01:03,00:01:04,- We did think they were.
00:01:04,00:01:07,"- And also, sorry, face mites, what are they?"
00:01:07,00:01:09,"- Oh right, sorry, yeah, I suppose I better start"
00:01:09,00:01:11,from the beginning of this story.
00:01:11,00:01:13,So face mites are something that almost everyone
00:01:13,00:01:15,"with normal faces-- - Face mites, yeah."
00:01:15,00:01:18,(laughing)
00:01:18,00:01:20,"- If you've got a face, you've got the mites,"
00:01:20,00:01:24,"probably about 90% of people, and they're very small,"
00:01:24,00:01:27,"about between 1/10th and 1/3 of a millimeter,"
00:01:27,00:01:28,"and so you can't really see them,"
00:01:28,00:01:30,and they're living sort of like inside your pores
00:01:30,00:01:33,"in the daytime, so you couldn't see them anyway."
00:01:33,00:01:35,"But there's been this thing, and honestly,"
00:01:35,00:01:38,if you look up face mites and you do a website search
00:01:38,00:01:40,"of new scientists, of national geographic,"
00:01:40,00:01:43,"very reputable sources, they all say,"
00:01:43,00:01:45,"interesting thing is, they don't have an anus,"
00:01:45,00:01:48,"and so what they do is, they store all their fecal waste"
00:01:48,00:01:51,"in their bodies until they reach death,"
00:01:51,00:01:53,"which does only happen after a few days,"
00:01:53,00:01:55,"and then they just explode it all out,"
00:01:55,00:01:56,"and this is why they're bad,"
00:01:56,00:01:58,because they explode feces on your face.
00:01:58,00:02:00,"Now, this isn't true, and what's more,"
00:02:00,00:02:02,"we've kind of known this isn't true since the '60s,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,so there was an electron microscope in the '60s
00:02:04,00:02:07,"that did identify a face mites anus, but--"
00:02:07,00:02:09,(laughing)
00:02:09,00:02:10,- No one believed him.
00:02:10,00:02:15,"- I wonder, would you rather have face mites"
00:02:15,00:02:17,"on your face that had an anus,"
00:02:17,00:02:20,"and were constantly pooing on your face,"
00:02:20,00:02:23,or one that only pooed as a one-off at the end of its life?
00:02:23,00:02:24,"- Well, I think there was an idea, sorry,"
00:02:24,00:02:27,"that it's worse to have them storing up all the poo,"
00:02:27,00:02:29,because this is where a lot of the bad rep
00:02:29,00:02:30,of the face mite comes from.
00:02:30,00:02:33,People will put various skin diseases
00:02:33,00:02:35,"down to face mite infestations,"
00:02:35,00:02:36,"and it's partly because they'd say,"
00:02:36,00:02:38,"oh, do you know, they build up with poo, so much poo,"
00:02:38,00:02:41,"and then it explodes everywhere, and it's not true,"
00:02:41,00:02:42,"and actually, we don't really have evidence"
00:02:42,00:02:44,that they do any harm to us at all.
00:02:44,00:02:47,"- Although, I found one thing that they might be doing to us,"
00:02:47,00:02:49,"so they've got no protection from ultraviolet light,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,"which is why they have to hide inside the pores,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,"and they can't produce melanin,"
00:02:53,00:02:55,"which is related to tanning and so on,"
00:02:55,00:02:59,but they do have the ability to eat our melanin.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"So, human's grin secretes melanin,"
00:03:01,00:03:02,and then they gobble it up.
00:03:02,00:03:03,"- That's good, so basically,"
00:03:03,00:03:06,"they get a suntanth through eating,"
00:03:06,00:03:08,as opposed to through sunbathing.
00:03:08,00:03:09,"- Exactly, that's exactly what they do."
00:03:09,00:03:10,"- Oh, that's great."
00:03:10,00:03:11,Imagine if we could do that.
00:03:11,00:03:13,It's like a biscuit that tanned us.
00:03:13,00:03:15,"- They're eating our suntanths, don't you find that?"
00:03:15,00:03:17,"- Oh, they're eating away our suntanths."
00:03:17,00:03:18,- I think they're eating our suntanths.
00:03:18,00:03:19,- That's so interesting.
00:03:19,00:03:20,- And they're using our suntanths
00:03:20,00:03:22,to fuel all night sex sessions on our faces.
00:03:22,00:03:23,"- I know, this is the most amazing fact."
00:03:23,00:03:25,- This sounds like a Tory party expose.
00:03:25,00:03:27,(all laughing)
00:03:27,00:03:29,- Can I ask about this massive poo?
00:03:29,00:03:32,Is it like fake tan coming onto your face?
00:03:32,00:03:34,"'Cause it's what they've eaten, right?"
00:03:34,00:03:35,- There is no massive poo.
00:03:35,00:03:36,It's all small poo.
00:03:36,00:03:37,- It's all small poo.
00:03:37,00:03:39,"- So, let's just quickly mention"
00:03:39,00:03:41,"something you dropped in a second ago,"
00:03:41,00:03:42,"which is the fact that every night,"
00:03:42,00:03:43,"when we go to bed,"
00:03:43,00:03:45,"they crawl out of our little pores,"
00:03:45,00:03:47,and they have a big old sex party on our face.
00:03:47,00:03:49,And this is happening every night
00:03:49,00:03:52,"on our children, on our grandparents."
00:03:52,00:03:53,It's happening everywhere.
00:03:53,00:03:54,"- It's quite a cool idea,"
00:03:54,00:03:57,'cause nighttime is when humans often have sex.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"So the idea that when you're having sex,"
00:03:59,00:04:02,it's likely that loads of face mites are also having sex.
00:04:02,00:04:04,"- Oh, so they're not even waiting for you to sleep."
00:04:04,00:04:05,It's just nighttime.
00:04:05,00:04:06,- I think it's just darkness.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"- Yeah, 'cause they don't--"
00:04:07,00:04:08,"- Away from the UV, isn't it?"
00:04:08,00:04:09,"- Yeah, right."
00:04:09,00:04:12,But also they find that couples pass each other's mites.
00:04:12,00:04:14,"So, while you're having sex,"
00:04:14,00:04:16,you might pass a mite that's now having sex
00:04:16,00:04:17,with another you mite.
00:04:17,00:04:19,- I think that's quite unusual
00:04:19,00:04:22,"for you to pass your mites onto another person, actually."
00:04:22,00:04:23,"- Yeah, oh yeah."
00:04:23,00:04:25,- I think babies normally get them from their mothers.
00:04:25,00:04:26,"- For breastfeeding, yeah."
00:04:26,00:04:30,- And I think any other way of me giving you one of my mites
00:04:30,00:04:31,is quite unlikely.
00:04:31,00:04:32,"- Oh, really?"
00:04:32,00:04:33,"- But it is weird, the idea that our face mites"
00:04:33,00:04:35,are basically our own.
00:04:35,00:04:36,"Because, as you say,"
00:04:36,00:04:40,mostly they come from either vaginal childbirth
00:04:40,00:04:42,or breastfeeding because you get face mites hanging around
00:04:42,00:04:45,sometimes in the genitals and the nipples.
00:04:46,00:04:48,And then they don't really change
00:04:48,00:04:52,"unless you are living face to face with someone,"
00:04:52,00:04:55,like cheek to cheek with someone for years on end.
00:04:55,00:04:56,"Like, my colony is totally different"
00:04:56,00:04:58,"to your guy's colonies this stage, I guess, right?"
00:04:58,00:05:00,"- Yeah, that is amazing."
00:05:00,00:05:02,"So, you'll have got some mites from your mother"
00:05:02,00:05:05,"from breastfeeding, perhaps, or vaginally."
00:05:05,00:05:09,And then they obviously won't live for your whole life.
00:05:09,00:05:11,"They'll have children,"
00:05:11,00:05:12,"and their children will have children,"
00:05:12,00:05:14,and their children will have children.
00:05:14,00:05:14,- The cycle of life.
00:05:14,00:05:15,"- So, it's a circle of life."
00:05:15,00:05:18,"- Well, it's more like a straight line of life."
00:05:18,00:05:19,"Because by the time you die,"
00:05:19,00:05:21,"if you live to an average human age,"
00:05:21,00:05:25,it will be 1200 generations from the start.
00:05:25,00:05:26,- Really?
00:05:26,00:05:29,"- Okay, so the ones that are living as you die"
00:05:29,00:05:31,"will be the great, great, great, great, great, great,"
00:05:31,00:05:34,1200 times from the ones that you got from your mother.
00:05:34,00:05:36,And that's the equivalent in humans
00:05:36,00:05:39,of when rope was invented and ovens were invented
00:05:39,00:05:41,and pottery were invented.
00:05:41,00:05:43,"- So, why aren't they achieving more by the end of my life?"
00:05:43,00:05:46,Why haven't they got many laptops on my face?
00:05:46,00:05:47,They're working on it.
00:05:47,00:05:51,"- On the sex, face mites, is quite interesting"
00:05:51,00:05:54,because their penis is on their back.
00:05:54,00:06:00,"So, the male has to sort of get underneath the female"
00:06:00,00:06:01,to have sex.
00:06:01,00:06:02,But his--
00:06:02,00:06:03,"- So, give her a piggyback?"
00:06:03,00:06:04,"- Yeah, like a piggyback."
00:06:04,00:06:08,And it's really interesting because this is a gene
00:06:08,00:06:12,which has changed in the genome called the hox gene.
00:06:12,00:06:15,"And if you, you know the facts which all mammals"
00:06:15,00:06:17,have got nine neck bones.
00:06:17,00:06:18,- Yeah.
00:06:18,00:06:19,- Even a giraffe has got the same number of bones
00:06:19,00:06:21,as a shrew or whatever.
00:06:21,00:06:22,That's because of the hox gene.
00:06:22,00:06:24,And the hox gene is the thing
00:06:24,00:06:27,which tells you where all your body parts grow
00:06:27,00:06:29,so that your arms are here and your legs are there
00:06:29,00:06:31,and your necks here and all that kind of stuff.
00:06:31,00:06:33,"And really, very, very few animals."
00:06:33,00:06:35,"In fact, this is the first one I've ever seen"
00:06:35,00:06:37,where they changed the hox gene
00:06:37,00:06:39,because it's really a hard thing to change
00:06:39,00:06:40,'cause you need all your bits in the right place.
00:06:40,00:06:42,"- So, evolutionarily at some point,"
00:06:42,00:06:46,their gene just changed and now their penis is on their back.
00:06:46,00:06:46,- Exactly.
00:06:46,00:06:50,"- And are you suggesting that if we harness this power,"
00:06:50,00:06:54,we'll be able to have penises wherever we like?
00:06:54,00:06:56,"- We could, but then the problem would be"
00:06:56,00:06:59,that our other body parts would grow in weird places.
00:06:59,00:07:02,"- Okay, so we've got to find a way of isolating it"
00:07:02,00:07:05,"to give each other a very sexy piggyback, yeah."
00:07:05,00:07:07,- What changed for them when their penis went on their back?
00:07:07,00:07:09,"- Well, actually, the mice have been in the news"
00:07:09,00:07:12,in the last few weeks 'cause they've checked the genome
00:07:12,00:07:15,and they found that the genome has changed quite a lot
00:07:15,00:07:17,"and the reason is because they are having sex,"
00:07:17,00:07:18,but they're having sex with their own cousins
00:07:18,00:07:20,and brothers and sisters and stuff like that.
00:07:20,00:07:23,And what they're finding is that they're changing
00:07:23,00:07:25,"in the way that I said,"
00:07:25,00:07:28,but also in a way that they're losing lots
00:07:28,00:07:31,"of their useful powers, if you know what I mean."
00:07:31,00:07:34,"So, things that could save them from ultraviolet,"
00:07:34,00:07:35,"they might have had that in the past,"
00:07:35,00:07:36,but they're losing it 'cause they don't need it
00:07:36,00:07:38,'cause they have such a nice environment in your face.
00:07:38,00:07:41,- They're basically becoming completely dependent on us.
00:07:41,00:07:41,They're very clingy.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"It's like having a partner who suddenly,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,"they ditch their whole friendship group,"
00:07:45,00:07:46,they can't even cook for themselves
00:07:46,00:07:48,and they're developing a completely symbiotic relationship.
00:07:48,00:07:50,- They do have a penis on the back though.
00:07:50,00:07:52,- It is worth it.
00:07:52,00:07:54,- I think the definition is they're currently
00:07:54,00:07:56,"classed as external parasites on us,"
00:07:56,00:07:59,"but soon, if this process continues,"
00:07:59,00:08:02,they will be classed as internal symbiotes.
00:08:02,00:08:05,"- Yeah, and also, they might be classed as extinct"
00:08:05,00:08:08,"because if they lose all of these skills to stay alive,"
00:08:08,00:08:10,then it makes it much more difficult
00:08:10,00:08:12,when they get passed on to the next generation.
00:08:12,00:08:15,"- They also have a seven-clawed organ around their mouth,"
00:08:15,00:08:17,"which when they do eat your sea bum,"
00:08:17,00:08:20,"they kind of latch their claws,"
00:08:20,00:08:22,these claws around their mouth into you.
00:08:22,00:08:22,- Right.
00:08:22,00:08:23,- Which is quite cool to imagine.
00:08:23,00:08:25,- Just when I was warming to them a little bit.
00:08:25,00:08:27,(all laughing)
00:08:27,00:08:29,"- I love those called sea bum,"
00:08:29,00:08:32,yet we have not seen bum for brilliant of these years.
00:08:32,00:08:35,"- Mmm, how did I not realise that?"
00:08:35,00:08:36,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:36,00:08:38,"- So, just mites in general."
00:08:38,00:08:40,"- There are five million different species of mites,"
00:08:40,00:08:42,"I believe, as in everything's got one."
00:08:42,00:08:44,Humans have their own.
00:08:44,00:08:45,- At least one.
00:08:45,00:08:45,- At least one.
00:08:45,00:08:47,Every kind of beetle will have its own mites.
00:08:47,00:08:51,"Every plant, soil, ocean, any mammal."
00:08:51,00:08:53,"- I have a favourite mites,"
00:08:53,00:08:56,which is the Adactolydium.
00:08:56,00:08:59,"This is so amazing, it's a life cycle."
00:08:59,00:09:01,"It's usually found in the Middle East,"
00:09:01,00:09:04,"and they're basically born pregnant,"
00:09:04,00:09:07,and they're born in order to die.
00:09:07,00:09:08,And so--
00:09:08,00:09:10,"- Aren't we all, aren't we all?"
00:09:10,00:09:13,"- It's like human lifespan, but very, very fast."
00:09:13,00:09:15,"So, basically, you've got the mother,"
00:09:15,00:09:17,"and she only ever eats one meal in her whole life,"
00:09:17,00:09:19,and it is always an egg.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"- Hard boiled, or--"
00:09:22,00:09:23,"- An egg, I think it's poached,"
00:09:23,00:09:26,"and it's specifically a poached egg of the Thunderfly,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,or I think in America you call them a thrip.
00:09:28,00:09:32,"And so yeah, it just eats one Thunderfly egg,"
00:09:32,00:09:35,"and then she, this keeps her alive,"
00:09:35,00:09:39,"and she, Insider, has six to 10 fertilized eggs"
00:09:39,00:09:42,"ready to go, and they hatch Insider."
00:09:42,00:09:43,"So, all her offspring hatch Insider,"
00:09:43,00:09:46,"and it's always one male, and then all the rest are females."
00:09:46,00:09:50,"And then, inside the mother, all of her offspring,"
00:09:50,00:09:52,"you know what's coming, we all know what's coming."
00:09:52,00:09:55,"Obviously, the one brother shags all the sisters--"
00:09:55,00:09:56,- A mucky pup.
00:09:56,00:09:58,"- Impregnates them all,"
00:09:58,00:10:00,"and then once he's got all the sisters pregnant,"
00:10:00,00:10:02,they eat their way out of the mother.
00:10:02,00:10:03,- Alpha heaven's sake.
00:10:03,00:10:05,"- So, the mother gets eaten from the inside,"
00:10:05,00:10:08,"and then the kids are born already pregnant, obviously."
00:10:08,00:10:10,"And then I guess they just start again,"
00:10:10,00:10:13,being eaten from the inside by the pregnant kids inside them.
00:10:13,00:10:15,- There are some animals which are just too different to us
00:10:15,00:10:16,for us to have anything in common.
00:10:16,00:10:18,"- Yeah, we wouldn't get along."
00:10:18,00:10:19,- No.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"- Yeah, nothing to talk about at all."
00:10:21,00:10:22,"- If one of them gained human sentience,"
00:10:22,00:10:24,we just wouldn't like that.
00:10:24,00:10:25,(laughing)
00:10:25,00:10:26,- Is that the dinner party?
00:10:26,00:10:29,They start up their children bursting through their chest.
00:10:29,00:10:33,"- At least at the dinner party, all they're eating is an egg."
00:10:33,00:10:34,- What egg?
00:10:34,00:10:34,- Are you gonna have that bread?
00:10:34,00:10:35,"- All right, I'll have that."
00:10:35,00:10:38,(upbeat music)
00:10:38,00:10:44,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:10:44,00:10:46,and that is Andy.
00:10:46,00:10:49,- My fact is that a robot version of the Mayflower
00:10:49,00:10:51,has just completed a human free void
00:10:51,00:10:52,from England to America.
00:10:52,00:10:55,"It went really well, except that it took three goes,"
00:10:55,00:10:56,"had to be towed in manually,"
00:10:56,00:11:00,and first hit land 400 miles from where the original landed.
00:11:00,00:11:01,(laughing)
00:11:01,00:11:02,- Still cool.
00:11:02,00:11:03,- Still cool.
00:11:03,00:11:04,- Still wants for effort.
00:11:04,00:11:06,- Totally disastrous.
00:11:06,00:11:08,It was a disaster.
00:11:08,00:11:10,So this is a ship.
00:11:10,00:11:11,It was a robot ship.
00:11:11,00:11:15,It was built by IBM and an organization called Pro Mare.
00:11:15,00:11:16,"I think that's how it's pronounced,"
00:11:16,00:11:17,'cause it's Mare like the C.
00:11:17,00:11:21,"And it was called the Mayflower Autonomous Ship,"
00:11:21,00:11:23,"and it was piloted by AI technology,"
00:11:23,00:11:28,and apparently the technology worked perfectly.
00:11:28,00:11:29,"But the really funny thing,"
00:11:29,00:11:30,"I just find it funny,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,the original Mayflower voyage in 1620
00:11:32,00:11:36,took 10 weeks to get from England to the Americas.
00:11:36,00:11:39,"And this was expected to take three weeks,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,"'cause they said this is so fast, it's so efficient,"
00:11:41,00:11:43,"it's so AI, it's amazing."
00:11:43,00:11:48,"And it's first set off in, I think, June 2021,"
00:11:48,00:11:53,"and eventually landed in, I think, May or June 2022."
00:11:53,00:11:54,"It took about 60 weeks, basically."
00:11:54,00:11:55,(laughing)
00:11:55,00:11:56,Any time longer than the original Mayflower.
00:11:56,00:11:58,- But I had to come back and start it again
00:11:58,00:11:59,"at that point, right?"
00:11:59,00:12:00,"- Yeah, most of those 60 weeks,"
00:12:00,00:12:04,it was just waiting to try again for a mechanic.
00:12:04,00:12:07,"- In fairness, it was a research thing, right?"
00:12:07,00:12:10,"And in some ways, it's a way to prove"
00:12:10,00:12:13,that you can do this for research in the future.
00:12:13,00:12:16,"So the idea is that a normal boat, like the Mayflower,"
00:12:16,00:12:19,most of the boat you're using to keep the people alive
00:12:19,00:12:21,who are on the boat.
00:12:21,00:12:23,"So you need to keep food, you need to give them shelter,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,you need all this kind of stuff.
00:12:25,00:12:27,"But if it's an AI boat, you don't need any of that stuff."
00:12:27,00:12:29,All you need to do is get from A to B.
00:12:29,00:12:31,And so you have loads of extra space
00:12:31,00:12:34,to do loads of experiments and put loads of electronics in
00:12:34,00:12:37,and loads of scanners and all that kind of stuff.
00:12:37,00:12:40,"And in that respect, I think it was something of a success."
00:12:40,00:12:42,They managed to get quite a lot of data out of it.
00:12:42,00:12:44,"- Oh yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:12:44,00:12:46,"And the whole thing is, what a cool idea as well."
00:12:46,00:12:47,"Like, yeah, it took a bit longer,"
00:12:47,00:12:48,it landed in the wrong spot.
00:12:48,00:12:50,"Sure, my factory's not."
00:12:50,00:12:51,- Broke down a lot.
00:12:51,00:12:52,"- Broke down a lot, cause nightmares,"
00:12:52,00:12:54,but the boat has got--
00:12:54,00:12:54,- Absolute mess.
00:12:54,00:12:55,- Absolute mess.
00:12:55,00:12:56,- Called pro mess.
00:12:56,00:12:57,"- Oh, there we go."
00:12:57,00:12:58,- Sorry.
00:12:58,00:13:00,(laughing)
00:13:00,00:13:02,"- But it's got a great website as well, should say."
00:13:02,00:13:04,"- Well, it did crash three times."
00:13:04,00:13:07,And then you ended up on bbc.co.uk.
00:13:07,00:13:11,- The boat itself had microphones on the hull
00:13:11,00:13:12,with the part of the research capacity.
00:13:12,00:13:14,So it was listening for whales as it traveled.
00:13:14,00:13:17,And it also has a smart tongue.
00:13:17,00:13:19,It had a tongue on the bottom.
00:13:19,00:13:21,- That sounds like someone's Tinder profile.
00:13:21,00:13:22,Or--
00:13:22,00:13:23,- I got a smart tongue.
00:13:23,00:13:24,"- No, that's too rude, isn't it?"
00:13:24,00:13:25,"- No, it sounds more like a mites penis."
00:13:25,00:13:27,- It's sort of migrated from the wrong side
00:13:27,00:13:29,to sort of under the keel.
00:13:29,00:13:31,- It was recording the chemical composition of the ocean.
00:13:31,00:13:33,So I think in that sense it wasn't the right place.
00:13:33,00:13:34,- Right.
00:13:34,00:13:35,(laughing)
00:13:35,00:13:37,"So before we invented the stove,"
00:13:37,00:13:39,there used to be sailors who would have to lay
00:13:39,00:13:40,at the bottom of the boat
00:13:40,00:13:41,(laughing)
00:13:41,00:13:42,with their tongue out through a hole.
00:13:42,00:13:43,- Scratch on.
00:13:43,00:13:45,(laughing)
00:13:45,00:13:47,"Still salty, I would say."
00:13:47,00:13:48,- We're not in the river yet.
00:13:48,00:13:51,(laughing)
00:13:51,00:13:54,"- I think it seemed like the conclusion of this voyage was,"
00:13:54,00:13:56,"AI works quite well,"
00:13:56,00:13:59,but it turns out humans still don't know how to make boats.
00:13:59,00:14:00,Right?
00:14:00,00:14:00,- I think that's boats to call.
00:14:00,00:14:01,- Boats break down all the time.
00:14:01,00:14:02,"- Boats break hard, yeah."
00:14:02,00:14:04,"- Boats really crap, they're always breaking."
00:14:04,00:14:07,"And this seems to be a problem with AI generally,"
00:14:07,00:14:08,"is that it can work very well,"
00:14:08,00:14:11,"but if stuff goes wrong around it, it can't fix it."
00:14:11,00:14:12,"And it made me think next time I go on a ferry,"
00:14:12,00:14:14,I'll have new fan respect for the people
00:14:14,00:14:15,I think are doing nothing.
00:14:15,00:14:18,"'Cause stuff just, stuff just breaks all the time."
00:14:18,00:14:19,- So you'll stop telling them.
00:14:19,00:14:20,- I'll stop saying.
00:14:20,00:14:22,- Name and shame these people who you think are doing nothing.
00:14:22,00:14:24,- Are you talking about the people manning like the kiosk
00:14:24,00:14:27,"for snacks, 'cause they're doing an important job,"
00:14:27,00:14:28,keeping the people out of their lives.
00:14:28,00:14:29,- Like health and safety officers.
00:14:29,00:14:30,"- They're crucial, the health and safety guys,"
00:14:30,00:14:32,the mechanics aren't necessary.
00:14:32,00:14:34,"- The guys in the car parking bit who are saying,"
00:14:34,00:14:37,"no, bring it in, left, left, left, left, left, left."
00:14:37,00:14:38,"- No, no, that's my left."
00:14:38,00:14:40,- They're doing a really important thing.
00:14:40,00:14:41,"- Reverse, reverse, oh, it's in."
00:14:41,00:14:43,"- Those are some of the most skilled people on the planet,"
00:14:43,00:14:44,I would say.
00:14:44,00:14:45,- Do you know what?
00:14:45,00:14:45,- People who can fill a ferry.
00:14:45,00:14:47,"- That bit of the ferry where you drive into,"
00:14:47,00:14:49,is one of my favorite smells.
00:14:49,00:14:53,"- Oh, that oil. - It's oily and petrally,"
00:14:53,00:14:54,and it smells like trucks.
00:14:54,00:14:55,- Yeah. - It's very petrally.
00:14:55,00:14:56,"- I really like that smell anyway,"
00:14:56,00:14:59,but it reminds me of holidays as a child and stuff.
00:14:59,00:15:00,"- As a result of that smell,"
00:15:00,00:15:01,"the guys who were doing the car parking,"
00:15:01,00:15:04,they're as high as cars for the whole time.
00:15:04,00:15:05,Like they're in an altered consciousness
00:15:05,00:15:07,where they can see Tetris.
00:15:07,00:15:08,"- That's what the thing is,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,"I thought I'd run over this guy,"
00:15:10,00:15:11,but it turned out he had his tongue
00:15:11,00:15:12,through a hole in the water.
00:15:12,00:15:14,(laughing)
00:15:14,00:15:17,- Did you guys see the picture of the robot Mayflower
00:15:17,00:15:18,when it was pulling in?
00:15:18,00:15:19,- Yeah.
00:15:19,00:15:21,"- When it finally landed at Plymouth,"
00:15:21,00:15:22,which it did eventually.
00:15:22,00:15:24,"So it left from Plymouth, as the original Mayflower did."
00:15:24,00:15:25,- England Plymouth.
00:15:25,00:15:27,"- England Plymouth, England, yep."
00:15:27,00:15:31,And then it ended up accidentally somewhere in Canada
00:15:31,00:15:32,where Halifax. - Halifax.
00:15:32,00:15:34,"- But then it did get to Plymouth in the end,"
00:15:34,00:15:35,"but it looks so pathetic,"
00:15:35,00:15:39,"because it pulls in next to the Mayflower 2,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,which is the exact replica of the Mayflower
00:15:42,00:15:44,"that was built in the 1950s, which I didn't know about,"
00:15:44,00:15:45,but that's obviously stunning.
00:15:45,00:15:47,"It's got all this stuff, like, you know,"
00:15:47,00:15:50,"it's all got all the rigging, it's like triple-masted,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"and then it's got this crappy,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,"it's like a cat moran, really, isn't it?"
00:15:54,00:15:55,- It is. - It's a trimoran.
00:15:55,00:15:58,"Outrigger, tiny thing, looks like Thunderbird 3, I thought."
00:15:58,00:16:01,"- Yeah, they didn't make much of an effort, yeah."
00:16:01,00:16:03,- I think there was a suggestion before they made it
00:16:03,00:16:04,"that, oh, should we make another replica"
00:16:04,00:16:06,of the Mayflower and send it across?
00:16:06,00:16:08,"And then they decided, no, let's try and do something"
00:16:08,00:16:10,for the next few centuries.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"You know, that's looking to the past"
00:16:11,00:16:13,"if we did that, another replica."
00:16:13,00:16:15,"So I think it is a really, it's a brilliant project,"
00:16:15,00:16:16,"and you know, well done, everyone involved."
00:16:16,00:16:18,"- It is really cool. - Yeah, it is really cool."
00:16:18,00:16:20,"- The Mayflower 2, when that originally went out"
00:16:20,00:16:22,"in the '50s, they had problems as well on the way,"
00:16:22,00:16:25,"and they had to divert, and during the diversion,"
00:16:25,00:16:28,"they went across Bermuda, and they almost sank"
00:16:28,00:16:30,in the Bermuda ocean. - Really?
00:16:30,00:16:33,"- So it could have been a Bermuda triangle casualty,"
00:16:33,00:16:36,"but they didn't, and so it's not a good story."
00:16:36,00:16:38,- How almost are we talking?
00:16:38,00:16:39,"- Oh, they just had, yeah, they had a bit of trouble."
00:16:39,00:16:41,"- Like, they had to bucket out a bit of water."
00:16:41,00:16:43,"- No, there was a big storm, and so it was, you know,"
00:16:43,00:16:44,you could go.
00:16:44,00:16:46,"- Oh, yes, there was, wasn't there?"
00:16:46,00:16:47,- Yeah.
00:16:47,00:16:50,"- That journey, it was in, it was in 1957, they went,"
00:16:50,00:16:53,"and it was this entrepreneur called Warwick Charlton,"
00:16:53,00:16:56,"was a great name, and he was full of crazy schemes,"
00:16:56,00:16:58,"I guess, all through his life, and he wanted to thank"
00:16:58,00:17:00,"the Americans for their help during the Second World War,"
00:17:00,00:17:02,"so he said, let's build another version of the Mayflower,"
00:17:02,00:17:03,and sail it across.
00:17:03,00:17:05,"And they did it in quite an authentic way,"
00:17:05,00:17:06,so they had one radio only.
00:17:06,00:17:10,"That was the only concession to modernity, I guess."
00:17:10,00:17:13,"You know, they had no radar, they had no supplies dropped in,"
00:17:13,00:17:16,they wore pilgrim outfits on Sundays.
00:17:16,00:17:17,"- On their journey. - Just on Sunday, isn't it?"
00:17:17,00:17:18,"- Yeah, just on Sunday."
00:17:18,00:17:20,"Yeah, they didn't want to do the whole thing as a cosplay."
00:17:20,00:17:21,- Yeah.
00:17:21,00:17:22,"- And then, after it was arrived,"
00:17:22,00:17:25,it was officially welcomed by Richard Nixon.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"- Oh, that sounds so frustrating,"
00:17:27,00:17:30,recreating it like hand forging the individual nails
00:17:30,00:17:33,"with which they make it, hand sewing the canvas sails,"
00:17:33,00:17:34,'cause that's how they did it.
00:17:34,00:17:36,"They must have thought at some points,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,"is this, what the fuck's the point in this?"
00:17:38,00:17:40,"And apparently, according to the Wikipedia page,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,and this is taken from a pamphlet
00:17:42,00:17:44,"that's issued by the Plymouth Museum in Massachusetts,"
00:17:44,00:17:45,which is where it is now.
00:17:45,00:17:48,"When they built this replica in England,"
00:17:48,00:17:51,"they employed the skills of elderly, traditional workmen"
00:17:51,00:17:52,so that they could build a vessel
00:17:52,00:17:53,that reflected the original.
00:17:53,00:17:55,- How old were they?
00:17:55,00:17:56,- That's interesting.
00:17:56,00:17:58,"You look like you're alive in 16, 20."
00:17:58,00:17:59,(laughing)
00:17:59,00:18:01,"- And do you know the one difference between the,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,"it's not the one difference, there are others,"
00:18:03,00:18:05,but a difference between the Mayflower Original
00:18:05,00:18:06,and Mayflower Two.
00:18:06,00:18:08,"- Oh, toilet facilities, I would guess."
00:18:08,00:18:09,"- Oh, that's a good one."
00:18:09,00:18:10,- Yeah.
00:18:10,00:18:11,- Would you?
00:18:11,00:18:13,I bet the toilets weren't that much more up to date.
00:18:13,00:18:15,- Electricity.
00:18:15,00:18:16,"- No, although that, I think there was a little bit"
00:18:16,00:18:18,of electricity on the top of my mind.
00:18:18,00:18:20,"- To power the radio, which I'm going to say is the other."
00:18:20,00:18:22,- So there were lots of differences.
00:18:22,00:18:25,"One of them was, no women allowed on Mayflower Two."
00:18:25,00:18:26,"- Oh, really?"
00:18:26,00:18:28,"- Yeah, that feels a bit regressive."
00:18:28,00:18:29,"- Well, I'm not--"
00:18:29,00:18:30,"- No, not allowed?"
00:18:30,00:18:31,"- Not allowed, wasn't."
00:18:31,00:18:32,"Not allowed because the captain,"
00:18:32,00:18:34,who's a guy called Alan Villiers.
00:18:34,00:18:35,"- Bad luck, maybe."
00:18:35,00:18:37,'Cause they used to be thought that women on boats
00:18:37,00:18:38,"was bad luck, wasn't it?"
00:18:38,00:18:38,- Yeah.
00:18:38,00:18:40,"- Sort of, he basically said that we won't be"
00:18:40,00:18:43,"having any women because there's no place for,"
00:18:43,00:18:47,"this is 1957, but there's no place for glamour pusses."
00:18:47,00:18:48,"And he said, ""Look, the reason women came--"""
00:18:48,00:18:49,- Llamour pusses?
00:18:49,00:18:50,- The women.
00:18:50,00:18:52,- Was the original Mayflower absolutely stuffed
00:18:52,00:18:54,"with, you know, Raquel Welch and a fur bikini?"
00:18:54,00:18:56,"- Yeah, and that's why it ended up so badly"
00:18:56,00:18:57,when they arrived at the other end.
00:18:57,00:18:58,They were all shagged out.
00:18:58,00:19:01,"No, he said the reason the Mayflower original worked,"
00:19:01,00:19:04,"and they had women on board and it was fine,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,"was because back in those days, women were chattels,"
00:19:06,00:19:08,"you know, you just owned them."
00:19:08,00:19:09,And they're not now.
00:19:09,00:19:11,They talk back and you can't handle them.
00:19:11,00:19:12,"No, no women."
00:19:12,00:19:13,"- Wow, Alan."
00:19:13,00:19:15,So there were thousands of women who applied
00:19:15,00:19:17,"to help sail the boat over,"
00:19:17,00:19:21,and they were not able to go on the trip.
00:19:21,00:19:23,"But aside from that, it was a really great mission."
00:19:23,00:19:24,- I found it amazing on the original Mayflower
00:19:24,00:19:28,that you had three women who were pregnant
00:19:28,00:19:31,and knew that they would have a baby on the boat.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"- Yeah, which I think that's hardcore, isn't it?"
00:19:33,00:19:34,'Cause you know how long it's gonna take.
00:19:34,00:19:36,It's gonna take you six months to get there.
00:19:36,00:19:38,"You're less than six months pregnant,"
00:19:38,00:19:41,or less than six months to go.
00:19:41,00:19:42,Would you do that?
00:19:42,00:19:43,"- I don't know, medical facilities were so shit."
00:19:43,00:19:45,I think the further away you can get from them
00:19:45,00:19:46,"in those days, the better."
00:19:46,00:19:48,"- Middle of the sea is better than anywhere else, yeah."
00:19:48,00:19:49,"- Really interesting, 'cause you might,"
00:19:49,00:19:52,"were any of the babies born on the new continent,"
00:19:52,00:19:54,or were they all born on board?
00:19:54,00:19:58,"- There was one that was born when the ship was anchored,"
00:19:58,00:19:59,"I think, in Cape Cod."
00:19:59,00:20:03,"So they called him like the first baby in North America,"
00:20:03,00:20:05,ignoring thousands and thousands of years.
00:20:05,00:20:06,- Waiting for them on shore.
00:20:06,00:20:07,- Hey!
00:20:07,00:20:10,- But yeah.
00:20:10,00:20:12,"You would've thought that they might've said to the mother,"
00:20:12,00:20:14,"if you just hold on a little bit longer,"
00:20:14,00:20:17,this'll be the first pilgrim baby born actually on.
00:20:17,00:20:20,"- Exactly, a bit like how we tried to have our cesarean"
00:20:20,00:20:22,"on the 22nd of the 2nd, 2022."
00:20:22,00:20:23,- Yes.
00:20:23,00:20:24,- How'd that work out?
00:20:24,00:20:25,"- When you say we, you mean you and your wife, not you."
00:20:25,00:20:28,"- You and I, I was looking at you dead in the eye"
00:20:28,00:20:28,"when I said that, Andy."
00:20:28,00:20:30,"Yeah, not me and my wife, yeah."
00:20:30,00:20:32,"- Doesn't always work out, does it?"
00:20:32,00:20:32,- I'm afraid not.
00:20:32,00:20:35,"- But then, much like, I think you, you know,"
00:20:35,00:20:38,"named your child partly after the day they were born,"
00:20:38,00:20:39,one of the children who was born on the Mayflower
00:20:39,00:20:42,"was called Oceania, I think."
00:20:42,00:20:43,"- Oh, cool."
00:20:43,00:20:43,- Oh.
00:20:43,00:20:44,- That is a cool name.
00:20:44,00:20:45,- After the Oceania. - That's a brilliant name.
00:20:45,00:20:46,- Yeah.
00:20:46,00:20:49,- Better than 14th of February that we called ours.
00:20:49,00:20:51,(laughing)
00:20:51,00:20:55,- There's been another Mayflower controversy recently.
00:20:55,00:20:56,- Okay.
00:20:56,00:20:58,"- In 2019, in Devon, there was this group"
00:20:58,00:21:00,which announced that they were planning to build
00:21:00,00:21:03,"a 400th anniversary Mayflower, so in 1620, 2020,"
00:21:03,00:21:05,and then they were gonna set it on fire.
00:21:05,00:21:06,- Oh yes.
00:21:06,00:21:08,"- And this prompted a row in America,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,people saying it's very disrespectful.
00:21:10,00:21:11,- I can see why.
00:21:11,00:21:13,"- Yeah, yeah, you know, but it wasn't intended"
00:21:13,00:21:15,as a disrespectful move at all.
00:21:15,00:21:18,It was this group in Devon who I want to go and meet.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"They're called the Great Torrington Cavaliers,"
00:21:20,00:21:23,"and every five years, they build a big old structure"
00:21:23,00:21:24,and then set fire to it.
00:21:24,00:21:25,- Right.
00:21:25,00:21:26,"- They've done it with loads of different things,"
00:21:26,00:21:29,and it's just their way of raising money for charity.
00:21:29,00:21:31,"- Yeah, I saw a photo of it, 'cause they did do it in the end."
00:21:31,00:21:33,"They did light it up, and yeah."
00:21:33,00:21:35,- And it had knitted rats.
00:21:35,00:21:38,"They had a ye olde one-stop knob shop on board,"
00:21:38,00:21:41,which I am pretty sure was an original feature
00:21:41,00:21:42,of the Mayflower.
00:21:42,00:21:43,- One-stop knob shop.
00:21:43,00:21:45,"- One-stop knob shop, what's that mean?"
00:21:45,00:21:45,- I don't know.
00:21:45,00:21:46,- What kind of knobs is it?
00:21:46,00:21:47,Door knobs?
00:21:47,00:21:48,- I imagine door knobs.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"- No, it'll be old knobs, 'cause it's only one stop."
00:21:50,00:21:52,So for all your knob needs.
00:21:52,00:21:53,(laughing)
00:21:53,00:21:56,"I'd like to buy a packet of hub knobs, a door knob."
00:21:56,00:21:58,- And Piers Morgan there in the corner.
00:21:58,00:22:00,(laughing)
00:22:00,00:22:03,"- Anyway, they set it on fire."
00:22:03,00:22:04,- That was very cool.
00:22:04,00:22:07,"- Another controversial one was the town of Horwich,"
00:22:07,00:22:10,which is where the Mayflower was originally constructed.
00:22:10,00:22:11,So this is an Essex.
00:22:11,00:22:14,They wanted to build a replica Mayflower
00:22:14,00:22:15,and send it across again.
00:22:15,00:22:17,So this was in 2009.
00:22:17,00:22:18,They had a town meeting.
00:22:18,00:22:20,"They said, ""How do we commemorate"
00:22:20,00:22:22,"""this big 400th anniversary?"""
00:22:22,00:22:24,"Someone said, ""Why don't we put up some bunting?"""
00:22:24,00:22:25,(laughing)
00:22:25,00:22:27,"And then another person, a dentist called Tom Daley,"
00:22:27,00:22:30,"said, ""Why don't we rebuild the Mayflower"
00:22:30,00:22:31,"""and we send it across?"""
00:22:31,00:22:34,And so they all agreed to it.
00:22:34,00:22:35,And they started raising money for it.
00:22:35,00:22:38,And it sounds like it was quite a doomed project
00:22:38,00:22:40,"from the get-go because first off,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,"they needed to build a shipyard,"
00:22:42,00:22:45,which they didn't have in order to build the ship.
00:22:45,00:22:46,And so that took up a lot of funds.
00:22:46,00:22:48,They raised millions and millions
00:22:48,00:22:50,in order to get this done.
00:22:50,00:22:52,"They hired lots of interns to come and build the ship,"
00:22:52,00:22:53,but they had no training.
00:22:53,00:22:55,So I think they went through hundreds and hundreds
00:22:55,00:22:56,of these interns that just didn't know
00:22:56,00:22:57,what they were doing.
00:22:57,00:23:00,"- Meanwhile, the guy suggested putting up some buntings,"
00:23:00,00:23:01,just watching the whole thing going.
00:23:01,00:23:04,"- I told them, I told them."
00:23:04,00:23:05,- So what happened?
00:23:05,00:23:06,"- Well, they just kept trying to,"
00:23:06,00:23:09,they were investing the money that they kept bringing in.
00:23:09,00:23:10,They kept building up more money
00:23:10,00:23:13,and people were doing things like sponsoring ship bolts
00:23:13,00:23:16,so that they could have their own ship bolts on the ship
00:23:16,00:23:17,and so on.
00:23:17,00:23:20,And eventually they just ran out of money.
00:23:20,00:23:21,- So how much of the ship did they build?
00:23:21,00:23:24,- I think they did the keel and like the bow
00:23:24,00:23:25,and then that was it.
00:23:25,00:23:27,And then obviously all these people
00:23:27,00:23:29,that had these plans anyway for the big anniversary
00:23:29,00:23:30,couldn't do anything about it
00:23:30,00:23:31,'cause COVID hit.
00:23:31,00:23:35,And so all these plans got put into the back seat.
00:23:35,00:23:36,So even if they had their ship
00:23:36,00:23:38,"it might not even, even gone at that point."
00:23:38,00:23:39,"- Oh, that's quite good."
00:23:39,00:23:40,I feel like COVID conveniently disappeared
00:23:40,00:23:41,a lot of doomed projects.
00:23:41,00:23:44,"You could just say, well, then COVID, you know,"
00:23:44,00:23:47,also if that was a completely stupid idea in the first place.
00:23:47,00:23:49,(upbeat music)
00:23:49,00:23:56,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three, that is James."
00:23:56,00:23:58,"- Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:23:58,00:24:02,"when the first four minute Myla, Roger Bannister,"
00:24:02,00:24:06,"met his future wife Myra, she knew he was a runner"
00:24:06,00:24:08,but thought he'd run four miles in one minute.
00:24:08,00:24:13,"Many years later, their grandson bragged to his friends"
00:24:13,00:24:17,that his grandfather could run one mile in under four seconds.
00:24:17,00:24:21,- This is like the Dan process of telling anecdote.
00:24:21,00:24:24,It's exaggerated beyond plausibility.
00:24:24,00:24:27,"- I should let you know, I am his grandson."
00:24:27,00:24:28,- Holding that back for years.
00:24:28,00:24:32,"- Yeah, so this is Roger Bannister."
00:24:32,00:24:34,- And it's very stupid wife apparently.
00:24:34,00:24:36,(laughing)
00:24:36,00:24:39,"Come on Myra, you've run before."
00:24:39,00:24:41,"- Four miles in one minute, that's pretty fast."
00:24:41,00:24:42,- That's silly.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"- So Bannister was a medic as well as a runner,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,wasn't he?
00:24:47,00:24:49,He became Sir Roger Bannister as well
00:24:49,00:24:51,because of the load of work that he did
00:24:51,00:24:52,for the sports council.
00:24:52,00:24:54,"So he wasn't just a fast runner,"
00:24:54,00:24:56,he was an all round guy.
00:24:56,00:25:00,I find it amazing that he wasn't even a fast runner
00:25:00,00:25:03,"after the age of, I think it was 25 when he quit."
00:25:03,00:25:05,"He just gave up, he said he wouldn't be taken seriously"
00:25:05,00:25:06,"as a doctor, he wanted to be a neurologist"
00:25:06,00:25:08,and that's exactly what he became.
00:25:08,00:25:11,And the running he just completely left to one side.
00:25:11,00:25:13,- He said that it was only a small section of his life
00:25:13,00:25:15,"and if he had to give one or the other up,"
00:25:15,00:25:17,he would definitely have given running up
00:25:17,00:25:18,and would have carried on being a medic
00:25:18,00:25:20,'cause that was his main part of his life.
00:25:20,00:25:21,- It's amazing.
00:25:21,00:25:22,"- Yeah, that makes sense."
00:25:22,00:25:24,- It's quite striking if you read any interview
00:25:24,00:25:25,with Roger Bannister.
00:25:25,00:25:28,"- The pretty much the first thing he'll say is,"
00:25:28,00:25:30,I hate it how everyone bangs on about my running.
00:25:30,00:25:31,I don't even care about that.
00:25:31,00:25:34,All I wanna be known for is being a doctor.
00:25:34,00:25:36,"- Yeah, I should have just run a bit slower, shouldn't he?"
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- Yeah, that's pretty right."
00:25:38,00:25:38,(laughing)
00:25:38,00:25:39,- We wouldn't have been talking about him.
00:25:39,00:25:41,- Just had a few seconds on
00:25:41,00:25:42,and you'd be a complete footnote in his room.
00:25:42,00:25:43,(laughing)
00:25:43,00:25:44,- Nobody would care.
00:25:44,00:25:47,- So this happened in Oxford at a place called Ifley Road
00:25:47,00:25:48,and he was--
00:25:48,00:25:49,- So that's his four minute mile.
00:25:49,00:25:51,- That's his four minute mile that he ran
00:25:51,00:25:54,and the track that he ran it on
00:25:54,00:25:57,was actually built partially by him
00:25:57,00:25:58,when he was at university.
00:25:58,00:26:00,He helped lay that track down.
00:26:00,00:26:01,"Yeah, when he did it--"
00:26:01,00:26:02,- Seems like a bit of a swiss.
00:26:02,00:26:03,"- It does, doesn't it?"
00:26:03,00:26:05,It feels like something's going on.
00:26:05,00:26:05,- What do you think he's done?
00:26:05,00:26:07,Made it very slippery or something.
00:26:07,00:26:09,"- Yeah, let it downhill part of it."
00:26:09,00:26:11,"- Yeah, a little spring."
00:26:11,00:26:13,(laughing)
00:26:13,00:26:14,Lobs him forward.
00:26:14,00:26:16,"But yeah, so he did this"
00:26:16,00:26:19,and it was an amazing thing
00:26:19,00:26:20,"that you can actually watch footage of online,"
00:26:20,00:26:22,which is pretty incredible.
00:26:22,00:26:23,"And they talk a lot about his legs,"
00:26:23,00:26:26,which are very kind of weirdly spindly
00:26:26,00:26:29,and the sort of big strides that he takes
00:26:29,00:26:30,are really interesting.
00:26:30,00:26:33,And you can see how knackered he is coming into the end
00:26:33,00:26:34,as he does it.
00:26:34,00:26:35,"In fact, there's a whole crowd waiting for him"
00:26:35,00:26:37,as he comes right into the end
00:26:37,00:26:39,and he basically collapses into someone's arms
00:26:39,00:26:40,as if they knew that was gonna happen.
00:26:40,00:26:42,They're waiting there to capture him.
00:26:42,00:26:45,And then they all stood around to hear had he done it
00:26:45,00:26:47,and there was an official announcement
00:26:47,00:26:50,and the announcer went the time was three
00:26:50,00:26:52,and then there was huge eruption
00:26:52,00:26:53,because that's what they needed to hear.
00:26:53,00:26:53,"- Yeah, it was in McWherter."
00:26:53,00:26:56,"- It was, it was Norris McWherter,"
00:26:56,00:26:58,the founder of the Guinness World Records
00:26:58,00:26:59,along with Hugh Beaver.
00:26:59,00:27:01,- Apparently we're in a pantomime.
00:27:01,00:27:02,(laughing)
00:27:02,00:27:04,- Norris McWherter is a very pantomime as well.
00:27:04,00:27:05,- And he nearly didn't do it.
00:27:05,00:27:07,"That morning he said he spent,"
00:27:07,00:27:08,'cause he was training to be a doctor at the time.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"I think he was a junior doctor, a medical student."
00:27:10,00:27:14,"And he, that morning was working"
00:27:14,00:27:16,"and said it was really, really windy."
00:27:16,00:27:16,"And it was only at the last minute,"
00:27:16,00:27:18,"I think his friend about half an hour before said,"
00:27:18,00:27:21,"""No, you gotta do it, Rog, come on."""
00:27:21,00:27:22,"- And the wind went, that was the other thing."
00:27:22,00:27:23,"- Oh, did it?"
00:27:23,00:27:25,"- Yeah, so he went and he went, ""Let's do it."""
00:27:25,00:27:28,"But he did it in three minutes, 59.4 seconds."
00:27:28,00:27:31,So we've really taken it to the just under four minutes.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"- In actual fact, I said he was the first four-minute miler,"
00:27:34,00:27:36,"I should have said under four-minute miles, right?"
00:27:36,00:27:39,He didn't do it in exactly four minutes.
00:27:39,00:27:41,"But there was someone a few years later,"
00:27:41,00:27:44,"Derek Ibbotson, who in a mile race at White City"
00:27:44,00:27:47,ran in exactly four minutes and zero seconds.
00:27:47,00:27:48,So he became the first person
00:27:48,00:27:50,to do an exact four-minute mile.
00:27:50,00:27:55,- Would that still have been as exciting to break the record
00:27:55,00:27:58,or is the point that it has to be under four minutes?
00:27:58,00:28:00,"- Yeah, it just had to be under four minutes."
00:28:00,00:28:02,It was this invisible barrier that people thought
00:28:02,00:28:04,that humans would never be able to get under.
00:28:04,00:28:05,"But yeah, we got under it."
00:28:05,00:28:07,"So getting four minutes, actually,"
00:28:07,00:28:10,"if Ibbotson had done that four-minute mile,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,arguably he wouldn't have become famous
00:28:12,00:28:13,'cause he hadn't beaten the four-minute mile.
00:28:13,00:28:15,"- Yes, yeah."
00:28:15,00:28:18,"And it's pretty, again, when you watch the footage,"
00:28:18,00:28:20,I do wonder it's the '50s here that we're talking about.
00:28:20,00:28:23,What sort of accuracy are we talking about
00:28:23,00:28:23,with the stopwatch?
00:28:23,00:28:25,'Cause it was so crowded.
00:28:25,00:28:26,What did they have?
00:28:26,00:28:27,"It was a stopwatch, presumably."
00:28:27,00:28:29,"- Yeah, I guess I would have imagined it was a stopwatch."
00:28:29,00:28:30,- I think that as well.
00:28:30,00:28:31,I was in quiz.
00:28:31,00:28:33,We accept this so blindly.
00:28:33,00:28:36,It's just all Norris sitting there jamming his thumb.
00:28:36,00:28:37,"- Yeah, doubting."
00:28:37,00:28:38,Norris McWhorke.
00:28:38,00:28:40,- Good call.
00:28:40,00:28:43,"- The first woman to run a five-minute mile, Diane Leather,"
00:28:43,00:28:47,"it was only 23 days after Bannister's record,"
00:28:47,00:28:49,but didn't get any of the...
00:28:49,00:28:51,- Diane Leather's a very good name.
00:28:51,00:28:52,- Run Hell for Leather.
00:28:52,00:28:53,- Okay.
00:28:53,00:28:54,"- Yeah, that is good."
00:28:54,00:28:56,"- By those days, basically women"
00:28:56,00:28:59,weren't really supposed to run middle distance running.
00:28:59,00:29:02,It was thought to be deleterous to their health.
00:29:02,00:29:03,- Was long distance running allowed?
00:29:03,00:29:06,"- Yeah, they were only allowed to run over 100 miles"
00:29:06,00:29:07,or under 100 meters.
00:29:07,00:29:09,(all laughing)
00:29:09,00:29:11,"- Yeah, the IAF just banned them"
00:29:11,00:29:14,"for running anything more than, I think, 800 meters."
00:29:14,00:29:15,"- I think we might have said,"
00:29:15,00:29:17,did we say once in an earlier episode
00:29:17,00:29:20,about there was an 800 meter race in the '20s
00:29:20,00:29:22,or something where all the women collapsed?
00:29:22,00:29:23,"- Collapsed, yeah, we've talked about that."
00:29:23,00:29:25,And so that put them off.
00:29:25,00:29:26,Just 'cause everyone collapses.
00:29:26,00:29:27,They collapse in the way
00:29:27,00:29:28,"that everyone at the end of a long distance race,"
00:29:28,00:29:31,like if you've ever seen Mo Farah or someone
00:29:31,00:29:32,"get to the end of a race,"
00:29:32,00:29:33,they fall onto the nearest person.
00:29:33,00:29:34,- Absolutely.
00:29:34,00:29:35,- They very often do.
00:29:35,00:29:37,And so these women kind of did some of them.
00:29:37,00:29:40,"- The IAF, we should say who they are,"
00:29:40,00:29:43,the International Amateur Athletics Federation.
00:29:43,00:29:47,'Cause they did exercise quite a lot of power at the time.
00:29:47,00:29:49,'Cause they still do the IAAF.
00:29:49,00:29:51,- So Panister was running as an amateur.
00:29:51,00:29:52,"That was part of the point, I think."
00:29:52,00:29:55,"And so after he'd run the four minute mile,"
00:29:55,00:29:56,"obviously incredibly famous,"
00:29:56,00:29:58,"now one of the most famous people in the world, blah, blah,"
00:29:58,00:30:01,"blah, he went to the USA on a kind of diplomatic,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,"you know, jolly, glad-handling celebrity trip."
00:30:03,00:30:05,He was sent by the foreign office.
00:30:05,00:30:08,"But when he got there, the IAAF said"
00:30:08,00:30:10,"that if he was on sponsored TV,"
00:30:10,00:30:12,that might risk his amateur status.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"And therefore, you know, that would be in big trouble"
00:30:15,00:30:16,and I don't think he'd lose a record or whatever.
00:30:16,00:30:20,"And he was offered a trophy, which was worth 178 pounds."
00:30:20,00:30:21,"But when he was in America,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,'cause they wanted to reward him somehow.
00:30:23,00:30:25,"And the IAAF said, absolutely not."
00:30:25,00:30:28,You can accept no gift worth more than 12 pounds
00:30:28,00:30:32,as a result of this becoming the most famous program.
00:30:32,00:30:34,"- Yeah, like you couldn't even have expenses"
00:30:34,00:30:35,to get to places.
00:30:35,00:30:35,- Really?
00:30:35,00:30:37,"- Yeah, maybe a bit earlier that,"
00:30:37,00:30:40,"but yeah, the amateurism was really important."
00:30:40,00:30:41,- That was why most of the people
00:30:41,00:30:43,who were quite successful runners back in the '50s
00:30:43,00:30:46,were quite wealthy white men in Western countries.
00:30:46,00:30:49,'Cause you couldn't really afford to do anything like that.
00:30:49,00:30:49,- That's true.
00:30:49,00:30:50,"And actually, there is a thought"
00:30:50,00:30:52,that there were people who were running
00:30:52,00:30:54,"sub-form minute miles before him,"
00:30:54,00:30:57,but they weren't Oxford graduates
00:30:57,00:30:59,who had all the newspapers and everything like that.
00:30:59,00:31:02,"So for instance, there's a guy called James Parrott,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,who is a costamonger.
00:31:04,00:31:08,And he supposedly ran a mile in under four minutes in 1770.
00:31:08,00:31:12,And there was in 1796 someone called Weller who did the same.
00:31:12,00:31:14,And the reason that we think it might be true
00:31:14,00:31:16,is because they were bets.
00:31:16,00:31:18,"So it was like this costamonger said to his mate,"
00:31:18,00:31:20,"""I bet you 10 pounds that I can run it"
00:31:20,00:31:21,"""under four minute mile."""
00:31:21,00:31:23,And the other person paid up.
00:31:23,00:31:24,We know that they paid up.
00:31:24,00:31:26,"So whether they did or not,"
00:31:26,00:31:28,"certainly the person they did the bet with,"
00:31:28,00:31:29,"you know, was happy."
00:31:29,00:31:30,"- I couldn't say that they had, yeah."
00:31:30,00:31:31,- I didn't know that if we're not trusting
00:31:31,00:31:33,"Norris McWhorter to stopwatch,"
00:31:33,00:31:35,I don't know if I'm trusting whatever grandfather clock
00:31:35,00:31:36,they timed it by.
00:31:36,00:31:37,- But I'm so clever on these guys
00:31:37,00:31:38,'cause I think they're really interesting claims.
00:31:38,00:31:40,I love the James Parrott one.
00:31:40,00:31:42,"And there was also, soon after him in 1787,"
00:31:42,00:31:44,"there was a runner called Powell,"
00:31:44,00:31:46,"who wagered a thousand guineas,"
00:31:46,00:31:47,which is a lot of money.
00:31:47,00:31:50,"Today that's nearly 800,000 pounds."
00:31:50,00:31:51,- Wow.
00:31:51,00:31:53,- That he could manage a four minute mile run.
00:31:53,00:31:57,And he claimed to have done it in four minutes '03
00:31:57,00:31:58,when he did this time trial.
00:31:58,00:32:00,It was near Hampton Court in London.
00:32:00,00:32:02,And it was five days before Christmas.
00:32:02,00:32:03,And the really interesting detail
00:32:03,00:32:04,is that he was naked at the time.
00:32:04,00:32:05,(laughing)
00:32:05,00:32:09,Most serious runners would have been naked when they--
00:32:09,00:32:10,- In the 1700s.
00:32:10,00:32:12,- It was kind of a harking back
00:32:12,00:32:14,to ancient Greek athletic culture.
00:32:14,00:32:14,But still.
00:32:14,00:32:15,- And so what happened?
00:32:15,00:32:16,Did he lose the money?
00:32:16,00:32:19,- I actually don't know if he lost or won the money.
00:32:19,00:32:21,I actually apparently didn't decide
00:32:21,00:32:23,it was worth writing down whether or not he managed.
00:32:23,00:32:24,- I did a similar thing.
00:32:24,00:32:27,The current record for what the four minute mile
00:32:27,00:32:29,"can be running, I've got all the other details."
00:32:29,00:32:30,Got the guy's name.
00:32:30,00:32:32,Just have to bring down what time he did it in.
00:32:32,00:32:34,So does anyone know the current?
00:32:34,00:32:35,- It's about 350.
00:32:35,00:32:36,- It's about 350.
00:32:36,00:32:36,- Is that Al-Garouj?
00:32:36,00:32:38,"- Yes, Al-Garouj."
00:32:38,00:32:39,- I don't know how much it was.
00:32:39,00:32:41,"I think it would be less than that, wouldn't it?"
00:32:41,00:32:42,- I think it's 340 something.
00:32:42,00:32:43,- 340.
00:32:43,00:32:46,- I know what he'd be banister by in meters.
00:32:46,00:32:48,"As in, if the two of them were racing against each other,"
00:32:48,00:32:50,how much of a lead he had on him.
00:32:50,00:32:52,- That's so weird for you to have collected that.
00:32:52,00:32:54,"- Okay, well, tell us about that, Al."
00:32:54,00:32:55,"- Yeah, try and work it out."
00:32:55,00:32:56,- How many meters was it?
00:32:56,00:32:59,- He beat him by 100 meters.
00:32:59,00:33:00,He would have crossed the line.
00:33:00,00:33:02,"- Okay, well, if you think 10 seconds"
00:33:02,00:33:04,"for a really fast runner to run 100 meters,"
00:33:04,00:33:06,"they would have done it in 15 seconds, something like that."
00:33:06,00:33:08,"So if you take that off four minutes,"
00:33:08,00:33:10,"then that's, you know, 345, 346."
00:33:10,00:33:11,- You made it a bit complicated
00:33:11,00:33:14,"by mixing up meters and miles, obviously, but we can work it."
00:33:14,00:33:15,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:33:15,00:33:17,"But just a home, do the calculation yourself."
00:33:17,00:33:22,"- Or just Google HML Gurush and find out, 1999 it was."
00:33:22,00:33:23,It seems strange that we haven't beaten
00:33:23,00:33:24,the world record since then.
00:33:24,00:33:25,"- Yeah, century."
00:33:25,00:33:28,"- Since 1999, a century."
00:33:28,00:33:29,- This century.
00:33:29,00:33:30,"- Oh, this century."
00:33:30,00:33:31,(laughing)
00:33:31,00:33:35,"But yeah, the reason, according to Peter Weyand,"
00:33:35,00:33:38,who is a Southern Methodist University Professor
00:33:38,00:33:41,"of Applied Physiology and Biomechanics,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,he records that the reason it hasn't been beaten
00:33:43,00:33:47,"is because the next year we started testing for EPO,"
00:33:47,00:33:50,"which is a banned steroid, which kind of gives you--"
00:33:50,00:33:51,"- What year was that, sorry?"
00:33:51,00:33:52,- '99.
00:33:52,00:33:53,- Oh.
00:33:53,00:33:57,"- And so the Olympics knew that people were taking EPO,"
00:33:57,00:33:58,but they didn't have a way of testing for it
00:33:58,00:34:00,until a year later.
00:34:00,00:34:03,"And El Gurush, I should say, has denied"
00:34:03,00:34:05,"that he's ever taken any drugs,"
00:34:05,00:34:08,and he is quite vocal in the anti-drugs kind of campaign
00:34:08,00:34:10,"in sports, so no suggestion."
00:34:10,00:34:12,"- 'Cause all the other ones go, ""Yep, I was definitely on it."""
00:34:12,00:34:14,(laughing)
00:34:14,00:34:17,- But the really interesting thing I think about El Gurush
00:34:17,00:34:20,is that he was gonna be a football goalkeeper.
00:34:20,00:34:23,"And as a kid, he was really, really good."
00:34:23,00:34:24,But his mum stopped him from doing it
00:34:24,00:34:26,"because he would dive around in the mud,"
00:34:26,00:34:29,and all of his clothes would get really dirty.
00:34:29,00:34:30,"And so she said, ""Oh, well, you know,"
00:34:30,00:34:31,"""I have to clean them all the time."
00:34:31,00:34:33,"""Can you not do something that's a bit less dirty?"""
00:34:33,00:34:35,"And he went, ""Okay, I'll be a runner instead."""
00:34:35,00:34:37,And he became the best miler ever.
00:34:37,00:34:38,- Wow.
00:34:38,00:34:40,- Do you know who came up with the first steroid test
00:34:40,00:34:41,for athletes?
00:34:41,00:34:43,- Is it someone we'll have heard of?
00:34:43,00:34:44,- Norris.
00:34:44,00:34:45,Is it Norris?
00:34:45,00:34:45,"- Yeah, you're really close."
00:34:45,00:34:46,- David Hartley.
00:34:46,00:34:47,"- Oh, Hugh Beaver."
00:34:47,00:34:48,"- No, it was a banister, wasn't it?"
00:34:48,00:34:49,- It was a banister.
00:34:49,00:34:50,- Oh!
00:34:50,00:34:51,- Yeah.
00:34:51,00:34:52,It was banister who developed the first steroid test
00:34:52,00:34:55,"as in 1973, 'cause he was big into, you know,"
00:34:55,00:34:58,calling out people who took steroids in sports.
00:34:58,00:35:00,"And other stuff he did, other medical stuff he did,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,"since that's all he wants us to know about him,"
00:35:02,00:35:04,is he was into self-experimenting.
00:35:04,00:35:05,He was one of those doctors.
00:35:05,00:35:06,"- Oh, really?"
00:35:06,00:35:07,- Okay.
00:35:07,00:35:08,- Steroids.
00:35:08,00:35:10,(laughing)
00:35:10,00:35:12,"- Yeah, later at the age of 45,"
00:35:12,00:35:13,he ran out of two minutes.
00:35:13,00:35:15,(laughing)
00:35:15,00:35:19,"- He, not steroids, with pyrogens, actually."
00:35:19,00:35:20,- Okay.
00:35:20,00:35:21,- Which are less fun.
00:35:21,00:35:23,They are chemicals that induce fever.
00:35:23,00:35:24,So he wanted to study fever.
00:35:24,00:35:26,"So he injected himself with pyrogens,"
00:35:26,00:35:29,"and then he sat naked in a hot chamber for six hours,"
00:35:29,00:35:32,which spiked his temperature to very dangerous levels
00:35:32,00:35:33,and turned him dark green.
00:35:33,00:35:34,- Wow.
00:35:34,00:35:35,- Dark green?
00:35:35,00:35:35,- Yeah.
00:35:35,00:35:36,- Do we believe that?
00:35:36,00:35:38,- We've got the story of the Accredible Hulk.
00:35:38,00:35:39,(laughing)
00:35:39,00:35:41,"- And he said, I wouldn't perhaps recommend it."
00:35:41,00:35:43,"- What, Bruce Banner, stirrer?"
00:35:43,00:35:44,- We've passed.
00:35:44,00:35:45,- Oh my god.
00:35:45,00:35:47,"- Oh, we blow this shit wide open."
00:35:47,00:35:47,(laughing)
00:35:47,00:35:49,- So long since we blew something wide open.
00:35:49,00:35:50,I'm so glad about that.
00:35:50,00:35:52,(laughing)
00:35:52,00:35:53,- Wow.
00:35:53,00:35:54,"- Yeah, you'll see in a lot of his papers,"
00:35:54,00:35:58,"he'll refer to the study participant, R.B."
00:35:58,00:36:00,"And it's always him, obviously."
00:36:00,00:36:02,"- You mentioned earlier, Anna,"
00:36:02,00:36:05,"that he was quite tricky to interview sometimes,"
00:36:05,00:36:07,because obviously he had two very different aspects
00:36:07,00:36:08,of his life.
00:36:08,00:36:10,"So there was an interview by the Guardian,"
00:36:10,00:36:11,I think in the early 2000s.
00:36:11,00:36:13,"So he was getting on them,"
00:36:13,00:36:14,but I just wanted to read you some of the--
00:36:14,00:36:15,"- Yeah, go for it."
00:36:15,00:36:17,"- Okay, he was asked a few questions."
00:36:17,00:36:18,"Then he said, right, is there anything else"
00:36:18,00:36:19,you want to know?
00:36:19,00:36:21,"And the interviewer said, well, I'll be honest, sir."
00:36:21,00:36:23,"Yes, what's your favorite biscuit?"
00:36:23,00:36:25,"Oh, I don't answer questions about biscuits."
00:36:25,00:36:26,(laughing)
00:36:26,00:36:27,Why not?
00:36:27,00:36:28,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
00:36:28,00:36:29,I'm not into biscuits.
00:36:29,00:36:31,(laughing)
00:36:31,00:36:33,"- Now, what is he hiding?"
00:36:33,00:36:34,That's the question.
00:36:34,00:36:36,"The interviewer says, everybody likes a nice biscuit."
00:36:36,00:36:38,"He says, well, I'm not sure what the purpose"
00:36:38,00:36:39,of that aspect of the interview is.
00:36:39,00:36:41,"It's quirky, game showy, odd."
00:36:41,00:36:44,(laughing)
00:36:44,00:36:46,"All right, fair play to the Guardian interviewer."
00:36:46,00:36:47,He perseveres.
00:36:47,00:36:49,Cheese or chocolate?
00:36:49,00:36:50,"No, no, no."
00:36:50,00:36:53,"All right, I think you've got more than enough there."
00:36:53,00:36:55,"What about pie fillings, steak and kidney"
00:36:55,00:36:57,or chicken and mushroom?
00:36:57,00:36:58,"Banister just says, thank you so much."
00:36:58,00:36:59,All the best.
00:36:59,00:37:00,(laughing)
00:37:00,00:37:01,Ends the interview.
00:37:01,00:37:02,- That's incredible.
00:37:02,00:37:03,What year is this?
00:37:03,00:37:04,2004 it was.
00:37:04,00:37:05,- Okay.
00:37:05,00:37:07,"I'm just wondering, is this like the era of like,"
00:37:07,00:37:09,"you know, Dennis Penness and Ali G"
00:37:09,00:37:11,and everyone's been primed not to answer stupid questions.
00:37:11,00:37:12,- I think you just hated us.
00:37:12,00:37:14,- I think that's just the point that's questioned
00:37:14,00:37:15,from a journalist.
00:37:15,00:37:16,"In that journalist, I can really imagine doing"
00:37:16,00:37:17,"what that journalist has done,"
00:37:17,00:37:19,which is not be able to remember anything else
00:37:19,00:37:20,that you might have asked him.
00:37:20,00:37:21,(laughing)
00:37:21,00:37:22,I'm just happy to keep going on.
00:37:22,00:37:23,"- Or just quickly looking at, you know,"
00:37:23,00:37:24,it's going off.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"Fuck, what's your favorite sandwich?"
00:37:26,00:37:27,(laughing)
00:37:27,00:37:28,Would you rather?
00:37:28,00:37:28,"No, that's not going to work either."
00:37:28,00:37:29,Have you ever?
00:37:29,00:37:30,No.
00:37:30,00:37:33,(laughing)
00:37:33,00:37:35,"I was, I was saying to you guys,"
00:37:35,00:37:38,"bizarrely, my brother helped him write"
00:37:38,00:37:40,"his last autobiography a few years ago,"
00:37:40,00:37:41,which came out.
00:37:41,00:37:44,"I think it's called ""Twinsumthings""."
00:37:44,00:37:46,And he said he was extremely nice.
00:37:46,00:37:48,"And actually, particularly his wife,"
00:37:48,00:37:50,my brother absolutely loved Moira.
00:37:50,00:37:52,And she'd always bring them warm beer
00:37:52,00:37:54,and sort of cold cuts for lunch.
00:37:54,00:37:55,- Any biscuits?
00:37:55,00:37:57,"- Well, I read through that book"
00:37:57,00:37:58,and there was no mention of Garibaldi.
00:37:58,00:38:00,"So we went, ""What's the matter?"""
00:38:00,00:38:01,"- Every time she wore biscuits in,"
00:38:01,00:38:03,he'd flip the table.
00:38:03,00:38:04,(laughing)
00:38:04,00:38:07,"- I saw him once at a,"
00:38:07,00:38:09,the QI used to have a building in Oxford
00:38:09,00:38:11,and he came to one of the parties in a QI.
00:38:11,00:38:13,"- He just ran in, had a drink, ran out."
00:38:13,00:38:14,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:38:14,00:38:15,Yeah.
00:38:15,00:38:17,(laughing)
00:38:17,00:38:20,"Yeah, but it was kind of like,"
00:38:20,00:38:21,"I don't know, in a weird way,"
00:38:21,00:38:24,because he's someone who's a slightly obscure famous person.
00:38:24,00:38:26,"It was sort of like spotting, you know, like a Bigfoot."
00:38:26,00:38:30,"It was just like, ""Wow, like look, a sighting of Bannister."""
00:38:30,00:38:30,Quite exciting.
00:38:30,00:38:32,"- I mean, he didn't like it,"
00:38:32,00:38:33,but let's say he did like it.
00:38:33,00:38:35,Would you walk around even in your 80s
00:38:35,00:38:38,wearing your shorts and your like-
00:38:38,00:38:39,- Tank top thingy.
00:38:39,00:38:41,"- Yeah, tank top thing."
00:38:41,00:38:43,"- Carrying your record, what did he get?"
00:38:43,00:38:44,- Medal?
00:38:44,00:38:44,- Must have got a medal or something.
00:38:44,00:38:45,- He was the year before you get
00:38:45,00:38:46,the Guinness World Records.
00:38:46,00:38:47,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:38:47,00:38:48,- Poor guy.
00:38:48,00:38:49,- So he didn't even have the-
00:38:49,00:38:49,- Missed it by a year.
00:38:49,00:38:50,- No proof.
00:38:50,00:38:52,"- Because his record was then broken, wasn't it?"
00:38:52,00:38:55,"46 days later by John Landy, the Aussie."
00:38:55,00:39:00,"And they ended up having an amazing run together,"
00:39:00,00:39:01,"which was part of a race,"
00:39:01,00:39:04,which was known as the Miracle Mile Race.
00:39:04,00:39:06,It had a few different names.
00:39:06,00:39:08,And they went up against each other.
00:39:08,00:39:09,"I mean, how exciting."
00:39:09,00:39:10,Two guys who had the records
00:39:10,00:39:11,trying to see who could beat them.
00:39:11,00:39:13,- I suppose that does happen
00:39:13,00:39:16,in pretty much every race meeting in the world.
00:39:16,00:39:17,"- I suppose, yeah, that's true,"
00:39:17,00:39:19,because you're always trying to break a record.
00:39:19,00:39:20,I guess this was-
00:39:20,00:39:21,"- Very rare, Mo Farrow just racing"
00:39:21,00:39:23,a bunch of primary school children's sports day.
00:39:23,00:39:24,Do you know what?
00:39:24,00:39:26,You should try racing other good runners.
00:39:26,00:39:26,- Yeah.
00:39:26,00:39:29,- I think Bannister said his race against Landy
00:39:29,00:39:31,was the thing he was really proudest of.
00:39:31,00:39:32,"- Oh, really?"
00:39:32,00:39:34,- 'Cause it was watched by 40 million people
00:39:34,00:39:36,when it was in Vancouver.
00:39:36,00:39:38,"- And listened by a hundred million on the radio,"
00:39:38,00:39:40,apparently. - Listened to by a hundred million.
00:39:40,00:39:41,- Bizarrely boring.
00:39:41,00:39:44,"Just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang."
00:39:44,00:39:46,Is that what you hear when you listen to a race?
00:39:46,00:39:48,"- Commentary, probably true, it probably be."
00:39:48,00:39:49,- Commentary.
00:39:49,00:39:50,- It's not a good commentator
00:39:50,00:39:51,if that's what they're saying the whole time.
00:39:51,00:39:53,"Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang."
00:39:53,00:39:56,"So in that race, they were both, you know,"
00:39:56,00:39:58,neck for neck the entire time.
00:39:58,00:40:00,And Bannister's behind him.
00:40:00,00:40:01,And-
00:40:01,00:40:02,- That's not what neck for neck.
00:40:02,00:40:02,- Yeah.
00:40:02,00:40:04,"So he was kind of like putting his neck out,"
00:40:04,00:40:05,touching the back of it.
00:40:05,00:40:06,"- It's neck and neck, I think."
00:40:06,00:40:07,- Yeah.
00:40:07,00:40:08,- Not neck for neck.
00:40:08,00:40:09,"- No, I've never-"
00:40:09,00:40:11,- And neck for neck and eye for eyes.
00:40:11,00:40:12,"- That's the Bible, yeah."
00:40:12,00:40:14,"I think they were neck and neck, I'm sorry too."
00:40:14,00:40:14,"- No, no, that's fine."
00:40:14,00:40:17,I would not make a good commentator either.
00:40:17,00:40:18,"- Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang."
00:40:18,00:40:19,"- Yep, they're neck for neck."
00:40:19,00:40:21,- They were neck and neck in front of one in front of the other.
00:40:21,00:40:22,Yeah.
00:40:22,00:40:26,- So Bannister's right behind him and he's covered up.
00:40:26,00:40:30,"And on the final corner, Landy looks over left"
00:40:30,00:40:32,"on his shoulder and as he looks over left,"
00:40:32,00:40:34,Bannister takes over on the right.
00:40:34,00:40:36,And that was the famous moment where-
00:40:36,00:40:38,- He tapped him on the shoulder before he did it.
00:40:38,00:40:41,(all laughing)
00:40:41,00:40:44,- I wanna put a ghost on the running track.
00:40:44,00:40:45,I think we need to redo it.
00:40:45,00:40:46,(all laughing)
00:40:46,00:40:48,- So that was the big moment.
00:40:48,00:40:49,And this moment has been-
00:40:49,00:40:50,- Then he stole his nose.
00:40:50,00:40:52,(all laughing)
00:40:52,00:40:54,"- And then his thumb came off and it was like,"
00:40:54,00:40:55,"""Whoa!"""
00:40:55,00:40:57,(all laughing)
00:40:57,00:40:59,"- Anyway, the prize money that Landy got"
00:40:59,00:41:01,was retrieved from behind his ear actually.
00:41:01,00:41:03,(all laughing)
00:41:03,00:41:05,(upbeat music)
00:41:05,00:41:10,"- Okay, it is time for fact number four."
00:41:10,00:41:11,And that is my fact.
00:41:11,00:41:14,My fact this week is that when the movie Ulysses
00:41:14,00:41:17,"was released in New Zealand in 1967,"
00:41:17,00:41:19,sensors were so worried about it
00:41:19,00:41:21,that men and women weren't allowed to watch it
00:41:21,00:41:22,at the same time.
00:41:22,00:41:27,So they literally had to be placed in different cinemas
00:41:27,00:41:28,if they wanted to go and see it.
00:41:28,00:41:30,And that continued on for years.
00:41:30,00:41:32,So there was a showing of it at a university
00:41:32,00:41:34,in New Zealand in 1972.
00:41:34,00:41:36,"And even then they still had,"
00:41:36,00:41:39,"they allowed men and women in the same room,"
00:41:39,00:41:41,but they had to sit on either side of the cinema.
00:41:41,00:41:44,"- Okay, so is it because it's so sexy?"
00:41:44,00:41:48,"- It's sexy, it's sweary, it was just debauched city."
00:41:48,00:41:49,It was-
00:41:49,00:41:51,"- You see, because I can see if it's sexy"
00:41:51,00:41:54,"that you don't want men and women sat next to each other,"
00:41:54,00:41:55,right?
00:41:55,00:41:55,- 'Cause they might have sex with each other.
00:41:55,00:41:58,"- They might, just straight like that, you know."
00:41:58,00:42:00,That's what happened when I watched.
00:42:00,00:42:01,Stop on my mom.
00:42:01,00:42:03,(all laughing)
00:42:03,00:42:05,"- And you weren't on your own to sit on that movie,"
00:42:05,00:42:07,so that poor person next to you.
00:42:07,00:42:09,- I could see half way through that sense
00:42:09,00:42:11,as that was going the other way.
00:42:11,00:42:14,"But then like if it was a sweary part of it,"
00:42:14,00:42:16,"it doesn't make sense if they're in the same room, right?"
00:42:16,00:42:19,"- No, it was a mixture of the sexiness and of the swearing."
00:42:19,00:42:21,"And in the room, there was a rope"
00:42:21,00:42:23,that went down the center of the audience.
00:42:23,00:42:25,"And so you had the men and women still,"
00:42:25,00:42:27,"there was one row, like one line down the center"
00:42:27,00:42:31,where men and women could have had sex with a rope.
00:42:31,00:42:34,"- Well, just like the rope was sort of,"
00:42:34,00:42:35,there was no aisle between them.
00:42:35,00:42:38,"They were literally in a seat next to someone, yeah."
00:42:38,00:42:40,- If there's just a piece of rope in between you
00:42:40,00:42:42,"and a person, you can still have sex with them."
00:42:42,00:42:45,"- It's a pretty weak barrier to ardor, I would say."
00:42:45,00:42:47,"- Yeah, I got this fact, by the way,"
00:42:47,00:42:50,"from a brilliant book called ""The Land Before Avocado"""
00:42:50,00:42:52,"and it's by a guy called Richard Glover,"
00:42:52,00:42:54,who I've met in Australia when we were on tour there.
00:42:54,00:42:56,"He actually, I went on his radio show."
00:42:56,00:42:58,So he's a big journalist and broadcaster.
00:42:58,00:42:59,He's written a bunch of books.
00:42:59,00:43:02,- What's the title referring to?
00:43:02,00:43:06,"- Well, avocado is absolutely abundant in Australia"
00:43:06,00:43:07,as a breakfast item.
00:43:07,00:43:09,And he's talking about the old Australia.
00:43:09,00:43:12,So avocado is sort of the new world of Australia.
00:43:12,00:43:13,- Got it.
00:43:13,00:43:15,- And the book is all about all the olden days
00:43:15,00:43:16,and how things used to be.
00:43:16,00:43:19,"And Ulysses was actually banned in Australia,"
00:43:19,00:43:22,"which is where it comes up, the book as well as the movie."
00:43:22,00:43:24,"- So this is James Joyce's ""Ulysses"", I should say."
00:43:24,00:43:26,"- Yeah, James Joyce's, you haven't read the book,"
00:43:26,00:43:28,now don't see the film.
00:43:28,00:43:29,(all laughing)
00:43:29,00:43:31,"But yeah, so he mentions that it was allowed in New Zealand,"
00:43:31,00:43:32,but then they had this segregation thing
00:43:32,00:43:34,between the men and the women.
00:43:34,00:43:34,- Very funny.
00:43:34,00:43:36,"- And you said that it was the film as well, wasn't it?"
00:43:36,00:43:39,"There was one in Australia and South Africa, I think."
00:43:39,00:43:41,"- Quite a lot of places, there was a band in Ireland."
00:43:41,00:43:42,- Yeah.
00:43:42,00:43:44,- The band in Ireland was only lifted in the year 2000.
00:43:44,00:43:45,- Yeah.
00:43:45,00:43:46,- That was a long band.
00:43:46,00:43:48,And I think Ireland's justice secretary
00:43:48,00:43:52,sent his secretary to go and see the movie
00:43:52,00:43:53,"and reported back that if this film was allowed,"
00:43:53,00:43:55,"it would discredit the Irish government,"
00:43:55,00:43:57,so it can't be permitted.
00:43:57,00:43:58,- Yeah.
00:43:58,00:43:59,- It was the first film shown in Britain
00:43:59,00:44:00,to feature the F-word.
00:44:00,00:44:01,- Ooh.
00:44:01,00:44:02,- Ooh.
00:44:02,00:44:02,- Spicy.
00:44:02,00:44:03,- Yeah.
00:44:03,00:44:04,- It's really interesting.
00:44:04,00:44:05,It was made by a guy called Joseph Strick
00:44:05,00:44:07,and he was a massive fan of the book.
00:44:07,00:44:09,So his initial pitch for making the movie
00:44:09,00:44:11,"was he wanted to do it verbatim,"
00:44:11,00:44:13,so it was gonna be 18 hours long.
00:44:13,00:44:15,He wanted every bit of dialogue
00:44:15,00:44:16,that was in the book.
00:44:16,00:44:17,"- Marley, Marley."
00:44:17,00:44:18,"- Got talked out of it,"
00:44:18,00:44:21,so it eventually ended up being two hours long.
00:44:21,00:44:22,"But then when it came out,"
00:44:22,00:44:25,he was very angry about the response of all these bannings
00:44:25,00:44:27,in the way that people were treating the film.
00:44:27,00:44:28,And there was one famous incident
00:44:28,00:44:29,where they showed the movie in Cannes
00:44:29,00:44:31,at the film festival.
00:44:31,00:44:33,And this was at the 1967 one.
00:44:33,00:44:35,It had French titles along the bottom.
00:44:35,00:44:36,"And during the film,"
00:44:36,00:44:39,"where it got to a particularly spicy bit,"
00:44:39,00:44:42,"they had, using their hands,"
00:44:42,00:44:44,scribbled out the translation
00:44:44,00:44:46,in French subtitle of what was being said.
00:44:46,00:44:47,"So Strick saw this,"
00:44:47,00:44:49,"thought, you're messing with my movie."
00:44:49,00:44:51,"Ran up, ran to the projection booth,"
00:44:51,00:44:54,where he was met by the committee of the film festival
00:44:54,00:44:57,who knew that he'd rush in there.
00:44:57,00:44:59,"And then he was forcibly ejected, according to him."
00:44:59,00:45:00,He said he was pushed down the steps
00:45:00,00:45:02,and suffered a broken foot.
00:45:02,00:45:05,And so he withdrew the film from Cannes altogether.
00:45:05,00:45:07,- The reason that he loved the book
00:45:07,00:45:12,is that his father had smuggled a copy into America
00:45:13,00:45:15,because it was illegal in lots of countries
00:45:15,00:45:18,at the start of the 20th century.
00:45:18,00:45:20,And his father smuggled this copy into America
00:45:20,00:45:21,and would just keep it in the house
00:45:21,00:45:22,and leave it on the table
00:45:22,00:45:24,"so that whenever anyone came around,"
00:45:24,00:45:27,"they would say, oh, that's that dirty book, isn't it?"
00:45:27,00:45:28,Like Ulysses.
00:45:28,00:45:30,"And then like, even though no one had read it,"
00:45:30,00:45:31,"they would still argue about it,"
00:45:31,00:45:33,about censorship and stuff like that.
00:45:33,00:45:34,"- Yeah, well, it was really,"
00:45:34,00:45:37,"so I think 1920, the very early 20s,"
00:45:37,00:45:39,"it was published, '23, I think."
00:45:39,00:45:42,"And it was, you know, it was printed."
00:45:42,00:45:44,"It was, 'cause he wrote it in '18, didn't he?"
00:45:44,00:45:45,"And it was serialized,"
00:45:45,00:45:48,"but maybe it was published in Britain in '23, do you mean?"
00:45:48,00:45:51,"- Well, 500 copies were burnt at Folkstone in 1923."
00:45:51,00:45:53,So I think that was an attempt to import it.
00:45:53,00:45:57,- It was published in France in 1922.
00:45:57,00:46:01,That was in Paris by an American woman called Sylvia Beach.
00:46:01,00:46:04,She opened a shop and she had these copies of Ulysses
00:46:04,00:46:05,that she managed to get.
00:46:05,00:46:06,And she sold them for 10 times more
00:46:06,00:46:08,than any other book in the shop
00:46:08,00:46:10,'cause she knew that everyone would want to get
00:46:10,00:46:11,the hands on this book.
00:46:11,00:46:13,"But still they managed to get them,"
00:46:13,00:46:14,still they paid for them.
00:46:14,00:46:17,And she removed the copy from the store window
00:46:17,00:46:19,'cause she thought that people would start throwing bricks
00:46:19,00:46:21,in her store and stuff like that.
00:46:21,00:46:23,- Still none of the buyers ever read it.
00:46:23,00:46:25,"I think we can guarantee all of these places,"
00:46:25,00:46:26,all of these people.
00:46:26,00:46:27,- Beach was really brave.
00:46:27,00:46:29,So the book was sued in New York
00:46:29,00:46:31,"by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice,"
00:46:31,00:46:33,and it was convicted for being obscene.
00:46:33,00:46:34,- They were fun people.
00:46:34,00:46:36,"- Yeah, but then after that,"
00:46:36,00:46:37,Beach published it in Paris.
00:46:37,00:46:39,And part of the reason it was controversial
00:46:39,00:46:41,"was when it was printed in extract in the USA,"
00:46:41,00:46:43,"even the printers themselves said,"
00:46:43,00:46:45,"this is outrageous, we're not working on this."
00:46:45,00:46:47,"And then when she was in Paris,"
00:46:47,00:46:49,French printers were obviously harder to offend
00:46:49,00:46:51,with English filth
00:46:51,00:46:52,because they don't understand the language
00:46:52,00:46:53,that they're printing in.
00:46:53,00:46:57,"- And that'd be French, like Madame Bovary."
00:46:57,00:46:59,"- Web it through, web it through, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:46:59,00:47:00,They're used to this sort of.
00:47:00,00:47:02,- Madame Bovary's not that sexy.
00:47:02,00:47:03,- Are you joking?
00:47:03,00:47:04,- There's some shit in a carriage.
00:47:04,00:47:05,"Come on, it's much more subtle"
00:47:05,00:47:07,than what Ulysses sounds like.
00:47:07,00:47:09,"- Pretty raunchy stuff, Madame Bovary."
00:47:09,00:47:10,- Okay.
00:47:10,00:47:12,- Andi's Bar is quite different to you.
00:47:12,00:47:14,- I'm still lobbying to ban Madame Bovary.
00:47:14,00:47:16,(all laughing)
00:47:16,00:47:18,"- But so, Norsica was the chapter in America"
00:47:18,00:47:19,that was seen from Ulysses.
00:47:19,00:47:21,So they were publishing these extracts.
00:47:21,00:47:24,"And in the chapter that suddenly raised the concern,"
00:47:24,00:47:27,"Leopold Bloom, one of the lead characters of the book,"
00:47:27,00:47:28,"Ulysses. - He's the lead, I think."
00:47:28,00:47:30,- He leads the main guy.
00:47:30,00:47:32,- He's not sharing it with many people.
00:47:32,00:47:33,Maybe Molly.
00:47:33,00:47:35,"- Yeah, I was thinking Molly."
00:47:35,00:47:37,So it's a scene in this chapter
00:47:37,00:47:39,where he's masturbating on a beach
00:47:39,00:47:44,while gazing at a 17-year-old girl called Goethe McDowell.
00:47:44,00:47:46,And that's what they took exception to.
00:47:46,00:47:47,Do they have scenes like that in Madame Bovary?
00:47:47,00:47:49,"- It's not quite that much, is it?"
00:47:49,00:47:50,- I don't remember.
00:47:50,00:47:51,"- Or in fact, another scene."
00:47:51,00:47:53,And this is just saving anyone the trouble
00:47:53,00:47:54,of actually reading it
00:47:54,00:47:55,'cause we're just telling you
00:47:55,00:47:57,"the couple of fun bits, so you don't have to bother."
00:47:57,00:48:00,"But apparently there's one scene in a, I haven't read it."
00:48:00,00:48:02,There's one scene in a Dublin brothel
00:48:02,00:48:05,where Leopold Bloom transforms into a woman
00:48:05,00:48:08,and then gives birth to octoplets
00:48:08,00:48:09,"before the brothel, Madame,"
00:48:09,00:48:11,who then turns into a man
00:48:11,00:48:12,and starts auctioning off blooms
00:48:12,00:48:16,like prostitution services and demonstrates.
00:48:16,00:48:18,So Bloom's now a woman with a vagina.
00:48:18,00:48:19,"And so the brothel, Madame,"
00:48:19,00:48:22,demonstrates how good a prostitute that he'd make
00:48:22,00:48:24,by shoving her arm up his vagina.
00:48:24,00:48:25,"- Yeah, okay."
00:48:25,00:48:26,- Also doesn't happen.
00:48:26,00:48:28,"Oh, it shoves her arm up the vagina"
00:48:28,00:48:29,and then shoves it into the bidder's face
00:48:29,00:48:32,"to be like, look, how good is that?"
00:48:32,00:48:33,- There's another line.
00:48:33,00:48:36,I actually started reading Ulysses at the start of the year
00:48:36,00:48:37,when my daughter was born
00:48:37,00:48:40,and I had a lot of time in the middle of the night
00:48:40,00:48:41,sat there with nothing else to do.
00:48:41,00:48:44,"And I got through quite, no, not much of it,"
00:48:44,00:48:46,"but then I started listening to the audio book,"
00:48:46,00:48:48,"the RTE version, which actually I got through most of."
00:48:48,00:48:50,I didn't get through to the end.
00:48:50,00:48:51,And it gets really racy at the end.
00:48:51,00:48:53,So I'm a bit gutted that I haven't got there yet.
00:48:53,00:48:54,"But anyway, there was this line,"
00:48:54,00:48:56,"and I did tweet this at the time,"
00:48:56,00:49:00,"which is, ""Haines helped himself and snapped the case too."
00:49:00,00:49:02,He put it back in his side pocket
00:49:02,00:49:04,and took from his waistcoat pocket
00:49:04,00:49:08,"a nickel tinder box, sprang it open too,"
00:49:08,00:49:10,"and having lit his cigarette,"
00:49:10,00:49:13,held the flaming spunk towards Stephen
00:49:13,00:49:14,"in the shell of his hands."""
00:49:14,00:49:17,- What?
00:49:17,00:49:18,- And so that's-
00:49:18,00:49:20,"- Sorry, when did the spunk come in before that move?"
00:49:20,00:49:22,- The reason is that the word spunk
00:49:22,00:49:24,just doesn't mean what it means today.
00:49:24,00:49:25,"- Oh, really?"
00:49:25,00:49:27,- It meant like a little bit of flame
00:49:27,00:49:28,"or a little bit of, you know,"
00:49:28,00:49:30,if you like to match a little bit of flame
00:49:30,00:49:31,sort of flies away.
00:49:31,00:49:32,That used to be called a spunk.
00:49:32,00:49:33,"- Oh, okay."
00:49:33,00:49:35,- Flaming spunk.
00:49:35,00:49:37,- I guess it is a sort of fly away thing.
00:49:37,00:49:38,It flies off and away.
00:49:38,00:49:39,- Yeah.
00:49:39,00:49:43,"- I'm sure there's some etymological reason, golly."
00:49:43,00:49:45,"- Do you know the day Ulysses was set,"
00:49:45,00:49:49,"which is famously one day, June the 16th, 1904,"
00:49:49,00:49:52,is the day that James Joyce first got a handjob
00:49:52,00:49:53,from his wife.
00:49:53,00:49:54,- Is it?
00:49:54,00:49:55,- Yeah.
00:49:55,00:49:55,- Bloom's day.
00:49:55,00:49:56,"- It's to commemorate that day, exactly."
00:49:56,00:49:57,- Really?
00:49:57,00:49:59,So that's why it's to commemorate?
00:49:59,00:50:00,"- Yeah, he said it then."
00:50:00,00:50:01,It was their first date.
00:50:01,00:50:02,Is it to commemorate the first date?
00:50:02,00:50:04,Is it to commemorate the handjob?
00:50:04,00:50:05,Is there a difference?
00:50:05,00:50:08,"- Is, I don't know, but also Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes"
00:50:08,00:50:09,married on that day.
00:50:09,00:50:10,- Did they?
00:50:10,00:50:10,"- In commemoration of Bloom's Day,"
00:50:10,00:50:12,not the handjob.
00:50:12,00:50:14,It looked more about when the day was set.
00:50:14,00:50:15,- Yeah.
00:50:15,00:50:16,- I wonder if she gave him a handjob
00:50:16,00:50:18,in proper commemoration.
00:50:18,00:50:19,"- You may now kiss the bride,"
00:50:19,00:50:20,and you may now...
00:50:20,00:50:21,Oh.
00:50:21,00:50:24,(laughing)
00:50:24,00:50:27,"The person who banned the book in the UK,"
00:50:27,00:50:30,this was in 1922.
00:50:30,00:50:31,"It was the government that banned it,"
00:50:31,00:50:33,but the person whose idea it was
00:50:33,00:50:36,was a guy called Sir Archibald Bodkin.
00:50:36,00:50:38,And he issued an official opinion
00:50:38,00:50:40,"saying that it was a filthy buck,"
00:50:40,00:50:42,and it should not be allowed to be imported
00:50:42,00:50:44,"into the country, and the government agreed."
00:50:44,00:50:47,And I was reading about Sir Archibald Bodkin.
00:50:47,00:50:51,Apparently he was a man of unwavering Victorian sensibilities.
00:50:51,00:50:54,"This is according to an author, Kevin Birmingham,"
00:50:54,00:50:55,who was writing about Ulysses.
00:50:55,00:50:59,"They said, ""On the rare occasions that he told a body joke,"
00:50:59,00:51:02,"""he drained away the humour by delivering the punchline"
00:51:02,00:51:04,"""with a disapproving glare."""
00:51:04,00:51:05,(laughing)
00:51:05,00:51:06,"- Why are you looking at me, James?"
00:51:06,00:51:07,(laughing)
00:51:07,00:51:09,I don't know what you're trying to say here.
00:51:09,00:51:10,- I love that.
00:51:10,00:51:10,- That's so funny.
00:51:10,00:51:13,- I'd love to see his live at the Apollo set.
00:51:13,00:51:14,(laughing)
00:51:14,00:51:17,- Furious when the audience laughs.
00:51:17,00:51:18,- Shut up.
00:51:18,00:51:19,- Just on films that are banned.
00:51:19,00:51:20,- Oh yeah.
00:51:20,00:51:21,- Oh yeah.
00:51:21,00:51:22,"- The Wikipedia film, which films are banned where,"
00:51:22,00:51:23,is great.
00:51:23,00:51:27,"So, 'cause it's quite nationally specific in lots of cases."
00:51:27,00:51:31,"So, ""Cuba,"" for example, has banned the films,"
00:51:31,00:51:36,"""Red Zone Cuba,"" ""Cuba Crossing,"" ""Red Dawn,"" ""Cuban Love."""
00:51:36,00:51:38,"- Any movie would ""Cuba Gooding Jr."""
00:51:38,00:51:40,(laughing)
00:51:40,00:51:41,- Without Havana.
00:51:41,00:51:44,"And finally, ""Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay."""
00:51:44,00:51:46,(laughing)
00:51:46,00:51:47,"- Okay, that's understandable."
00:51:47,00:51:50,"- There's one film called ""Titanic"" from 1943,"
00:51:50,00:51:52,"it's a 1943 Titanic of the original,"
00:51:52,00:51:54,"which was banned by the Nazi government,"
00:51:54,00:51:56,despite the fact that it had been made
00:51:56,00:51:57,by the Nazi propaganda department.
00:51:57,00:51:58,"- Oh, I remember that one, yeah."
00:51:58,00:51:59,- Yeah.
00:51:59,00:52:00,"- Why, was it like a practice run"
00:52:00,00:52:03,to check how well they banned stuff?
00:52:03,00:52:05,"- I think Goebbels decided it would weaken morale,"
00:52:05,00:52:07,because there was lots of bombing happening
00:52:07,00:52:07,in Germany at the time.
00:52:07,00:52:09,"And Goebbels decided that, because this film"
00:52:09,00:52:11,"featured a lot of deaths on the Titanic,"
00:52:11,00:52:12,that it would weaken morale in Germany.
00:52:12,00:52:14,"So, there were some test screenings outside Germany,"
00:52:14,00:52:15,but it was never shown in Germany.
00:52:15,00:52:18,"It was also then obviously banned by the Allies,"
00:52:18,00:52:19,because it was Nazi propaganda.
00:52:19,00:52:21,"- So, there was basically nowhere this film"
00:52:21,00:52:22,was allowed to be shown.
00:52:22,00:52:23,- Yeah.
00:52:23,00:52:26,"- Do you guys do the film ""Too Cool for Christmas?"""
00:52:26,00:52:27,- No. - No.
00:52:27,00:52:28,- Not familiar with that.
00:52:28,00:52:30,"- Do you know the film ""A Very Cool Christmas?"""
00:52:30,00:52:31,- No.
00:52:31,00:52:34,"- Right, well, they're both the same film."
00:52:34,00:52:37,They're about a girl who wants to go skiing
00:52:37,00:52:39,instead of spending Christmas with her parents.
00:52:39,00:52:42,"But in one of them, in ""A Very Cool Christmas,"""
00:52:42,00:52:45,the girl's parents are a female and male
00:52:45,00:52:46,heterosexual couple.
00:52:46,00:52:48,"And in ""Too Cool for Christmas,"""
00:52:48,00:52:50,her parents are two male gay fathers.
00:52:50,00:52:51,"- Right, okay."
00:52:51,00:52:54,- And it's exactly the same.
00:52:54,00:52:56,But the films are exactly the same as each other.
00:52:56,00:52:58,"They just re-filmed every single scene involving the parents,"
00:52:58,00:53:00,which I imagine is quite a lot of scenes.
00:53:00,00:53:02,- And they just show them in different parts of America.
00:53:02,00:53:03,- Or different parts of the world.
00:53:03,00:53:04,- That was pretty much exactly it.
00:53:04,00:53:06,"It was for America, it was 2004."
00:53:06,00:53:09,"And it's this director who is called Sam Irvin,"
00:53:09,00:53:12,who's a gay director who wanted to do the plotline
00:53:12,00:53:13,about the gay dads.
00:53:13,00:53:17,But couldn't get the budget for the LGBTQ station
00:53:17,00:53:18,that he wanted to put it on.
00:53:18,00:53:21,"So he also sold it to Lifetime TV,"
00:53:21,00:53:23,a rather traditionalist TV station.
00:53:23,00:53:25,So he also got a mom.
00:53:25,00:53:27,- I want to go to like a traditional
00:53:27,00:53:31,"Orthodox American family and show them the first film,"
00:53:31,00:53:33,"the one with the heterosexual couple,"
00:53:33,00:53:35,"and then show them the other one and say,"
00:53:35,00:53:38,"""You know what, they've done this for all the films."""
00:53:38,00:53:52,(all laughing)
00:53:52,00:53:53,"- Okay, that's it."
