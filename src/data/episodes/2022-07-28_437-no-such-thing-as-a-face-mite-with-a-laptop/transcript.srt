1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,980
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,940
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,100
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,980
 My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,500
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshensky,

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,780
 and James Harkin.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,140
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,980
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,020
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,940
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,300
 - My fact this week is that it's a common misconception

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,720
 that face mites don't have an anus.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,140
 - How common?

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,580
 - Oh well, I know that I've blown it wide open

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,260
 for all of you guys and everyone listening.

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,260
 (laughing)

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,540
 - If I, honestly, if I had a quid for every time

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,860
 I'd heard someone on the bus saying,

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,660
 you know that face mites don't have an anus.

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,500
 - No, right?

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,620
 - It's exhausting.

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,740
 - So we did think they were anus-less for a long time?

24
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,860
 - We did think they were.

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,660
 - And also, sorry, face mites, what are they?

26
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,860
 - Oh right, sorry, yeah, I suppose I better start

27
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,420
 from the beginning of this story.

28
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,540
 So face mites are something that almost everyone

29
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,980
 with normal faces-- - Face mites, yeah.

30
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,100
 (laughing)

31
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,540
 - If you've got a face, you've got the mites,

32
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,240
 probably about 90% of people, and they're very small,

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,320
 about between 1/10th and 1/3 of a millimeter,

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,460
 and so you can't really see them,

35
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,780
 and they're living sort of like inside your pores

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,560
 in the daytime, so you couldn't see them anyway.

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,240
 But there's been this thing, and honestly,

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,140
 if you look up face mites and you do a website search

39
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,400
 of new scientists, of national geographic,

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,120
 very reputable sources, they all say,

41
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,440
 interesting thing is, they don't have an anus,

42
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,800
 and so what they do is, they store all their fecal waste

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,200
 in their bodies until they reach death,

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,220
 which does only happen after a few days,

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,660
 and then they just explode it all out,

46
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,500
 and this is why they're bad,

47
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,140
 because they explode feces on your face.

48
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,060
 Now, this isn't true, and what's more,

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,540
 we've kind of known this isn't true since the '60s,

50
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,980
 so there was an electron microscope in the '60s

51
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,700
 that did identify a face mites anus, but--

52
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,780
 (laughing)

53
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,820
 - No one believed him.

54
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,360
 - I wonder, would you rather have face mites

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,960
 on your face that had an anus,

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,340
 and were constantly pooing on your face,

57
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,200
 or one that only pooed as a one-off at the end of its life?

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,680
 - Well, I think there was an idea, sorry,

59
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,500
 that it's worse to have them storing up all the poo,

60
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,900
 because this is where a lot of the bad rep

61
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,980
 of the face mite comes from.

62
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,380
 People will put various skin diseases

63
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,420
 down to face mite infestations,

64
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,540
 and it's partly because they'd say,

65
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,700
 oh, do you know, they build up with poo, so much poo,

66
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,060
 and then it explodes everywhere, and it's not true,

67
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,540
 and actually, we don't really have evidence

68
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,500
 that they do any harm to us at all.

69
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,100
 - Although, I found one thing that they might be doing to us,

70
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,140
 so they've got no protection from ultraviolet light,

71
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,580
 which is why they have to hide inside the pores,

72
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,480
 and they can't produce melanin,

73
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,360
 which is related to tanning and so on,

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,240
 but they do have the ability to eat our melanin.

75
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,120
 So, human's grin secretes melanin,

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,440
 and then they gobble it up.

77
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,800
 - That's good, so basically,

78
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,400
 they get a suntanth through eating,

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,200
 as opposed to through sunbathing.

80
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,600
 - Exactly, that's exactly what they do.

81
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,440
 - Oh, that's great.

82
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,280
 Imagine if we could do that.

83
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,660
 It's like a biscuit that tanned us.

84
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,680
 - They're eating our suntanths, don't you find that?

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,160
 - Oh, they're eating away our suntanths.

86
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
 - I think they're eating our suntanths.

87
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,000
 - That's so interesting.

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
 - And they're using our suntanths

89
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,900
 to fuel all night sex sessions on our faces.

90
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,900
 - I know, this is the most amazing fact.

91
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,700
 - This sounds like a Tory party expose.

92
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,060
 (all laughing)

93
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,140
 - Can I ask about this massive poo?

94
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,140
 Is it like fake tan coming onto your face?

95
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,380
 'Cause it's what they've eaten, right?

96
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,660
 - There is no massive poo.

97
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,500
 It's all small poo.

98
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,700
 - It's all small poo.

99
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,620
 - So, let's just quickly mention

100
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,020
 something you dropped in a second ago,

101
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,620
 which is the fact that every night,

102
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,580
 when we go to bed,

103
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,340
 they crawl out of our little pores,

104
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,740
 and they have a big old sex party on our face.

105
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,540
 And this is happening every night

106
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,440
 on our children, on our grandparents.

107
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,880
 It's happening everywhere.

108
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
 - It's quite a cool idea,

109
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,200
 'cause nighttime is when humans often have sex.

110
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,440
 So the idea that when you're having sex,

111
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,440
 it's likely that loads of face mites are also having sex.

112
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,560
 - Oh, so they're not even waiting for you to sleep.

113
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,400
 It's just nighttime.

114
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
 - I think it's just darkness.

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
 - Yeah, 'cause they don't--

116
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,640
 - Away from the UV, isn't it?

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,800
 - Yeah, right.

118
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,800
 But also they find that couples pass each other's mites.

119
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,680
 So, while you're having sex,

120
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,600
 you might pass a mite that's now having sex

121
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,720
 with another you mite.

122
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,820
 - I think that's quite unusual

123
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,860
 for you to pass your mites onto another person, actually.

124
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,700
 - Yeah, oh yeah.

125
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,620
 - I think babies normally get them from their mothers.

126
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,780
 - For breastfeeding, yeah.

127
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,500
 - And I think any other way of me giving you one of my mites

128
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,460
 is quite unlikely.

129
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,300
 - Oh, really?

130
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,860
 - But it is weird, the idea that our face mites

131
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,180
 are basically our own.

132
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,420
 Because, as you say,

133
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,220
 mostly they come from either vaginal childbirth

134
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,980
 or breastfeeding because you get face mites hanging around

135
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,380
 sometimes in the genitals and the nipples.

136
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,880
 And then they don't really change

137
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,160
 unless you are living face to face with someone,

138
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,000
 like cheek to cheek with someone for years on end.

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,560
 Like, my colony is totally different

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,400
 to your guy's colonies this stage, I guess, right?

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
 - Yeah, that is amazing.

142
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,280
 So, you'll have got some mites from your mother

143
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,200
 from breastfeeding, perhaps, or vaginally.

144
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,480
 And then they obviously won't live for your whole life.

145
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,000
 They'll have children,

146
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,360
 and their children will have children,

147
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,000
 and their children will have children.

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,840
 - The cycle of life.

149
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
 - So, it's a circle of life.

150
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,220
 - Well, it's more like a straight line of life.

151
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,780
 Because by the time you die,

152
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,940
 if you live to an average human age,

153
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,660
 it will be 1200 generations from the start.

154
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,500
 - Really?

155
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,400
 - Okay, so the ones that are living as you die

156
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,420
 will be the great, great, great, great, great, great,

157
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,980
 1200 times from the ones that you got from your mother.

158
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,900
 And that's the equivalent in humans

159
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,900
 of when rope was invented and ovens were invented

160
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,340
 and pottery were invented.

161
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,340
 - So, why aren't they achieving more by the end of my life?

162
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,100
 Why haven't they got many laptops on my face?

163
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,900
 They're working on it.

164
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,560
 - On the sex, face mites, is quite interesting

165
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,600
 because their penis is on their back.

166
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,000
 So, the male has to sort of get underneath the female

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,400
 to have sex.

168
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,240
 But his--

169
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
 - So, give her a piggyback?

170
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,440
 - Yeah, like a piggyback.

171
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,600
 And it's really interesting because this is a gene

172
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,000
 which has changed in the genome called the hox gene.

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,220
 And if you, you know the facts which all mammals

174
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,540
 have got nine neck bones.

175
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,380
 - Yeah.

176
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,580
 - Even a giraffe has got the same number of bones

177
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,180
 as a shrew or whatever.

178
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,780
 That's because of the hox gene.

179
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,620
 And the hox gene is the thing

180
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,300
 which tells you where all your body parts grow

181
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,620
 so that your arms are here and your legs are there

182
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,620
 and your necks here and all that kind of stuff.

183
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,700
 And really, very, very few animals.

184
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,340
 In fact, this is the first one I've ever seen

185
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,260
 where they changed the hox gene

186
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,060
 because it's really a hard thing to change

187
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,980
 'cause you need all your bits in the right place.

188
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,700
 - So, evolutionarily at some point,

189
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,000
 their gene just changed and now their penis is on their back.

190
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,840
 - Exactly.

191
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,600
 - And are you suggesting that if we harness this power,

192
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,480
 we'll be able to have penises wherever we like?

193
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,440
 - We could, but then the problem would be

194
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,280
 that our other body parts would grow in weird places.

195
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,120
 - Okay, so we've got to find a way of isolating it

196
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,280
 to give each other a very sexy piggyback, yeah.

197
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,480
 - What changed for them when their penis went on their back?

198
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,120
 - Well, actually, the mice have been in the news

199
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,100
 in the last few weeks 'cause they've checked the genome

200
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,060
 and they found that the genome has changed quite a lot

201
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,100
 and the reason is because they are having sex,

202
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,960
 but they're having sex with their own cousins

203
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,980
 and brothers and sisters and stuff like that.

204
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,980
 And what they're finding is that they're changing

205
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,340
 in the way that I said,

206
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,260
 but also in a way that they're losing lots

207
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,260
 of their useful powers, if you know what I mean.

208
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,020
 So, things that could save them from ultraviolet,

209
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,220
 they might have had that in the past,

210
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,620
 but they're losing it 'cause they don't need it

211
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,700
 'cause they have such a nice environment in your face.

212
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,000
 - They're basically becoming completely dependent on us.

213
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,980
 They're very clingy.

214
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,820
 It's like having a partner who suddenly,

215
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,280
 they ditch their whole friendship group,

216
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,720
 they can't even cook for themselves

217
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,560
 and they're developing a completely symbiotic relationship.

218
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,100
 - They do have a penis on the back though.

219
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,660
 - It is worth it.

220
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,400
 - I think the definition is they're currently

221
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,580
 classed as external parasites on us,

222
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,440
 but soon, if this process continues,

223
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,340
 they will be classed as internal symbiotes.

224
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,300
 - Yeah, and also, they might be classed as extinct

225
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,680
 because if they lose all of these skills to stay alive,

226
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,280
 then it makes it much more difficult

227
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,500
 when they get passed on to the next generation.

228
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,940
 - They also have a seven-clawed organ around their mouth,

229
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,900
 which when they do eat your sea bum,

230
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,120
 they kind of latch their claws,

231
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,020
 these claws around their mouth into you.

232
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,860
 - Right.

233
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,700
 - Which is quite cool to imagine.

234
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,660
 - Just when I was warming to them a little bit.

235
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,320
 (all laughing)

236
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,060
 - I love those called sea bum,

237
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,560
 yet we have not seen bum for brilliant of these years.

238
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,500
 - Mmm, how did I not realise that?

239
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,600
 Yeah, yeah.

240
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,080
 - So, just mites in general.

241
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,340
 - There are five million different species of mites,

242
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,420
 I believe, as in everything's got one.

243
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,100
 Humans have their own.

244
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,020
 - At least one.

245
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,860
 - At least one.

246
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,980
 Every kind of beetle will have its own mites.

247
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,520
 Every plant, soil, ocean, any mammal.

248
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,500
 - I have a favourite mites,

249
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,620
 which is the Adactolydium.

250
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,300
 This is so amazing, it's a life cycle.

251
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,540
 It's usually found in the Middle East,

252
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,720
 and they're basically born pregnant,

253
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,180
 and they're born in order to die.

254
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,020
 And so--

255
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,620
 - Aren't we all, aren't we all?

256
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,440
 - It's like human lifespan, but very, very fast.

257
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,220
 So, basically, you've got the mother,

258
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,400
 and she only ever eats one meal in her whole life,

259
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,240
 and it is always an egg.

260
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,260
 - Hard boiled, or--

261
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,420
 - An egg, I think it's poached,

262
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,760
 and it's specifically a poached egg of the Thunderfly,

263
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,480
 or I think in America you call them a thrip.

264
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,200
 And so yeah, it just eats one Thunderfly egg,

265
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,640
 and then she, this keeps her alive,

266
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,780
 and she, Insider, has six to 10 fertilized eggs

267
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,180
 ready to go, and they hatch Insider.

268
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,700
 So, all her offspring hatch Insider,

269
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,940
 and it's always one male, and then all the rest are females.

270
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,060
 And then, inside the mother, all of her offspring,

271
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,660
 you know what's coming, we all know what's coming.

272
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,460
 Obviously, the one brother shags all the sisters--

273
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,580
 - A mucky pup.

274
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,380
 - Impregnates them all,

275
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,260
 and then once he's got all the sisters pregnant,

276
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,180
 they eat their way out of the mother.

277
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,500
 - Alpha heaven's sake.

278
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,020
 - So, the mother gets eaten from the inside,

279
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,360
 and then the kids are born already pregnant, obviously.

280
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,040
 And then I guess they just start again,

281
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,560
 being eaten from the inside by the pregnant kids inside them.

282
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,320
 - There are some animals which are just too different to us

283
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,840
 for us to have anything in common.

284
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,520
 - Yeah, we wouldn't get along.

285
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,360
 - No.

286
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,120
 - Yeah, nothing to talk about at all.

287
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,900
 - If one of them gained human sentience,

288
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,240
 we just wouldn't like that.

289
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,640
 (laughing)

290
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,800
 - Is that the dinner party?

291
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,880
 They start up their children bursting through their chest.

292
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,160
 - At least at the dinner party, all they're eating is an egg.

293
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,000
 - What egg?

294
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,820
 - Are you gonna have that bread?

295
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,660
 - All right, I'll have that.

296
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,240
 (upbeat music)

297
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,180
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

298
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,220
 and that is Andy.

299
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,660
 - My fact is that a robot version of the Mayflower

300
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,420
 has just completed a human free void

301
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,800
 from England to America.

302
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,500
 It went really well, except that it took three goes,

303
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,940
 had to be towed in manually,

304
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,100
 and first hit land 400 miles from where the original landed.

305
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,300
 (laughing)

306
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,340
 - Still cool.

307
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,820
 - Still cool.

308
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,820
 - Still wants for effort.

309
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,960
 - Totally disastrous.

310
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,040
 It was a disaster.

311
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,140
 So this is a ship.

312
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,380
 It was a robot ship.

313
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,220
 It was built by IBM and an organization called Pro Mare.

314
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,460
 I think that's how it's pronounced,

315
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,920
 'cause it's Mare like the C.

316
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,100
 And it was called the Mayflower Autonomous Ship,

317
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,660
 and it was piloted by AI technology,

318
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,620
 and apparently the technology worked perfectly.

319
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,660
 But the really funny thing,

320
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,500
 I just find it funny,

321
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,980
 the original Mayflower voyage in 1620

322
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,700
 took 10 weeks to get from England to the Americas.

323
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,100
 And this was expected to take three weeks,

324
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,020
 'cause they said this is so fast, it's so efficient,

325
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,300
 it's so AI, it's amazing.

326
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,300
 And it's first set off in, I think, June 2021,

327
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,060
 and eventually landed in, I think, May or June 2022.

328
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,580
 It took about 60 weeks, basically.

329
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,400
 (laughing)

330
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,980
 Any time longer than the original Mayflower.

331
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,620
 - But I had to come back and start it again

332
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,460
 at that point, right?

333
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,860
 - Yeah, most of those 60 weeks,

334
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,460
 it was just waiting to try again for a mechanic.

335
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,900
 - In fairness, it was a research thing, right?

336
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,700
 And in some ways, it's a way to prove

337
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,380
 that you can do this for research in the future.

338
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,780
 So the idea is that a normal boat, like the Mayflower,

339
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,860
 most of the boat you're using to keep the people alive

340
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,160
 who are on the boat.

341
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,940
 So you need to keep food, you need to give them shelter,

342
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,260
 you need all this kind of stuff.

343
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,740
 But if it's an AI boat, you don't need any of that stuff.

344
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
 All you need to do is get from A to B.

345
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,480
 And so you have loads of extra space

346
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,500
 to do loads of experiments and put loads of electronics in

347
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,020
 and loads of scanners and all that kind of stuff.

348
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,900
 And in that respect, I think it was something of a success.

349
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,820
 They managed to get quite a lot of data out of it.

350
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,100
 - Oh yeah, yeah, exactly.

351
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,180
 And the whole thing is, what a cool idea as well.

352
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,700
 Like, yeah, it took a bit longer,

353
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,900
 it landed in the wrong spot.

354
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,460
 Sure, my factory's not.

355
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,300
 - Broke down a lot.

356
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,740
 - Broke down a lot, cause nightmares,

357
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,060
 but the boat has got--

358
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,900
 - Absolute mess.

359
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,740
 - Absolute mess.

360
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,580
 - Called pro mess.

361
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,420
 - Oh, there we go.

362
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,260
 - Sorry.

363
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,380
 (laughing)

364
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,900
 - But it's got a great website as well, should say.

365
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,340
 - Well, it did crash three times.

366
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,380
 And then you ended up on bbc.co.uk.

367
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,260
 - The boat itself had microphones on the hull

368
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,660
 with the part of the research capacity.

369
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,500
 So it was listening for whales as it traveled.

370
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
 And it also has a smart tongue.

371
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,700
 It had a tongue on the bottom.

372
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,820
 - That sounds like someone's Tinder profile.

373
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,660
 Or--

374
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,500
 - I got a smart tongue.

375
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,340
 - No, that's too rude, isn't it?

376
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,740
 - No, it sounds more like a mites penis.

377
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,700
 - It's sort of migrated from the wrong side

378
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,180
 to sort of under the keel.

379
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,700
 - It was recording the chemical composition of the ocean.

380
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,820
 So I think in that sense it wasn't the right place.

381
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,660
 - Right.

382
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,980
 (laughing)

383
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,980
 So before we invented the stove,

384
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,620
 there used to be sailors who would have to lay

385
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,580
 at the bottom of the boat

386
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,540
 (laughing)

387
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,780
 with their tongue out through a hole.

388
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,620
 - Scratch on.

389
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,180
 (laughing)

390
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,420
 Still salty, I would say.

391
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,740
 - We're not in the river yet.

392
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,580
 (laughing)

393
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,660
 - I think it seemed like the conclusion of this voyage was,

394
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,380
 AI works quite well,

395
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,260
 but it turns out humans still don't know how to make boats.

396
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,100
 Right?

397
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,940
 - I think that's boats to call.

398
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,780
 - Boats break down all the time.

399
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,620
 - Boats break hard, yeah.

400
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,700
 - Boats really crap, they're always breaking.

401
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,140
 And this seems to be a problem with AI generally,

402
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,740
 is that it can work very well,

403
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,220
 but if stuff goes wrong around it, it can't fix it.

404
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,900
 And it made me think next time I go on a ferry,

405
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,340
 I'll have new fan respect for the people

406
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,620
 I think are doing nothing.

407
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,300
 'Cause stuff just, stuff just breaks all the time.

408
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,460
 - So you'll stop telling them.

409
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,660
 - I'll stop saying.

410
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,340
 - Name and shame these people who you think are doing nothing.

411
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,540
 - Are you talking about the people manning like the kiosk

412
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,140
 for snacks, 'cause they're doing an important job,

413
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,460
 keeping the people out of their lives.

414
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,300
 - Like health and safety officers.

415
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,700
 - They're crucial, the health and safety guys,

416
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,260
 the mechanics aren't necessary.

417
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,940
 - The guys in the car parking bit who are saying,

418
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,180
 no, bring it in, left, left, left, left, left, left.

419
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,940
 - No, no, that's my left.

420
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,060
 - They're doing a really important thing.

421
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,620
 - Reverse, reverse, oh, it's in.

422
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,380
 - Those are some of the most skilled people on the planet,

423
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,220
 I would say.

424
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,060
 - Do you know what?

425
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,900
 - People who can fill a ferry.

426
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,820
 - That bit of the ferry where you drive into,

427
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,700
 is one of my favorite smells.

428
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,100
 - Oh, that oil. - It's oily and petrally,

429
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,340
 and it smells like trucks.

430
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,500
 - Yeah. - It's very petrally.

431
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,900
 - I really like that smell anyway,

432
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,460
 but it reminds me of holidays as a child and stuff.

433
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,300
 - As a result of that smell,

434
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,500
 the guys who were doing the car parking,

435
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,260
 they're as high as cars for the whole time.

436
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,660
 Like they're in an altered consciousness

437
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,300
 where they can see Tetris.

438
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,220
 - That's what the thing is,

439
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,100
 I thought I'd run over this guy,

440
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,420
 but it turned out he had his tongue

441
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,420
 through a hole in the water.

442
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,540
 (laughing)

443
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,060
 - Did you guys see the picture of the robot Mayflower

444
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,580
 when it was pulling in?

445
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,420
 - Yeah.

446
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,220
 - When it finally landed at Plymouth,

447
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,140
 which it did eventually.

448
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,900
 So it left from Plymouth, as the original Mayflower did.

449
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,740
 - England Plymouth.

450
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,420
 - England Plymouth, England, yep.

451
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,100
 And then it ended up accidentally somewhere in Canada

452
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,420
 where Halifax. - Halifax.

453
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,300
 - But then it did get to Plymouth in the end,

454
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,620
 but it looks so pathetic,

455
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,740
 because it pulls in next to the Mayflower 2,

456
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,340
 which is the exact replica of the Mayflower

457
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,500
 that was built in the 1950s, which I didn't know about,

458
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,860
 but that's obviously stunning.

459
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,540
 It's got all this stuff, like, you know,

460
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,660
 it's all got all the rigging, it's like triple-masted,

461
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,300
 and then it's got this crappy,

462
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,060
 it's like a cat moran, really, isn't it?

463
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,900
 - It is. - It's a trimoran.

464
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,980
 Outrigger, tiny thing, looks like Thunderbird 3, I thought.

465
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,220
 - Yeah, they didn't make much of an effort, yeah.

466
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,140
 - I think there was a suggestion before they made it

467
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,980
 that, oh, should we make another replica

468
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,300
 of the Mayflower and send it across?

469
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,620
 And then they decided, no, let's try and do something

470
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,020
 for the next few centuries.

471
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,780
 You know, that's looking to the past

472
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,340
 if we did that, another replica.

473
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,740
 So I think it is a really, it's a brilliant project,

474
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,980
 and you know, well done, everyone involved.

475
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,180
 - It is really cool. - Yeah, it is really cool.

476
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,300
 - The Mayflower 2, when that originally went out

477
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,940
 in the '50s, they had problems as well on the way,

478
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,260
 and they had to divert, and during the diversion,

479
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,660
 they went across Bermuda, and they almost sank

480
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,700
 in the Bermuda ocean. - Really?

481
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,580
 - So it could have been a Bermuda triangle casualty,

482
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,540
 but they didn't, and so it's not a good story.

483
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,100
 - How almost are we talking?

484
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,500
 - Oh, they just had, yeah, they had a bit of trouble.

485
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,140
 - Like, they had to bucket out a bit of water.

486
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,700
 - No, there was a big storm, and so it was, you know,

487
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,580
 you could go.

488
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,260
 - Oh, yes, there was, wasn't there?

489
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,080
 - Yeah.

490
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,100
 - That journey, it was in, it was in 1957, they went,

491
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,180
 and it was this entrepreneur called Warwick Charlton,

492
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,460
 was a great name, and he was full of crazy schemes,

493
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,500
 I guess, all through his life, and he wanted to thank

494
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,540
 the Americans for their help during the Second World War,

495
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,860
 so he said, let's build another version of the Mayflower,

496
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,700
 and sail it across.

497
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,060
 And they did it in quite an authentic way,

498
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,700
 so they had one radio only.

499
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,300
 That was the only concession to modernity, I guess.

500
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,340
 You know, they had no radar, they had no supplies dropped in,

501
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,220
 they wore pilgrim outfits on Sundays.

502
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,580
 - On their journey. - Just on Sunday, isn't it?

503
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,420
 - Yeah, just on Sunday.

504
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,180
 Yeah, they didn't want to do the whole thing as a cosplay.

505
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,020
 - Yeah.

506
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,940
 - And then, after it was arrived,

507
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,500
 it was officially welcomed by Richard Nixon.

508
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,740
 - Oh, that sounds so frustrating,

509
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,740
 recreating it like hand forging the individual nails

510
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,820
 with which they make it, hand sewing the canvas sails,

511
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
 'cause that's how they did it.

512
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,140
 They must have thought at some points,

513
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,540
 is this, what the fuck's the point in this?

514
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,580
 And apparently, according to the Wikipedia page,

515
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,060
 and this is taken from a pamphlet

516
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,940
 that's issued by the Plymouth Museum in Massachusetts,

517
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,980
 which is where it is now.

518
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,460
 When they built this replica in England,

519
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,460
 they employed the skills of elderly, traditional workmen

520
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,620
 so that they could build a vessel

521
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,900
 that reflected the original.

522
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,220
 - How old were they?

523
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,220
 - That's interesting.

524
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,060
 You look like you're alive in 16, 20.

525
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,980
 (laughing)

526
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,820
 - And do you know the one difference between the,

527
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,300
 it's not the one difference, there are others,

528
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,220
 but a difference between the Mayflower Original

529
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,060
 and Mayflower Two.

530
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,020
 - Oh, toilet facilities, I would guess.

531
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,420
 - Oh, that's a good one.

532
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,260
 - Yeah.

533
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,100
 - Would you?

534
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,460
 I bet the toilets weren't that much more up to date.

535
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,060
 - Electricity.

536
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,620
 - No, although that, I think there was a little bit

537
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,060
 of electricity on the top of my mind.

538
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,780
 - To power the radio, which I'm going to say is the other.

539
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,380
 - So there were lots of differences.

540
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,260
 One of them was, no women allowed on Mayflower Two.

541
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,580
 - Oh, really?

542
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,700
 - Yeah, that feels a bit regressive.

543
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,540
 - Well, I'm not--

544
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,380
 - No, not allowed?

545
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,540
 - Not allowed, wasn't.

546
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,940
 Not allowed because the captain,

547
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,140
 who's a guy called Alan Villiers.

548
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,460
 - Bad luck, maybe.

549
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,260
 'Cause they used to be thought that women on boats

550
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,100
 was bad luck, wasn't it?

551
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,940
 - Yeah.

552
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,860
 - Sort of, he basically said that we won't be

553
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,700
 having any women because there's no place for,

554
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,180
 this is 1957, but there's no place for glamour pusses.

555
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,980
 And he said, "Look, the reason women came--"

556
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,820
 - Llamour pusses?

557
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,660
 - The women.

558
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,220
 - Was the original Mayflower absolutely stuffed

559
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,340
 with, you know, Raquel Welch and a fur bikini?

560
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,140
 - Yeah, and that's why it ended up so badly

561
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
 when they arrived at the other end.

562
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,420
 They were all shagged out.

563
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,940
 No, he said the reason the Mayflower original worked,

564
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,100
 and they had women on board and it was fine,

565
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,300
 was because back in those days, women were chattels,

566
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,140
 you know, you just owned them.

567
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,300
 And they're not now.

568
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,460
 They talk back and you can't handle them.

569
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,780
 No, no women.

570
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,620
 - Wow, Alan.

571
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,580
 So there were thousands of women who applied

572
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,660
 to help sail the boat over,

573
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,780
 and they were not able to go on the trip.

574
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,140
 But aside from that, it was a really great mission.

575
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,980
 - I found it amazing on the original Mayflower

576
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,580
 that you had three women who were pregnant

577
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,140
 and knew that they would have a baby on the boat.

578
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,660
 - Yeah, which I think that's hardcore, isn't it?

579
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,820
 'Cause you know how long it's gonna take.

580
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,820
 It's gonna take you six months to get there.

581
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,580
 You're less than six months pregnant,

582
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,100
 or less than six months to go.

583
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,420
 Would you do that?

584
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,940
 - I don't know, medical facilities were so shit.

585
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,300
 I think the further away you can get from them

586
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,620
 in those days, the better.

587
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,660
 - Middle of the sea is better than anywhere else, yeah.

588
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,940
 - Really interesting, 'cause you might,

589
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,700
 were any of the babies born on the new continent,

590
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,940
 or were they all born on board?

591
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,260
 - There was one that was born when the ship was anchored,

592
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,500
 I think, in Cape Cod.

593
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,060
 So they called him like the first baby in North America,

594
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,500
 ignoring thousands and thousands of years.

595
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,740
 - Waiting for them on shore.

596
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,580
 - Hey!

597
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,220
 - But yeah.

598
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,740
 You would've thought that they might've said to the mother,

599
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,580
 if you just hold on a little bit longer,

600
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,100
 this'll be the first pilgrim baby born actually on.

601
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,140
 - Exactly, a bit like how we tried to have our cesarean

602
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,820
 on the 22nd of the 2nd, 2022.

603
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,660
 - Yes.

604
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,500
 - How'd that work out?

605
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,980
 - When you say we, you mean you and your wife, not you.

606
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,020
 - You and I, I was looking at you dead in the eye

607
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,980
 when I said that, Andy.

608
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,980
 Yeah, not me and my wife, yeah.

609
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,140
 - Doesn't always work out, does it?

610
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,980
 - I'm afraid not.

611
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,780
 - But then, much like, I think you, you know,

612
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,420
 named your child partly after the day they were born,

613
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,940
 one of the children who was born on the Mayflower

614
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,220
 was called Oceania, I think.

615
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,060
 - Oh, cool.

616
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,900
 - Oh.

617
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,740
 - That is a cool name.

618
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,900
 - After the Oceania. - That's a brilliant name.

619
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,740
 - Yeah.

620
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,060
 - Better than 14th of February that we called ours.

621
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,300
 (laughing)

622
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,260
 - There's been another Mayflower controversy recently.

623
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,100
 - Okay.

624
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,460
 - In 2019, in Devon, there was this group

625
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,260
 which announced that they were planning to build

626
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,940
 a 400th anniversary Mayflower, so in 1620, 2020,

627
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,620
 and then they were gonna set it on fire.

628
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,460
 - Oh yes.

629
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,400
 - And this prompted a row in America,

630
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,500
 people saying it's very disrespectful.

631
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,340
 - I can see why.

632
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,460
 - Yeah, yeah, you know, but it wasn't intended

633
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,420
 as a disrespectful move at all.

634
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,020
 It was this group in Devon who I want to go and meet.

635
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,940
 They're called the Great Torrington Cavaliers,

636
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,580
 and every five years, they build a big old structure

637
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,420
 and then set fire to it.

638
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,260
 - Right.

639
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,180
 - They've done it with loads of different things,

640
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,580
 and it's just their way of raising money for charity.

641
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,780
 - Yeah, I saw a photo of it, 'cause they did do it in the end.

642
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,180
 They did light it up, and yeah.

643
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,060
 - And it had knitted rats.

644
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,820
 They had a ye olde one-stop knob shop on board,

645
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,320
 which I am pretty sure was an original feature

646
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,160
 of the Mayflower.

647
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,220
 - One-stop knob shop.

648
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,120
 - One-stop knob shop, what's that mean?

649
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,960
 - I don't know.

650
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,800
 - What kind of knobs is it?

651
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,640
 Door knobs?

652
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,460
 - I imagine door knobs.

653
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,520
 - No, it'll be old knobs, 'cause it's only one stop.

654
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,300
 So for all your knob needs.

655
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,880
 (laughing)

656
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,680
 I'd like to buy a packet of hub knobs, a door knob.

657
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,020
 - And Piers Morgan there in the corner.

658
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,280
 (laughing)

659
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,360
 - Anyway, they set it on fire.

660
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,200
 - That was very cool.

661
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,440
 - Another controversial one was the town of Horwich,

662
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,280
 which is where the Mayflower was originally constructed.

663
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
 So this is an Essex.

664
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,080
 They wanted to build a replica Mayflower

665
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,280
 and send it across again.

666
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,560
 So this was in 2009.

667
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,960
 They had a town meeting.

668
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,400
 They said, "How do we commemorate

669
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,560
 "this big 400th anniversary?"

670
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,540
 Someone said, "Why don't we put up some bunting?"

671
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,380
 (laughing)

672
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,460
 And then another person, a dentist called Tom Daley,

673
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,420
 said, "Why don't we rebuild the Mayflower

674
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,800
 "and we send it across?"

675
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,060
 And so they all agreed to it.

676
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,960
 And they started raising money for it.

677
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,280
 And it sounds like it was quite a doomed project

678
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,600
 from the get-go because first off,

679
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,360
 they needed to build a shipyard,

680
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,240
 which they didn't have in order to build the ship.

681
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,720
 And so that took up a lot of funds.

682
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,440
 They raised millions and millions

683
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,080
 in order to get this done.

684
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,720
 They hired lots of interns to come and build the ship,

685
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
 but they had no training.

686
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,440
 So I think they went through hundreds and hundreds

687
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,800
 of these interns that just didn't know

688
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,640
 what they were doing.

689
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,160
 - Meanwhile, the guy suggested putting up some buntings,

690
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,400
 just watching the whole thing going.

691
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,300
 - I told them, I told them.

692
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,140
 - So what happened?

693
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,740
 - Well, they just kept trying to,

694
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,100
 they were investing the money that they kept bringing in.

695
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,380
 They kept building up more money

696
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,780
 and people were doing things like sponsoring ship bolts

697
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,460
 so that they could have their own ship bolts on the ship

698
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,300
 and so on.

699
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,020
 And eventually they just ran out of money.

700
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,900
 - So how much of the ship did they build?

701
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,620
 - I think they did the keel and like the bow

702
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,780
 and then that was it.

703
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,220
 And then obviously all these people

704
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,380
 that had these plans anyway for the big anniversary

705
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,820
 couldn't do anything about it

706
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,660
 'cause COVID hit.

707
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,260
 And so all these plans got put into the back seat.

708
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,400
 So even if they had their ship

709
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,380
 it might not even, even gone at that point.

710
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,220
 - Oh, that's quite good.

711
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,760
 I feel like COVID conveniently disappeared

712
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,980
 a lot of doomed projects.

713
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,080
 You could just say, well, then COVID, you know,

714
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,200
 also if that was a completely stupid idea in the first place.

715
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,780
 (upbeat music)

716
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:56,720
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three, that is James.

717
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,400
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

718
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,360
 when the first four minute Myla, Roger Bannister,

719
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,100
 met his future wife Myra, she knew he was a runner

720
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,940
 but thought he'd run four miles in one minute.

721
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,380
 Many years later, their grandson bragged to his friends

722
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,740
 that his grandfather could run one mile in under four seconds.

723
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,540
 - This is like the Dan process of telling anecdote.

724
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,480
 It's exaggerated beyond plausibility.

725
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,160
 - I should let you know, I am his grandson.

726
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,580
 - Holding that back for years.

727
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,020
 - Yeah, so this is Roger Bannister.

728
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,000
 - And it's very stupid wife apparently.

729
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,160
 (laughing)

730
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,160
 Come on Myra, you've run before.

731
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,300
 - Four miles in one minute, that's pretty fast.

732
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,140
 - That's silly.

733
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,880
 - So Bannister was a medic as well as a runner,

734
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,200
 wasn't he?

735
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,700
 He became Sir Roger Bannister as well

736
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,680
 because of the load of work that he did

737
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,760
 for the sports council.

738
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,340
 So he wasn't just a fast runner,

739
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,880
 he was an all round guy.

740
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,280
 I find it amazing that he wasn't even a fast runner

741
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,000
 after the age of, I think it was 25 when he quit.

742
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,200
 He just gave up, he said he wouldn't be taken seriously

743
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,840
 as a doctor, he wanted to be a neurologist

744
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,920
 and that's exactly what he became.

745
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,520
 And the running he just completely left to one side.

746
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,680
 - He said that it was only a small section of his life

747
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
 and if he had to give one or the other up,

748
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,360
 he would definitely have given running up

749
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,760
 and would have carried on being a medic

750
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,600
 'cause that was his main part of his life.

751
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,440
 - It's amazing.

752
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,280
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

753
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,400
 - It's quite striking if you read any interview

754
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,920
 with Roger Bannister.

755
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,040
 - The pretty much the first thing he'll say is,

756
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,600
 I hate it how everyone bangs on about my running.

757
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,800
 I don't even care about that.

758
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,000
 All I wanna be known for is being a doctor.

759
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,440
 - Yeah, I should have just run a bit slower, shouldn't he?

760
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,040
 - Yeah, that's pretty right.

761
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,880
 (laughing)

762
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,720
 - We wouldn't have been talking about him.

763
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,000
 - Just had a few seconds on

764
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,880
 and you'd be a complete footnote in his room.

765
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,720
 (laughing)

766
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,560
 - Nobody would care.

767
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,520
 - So this happened in Oxford at a place called Ifley Road

768
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,360
 and he was--

769
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,640
 - So that's his four minute mile.

770
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,760
 - That's his four minute mile that he ran

771
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,680
 and the track that he ran it on

772
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,360
 was actually built partially by him

773
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,520
 when he was at university.

774
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,040
 He helped lay that track down.

775
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,360
 Yeah, when he did it--

776
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
 - Seems like a bit of a swiss.

777
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,920
 - It does, doesn't it?

778
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,080
 It feels like something's going on.

779
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,920
 - What do you think he's done?

780
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,320
 Made it very slippery or something.

781
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,920
 - Yeah, let it downhill part of it.

782
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,880
 - Yeah, a little spring.

783
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,720
 (laughing)

784
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,840
 Lobs him forward.

785
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,920
 But yeah, so he did this

786
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,040
 and it was an amazing thing

787
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,880
 that you can actually watch footage of online,

788
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,040
 which is pretty incredible.

789
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,600
 And they talk a lot about his legs,

790
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,880
 which are very kind of weirdly spindly

791
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,440
 and the sort of big strides that he takes

792
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
 are really interesting.

793
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,200
 And you can see how knackered he is coming into the end

794
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,040
 as he does it.

795
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,720
 In fact, there's a whole crowd waiting for him

796
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,040
 as he comes right into the end

797
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,280
 and he basically collapses into someone's arms

798
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,960
 as if they knew that was gonna happen.

799
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,280
 They're waiting there to capture him.

800
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,680
 And then they all stood around to hear had he done it

801
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,640
 and there was an official announcement

802
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,600
 and the announcer went the time was three

803
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,000
 and then there was huge eruption

804
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 because that's what they needed to hear.

805
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,840
 - Yeah, it was in McWherter.

806
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,040
 - It was, it was Norris McWherter,

807
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,720
 the founder of the Guinness World Records

808
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,960
 along with Hugh Beaver.

809
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,280
 - Apparently we're in a pantomime.

810
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,360
 (laughing)

811
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,240
 - Norris McWherter is a very pantomime as well.

812
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,440
 - And he nearly didn't do it.

813
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,280
 That morning he said he spent,

814
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,680
 'cause he was training to be a doctor at the time.

815
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,880
 I think he was a junior doctor, a medical student.

816
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,480
 And he, that morning was working

817
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,000
 and said it was really, really windy.

818
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,960
 And it was only at the last minute,

819
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,800
 I think his friend about half an hour before said,

820
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,000
 "No, you gotta do it, Rog, come on."

821
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,840
 - And the wind went, that was the other thing.

822
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,680
 - Oh, did it?

823
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,440
 - Yeah, so he went and he went, "Let's do it."

824
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,680
 But he did it in three minutes, 59.4 seconds.

825
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,640
 So we've really taken it to the just under four minutes.

826
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,080
 - In actual fact, I said he was the first four-minute miler,

827
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,280
 I should have said under four-minute miles, right?

828
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,040
 He didn't do it in exactly four minutes.

829
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,120
 But there was someone a few years later,

830
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,400
 Derek Ibbotson, who in a mile race at White City

831
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,480
 ran in exactly four minutes and zero seconds.

832
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,960
 So he became the first person

833
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,880
 to do an exact four-minute mile.

834
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,440
 - Would that still have been as exciting to break the record

835
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,360
 or is the point that it has to be under four minutes?

836
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,240
 - Yeah, it just had to be under four minutes.

837
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,440
 It was this invisible barrier that people thought

838
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,880
 that humans would never be able to get under.

839
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,920
 But yeah, we got under it.

840
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,960
 So getting four minutes, actually,

841
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,560
 if Ibbotson had done that four-minute mile,

842
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,640
 arguably he wouldn't have become famous

843
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,960
 'cause he hadn't beaten the four-minute mile.

844
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,320
 - Yes, yeah.

845
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,000
 And it's pretty, again, when you watch the footage,

846
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,560
 I do wonder it's the '50s here that we're talking about.

847
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,120
 What sort of accuracy are we talking about

848
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,960
 with the stopwatch?

849
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,480
 'Cause it was so crowded.

850
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,320
 What did they have?

851
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,400
 It was a stopwatch, presumably.

852
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,640
 - Yeah, I guess I would have imagined it was a stopwatch.

853
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,960
 - I think that as well.

854
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,800
 I was in quiz.

855
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,400
 We accept this so blindly.

856
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,040
 It's just all Norris sitting there jamming his thumb.

857
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,520
 - Yeah, doubting.

858
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,800
 Norris McWhorke.

859
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,120
 - Good call.

860
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,960
 - The first woman to run a five-minute mile, Diane Leather,

861
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,880
 it was only 23 days after Bannister's record,

862
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,320
 but didn't get any of the...

863
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,600
 - Diane Leather's a very good name.

864
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,680
 - Run Hell for Leather.

865
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,520
 - Okay.

866
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
 - Yeah, that is good.

867
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,200
 - By those days, basically women

868
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,160
 weren't really supposed to run middle distance running.

869
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,080
 It was thought to be deleterous to their health.

870
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,640
 - Was long distance running allowed?

871
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,200
 - Yeah, they were only allowed to run over 100 miles

872
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,640
 or under 100 meters.

873
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,800
 (all laughing)

874
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,440
 - Yeah, the IAF just banned them

875
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,520
 for running anything more than, I think, 800 meters.

876
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,880
 - I think we might have said,

877
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,520
 did we say once in an earlier episode

878
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,320
 about there was an 800 meter race in the '20s

879
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,200
 or something where all the women collapsed?

880
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,640
 - Collapsed, yeah, we've talked about that.

881
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,040
 And so that put them off.

882
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,320
 Just 'cause everyone collapses.

883
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,160
 They collapse in the way

884
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,960
 that everyone at the end of a long distance race,

885
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,120
 like if you've ever seen Mo Farah or someone

886
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,320
 get to the end of a race,

887
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,840
 they fall onto the nearest person.

888
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,680
 - Absolutely.

889
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,520
 - They very often do.

890
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,080
 And so these women kind of did some of them.

891
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,400
 - The IAF, we should say who they are,

892
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,640
 the International Amateur Athletics Federation.

893
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,480
 'Cause they did exercise quite a lot of power at the time.

894
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,360
 'Cause they still do the IAAF.

895
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,280
 - So Panister was running as an amateur.

896
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,840
 That was part of the point, I think.

897
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,360
 And so after he'd run the four minute mile,

898
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,640
 obviously incredibly famous,

899
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,120
 now one of the most famous people in the world, blah, blah,

900
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,440
 blah, he went to the USA on a kind of diplomatic,

901
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,800
 you know, jolly, glad-handling celebrity trip.

902
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,840
 He was sent by the foreign office.

903
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,520
 But when he got there, the IAAF said

904
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,720
 that if he was on sponsored TV,

905
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,760
 that might risk his amateur status.

906
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,000
 And therefore, you know, that would be in big trouble

907
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,760
 and I don't think he'd lose a record or whatever.

908
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,480
 And he was offered a trophy, which was worth 178 pounds.

909
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,560
 But when he was in America,

910
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,400
 'cause they wanted to reward him somehow.

911
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,440
 And the IAAF said, absolutely not.

912
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,560
 You can accept no gift worth more than 12 pounds

913
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,440
 as a result of this becoming the most famous program.

914
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,240
 - Yeah, like you couldn't even have expenses

915
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,080
 to get to places.

916
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,920
 - Really?

917
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,280
 - Yeah, maybe a bit earlier that,

918
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,200
 but yeah, the amateurism was really important.

919
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,600
 - That was why most of the people

920
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,360
 who were quite successful runners back in the '50s

921
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,600
 were quite wealthy white men in Western countries.

922
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,040
 'Cause you couldn't really afford to do anything like that.

923
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,880
 - That's true.

924
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,960
 And actually, there is a thought

925
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,160
 that there were people who were running

926
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,520
 sub-form minute miles before him,

927
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,000
 but they weren't Oxford graduates

928
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,800
 who had all the newspapers and everything like that.

929
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,520
 So for instance, there's a guy called James Parrott,

930
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,120
 who is a costamonger.

931
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,880
 And he supposedly ran a mile in under four minutes in 1770.

932
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,200
 And there was in 1796 someone called Weller who did the same.

933
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,000
 And the reason that we think it might be true

934
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 is because they were bets.

935
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,440
 So it was like this costamonger said to his mate,

936
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,800
 "I bet you 10 pounds that I can run it

937
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,960
 "under four minute mile."

938
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,320
 And the other person paid up.

939
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,800
 We know that they paid up.

940
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,760
 So whether they did or not,

941
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,560
 certainly the person they did the bet with,

942
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
 you know, was happy.

943
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,400
 - I couldn't say that they had, yeah.

944
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,640
 - I didn't know that if we're not trusting

945
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,000
 Norris McWhorter to stopwatch,

946
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,400
 I don't know if I'm trusting whatever grandfather clock

947
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,240
 they timed it by.

948
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
 - But I'm so clever on these guys

949
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,880
 'cause I think they're really interesting claims.

950
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,040
 I love the James Parrott one.

951
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,520
 And there was also, soon after him in 1787,

952
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,120
 there was a runner called Powell,

953
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,200
 who wagered a thousand guineas,

954
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,640
 which is a lot of money.

955
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,360
 Today that's nearly 800,000 pounds.

956
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,200
 - Wow.

957
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,960
 - That he could manage a four minute mile run.

958
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,120
 And he claimed to have done it in four minutes '03

959
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,600
 when he did this time trial.

960
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,400
 It was near Hampton Court in London.

961
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,160
 And it was five days before Christmas.

962
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,240
 And the really interesting detail

963
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,720
 is that he was naked at the time.

964
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,800
 (laughing)

965
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,240
 Most serious runners would have been naked when they--

966
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,720
 - In the 1700s.

967
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,080
 - It was kind of a harking back

968
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,040
 to ancient Greek athletic culture.

969
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,880
 But still.

970
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,720
 - And so what happened?

971
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,560
 Did he lose the money?

972
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,240
 - I actually don't know if he lost or won the money.

973
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,080
 I actually apparently didn't decide

974
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,400
 it was worth writing down whether or not he managed.

975
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,720
 - I did a similar thing.

976
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,400
 The current record for what the four minute mile

977
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
 can be running, I've got all the other details.

978
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,240
 Got the guy's name.

979
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,680
 Just have to bring down what time he did it in.

980
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,320
 So does anyone know the current?

981
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,160
 - It's about 350.

982
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,000
 - It's about 350.

983
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,840
 - Is that Al-Garouj?

984
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,320
 - Yes, Al-Garouj.

985
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,480
 - I don't know how much it was.

986
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,360
 I think it would be less than that, wouldn't it?

987
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,920
 - I think it's 340 something.

988
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,760
 - 340.

989
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,240
 - I know what he'd be banister by in meters.

990
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,680
 As in, if the two of them were racing against each other,

991
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,440
 how much of a lead he had on him.

992
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,640
 - That's so weird for you to have collected that.

993
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
 - Okay, well, tell us about that, Al.

994
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,480
 - Yeah, try and work it out.

995
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,800
 - How many meters was it?

996
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,600
 - He beat him by 100 meters.

997
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,480
 He would have crossed the line.

998
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,040
 - Okay, well, if you think 10 seconds

999
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,080
 for a really fast runner to run 100 meters,

1000
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,680
 they would have done it in 15 seconds, something like that.

1001
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,080
 So if you take that off four minutes,

1002
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,680
 then that's, you know, 345, 346.

1003
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,840
 - You made it a bit complicated

1004
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,840
 by mixing up meters and miles, obviously, but we can work it.

1005
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1006
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,800
 But just a home, do the calculation yourself.

1007
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,520
 - Or just Google HML Gurush and find out, 1999 it was.

1008
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,920
 It seems strange that we haven't beaten

1009
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
 the world record since then.

1010
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,760
 - Yeah, century.

1011
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,440
 - Since 1999, a century.

1012
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,280
 - This century.

1013
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,120
 - Oh, this century.

1014
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,960
 (laughing)

1015
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,720
 But yeah, the reason, according to Peter Weyand,

1016
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,560
 who is a Southern Methodist University Professor

1017
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,320
 of Applied Physiology and Biomechanics,

1018
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,120
 he records that the reason it hasn't been beaten

1019
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,320
 is because the next year we started testing for EPO,

1020
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,720
 which is a banned steroid, which kind of gives you--

1021
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,560
 - What year was that, sorry?

1022
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,880
 - '99.

1023
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,720
 - Oh.

1024
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,140
 - And so the Olympics knew that people were taking EPO,

1025
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,960
 but they didn't have a way of testing for it

1026
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,760
 until a year later.

1027
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,360
 And El Gurush, I should say, has denied

1028
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,200
 that he's ever taken any drugs,

1029
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,800
 and he is quite vocal in the anti-drugs kind of campaign

1030
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,160
 in sports, so no suggestion.

1031
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,600
 - 'Cause all the other ones go, "Yep, I was definitely on it."

1032
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,440
 (laughing)

1033
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,080
 - But the really interesting thing I think about El Gurush

1034
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,320
 is that he was gonna be a football goalkeeper.

1035
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,040
 And as a kid, he was really, really good.

1036
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,880
 But his mum stopped him from doing it

1037
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,800
 because he would dive around in the mud,

1038
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,040
 and all of his clothes would get really dirty.

1039
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,480
 And so she said, "Oh, well, you know,

1040
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,640
 "I have to clean them all the time.

1041
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,760
 "Can you not do something that's a bit less dirty?"

1042
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,560
 And he went, "Okay, I'll be a runner instead."

1043
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,640
 And he became the best miler ever.

1044
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,640
 - Wow.

1045
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,520
 - Do you know who came up with the first steroid test

1046
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,920
 for athletes?

1047
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,320
 - Is it someone we'll have heard of?

1048
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,160
 - Norris.

1049
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,000
 Is it Norris?

1050
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,820
 - Yeah, you're really close.

1051
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,660
 - David Hartley.

1052
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,500
 - Oh, Hugh Beaver.

1053
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,840
 - No, it was a banister, wasn't it?

1054
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,680
 - It was a banister.

1055
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,520
 - Oh!

1056
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,360
 - Yeah.

1057
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,560
 It was banister who developed the first steroid test

1058
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,640
 as in 1973, 'cause he was big into, you know,

1059
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,720
 calling out people who took steroids in sports.

1060
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,680
 And other stuff he did, other medical stuff he did,

1061
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,960
 since that's all he wants us to know about him,

1062
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
 is he was into self-experimenting.

1063
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,800
 He was one of those doctors.

1064
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,620
 - Oh, really?

1065
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,460
 - Okay.

1066
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,300
 - Steroids.

1067
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,320
 (laughing)

1068
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,060
 - Yeah, later at the age of 45,

1069
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,400
 he ran out of two minutes.

1070
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,940
 (laughing)

1071
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,280
 - He, not steroids, with pyrogens, actually.

1072
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,120
 - Okay.

1073
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,420
 - Which are less fun.

1074
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,720
 They are chemicals that induce fever.

1075
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,800
 So he wanted to study fever.

1076
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,560
 So he injected himself with pyrogens,

1077
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,880
 and then he sat naked in a hot chamber for six hours,

1078
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,040
 which spiked his temperature to very dangerous levels

1079
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,400
 and turned him dark green.

1080
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,240
 - Wow.

1081
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,080
 - Dark green?

1082
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,920
 - Yeah.

1083
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,760
 - Do we believe that?

1084
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,520
 - We've got the story of the Accredible Hulk.

1085
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,580
 (laughing)

1086
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,520
 - And he said, I wouldn't perhaps recommend it.

1087
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,620
 - What, Bruce Banner, stirrer?

1088
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,460
 - We've passed.

1089
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,300
 - Oh my god.

1090
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,100
 - Oh, we blow this shit wide open.

1091
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,940
 (laughing)

1092
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,660
 - So long since we blew something wide open.

1093
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,880
 I'm so glad about that.

1094
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,460
 (laughing)

1095
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,300
 - Wow.

1096
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,900
 - Yeah, you'll see in a lot of his papers,

1097
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,420
 he'll refer to the study participant, R.B.

1098
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,220
 And it's always him, obviously.

1099
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,620
 - You mentioned earlier, Anna,

1100
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,620
 that he was quite tricky to interview sometimes,

1101
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,520
 because obviously he had two very different aspects

1102
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,440
 of his life.

1103
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,520
 So there was an interview by the Guardian,

1104
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,720
 I think in the early 2000s.

1105
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,040
 So he was getting on them,

1106
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,920
 but I just wanted to read you some of the--

1107
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,760
 - Yeah, go for it.

1108
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,680
 - Okay, he was asked a few questions.

1109
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,760
 Then he said, right, is there anything else

1110
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,800
 you want to know?

1111
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,560
 And the interviewer said, well, I'll be honest, sir.

1112
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,580
 Yes, what's your favorite biscuit?

1113
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,560
 Oh, I don't answer questions about biscuits.

1114
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,400
 (laughing)

1115
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,320
 Why not?

1116
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,640
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1117
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,840
 I'm not into biscuits.

1118
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,720
 (laughing)

1119
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,360
 - Now, what is he hiding?

1120
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,400
 That's the question.

1121
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,780
 The interviewer says, everybody likes a nice biscuit.

1122
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,380
 He says, well, I'm not sure what the purpose

1123
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,740
 of that aspect of the interview is.

1124
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,860
 It's quirky, game showy, odd.

1125
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,100
 (laughing)

1126
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,260
 All right, fair play to the Guardian interviewer.

1127
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,980
 He perseveres.

1128
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,300
 Cheese or chocolate?

1129
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,620
 No, no, no.

1130
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,220
 All right, I think you've got more than enough there.

1131
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,860
 What about pie fillings, steak and kidney

1132
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,280
 or chicken and mushroom?

1133
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,900
 Banister just says, thank you so much.

1134
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,900
 All the best.

1135
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,740
 (laughing)

1136
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,580
 Ends the interview.

1137
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,420
 - That's incredible.

1138
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,260
 What year is this?

1139
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,520
 2004 it was.

1140
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,360
 - Okay.

1141
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,120
 I'm just wondering, is this like the era of like,

1142
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,120
 you know, Dennis Penness and Ali G

1143
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,960
 and everyone's been primed not to answer stupid questions.

1144
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,800
 - I think you just hated us.

1145
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,360
 - I think that's just the point that's questioned

1146
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,200
 from a journalist.

1147
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,520
 In that journalist, I can really imagine doing

1148
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,360
 what that journalist has done,

1149
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,120
 which is not be able to remember anything else

1150
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,200
 that you might have asked him.

1151
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,040
 (laughing)

1152
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,400
 I'm just happy to keep going on.

1153
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,680
 - Or just quickly looking at, you know,

1154
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,520
 it's going off.

1155
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,320
 Fuck, what's your favorite sandwich?

1156
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,160
 (laughing)

1157
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,000
 Would you rather?

1158
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,820
 No, that's not going to work either.

1159
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,660
 Have you ever?

1160
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,500
 No.

1161
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,240
 (laughing)

1162
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,580
 I was, I was saying to you guys,

1163
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,860
 bizarrely, my brother helped him write

1164
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,780
 his last autobiography a few years ago,

1165
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,620
 which came out.

1166
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,180
 I think it's called "Twinsumthings".

1167
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,340
 And he said he was extremely nice.

1168
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,700
 And actually, particularly his wife,

1169
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,580
 my brother absolutely loved Moira.

1170
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,860
 And she'd always bring them warm beer

1171
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,220
 and sort of cold cuts for lunch.

1172
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,940
 - Any biscuits?

1173
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,140
 - Well, I read through that book

1174
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,840
 and there was no mention of Garibaldi.

1175
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,700
 So we went, "What's the matter?"

1176
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,900
 - Every time she wore biscuits in,

1177
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,120
 he'd flip the table.

1178
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,840
 (laughing)

1179
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,080
 - I saw him once at a,

1180
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,520
 the QI used to have a building in Oxford

1181
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,880
 and he came to one of the parties in a QI.

1182
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,580
 - He just ran in, had a drink, ran out.

1183
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,420
 - Yeah, exactly.

1184
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,240
 Yeah.

1185
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,480
 (laughing)

1186
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,000
 Yeah, but it was kind of like,

1187
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,040
 I don't know, in a weird way,

1188
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,280
 because he's someone who's a slightly obscure famous person.

1189
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,840
 It was sort of like spotting, you know, like a Bigfoot.

1190
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,040
 It was just like, "Wow, like look, a sighting of Bannister."

1191
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,880
 Quite exciting.

1192
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,040
 - I mean, he didn't like it,

1193
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,560
 but let's say he did like it.

1194
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,600
 Would you walk around even in your 80s

1195
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,480
 wearing your shorts and your like-

1196
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,320
 - Tank top thingy.

1197
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,040
 - Yeah, tank top thing.

1198
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,280
 - Carrying your record, what did he get?

1199
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,120
 - Medal?

1200
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,940
 - Must have got a medal or something.

1201
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,780
 - He was the year before you get

1202
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,620
 the Guinness World Records.

1203
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,460
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1204
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,280
 - Poor guy.

1205
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,120
 - So he didn't even have the-

1206
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,960
 - Missed it by a year.

1207
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,800
 - No proof.

1208
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
 - Because his record was then broken, wasn't it?

1209
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,680
 46 days later by John Landy, the Aussie.

1210
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,200
 And they ended up having an amazing run together,

1211
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,120
 which was part of a race,

1212
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,100
 which was known as the Miracle Mile Race.

1213
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,080
 It had a few different names.

1214
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,560
 And they went up against each other.

1215
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,400
 I mean, how exciting.

1216
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,880
 Two guys who had the records

1217
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,960
 trying to see who could beat them.

1218
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,220
 - I suppose that does happen

1219
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,120
 in pretty much every race meeting in the world.

1220
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,840
 - I suppose, yeah, that's true,

1221
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,320
 because you're always trying to break a record.

1222
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,160
 I guess this was-

1223
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,280
 - Very rare, Mo Farrow just racing

1224
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,760
 a bunch of primary school children's sports day.

1225
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,600
 Do you know what?

1226
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,040
 You should try racing other good runners.

1227
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,880
 - Yeah.

1228
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,520
 - I think Bannister said his race against Landy

1229
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,640
 was the thing he was really proudest of.

1230
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,480
 - Oh, really?

1231
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,920
 - 'Cause it was watched by 40 million people

1232
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,680
 when it was in Vancouver.

1233
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,920
 - And listened by a hundred million on the radio,

1234
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,360
 apparently. - Listened to by a hundred million.

1235
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,480
 - Bizarrely boring.

1236
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,000
 Just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

1237
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,440
 Is that what you hear when you listen to a race?

1238
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,720
 - Commentary, probably true, it probably be.

1239
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,560
 - Commentary.

1240
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,680
 - It's not a good commentator

1241
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,960
 if that's what they're saying the whole time.

1242
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,840
 Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

1243
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,680
 So in that race, they were both, you know,

1244
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,320
 neck for neck the entire time.

1245
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,240
 And Bannister's behind him.

1246
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,080
 And-

1247
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,080
 - That's not what neck for neck.

1248
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,920
 - Yeah.

1249
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,400
 So he was kind of like putting his neck out,

1250
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,480
 touching the back of it.

1251
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,720
 - It's neck and neck, I think.

1252
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,560
 - Yeah.

1253
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,400
 - Not neck for neck.

1254
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,240
 - No, I've never-

1255
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,000
 - And neck for neck and eye for eyes.

1256
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,200
 - That's the Bible, yeah.

1257
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,000
 I think they were neck and neck, I'm sorry too.

1258
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,840
 - No, no, that's fine.

1259
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,040
 I would not make a good commentator either.

1260
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,480
 - Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

1261
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,320
 - Yep, they're neck for neck.

1262
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,560
 - They were neck and neck in front of one in front of the other.

1263
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,400
 Yeah.

1264
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,960
 - So Bannister's right behind him and he's covered up.

1265
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,520
 And on the final corner, Landy looks over left

1266
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,600
 on his shoulder and as he looks over left,

1267
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,240
 Bannister takes over on the right.

1268
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,800
 And that was the famous moment where-

1269
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,640
 - He tapped him on the shoulder before he did it.

1270
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,680
 (all laughing)

1271
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,200
 - I wanna put a ghost on the running track.

1272
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,400
 I think we need to redo it.

1273
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,600
 (all laughing)

1274
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,200
 - So that was the big moment.

1275
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,240
 And this moment has been-

1276
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,600
 - Then he stole his nose.

1277
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,400
 (all laughing)

1278
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,240
 - And then his thumb came off and it was like,

1279
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,080
 "Whoa!"

1280
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,720
 (all laughing)

1281
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,320
 - Anyway, the prize money that Landy got

1282
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,040
 was retrieved from behind his ear actually.

1283
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,200
 (all laughing)

1284
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,780
 (upbeat music)

1285
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,480
 - Okay, it is time for fact number four.

1286
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,560
 And that is my fact.

1287
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,160
 My fact this week is that when the movie Ulysses

1288
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,080
 was released in New Zealand in 1967,

1289
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,280
 sensors were so worried about it

1290
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,440
 that men and women weren't allowed to watch it

1291
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,640
 at the same time.

1292
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,040
 So they literally had to be placed in different cinemas

1293
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,840
 if they wanted to go and see it.

1294
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,320
 And that continued on for years.

1295
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,160
 So there was a showing of it at a university

1296
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,760
 in New Zealand in 1972.

1297
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,720
 And even then they still had,

1298
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,240
 they allowed men and women in the same room,

1299
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,920
 but they had to sit on either side of the cinema.

1300
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,800
 - Okay, so is it because it's so sexy?

1301
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,960
 - It's sexy, it's sweary, it was just debauched city.

1302
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,800
 It was-

1303
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,960
 - You see, because I can see if it's sexy

1304
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,240
 that you don't want men and women sat next to each other,

1305
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,080
 right?

1306
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,920
 - 'Cause they might have sex with each other.

1307
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,360
 - They might, just straight like that, you know.

1308
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,280
 That's what happened when I watched.

1309
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,440
 Stop on my mom.

1310
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,840
 (all laughing)

1311
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,280
 - And you weren't on your own to sit on that movie,

1312
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,000
 so that poor person next to you.

1313
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,560
 - I could see half way through that sense

1314
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,640
 as that was going the other way.

1315
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,200
 But then like if it was a sweary part of it,

1316
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,520
 it doesn't make sense if they're in the same room, right?

1317
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,680
 - No, it was a mixture of the sexiness and of the swearing.

1318
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,280
 And in the room, there was a rope

1319
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,800
 that went down the center of the audience.

1320
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,400
 And so you had the men and women still,

1321
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,920
 there was one row, like one line down the center

1322
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,880
 where men and women could have had sex with a rope.

1323
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,160
 - Well, just like the rope was sort of,

1324
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,840
 there was no aisle between them.

1325
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,160
 They were literally in a seat next to someone, yeah.

1326
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,320
 - If there's just a piece of rope in between you

1327
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,440
 and a person, you can still have sex with them.

1328
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,800
 - It's a pretty weak barrier to ardor, I would say.

1329
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,400
 - Yeah, I got this fact, by the way,

1330
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,040
 from a brilliant book called "The Land Before Avocado"

1331
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,320
 and it's by a guy called Richard Glover,

1332
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,640
 who I've met in Australia when we were on tour there.

1333
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,560
 He actually, I went on his radio show.

1334
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,720
 So he's a big journalist and broadcaster.

1335
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,640
 He's written a bunch of books.

1336
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,760
 - What's the title referring to?

1337
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,040
 - Well, avocado is absolutely abundant in Australia

1338
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,880
 as a breakfast item.

1339
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,880
 And he's talking about the old Australia.

1340
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,720
 So avocado is sort of the new world of Australia.

1341
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,560
 - Got it.

1342
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,400
 - And the book is all about all the olden days

1343
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,480
 and how things used to be.

1344
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,280
 And Ulysses was actually banned in Australia,

1345
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,760
 which is where it comes up, the book as well as the movie.

1346
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,960
 - So this is James Joyce's "Ulysses", I should say.

1347
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,840
 - Yeah, James Joyce's, you haven't read the book,

1348
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,180
 now don't see the film.

1349
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,400
 (all laughing)

1350
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,640
 But yeah, so he mentions that it was allowed in New Zealand,

1351
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,960
 but then they had this segregation thing

1352
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,080
 between the men and the women.

1353
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,920
 - Very funny.

1354
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,400
 - And you said that it was the film as well, wasn't it?

1355
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,240
 There was one in Australia and South Africa, I think.

1356
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,200
 - Quite a lot of places, there was a band in Ireland.

1357
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,360
 - Yeah.

1358
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,600
 - The band in Ireland was only lifted in the year 2000.

1359
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,440
 - Yeah.

1360
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,840
 - That was a long band.

1361
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,720
 And I think Ireland's justice secretary

1362
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,280
 sent his secretary to go and see the movie

1363
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,920
 and reported back that if this film was allowed,

1364
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,240
 it would discredit the Irish government,

1365
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,460
 so it can't be permitted.

1366
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,300
 - Yeah.

1367
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,140
 - It was the first film shown in Britain

1368
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,360
 to feature the F-word.

1369
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,200
 - Ooh.

1370
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,040
 - Ooh.

1371
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:02,880
 - Spicy.

1372
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,720
 - Yeah.

1373
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,560
 - It's really interesting.

1374
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,360
 It was made by a guy called Joseph Strick

1375
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,520
 and he was a massive fan of the book.

1376
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,760
 So his initial pitch for making the movie

1377
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,440
 was he wanted to do it verbatim,

1378
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,520
 so it was gonna be 18 hours long.

1379
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,520
 He wanted every bit of dialogue

1380
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,840
 that was in the book.

1381
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,680
 - Marley, Marley.

1382
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,520
 - Got talked out of it,

1383
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,320
 so it eventually ended up being two hours long.

1384
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,400
 But then when it came out,

1385
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,400
 he was very angry about the response of all these bannings

1386
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,220
 in the way that people were treating the film.

1387
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,600
 And there was one famous incident

1388
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,960
 where they showed the movie in Cannes

1389
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,240
 at the film festival.

1390
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,220
 And this was at the 1967 one.

1391
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,340
 It had French titles along the bottom.

1392
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,960
 And during the film,

1393
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,740
 where it got to a particularly spicy bit,

1394
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,040
 they had, using their hands,

1395
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,800
 scribbled out the translation

1396
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,920
 in French subtitle of what was being said.

1397
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,960
 So Strick saw this,

1398
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,720
 thought, you're messing with my movie.

1399
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,800
 Ran up, ran to the projection booth,

1400
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,760
 where he was met by the committee of the film festival

1401
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,080
 who knew that he'd rush in there.

1402
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,560
 And then he was forcibly ejected, according to him.

1403
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,920
 He said he was pushed down the steps

1404
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,520
 and suffered a broken foot.

1405
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,960
 And so he withdrew the film from Cannes altogether.

1406
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,360
 - The reason that he loved the book

1407
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,360
 is that his father had smuggled a copy into America

1408
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,760
 because it was illegal in lots of countries

1409
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,000
 at the start of the 20th century.

1410
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,400
 And his father smuggled this copy into America

1411
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,720
 and would just keep it in the house

1412
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,800
 and leave it on the table

1413
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,280
 so that whenever anyone came around,

1414
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,440
 they would say, oh, that's that dirty book, isn't it?

1415
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,280
 Like Ulysses.

1416
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,140
 And then like, even though no one had read it,

1417
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,400
 they would still argue about it,

1418
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,080
 about censorship and stuff like that.

1419
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,160
 - Yeah, well, it was really,

1420
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,680
 so I think 1920, the very early 20s,

1421
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,760
 it was published, '23, I think.

1422
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,800
 And it was, you know, it was printed.

1423
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,720
 It was, 'cause he wrote it in '18, didn't he?

1424
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,720
 And it was serialized,

1425
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,360
 but maybe it was published in Britain in '23, do you mean?

1426
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,520
 - Well, 500 copies were burnt at Folkstone in 1923.

1427
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,640
 So I think that was an attempt to import it.

1428
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,280
 - It was published in France in 1922.

1429
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,240
 That was in Paris by an American woman called Sylvia Beach.

1430
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,200
 She opened a shop and she had these copies of Ulysses

1431
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,200
 that she managed to get.

1432
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,760
 And she sold them for 10 times more

1433
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,040
 than any other book in the shop

1434
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,240
 'cause she knew that everyone would want to get

1435
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,760
 the hands on this book.

1436
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,160
 But still they managed to get them,

1437
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,640
 still they paid for them.

1438
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,240
 And she removed the copy from the store window

1439
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,320
 'cause she thought that people would start throwing bricks

1440
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,640
 in her store and stuff like that.

1441
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,440
 - Still none of the buyers ever read it.

1442
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,920
 I think we can guarantee all of these places,

1443
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,760
 all of these people.

1444
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,600
 - Beach was really brave.

1445
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,320
 So the book was sued in New York

1446
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,960
 by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice,

1447
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,800
 and it was convicted for being obscene.

1448
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,640
 - They were fun people.

1449
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,000
 - Yeah, but then after that,

1450
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,240
 Beach published it in Paris.

1451
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,400
 And part of the reason it was controversial

1452
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,880
 was when it was printed in extract in the USA,

1453
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,480
 even the printers themselves said,

1454
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,600
 this is outrageous, we're not working on this.

1455
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,280
 And then when she was in Paris,

1456
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,440
 French printers were obviously harder to offend

1457
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,440
 with English filth

1458
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,760
 because they don't understand the language

1459
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,680
 that they're printing in.

1460
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,080
 - And that'd be French, like Madame Bovary.

1461
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,880
 - Web it through, web it through, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1462
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,920
 They're used to this sort of.

1463
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,440
 - Madame Bovary's not that sexy.

1464
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,280
 - Are you joking?

1465
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,440
 - There's some shit in a carriage.

1466
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,960
 Come on, it's much more subtle

1467
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,520
 than what Ulysses sounds like.

1468
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,600
 - Pretty raunchy stuff, Madame Bovary.

1469
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,920
 - Okay.

1470
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,880
 - Andi's Bar is quite different to you.

1471
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,800
 - I'm still lobbying to ban Madame Bovary.

1472
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,120
 (all laughing)

1473
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,440
 - But so, Norsica was the chapter in America

1474
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,800
 that was seen from Ulysses.

1475
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
 So they were publishing these extracts.

1476
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,480
 And in the chapter that suddenly raised the concern,

1477
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,680
 Leopold Bloom, one of the lead characters of the book,

1478
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,760
 Ulysses. - He's the lead, I think.

1479
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,600
 - He leads the main guy.

1480
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,200
 - He's not sharing it with many people.

1481
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,840
 Maybe Molly.

1482
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,800
 - Yeah, I was thinking Molly.

1483
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,300
 So it's a scene in this chapter

1484
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,280
 where he's masturbating on a beach

1485
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,080
 while gazing at a 17-year-old girl called Goethe McDowell.

1486
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,080
 And that's what they took exception to.

1487
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,960
 Do they have scenes like that in Madame Bovary?

1488
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,380
 - It's not quite that much, is it?

1489
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,220
 - I don't remember.

1490
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,560
 - Or in fact, another scene.

1491
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,520
 And this is just saving anyone the trouble

1492
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,360
 of actually reading it

1493
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,200
 'cause we're just telling you

1494
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,880
 the couple of fun bits, so you don't have to bother.

1495
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,560
 But apparently there's one scene in a, I haven't read it.

1496
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,320
 There's one scene in a Dublin brothel

1497
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,880
 where Leopold Bloom transforms into a woman

1498
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,180
 and then gives birth to octoplets

1499
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,620
 before the brothel, Madame,

1500
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,500
 who then turns into a man

1501
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,940
 and starts auctioning off blooms

1502
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,340
 like prostitution services and demonstrates.

1503
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,540
 So Bloom's now a woman with a vagina.

1504
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,780
 And so the brothel, Madame,

1505
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,400
 demonstrates how good a prostitute that he'd make

1506
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,820
 by shoving her arm up his vagina.

1507
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,660
 - Yeah, okay.

1508
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,660
 - Also doesn't happen.

1509
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,060
 Oh, it shoves her arm up the vagina

1510
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,740
 and then shoves it into the bidder's face

1511
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,180
 to be like, look, how good is that?

1512
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,180
 - There's another line.

1513
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,460
 I actually started reading Ulysses at the start of the year

1514
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,460
 when my daughter was born

1515
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,140
 and I had a lot of time in the middle of the night

1516
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,980
 sat there with nothing else to do.

1517
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,300
 And I got through quite, no, not much of it,

1518
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,220
 but then I started listening to the audio book,

1519
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,700
 the RTE version, which actually I got through most of.

1520
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,140
 I didn't get through to the end.

1521
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,780
 And it gets really racy at the end.

1522
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,740
 So I'm a bit gutted that I haven't got there yet.

1523
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,800
 But anyway, there was this line,

1524
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,260
 and I did tweet this at the time,

1525
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:00,660
 which is, "Haines helped himself and snapped the case too.

1526
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,740
 He put it back in his side pocket

1527
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,780
 and took from his waistcoat pocket

1528
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,060
 a nickel tinder box, sprang it open too,

1529
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,220
 and having lit his cigarette,

1530
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,260
 held the flaming spunk towards Stephen

1531
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,940
 in the shell of his hands."

1532
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,220
 - What?

1533
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,060
 - And so that's-

1534
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,580
 - Sorry, when did the spunk come in before that move?

1535
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,260
 - The reason is that the word spunk

1536
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,220
 just doesn't mean what it means today.

1537
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,060
 - Oh, really?

1538
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,220
 - It meant like a little bit of flame

1539
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,620
 or a little bit of, you know,

1540
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,260
 if you like to match a little bit of flame

1541
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,500
 sort of flies away.

1542
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,980
 That used to be called a spunk.

1543
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:33,820
 - Oh, okay.

1544
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,780
 - Flaming spunk.

1545
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,820
 - I guess it is a sort of fly away thing.

1546
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,860
 It flies off and away.

1547
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,700
 - Yeah.

1548
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,300
 - I'm sure there's some etymological reason, golly.

1549
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,860
 - Do you know the day Ulysses was set,

1550
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,300
 which is famously one day, June the 16th, 1904,

1551
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,100
 is the day that James Joyce first got a handjob

1552
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,420
 from his wife.

1553
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,260
 - Is it?

1554
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,100
 - Yeah.

1555
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,940
 - Bloom's day.

1556
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:56,780
 - It's to commemorate that day, exactly.

1557
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,620
 - Really?

1558
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,460
 So that's why it's to commemorate?

1559
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,420
 - Yeah, he said it then.

1560
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,740
 It was their first date.

1561
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,940
 Is it to commemorate the first date?

1562
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,340
 Is it to commemorate the handjob?

1563
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,260
 Is there a difference?

1564
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,060
 - Is, I don't know, but also Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes

1565
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,220
 married on that day.

1566
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,060
 - Did they?

1567
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:10,940
 - In commemoration of Bloom's Day,

1568
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,260
 not the handjob.

1569
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,660
 It looked more about when the day was set.

1570
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,500
 - Yeah.

1571
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,660
 - I wonder if she gave him a handjob

1572
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,260
 in proper commemoration.

1573
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,740
 - You may now kiss the bride,

1574
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,780
 and you may now...

1575
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,620
 Oh.

1576
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,180
 (laughing)

1577
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,940
 The person who banned the book in the UK,

1578
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,740
 this was in 1922.

1579
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,900
 It was the government that banned it,

1580
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,380
 but the person whose idea it was

1581
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,260
 was a guy called Sir Archibald Bodkin.

1582
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,460
 And he issued an official opinion

1583
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,700
 saying that it was a filthy buck,

1584
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,580
 and it should not be allowed to be imported

1585
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,860
 into the country, and the government agreed.

1586
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,620
 And I was reading about Sir Archibald Bodkin.

1587
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:51,940
 Apparently he was a man of unwavering Victorian sensibilities.

1588
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,180
 This is according to an author, Kevin Birmingham,

1589
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,780
 who was writing about Ulysses.

1590
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,260
 They said, "On the rare occasions that he told a body joke,

1591
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,260
 "he drained away the humour by delivering the punchline

1592
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,100
 "with a disapproving glare."

1593
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,220
 (laughing)

1594
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,340
 - Why are you looking at me, James?

1595
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,180
 (laughing)

1596
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,180
 I don't know what you're trying to say here.

1597
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,020
 - I love that.

1598
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:10,860
 - That's so funny.

1599
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,100
 - I'd love to see his live at the Apollo set.

1600
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,980
 (laughing)

1601
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,260
 - Furious when the audience laughs.

1602
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,100
 - Shut up.

1603
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,500
 - Just on films that are banned.

1604
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,340
 - Oh yeah.

1605
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,180
 - Oh yeah.

1606
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,380
 - The Wikipedia film, which films are banned where,

1607
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,220
 is great.

1608
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:27,220
 So, 'cause it's quite nationally specific in lots of cases.

1609
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:31,420
 So, "Cuba," for example, has banned the films,

1610
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:36,420
 "Red Zone Cuba," "Cuba Crossing," "Red Dawn," "Cuban Love."

1611
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,100
 - Any movie would "Cuba Gooding Jr."

1612
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,260
 (laughing)

1613
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,380
 - Without Havana.

1614
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,620
 And finally, "Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay."

1615
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,100
 (laughing)

1616
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,580
 - Okay, that's understandable.

1617
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,060
 - There's one film called "Titanic" from 1943,

1618
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,740
 it's a 1943 Titanic of the original,

1619
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,700
 which was banned by the Nazi government,

1620
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,060
 despite the fact that it had been made

1621
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,780
 by the Nazi propaganda department.

1622
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,700
 - Oh, I remember that one, yeah.

1623
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,540
 - Yeah.

1624
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,980
 - Why, was it like a practice run

1625
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,180
 to check how well they banned stuff?

1626
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,420
 - I think Goebbels decided it would weaken morale,

1627
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,020
 because there was lots of bombing happening

1628
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,860
 in Germany at the time.

1629
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,900
 And Goebbels decided that, because this film

1630
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,460
 featured a lot of deaths on the Titanic,

1631
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,700
 that it would weaken morale in Germany.

1632
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,860
 So, there were some test screenings outside Germany,

1633
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,980
 but it was never shown in Germany.

1634
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,580
 It was also then obviously banned by the Allies,

1635
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,700
 because it was Nazi propaganda.

1636
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,460
 - So, there was basically nowhere this film

1637
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,860
 was allowed to be shown.

1638
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,780
 - Yeah.

1639
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,380
 - Do you guys do the film "Too Cool for Christmas?"

1640
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,220
 - No. - No.

1641
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,180
 - Not familiar with that.

1642
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,980
 - Do you know the film "A Very Cool Christmas?"

1643
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,820
 - No.

1644
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,940
 - Right, well, they're both the same film.

1645
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,420
 They're about a girl who wants to go skiing

1646
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,700
 instead of spending Christmas with her parents.

1647
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,700
 But in one of them, in "A Very Cool Christmas,"

1648
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,500
 the girl's parents are a female and male

1649
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,860
 heterosexual couple.

1650
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,300
 And in "Too Cool for Christmas,"

1651
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,860
 her parents are two male gay fathers.

1652
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:51,700
 - Right, okay.

1653
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,180
 - And it's exactly the same.

1654
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,220
 But the films are exactly the same as each other.

1655
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,900
 They just re-filmed every single scene involving the parents,

1656
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,220
 which I imagine is quite a lot of scenes.

1657
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,340
 - And they just show them in different parts of America.

1658
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,380
 - Or different parts of the world.

1659
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,580
 - That was pretty much exactly it.

1660
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,300
 It was for America, it was 2004.

1661
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,660
 And it's this director who is called Sam Irvin,

1662
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,180
 who's a gay director who wanted to do the plotline

1663
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,620
 about the gay dads.

1664
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,620
 But couldn't get the budget for the LGBTQ station

1665
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,700
 that he wanted to put it on.

1666
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,380
 So he also sold it to Lifetime TV,

1667
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,820
 a rather traditionalist TV station.

1668
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,460
 So he also got a mom.

1669
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,980
 - I want to go to like a traditional

1670
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,700
 Orthodox American family and show them the first film,

1671
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,540
 the one with the heterosexual couple,

1672
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,900
 and then show them the other one and say,

1673
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,220
 "You know what, they've done this for all the films."

1674
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:52,220
 (all laughing)

1675
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,220
 - Okay, that's it.

1676
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,220
 That is all of our facts.

1677
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,580

 You might just want to do that.

1704

 don't worry, you don't need to,

1712

1713
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,900
 We are not going behind a paywall.

00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,580

00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,700
 for the rest of its days.

1716
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,980
 So the best way you could support us,

1717
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,060
 if you don't want to do Club Fish,

1718
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,740
 is simply just keep listening.

1719
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,540
 Just keep bringing your ears to the party

1720
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,300
 and maybe tell your friends about it too.

1721
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,740
 We want to be spreading these facts

1722
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,180
 to as many people as possible.

1723
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,260
 And the only way we do that

1724
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,140
 is by having listeners like you tell your friends about it.

1725
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,420
 We will be back again next week with a very special guest.

1726
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,140
 We'll see you then, goodbye.

1727
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,720
