00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everybody, I hope you're all keeping safe and well and 99% indoors. I just wanted to let you"
00:00:06,00:00:11,"know about a very exciting guest we've got on the show today. It is historian Greg Jenner,"
00:00:11,00:00:16,"you'll probably recognize him from his previous appearances on this show or from his own podcast,"
00:00:16,00:00:21,"Your Dead To Me, which is sort of a comedy history podcast. He gets fantastic guests on. It's"
00:00:21,00:00:26,really a great listen and he also has a book out at the moment. He has a brand new book called
00:00:26,00:00:30,Dead Famous. It's about the history of celebrity. I've already started reading it. It's a
00:00:30,00:00:36,relicking good read. It covers a whole bunch of historic celebrities from the 1700s onwards.
00:00:36,00:00:41,"And if you thought that throwing your underwear at celebrities was a modern phenomenon, then"
00:00:41,00:00:46,"don't you worry, it's got historic precedent. You can always use that as your defence."
00:00:46,00:00:52,"You'll find out that and lots more stuff in his book, so that's Dead Famous. Go all to the book"
00:00:52,00:00:57,"now, Dead Famous by Greg Jenner. And spoiler alert, you're about to hear about one of those"
00:00:57,00:01:02,"historic celebrities in the upcoming podcast. So with that further ado, let's get on with the show!"
00:01:17,00:01:24,"Hello and welcome to another working from home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly"
00:01:24,00:01:31,podcast coming to you from our respective solitary pods. My name is Anna Toshinsky and I am
00:01:31,00:01:37,"sitting here in my home and in their homes we have James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:01:37,00:01:42,"historian Greg Jenner. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:01:42,00:01:49,"facts from the last seven days in no particular order. Here we go, starting with you, Greg."
00:01:49,00:01:55,"Thank you very much. Okay, my fact is in 1825, Britain's most famous actor was nearly murdered"
00:01:55,00:02:04,"by his own furious audience. Was he murdering a role at the time? No, no, it's quite a complicated"
00:02:04,00:02:10,story. His name was Edmund Kean and he was an absolute genius. He was the greatest actor of the 19th
00:02:10,00:02:14,"century. Still to this day, greatly revered as a Shakespearean actor, but he was an absolute"
00:02:14,00:02:19,bellend. He was just the worst guy. I love him. He's my favourite. He's sort of the star of my new
00:02:19,00:02:25,"book because he, everything he does is just great and bad simultaneously. Such mixed messages here."
00:02:25,00:02:32,"He had been, this was in America at the time. This was his second American tour. It's 1825. He's in"
00:02:32,00:02:38,the city of Boston and previously he'd been there in 1821 and he had basically angered the crowd
00:02:38,00:02:42,by refusing to go on because they weren't enough people in the audience. He's a bit of a diva.
00:02:42,00:02:46,"And he'd sort of, you know, he'd looked around the curtain and gone, no, there's not enough people."
00:02:46,00:02:52,I'm Edmund Kean. I'm the great Edmund Kean. I'm refusing to go on. It basically left us sort of
00:02:52,00:02:58,"sour taste in the mouth. The Bostonians told him to never come back. And then in 1825, he comes back"
00:02:58,00:03:03,and he's just come off the back of a huge sex scandal and he thinks he'll run to America and
00:03:03,00:03:07,"get away from the scandal in Britain, but they'll read the papers. So he turns up,"
00:03:07,00:03:12,"comes back to New York, they chuck oranges at his head, which is, you know, not too bad,"
00:03:12,00:03:16,"but he gets the Boston and 5,000 people storm the theatre and try and kill him."
00:03:16,00:03:20,"Wow. Oh my goodness. 5,000. That's quite a big gig."
00:03:20,00:03:27,It's huge. That's what I get it out of that. I read that they turned up after the start of the show.
00:03:27,00:03:33,"They do, yeah. His audience was probably several hundred people and then an extra 5,000 sort of"
00:03:33,00:03:37,"break down the door, smash their way in. That's kind of good news and bad news, isn't it? Because"
00:03:37,00:03:41,"on the, you know, good news, 5,000 more people want to come and see you, but the bad news is they also want"
00:03:41,00:03:47,"to kill you. Yeah, they probably weren't paying, I guess. No. And what happened? Did he, presumably,"
00:03:47,00:03:52,"he survived, right? Yeah, he does. He throws down his wig, he runs out the back door. He sprints"
00:03:52,00:03:58,"up the street and he hides in, I think it's one of the theatre employees houses around the corner."
00:03:58,00:04:03,"And he runs in the door and hides in the linen basket. Oh wow. It's so clever. It's so clever,"
00:04:03,00:04:09,"because he's an actor. He's a master of disguise. But for him, just taking off a wig is a disguise."
00:04:09,00:04:16,"You know what I mean? True, but the audience do track him down and they come to the door. But luckily,"
00:04:16,00:04:21,the theatre employees wife is pregnant and it sort of calms them down. I guess she comes to the door
00:04:21,00:04:27,"looking, you know, vulnerable and sort of like, please don't stall my house. And they kind of go,"
00:04:27,00:04:32,"""Oh yeah, right then, I guess. I guess we won't murder the English guy."" So he gets away with it"
00:04:32,00:04:36,"and comes back to Britain. And then, is this right Greg, that then he carried on the torch?"
00:04:36,00:04:43,"This is what I love about Edmund Keane. He doesn't really take his subtle cues very well. So yeah,"
00:04:43,00:04:48,"he carried on with the tour. Well, it can only get better from that quite low starting point,"
00:04:48,00:04:53,"presumably. Well, I read that the rest of the tour, he did Philadelphia, but there were protests."
00:04:53,00:04:59,"And then he did Baltimore, but the night was cancelled when a mob refused to let the curtain go up."
00:04:59,00:05:04,"And then he did Charleston and the crowd loved it. So it was such a, we've all had those tours,"
00:05:04,00:05:09,"haven't we? Well, you kind of do Norwich and it's good and then Bristol and it's good and then you"
00:05:09,00:05:15,"do Dunstable and you get chased out by a bang mob. And then, Greg, I want to know if this is true,"
00:05:15,00:05:20,right? I read this in a book called Rogues and Vagabons by Vivian Ellicott and they said that he
00:05:20,00:05:26,then did a Canadian tour and he got really drunk after one of the gigs and then disappeared and
00:05:26,00:05:32,"went to live with some Native Americans. Yeah, he's not true. It's true. He is made an honorary member"
00:05:32,00:05:38,of the Huron Native Indigenous tribe there. They give him a full ceremony and he wears the stuff
00:05:38,00:05:42,back in London. He wears the sort of the head of the rest and the clothes. He's got a pet lion as well
00:05:42,00:05:48,which he walks around London with. Is it true that he did the gig and then he just disappeared
00:05:48,00:05:52,and no one could find him anywhere and eventually turned up in a wig lamp? But this was pig Edmund
00:05:52,00:05:58,"Kean. This was him to a tee. He was famous for vanishing mid dinner party, mid gig. I mean,"
00:05:58,00:06:03,my favourite story before he becomes famous is that he was merely playing Charles II in a play
00:06:03,00:06:07,and he doesn't turn up for the gig. The theatre manager has to go on in his stead. It doesn't really
00:06:07,00:06:11,know the lines. The audience start booing because the play is going poorly. The manager is sort of
00:06:11,00:06:16,looking down at his script trying to read the lines as he is on stage and suddenly a voice
00:06:16,00:06:20,"calls out from the royal box and it's this voice going, ""Keep going lad, you're doing really well."""
00:06:21,00:06:28,"Edmund Kean and he has drunkenly, he's arranging alcoholics. He's stumbled off to the pub. He's got a"
00:06:28,00:06:33,"skin fall. He suddenly goes, ""I'm meant to be in the theatre but he can't remember how or why."""
00:06:33,00:06:39,So he's stumbled into the theatre to watch his own play and then what's lovely is that he starts out
00:06:39,00:06:43,with encouraging heckles and then gradually he starts to agree with the audience that the play is
00:06:43,00:06:49,crap and starts heckling his own cast mate and is then carried out or forced out by security and
00:06:49,00:06:55,"fired from the gig. He was a minor child star. He played in playoffs, didn't he? He was his first"
00:06:55,00:06:59,role when he was six. That's right. So the thing you should know about Edmund Kean is that he's
00:06:59,00:07:04,very small and he's very weird looking. He kind of looks a bit like Steve Pashemi. He's kind of
00:07:04,00:07:10,"got these furious features and as a kid he was a brilliant gymnast. So his mum, who was a bit"
00:07:10,00:07:14,"of an absent mum but at one point she was in his life, she described to him in the sort of"
00:07:14,00:07:19,plays as a sort of child genius but he was actually a teenager. Basically he was so small
00:07:19,00:07:25,that he could pass for a child but he was in his teens. So he was briefly famous in his teens.
00:07:25,00:07:31,Then he had an absolute disaster and was a wandering actor who nearly starved to death on several
00:07:31,00:07:37,occasions. At one point he and his pregnant wife walk 118 miles from Birmingham to Swansea for a gig.
00:07:37,00:07:41,They don't have any money and they're sleeping in hedges in the height of summer. She's seven months
00:07:41,00:07:46,"pregnant. Oh, really rough ridges. No one he didn't know how to deal with the enormous wealth when"
00:07:46,00:07:51,"it came. It really is. He literally overnight fame, literally overnight. It's incredible."
00:07:51,00:07:55,"But that's a lot of planning to get to, if you know we've got a gig in Swansea in a fortnight."
00:07:55,00:08:00,"Yeah, well you can now, you can buckle your hedges in that bounce back."
00:08:00,00:08:08,So we should say that Kean was as well as being a bit of a rogue was as you said a brilliant actor
00:08:08,00:08:13,"apparently, as far as we know, right? And I think William Haslop was very impressed with him and sort of"
00:08:13,00:08:20,"friend of the show. Friend of the show. Big willy age, yep. Good old willy age. You sort of kick"
00:08:20,00:08:26,"started his career, although he was asked to give a review. So I went to see him in, I think it was"
00:08:26,00:08:30,"playing Shylock, his first big role. And he was asked to give a favourable review, which I didn't"
00:08:30,00:08:34,"realise people do. You sent a review to the theatre, but you'd say yeah, but make it a really good"
00:08:34,00:08:38,"review. So Haslop had to be a bit like, look, I was asked to give a favourable review, but I really"
00:08:38,00:08:44,"do mean it this time. It's great. But he was particularly good at villains, it seems. I think,"
00:08:44,00:08:49,"wasn't he? He seemed to play, he played Richard III very well, he played ERGO, he played Shylock,"
00:08:49,00:08:54,"and he played this guy called Sir Giles Overreach, and I'd never heard of this play,"
00:08:54,00:08:58,but apparently it was one of the most popular plays in the 19th century. It's called A New Way To Pay Old
00:08:58,00:09:04,"Dead, and it was written by a contemporary almost contemporary of Shakespeare just after him. And it"
00:09:04,00:09:11,"sounds great, it's by a guy called Philip Massinger, and he wrote about 50 plays apparently, and we've"
00:09:11,00:09:16,"lost about half of them, and a whole bunch of them we've lost because they were collected by an"
00:09:16,00:09:23,"antiquarian sort of book collector, and his cook, who was called Betsy Baker, fittingly, didn't"
00:09:23,00:09:29,"realise how precious they were, and used them all as pie baking dish liners, so they were just there"
00:09:29,00:09:34,"to line dishes for pastry, and we've lost them. But he was this great, he's not known at all,"
00:09:34,00:09:40,"anymore, is he? No, a lot of playwrights of that period actually don't really have a modern"
00:09:40,00:09:44,"reputation, it's kind of interesting, but I mean, it reminds me that by a tapestry was briefly used,"
00:09:44,00:09:50,"I think, as a wagon covering. I think so, but yeah, I mean several sort of priceless things now,"
00:09:50,00:09:55,"you kind of look back and go, there was a brief period where we were basically using that as blue tag."
00:09:55,00:10:02,"And I read, just going back on to Keen, he became very rich very quickly, like you said, then he was"
00:10:02,00:10:07,"living in London, so he's living in quite high society, but he also had, he was a bit rough around"
00:10:07,00:10:13,"the edges, as we've learned, right? So I read that he, people used to make fun of him because he was"
00:10:13,00:10:18,"sprinkled Greek and Latin into the conversation, but he wouldn't really know what they mean, like Delboi?"
00:10:18,00:10:22,"Yeah, yeah, and it's one of my favourite facts about him, one of the reasons I love him, and he's"
00:10:22,00:10:26,"absolutely my favourite, because on the one hand, he's such an asshole, on the other hand,"
00:10:26,00:10:32,"he's sort of man of the people, he didn't speak Greek or Latin, but he didn't let that stop him,"
00:10:32,00:10:37,"and so he would go to dinner with his posh friends, Lord Byron and William has let he hang out with"
00:10:37,00:10:42,"the king and the princes, and he would stand up and give a speech in dead languages that he couldn't"
00:10:42,00:10:47,"speak to people who spoke them, so he was like the opposite of Boris Johnson, Boris Johnson obviously"
00:10:47,00:10:51,speaks dead languages to people who can't speak them as a way of showing off how clever he is. Edmund
00:10:51,00:10:58,"Keen did the opposite, and everyone was like that is not Latin. But what I like is that he would leave,"
00:10:58,00:11:02,"he sort of midway through the speech, he'd be like, yeah, this isn't really working, and I don't"
00:11:02,00:11:06,"really like these people anyway. My people are my drinking buddies, the wolves, and his drinking club"
00:11:06,00:11:11,"were called the wolves, and they were all kind of this rowdy bunch of people he'd meet in the pub,"
00:11:11,00:11:15,"and so he'd leave these parties midway through a speech or whatever, it wouldn't say goodbye,"
00:11:15,00:11:20,"he'd just go, and he'd be found a week later, comatose in the floor of a pub in Depford, surrounded by"
00:11:20,00:11:25,"his drinking buddies. But what's brilliant about Keen is that he was also incredibly vengeful,"
00:11:25,00:11:31,"he was such a petty guy, and so he used the wolves as his own personal kind of fan group to go and"
00:11:31,00:11:38,"boo every actor who'd ever sort of wronged him, or any stage manager who hadn't hired him, or anyone"
00:11:38,00:11:41,"who'd ever crossed him in his entire career, he would use the wolves to go and sit in the front row"
00:11:41,00:11:48,"and just boo and heckle the entire play. So cool. Here's a thing Greg that I read, and I want to know if"
00:11:48,00:11:53,"this is true or not, so Keen was considered to be the best actor in England, which is true, I think."
00:11:53,00:12:00,"But what that was like was like being a heavyweight boxer, and whenever another upstart kind of actor"
00:12:00,00:12:06,"came along, they would challenge you to say, I'm a better actor, and the way they would do this"
00:12:06,00:12:12,"is have a contest of a fellow, whoever was the best actor would be a fellow, and whoever the"
00:12:12,00:12:18,"upstart is would be Iago, and they would just kind of do this play to try and upstage each other,"
00:12:18,00:12:22,"like a heavyweight boxing championship, is that right? Yeah, absolutely right, and you also had"
00:12:22,00:12:27,"these two main theatres, the jury lane theatre and the Covent Garden theatre, and you would quite"
00:12:27,00:12:32,"often see people mounting the same play at the same time to see who was the better, who was"
00:12:32,00:12:38,"the better, which was the third, who would be the better hamlet, and so yeah, it was a very much"
00:12:38,00:12:44,"a way of keeping in check who the new kids on the block were. Did you have to, I mean if you were"
00:12:44,00:12:49,"trying to decide, did you have to run between the two theatres during the performance to compare and"
00:12:49,00:12:53,"compare? The one being on the same night, it would be roughly a similar period, so you know,"
00:12:53,00:12:57,"within a few weeks of each other, you'd be able to sort of cook today. Okay, that makes it easier"
00:12:57,00:13:01,"for all these people. Yeah, absolutely, sort of flicking over from Channel 4 to Channel 3, you know,"
00:13:01,00:13:08,"that's an ITV, but Keen was so jealous and so vengeful that he would set out to try and destroy"
00:13:08,00:13:13,"all of his rivals, and so he would do his absolute best to undermine them, he would often"
00:13:13,00:13:17,"refuse to act alongside people, he fired any actor who was tall on him, and he was five foot four,"
00:13:17,00:13:22,"so that was much active. He fired any actor who was better than him, or any actor who was better"
00:13:22,00:13:28,"looking, so much so that famously people would go and watch Edmund Keen act, but they would leave"
00:13:28,00:13:34,"before the end of the play, because all the other actors were crap, and he also famously later on"
00:13:34,00:13:39,"had a lot of power in deciding which plays would be put on at the Drew Lane Theatre, and he rejected"
00:13:39,00:13:45,"500 scripts because other actors had good parts, and he was jealous of them. No wonder people thought"
00:13:45,00:13:50,"he was the best actor of his time, no one else was allowed to do it. All these other five foot three"
00:13:50,00:13:58,"actors, it's insanely ugly. In fact, it was a great time to be a five foot three ugly actor."
00:13:58,00:14:03,"Tom Cruise would have fit right in. That's mean, he's a very handsome man."
00:14:03,00:14:12,"Okay, it is time for a fact number two, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that it wasn't until"
00:14:12,00:14:19,1913 that we finally figured out how to stop our food tasting like our cutlery. It was just all
00:14:20,00:14:24,"it, everything tasted like metal before that. It all just depended how tasty or for"
00:14:24,00:14:31,"so I was sort of reading about the history of stainless steel, which is effectively when this"
00:14:31,00:14:36,"revolution happened and being able to taste your food rather than your cutlery, and before stainless"
00:14:36,00:14:43,"steel was invented and finally applied to cutlery in 1913, we'd had metal tools obviously since you"
00:14:43,00:14:49,"know the iron age, the copper age, things were made of copper and the bronze age, but they all"
00:14:49,00:14:53,are quite reactive with the stuff you put on them. The only thing that doesn't react with the food
00:14:53,00:14:59,"that you're putting on it is gold, but that obviously was out of the reach of your use and your"
00:14:59,00:15:05,"knees, so most people couldn't do that. You know when they moved from the copper age to the bronze age"
00:15:05,00:15:10,"to the iron age or whatever, did everything just start tasting different? Is that the main thing that"
00:15:10,00:15:16,"happens to people who are living there? They're like, wow. It was a revelation. Yeah. Even chicken,"
00:15:16,00:15:21,"even chicken, which tastes like nothing, starts to taste completely different. In fact, actually,"
00:15:21,00:15:27,that thing of everything tasting like chicken would have been true back then. Have you ever
00:15:27,00:15:30,"had, have you ever eaten tarantula? Yeah, it tastes a bit like fork. Yeah."
00:15:30,00:15:39,"But it's a really interesting thing, I mean, I made a radio for documentary about this and I got to,"
00:15:39,00:15:44,"I was on with a material scientist and we got to taste foods with different types of spoon,"
00:15:44,00:15:49,"made of different materials. Who were you on with, out of interest? So it's a show called The"
00:15:49,00:15:54,"Origin of Stuff and the scientist is called Dr. Zoe Lafflin. Yes, I was really about her. She's"
00:15:54,00:15:58,"great. She's really cool. She makes stuff like, well, she's got a BBC program at the moment where she"
00:15:58,00:16:04,"makes her own trainers. She's really cool. And I was also on with Katie Brown, who's the host,"
00:16:04,00:16:11,and a food writer called Be Wilson. And we tried mango and strawberry. Can I just say we always
00:16:11,00:16:16,harassed what's your favourite dinner party? Guests. I think the four people that you've just mentioned
00:16:16,00:16:22,"there is pretty much my favourite. It was pretty fun. Yeah. Be Wilson, what a legend. Katie Brown,"
00:16:22,00:16:26,"love her. Yeah, it was amazing. Show me about the Greg Jenner aspect. I mean, it's a show, I brought it"
00:16:26,00:16:32,"down. I mean, I ruined it. But so what was really cool is we tried mango and we tried strawberry yogurt"
00:16:32,00:16:39,"and we tried them with copper spoons, silver spoons, zinc spoons and gold spoons. And it's"
00:16:39,00:16:45,"amazing. Like the genuinely, genuinely you don't realise how much you're tasting the spoon in the"
00:16:45,00:16:52,apple until you're not tasting it. I did read that eating mango sorbet with a gold spoon is just about
00:16:52,00:16:57,"the best, you know, epicurean treats you could possibly have. Is that true? It does sound really good,"
00:16:57,00:17:02,"doesn't it? I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't, yeah. It doesn't sound like you're sloughing it. They don't"
00:17:02,00:17:08,"have it at many motorway service stations today. It sounds better than, you know, muller fruit"
00:17:08,00:17:14,corner with a bus ticket. There was a point in the radio show where I stopped talking and I was just
00:17:14,00:17:18,eating the mango just happily. I just like everyone else was talking about the science and I was just
00:17:18,00:17:21,sitting there eating all the mango because it was amazing. But what was really interesting is that
00:17:21,00:17:28,"copper makes sweet things much sweeter and it makes other things much more bitter. So savory things,"
00:17:28,00:17:31,much more bitter. It's like vegetables when you eat it with a copper spoon. It tastes really
00:17:31,00:17:37,"metallic and sharp and bitter. But when you did the strawberry yogurt, it tasted incredibly sweet"
00:17:37,00:17:41,as if you'd pour loads of artificial sweetener into your yogurt. What about foods that are bitter
00:17:41,00:17:46,"sweet like chocolate that's 85% cocoa? That'll be really interesting, wouldn't it? I don't know,"
00:17:46,00:17:52,"actually. Weirdly, I had some 85% cocoa last night. If only I'd waited 24 hours, I could have tested"
00:17:52,00:17:57,"this right now. Right here. Do you have a copper spoon? Yeah, I bring my copper spoon everywhere"
00:17:57,00:18:01,"with me. It's in my front pocket. Yeah, a good point. Well, people used to, though, in the past,"
00:18:01,00:18:06,"they used to have their own personal cutlery. You'd go everywhere with your own knife and that was,"
00:18:06,00:18:09,with your knife and you'd carry it everywhere and you'd only with your own knife.
00:18:09,00:18:14,And then gradually people started to do this forks because forks come quite late.
00:18:14,00:18:18,Didn't people carry it round in sort of cutlery shoulder bags? Aren't there lots of those throughout
00:18:18,00:18:23,"history that, like, could you take your cutlery satchel to a party? How much cutlery are you taking?"
00:18:23,00:18:30,"Are you taking your asparagus spoon as well? Yeah, your terrapin fork. Of course. If it's not a"
00:18:30,00:18:36,"13-course meal, I'm not going to the event in the first place. So, if this is true about the"
00:18:36,00:18:40,"cutlery that you're having, does the phrase, being bored with a silver spoon in your mouth,"
00:18:40,00:18:45,"is that a bad thing? Does that, it doesn't, oh yeah, he was bored with a silver spoon in his mouth."
00:18:45,00:18:51,"Everything tastes like shit for him. Yeah. So I originally meant, well, so silver is less"
00:18:51,00:18:55,"reactive than most metals, but it's still apparently, and Greg would know, does leave a pretty"
00:18:55,00:19:00,"pronounced taste. Yeah, it does, and you really taste it as soon as you then taste the gold,"
00:19:00,00:19:06,"which tastes of nothing. And the gold was just amazingly interesting, because it doesn't taste"
00:19:06,00:19:10,"of metal, it doesn't taste of anything, you're just tasting the food. Whereas the copper was"
00:19:10,00:19:14,"like really, really active, because it's all about the electrons and, you know, the help free,"
00:19:14,00:19:20,"they move around. So, gold is inert, but copper conducts electricity really well. So it kind of,"
00:19:20,00:19:24,you just sort of get that activity in the mouth. So you're really feeling all the kind of taste
00:19:24,00:19:29,"abouts going, ""Wow, what's happening?"" Whereas gold's much more sedate and gentle."
00:19:29,00:19:33,"I mean, you'll make Zoe, Dr Zoe, did say, I think, at the end of this event, which I'm so excited"
00:19:33,00:19:38,"to do attended, she said, ""You haven't lived until you've eaten off gold."" So that's a bit of a blow"
00:19:38,00:19:44,"for most of us. Almost everybody, yeah. But should we get back to the actual original fact,"
00:19:44,00:19:49,"Anna, the 1913 thing? That's how it really is, isn't it? Yes, yeah, we should talk about him,"
00:19:49,00:19:55,"the hero. Do you want to sell us a band? What do you want me to do it? Oh, yes, I guess since I sort of"
00:19:55,00:20:02,"brought him up initially, fine. Well, we have a historian here. It's like, you know, why do we have to do"
00:20:02,00:20:08,"all the work? Exactly. I figured I could put my face up for God's sake. Right, fine, 1913."
00:20:08,00:20:14,"There's a metallurgist called Harry, really, and he's actually working as all the best inventions"
00:20:14,00:20:18,"often came from sort of trying to work on weapons, because really all countries want to pump money"
00:20:18,00:20:24,into his war. So he was working on alloys for gum barrels to try and make the steel in gum barrels
00:20:24,00:20:31,"harder. So he was testing out lots of different alloys, steel alloys, and he added chromium to one."
00:20:31,00:20:37,"And when he was doing this to test sort of how strong it was, he had to etch into it with various"
00:20:37,00:20:42,"chemical additives. And he noticed that the chromium was very resistant to these. And the thing is,"
00:20:42,00:20:46,this had been spotted before. So stainless steel is basically you add a certain amount of chromium
00:20:46,00:20:51,"to steel. This had been spotted, but the theory is that the reason Harry really realised how useful"
00:20:51,00:20:57,"it would be for cutlery is because he was working in Sheffield. And Sheffield, for many hundreds of years,"
00:20:57,00:21:01,"as I'm sure any listeners in Sheffield will know, has been famous as a cutlery manufacturer. So straight"
00:21:01,00:21:06,"away, when he saw this material shoved it in his mouth, went, oh, wow, that tasted nothing."
00:21:06,00:21:12,I can use this because he was working on gum barrels. Would it be fair to say that Harry
00:21:12,00:21:17,"Brielly literally brought a knife to a gun fight, which is in a way what the first world war was."
00:21:17,00:21:24,"That's exactly what he did, and that's what the saying comes from. Yeah, very strong."
00:21:24,00:21:28,But the interesting thing about Brielly is that he was not the first person to be experimented
00:21:28,00:21:32,"with this. And I think various other countries have claimed their own scientists got their first,"
00:21:32,00:21:37,"but he turned into cutlery, which is a huge deal. He was in Sheffield. Yeah, exactly."
00:21:38,00:21:43,"You don't have Sheffield in France, do you? No. We have a leguto."
00:21:43,00:21:52,"And he was quite a socialist, Brielly, wasn't he? And basically, they never painted the invention"
00:21:52,00:21:57,"of stainless steel in Britain. So it meant that anyone could make it. And also, any money they did"
00:21:57,00:22:01,"make, he wanted to share with everyone else in this company. And his bosses weren't particularly"
00:22:01,00:22:06,happy with that. But they did painted it around the world. So it meant that if anyone made stainless
00:22:06,00:22:11,"steel in USA, Canada, Italy, France, or Japan, they had to get a license from Sheffield to do it."
00:22:11,00:22:16,"So that's how they made all their money. And then eventually, he retired, and he started a charity"
00:22:16,00:22:22,"called the Freshgate Trust Foundation, which he said he hoped would help lame dogs over styles."
00:22:22,00:22:27,"Oh, it's good to have an ambition, isn't it? I don't know exactly. I don't know if he was like"
00:22:27,00:22:31,"giving legs to dogs or lowering styles. I'm not really sure, but one or the other."
00:22:31,00:22:36,"Are we 100% sure it wasn't a metaphor? Yeah, it feels like it's a metaphor or Harry Styles. Does he"
00:22:36,00:22:44,"mean Genshin dogs to jump over Harry Styles? That's really nice. Yeah, it is nice, isn't it? I like"
00:22:44,00:22:50,"to think it's not a metaphor, and it's an exact explanation of what he was doing. I think it sounds"
00:22:50,00:22:54,"odd. Actually, I believe that, because it sounds, what you need when you've got a charitable"
00:22:54,00:22:59,"campaign is a little big thing, they say, or a big little thing, you know, which is where it taps"
00:22:59,00:23:03,"into a problem that we all know. So instead of saying, let's solve plastic pollution, let's say,"
00:23:03,00:23:08,"let's take this one particular example. So rather than saying, let's just replace all styles"
00:23:08,00:23:14,"with gates, which is an impossible dream. You say, let's just help lame dogs over styles, and it's"
00:23:14,00:23:18,"achievable. Yeah, it's good. And yeah, that invention doesn't seem to have lasted in the same way"
00:23:18,00:23:22,"that Stainless Steelhouse. I don't know about you guys' dogs, but my lame dog's dog can't make it over"
00:23:22,00:23:27,"those damn styles. I'm constantly, whenever I see a style, there's a queue of sad looking dogs."
00:23:27,00:23:39,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is that ants have a special stomach,"
00:23:39,00:23:43,"which is just to contain food, to throw up into the mouths of other ants."
00:23:43,00:23:50,"Isn't that lovely? And then to go down the line, so do those recipient ants, then throw up"
00:23:50,00:23:54,"their food into the mouth of other ants. I mean, how many times does food get eaten through the"
00:23:54,00:23:59,"recipient ants? I don't know. That's such a good point. You don't want to be at the end of that line,"
00:23:59,00:24:04,"do you? Like the human centipede. It's the worst position, I think, is at the end of the ant"
00:24:04,00:24:09,"from it line. That's definitely true. It's not quite as bad as the human centipede. In fact,"
00:24:09,00:24:14,"the human centipede, if it was the human ant, would be very different. It would just be two people"
00:24:14,00:24:20,sellitaped by their mouths. I don't want to talk about this. I know I mentioned this because it's
00:24:20,00:24:26,"got a weird analogy to human life, but I've already referred it. Go on, talk us through it then."
00:24:26,00:24:32,"Okay, so this is a process called trofil axis, and it's another way of ants talking to each other"
00:24:32,00:24:38,"basically. So they make noises, they touch each other, they have pheromones, and they also throw"
00:24:38,00:24:44,"up into each other's mouths. It's all liquid to mouth-to-mouth stuff. It's actually, I say that,"
00:24:44,00:24:51,"it's not all mouth-to-mouth, sometimes it's bottom-to-mouth, they'll inbib, anal secretions"
00:24:51,00:24:55,"are imbibed according to the scientific way of describing it. Yeah, that is a bit human centipede,"
00:24:55,00:25:01,"isn't it? Yeah, it is. I know, yeah. But it's very useful because this is a, it has a purpose,"
00:25:01,00:25:09,"they're not just doing it for fun. They have information in this stuff they're throwing up, so"
00:25:09,00:25:16,"it might contain hormones, and maybe you can feed these hormones to a lover, and it will change"
00:25:16,00:25:23,the way that the lover's life develops. So a lover which receives this kind of vom is twice as
00:25:23,00:25:28,likely to become a larger work-around. So your whole life can be changed by someone else throwing
00:25:28,00:25:33,up in your mouth as an ant. I find that amazing. It's like Captain America's super serum. You can
00:25:33,00:25:40,"supercharge you into a supercharged ant. It is. It is basically like that, yeah, and the amazing"
00:25:40,00:25:45,"thing about this research is how it was done. So the researchers, they had to collect this fluid"
00:25:45,00:25:50,"from the mouths of ants, which were returning to the colony after a while away collecting fluid,"
00:25:50,00:25:55,"and they kidnapped them, they anesthetized them, and then they squeezed them very, very gently"
00:25:55,00:26:02,"until they threw up this stuff, and they collected 0.34 million of a liter per ant."
00:26:03,00:26:08,"And then had to analyse what was in that. What kind of dexterous, tiny-fingered research should"
00:26:08,00:26:15,they find to anesthetize and then extract this? It's very hard to get a tiny chloroform rag over
00:26:15,00:26:20,"the ants' mouth, isn't it? So if the Ant-Man movie had been anything like the science, then it would"
00:26:20,00:26:27,have been Michael Douglas taking a dump in his mouth and then he saw the superhero. Is this
00:26:27,00:26:34,going to be a string of superhero references that I don't understand? I'll just laugh along. Do
00:26:34,00:26:40,you reckon that this stuff that they vomit up could be milked for human consumption if you had enough ants?
00:26:40,00:26:49,"Yeah, I guess it could. I think it's a very much a last resort. I know you're getting to the end"
00:26:49,00:26:58,"of your canned goods at this point. Well, we do have ants in this house. Yeah, okay. Yeah, maybe"
00:26:58,00:27:04,the baked beans first. So not the only animals who do this are they who vomit each other's mouths
00:27:04,00:27:11,"for various different reasons. Vampire bats do it, so they vomit blood into each other's mouths,"
00:27:11,00:27:18,which I would argue is one step more disgusting than the ant version. Do you want to do a Batman
00:27:18,00:27:25,"thing here, Gregor? Yeah, absolutely. In order to defeat fear, you must become fear, which means you"
00:27:25,00:27:31,"have to vomit blood into your mates. Yeah, it doesn't quite work. They're really sweet, aren't they?"
00:27:31,00:27:37,"They do it to strangers or to people who they've just met, basically. Is it like a handshake?"
00:27:37,00:27:42,"It is. That has to be a viral nightmare. Yes, exactly. We're not allowed to handshake anymore,"
00:27:42,00:27:46,but we're definitely not allowed to vomit blood into each other's faces. You can't do anything
00:27:46,00:27:54,"these days. But yeah, so when you first meet a vampire bat and you want to be friends with them,"
00:27:54,00:27:58,you vomit blood in their mouths and they gradually raise the stakes as they're worth making friends.
00:27:58,00:28:03,"So you start off with vomiting a small amount of, but it's doing a small favour for someone, and then"
00:28:03,00:28:08,"as you get to know and like each other and trust each other, you will end up sharing lots of food"
00:28:08,00:28:14,with the other vampires. It's really sweet. It's cute. I was really surprised that wolves do it. We're
00:28:14,00:28:20,not talking about Edmund Keen's friends. The wolves drinking love. I bet at some point actually
00:28:20,00:28:27,"Edmund Keen's wolves did throw up into each other's mouths, but also Grey wolves do this, which I find"
00:28:27,00:28:31,"very sweet, but they leave the vomit in special piles and then it's for their cubs, so their cubs"
00:28:31,00:28:36,"come along and chew it up. When I was reading about this, they do it with blueberries. So you think"
00:28:36,00:28:42,"of wolves as sort of tearing apart prey animals, which they do, but they love blueberries apparently,"
00:28:42,00:28:46,"so they'll go and pick those blueberries and push, throw them up, and then they're kissing them."
00:28:46,00:28:52,That reminds me of Pliny the Elder. Do you know the story of the Indian Ants in Pliny's natural
00:28:52,00:28:57,"history? I mean, we all do, but why don't you just tell us anyway? Pliny the Elder is one of"
00:28:57,00:29:02,the great naturalists of the ancient world. He's fascinating. He's really interested in science
00:29:02,00:29:06,"and all sorts of things. He writes his lovely section about ants and how collaborative they are,"
00:29:06,00:29:08,"and what they do, and it's really lovely and it's quite accurate, and you kind of read and go,"
00:29:08,00:29:12,"that's good, that's right, and then he gets this weird paragraph, and he's like, and in India,"
00:29:12,00:29:17,"they have Indian ants, which are giant, and they have the size of foxes or wolves, and they hunt"
00:29:17,00:29:22,"and mine gold, and they dig it up in the ground, and they carry it back to their layers, and any passing"
00:29:22,00:29:28,Indian who happens to sort of pick up the gold is torn apart by these giant ants. It's pretty
00:29:28,00:29:32,"terrifying, and modern scholars are like, well, that sounds not like an ant, that's probably a"
00:29:32,00:29:37,"marmot or some sort of other creature, but they were convinced in the ancient world that there was a"
00:29:37,00:29:42,"sort of race of giant mega ants that hauded gold like dragons. It doesn't sound much like a marmot,"
00:29:42,00:29:48,"if I'm honest. No, it doesn't. No, so it's probably a translation error, but it's got a nice bit"
00:29:48,00:29:52,"that comes after a long bit about ants being, you know, really interesting animals, and then you get"
00:29:52,00:29:56,"to be used. Pliny, he did let his imagination run away with him sometimes, didn't he? Yeah, it's"
00:29:56,00:30:03,"a huge, great man. I think it's okay to riff, but the weird thing is that it is weirdly socialised,"
00:30:03,00:30:07,"because the theory is that lots of insect colonies, like ants or termites, they basically have one"
00:30:07,00:30:14,"collective stomach, and so forager ants deliver food at a rate which depends on how full the"
00:30:14,00:30:20,"individuals they encounter before are. So if everyone you come across as really hungry, then forager ants"
00:30:20,00:30:25,"kind of raise their game, and food flow rates kind of get matched to how hungry the overall"
00:30:25,00:30:31,colony is based on the information you're taking in. That's amazing. It's really neat. How do you
00:30:31,00:30:34,spot hungry ants? Do they sort of limp and drag them? Because I don't know if I could tell if an
00:30:34,00:30:40,"ant had lost weight for it. If it's so weak that it can't get over a style, then it's a very hungry ant."
00:30:40,00:30:47,"Forager ants actually self-isolate. Do they? Very, very thoughtful. Yes, they would have been"
00:30:47,00:30:52,"absolutely nailing it around this time, probably are. So they'd go out and pick up food from outside"
00:30:52,00:30:57,"the colony, and so they're the most exposed to pathogens and stuff because they're in the outside world."
00:30:57,00:31:01,And scientists find that when they deliberately expose them to a fungus that kills them after
00:31:01,00:31:06,"a few days, if they infect them with it, they'll avoid going back to the nest, and this is even before"
00:31:06,00:31:10,"they get sick. They've got an instinct that seems to know they've been infected with a fungus,"
00:31:10,00:31:16,"they don't go back to the nest, so they don't infect their friends, and even their fellow forager ants"
00:31:16,00:31:20,"will also not go back to the nest, you know, as if they've come into contact with this ant who's"
00:31:20,00:31:25,"infected, and they won't go back to the nest, and then meanwhile the nurse ants inside the nest"
00:31:25,00:31:30,"will treat deeper and deeper into the nest. Wow, but is it not true that the ones who are self-isolating"
00:31:30,00:31:37,"do come out once a week to applaud the nurse. Yes, they were in a little badge. It's very moving"
00:31:37,00:31:43,"actually. If you put your ear to the ground, you can't hear it. Another animal that does this"
00:31:43,00:31:50,"vomiting thing is honeybees, so if you're living in a honeybee house or hive, as they call it,"
00:31:50,00:31:56,"it might get too hot, right? It might get too hot, and so when it gets too hot, what happens is"
00:31:56,00:32:02,"some water collector bees go out, they drink a load of water, and then they come back,"
00:32:02,00:32:09,"and then vomit it over everything, and everyone. Wow, that's incredible. Yeah, like a hose pipe"
00:32:09,00:32:15,"kind of thing. Like a fireman. Like a fireman, yeah, yeah. There is a thing about the nectar that bees"
00:32:15,00:32:20,"drink, isn't it, because they drink the nectar, and then they come back to the hive and they regurgitate"
00:32:20,00:32:27,"it into honey pots, basically, for the workers in hive. But there's been a study done, I think"
00:32:27,00:32:33,"within the last couple of months, saying that the sweeter the nectar is, the harder the bees find"
00:32:33,00:32:38,"it to regurgitate. So if it's not very sugary, it's very easy for them to regurgitate, because it's"
00:32:38,00:32:42,"not very viscous, it's quite thin, and it takes four or five seconds, so they just, you know,"
00:32:42,00:32:47,"they lean over the honey pot, they get another ant to hold the hair back a few seconds, and it's fine."
00:32:47,00:32:51,"But if they've been drinking really, really sweet honey, or really, really sweet nectar, rather,"
00:32:51,00:32:56,"it takes about 30 seconds for them to come up, and they basically have to lean over the honey pot"
00:32:56,00:33:03,"and straight, they just sit there going, it takes ages to come out. Do you remember when we went to"
00:33:03,00:33:07,John Mitchinson's birthday party a few years ago on all the elves sat in the kitchen and drank meat?
00:33:08,00:33:13,"Oh yeah, yeah. That what you explained there is exactly how I felt the next one."
00:33:13,00:33:18,"We all performed the honeybee ritual later than that, in fact."
00:33:18,00:33:26,"So there's one regurgitating creature, it makes a seriously massive sacrifice, that's the desert spider,"
00:33:26,00:33:31,"so she regurgitates food for her offspring as soon as they've hatched. But what she does,"
00:33:31,00:33:36,"she eats enormous amount of food so that she can feed it to them, and then it goes into her"
00:33:36,00:33:42,"stomach, and then in order to, like she needs to pre-digest it for her offspring, and so her stomach"
00:33:42,00:33:47,"properly digests it, and this involves her stomach creating massive amounts of digestive enzymes,"
00:33:47,00:33:51,so that she can throw up enough to feed all of her offspring. And her stomach creates so many
00:33:51,00:33:58,enzymes and so much stomach acid that it starts to eat her from the inside out as well. So she throws
00:33:58,00:34:02,"up all this food for her kids, and then after about two weeks once they've finished the food,"
00:34:02,00:34:09,her body's been eaten away enough that the kids can eat her as their last supper. That's so
00:34:09,00:34:15,"weird. It's weird, but it's good parenting actually, in a way. Yeah. It's short term peritting,"
00:34:15,00:34:19,"because once they've eaten you, you can't do much, you can't take them to the park after that."
00:34:19,00:34:23,"No, you're right, I think the dad really has to step up. That's a bit like,"
00:34:23,00:34:28,"have you ever heard of the ""Mellified Man"" thing? I think it was Medieval Arabia,"
00:34:28,00:34:33,"top of my head, people who at the very end of their life, this is a thing you could do, you just"
00:34:33,00:34:40,"only eat honey, you just only eat honey, and very gradually your body becomes sort of sweet,"
00:34:40,00:34:45,"and then when you died, they would bury you and mummify you, and then many years later on people would"
00:34:45,00:34:51,"eat you, and you'd be sweet tasting, and it was sort of a religious thing. Yeah, I was going to"
00:34:51,00:34:57,ask what the incentive is for this. I don't know. I think if you earlier in life got to eat someone
00:34:57,00:35:03,"who was a sort of honey monster lying under the ground, then I would be willing to enter that scheme"
00:35:03,00:35:09,where after my dad's people could do that to me. Imagine if they rebranded sugar puffs with a
00:35:09,00:35:15,"""Mellified Man"" on the front of the box, a rotting corpse of a person who once ate honey."
00:35:15,00:35:24,"I'm not convinced that if you ate the, like presumably by this point, quite well decomposed body"
00:35:24,00:35:28,"of someone who ate honey for a while before they died, I don't even know if that would taste of honey"
00:35:28,00:35:34,"by that point, would it? I mean, did it work? Oh, don't spoil it. It's just going to taste a very"
00:35:34,00:35:39,"slightly sweet human carbs, isn't it? I think so. If it depends what fork you're eating it with,"
00:35:39,00:35:47,doesn't it? I've read it. So this is just briefly back to ants. I just want to share with you the
00:35:47,00:35:51,"intro of an article in a new scientist about a particular kind of ant, okay? There's a couple of"
00:35:51,00:35:58,sentences. I think it's worth telling you. The article begins. Suppose you could have sex with your
00:35:58,00:36:02,brother or sister in the full and certain knowledge that any children will be safe from the harmful
00:36:02,00:36:08,effects of inbreeding. Would you be more willing to commit incest? The longhorn crazy ant certainly is.
00:36:08,00:36:15,"Wow, that does feel like the journalist has got lucky by finding that ant, doesn't he?"
00:36:17,00:36:23,"After he's already written the first two sentences. I mean, I didn't really know it was about ants when I"
00:36:23,00:36:31,"clicked on it. I was very disappointed. Yeah, what a start. Open it and would you though? No."
00:36:31,00:36:37,"Yeah, I think that's probably the right answer, isn't it? Probably. Well, queen Cleopatra did,"
00:36:37,00:36:42,of course. She wrote two of her brothers. And she didn't even do that in the certain knowledge that
00:36:42,00:36:50,"she would be free from the damaging effects of insects. On regurgitators, do you remember last week?"
00:36:50,00:36:54,"You won't remember this Greg because you weren't here, but Andy, you talked about human ostriches."
00:36:54,00:36:59,"Do you remember? Oh, yeah, yeah. So they would swallow bits of metal and bits of glass and so on"
00:36:59,00:37:05,"like that. And the modern day version of that, they have the solid swallowers, but also you have"
00:37:05,00:37:10,"regurgitators. So on Britain's Got Talent a few years ago, there was someone called Stevie Star"
00:37:10,00:37:16,who could swallow a Rubik's Cube that was mixed up and then when he regurgitators it was all solved.
00:37:16,00:37:23,"No. No way he couldn't. No throat is big enough for a Rubik's Cube. It was a small, it was a small"
00:37:23,00:37:29,"well. This makes tying a knot in a cherry stalk look like really child's place. Okay,"
00:37:29,00:37:33,which do you think would be harder? Learning how to solve a Rubik's Cube with the inside of your
00:37:33,00:37:39,"stomach or learning how to swallow two Rubik's Cubes, one pre-solved before you do the show."
00:37:39,00:37:47,"Yeah, and then so a lot of people think I've read a lot of forums about it and a lot of people"
00:37:47,00:37:51,"think that maybe he did your trick, which is having two Rubik's Cubes inside him and one of them"
00:37:51,00:37:56,"comes out, but then a lot of people who do this kind of regurgitation, they think, well, you know what,"
00:37:56,00:38:01,"maybe it is possible to do that. No way. And he definitely does, but he definitely does other tricks"
00:38:01,00:38:08,with his regurgitation. Apparently he learned his skill when he was a child and he swallowed his
00:38:08,00:38:12,"pocket money so no one would steal it. Wow. Nice. And then when he brought it back up, it was what,"
00:38:12,00:38:21,"a different denomination of chocolate? He's like a bureau de charge. That's amazing, James."
00:38:21,00:38:26,"I don't really know. I don't. Did he not win? No, he didn't win. What? That's an amazing talent."
00:38:26,00:38:33,"There's no justice. No. Who won? Some singer. Probably about that dancing dog. But in fairness,"
00:38:33,00:38:40,"do you remember that dancing dog in fairness? It could get over styles, so quite skillful."
00:38:40,00:38:45,"In terms of the guy who the human ostriches, did you talk about Polly Fagus, Nero's?"
00:38:45,00:38:53,"No. So, Emperor Nero, according to Setonius, the Roman writer, talked about Nero having a kind"
00:38:53,00:38:57,"of a pet man who was probably a slave, but we're not quite sure. And he was known as Polly Fagus,"
00:38:57,00:39:03,"which is Greek for all eater, eats all things. And he would eat anything, including humans alive,"
00:39:03,00:39:09,apparently. You could throw him a human and he would eat the human. How big was Polly Fagus?
00:39:09,00:39:12,"Well, apparently he was a very large man, and he was sort of a glutton or a gourmand who would eat"
00:39:12,00:39:17,"anything at all, and he would devour. He sounds like a very large man with big claws"
00:39:17,00:39:22,"who hyenas every win such to me. Well, so that is that's one of the actual interpretations"
00:39:22,00:39:25,"of the story to like. Are you sure it's not a bear? But, yeah. So, you know."
00:39:25,00:39:32,"Pet man, I'm trying to work out which is a worse thing to be a slave or a pet man. Both are very bad."
00:39:32,00:39:37,"It does sound like a very bad euphemism for a slave person, isn't it? He's not a slave, it's a"
00:39:37,00:39:41,"pet man. It's awkward you don't understand of that, and because that is what your wife calls you"
00:39:41,00:39:49,"when she refers to you, but unbelievable. Okay, it is time for our final"
00:39:49,00:39:56,"fact of the show, and that is James Arkin. Okay, my fact this week is that ancient Egyptians had artificial"
00:39:56,00:40:01,"egg incubators, but they didn't have the monitors, so they measured the temperature of the eggs by"
00:40:01,00:40:09,"holding them to their eyelids. It's really nice. Why? Isn't that lovely? So, very quickly on this,"
00:40:09,00:40:15,"Egypt has been famous for a long time for its egg ovens, and they have been going back"
00:40:15,00:40:22,"from at least the late period of the new kingdom, which is 500 BC onwards, and we know that because"
00:40:22,00:40:28,Aristotle wrote about them. He said that the people in Egypt make eggs that are hatched spontaneously
00:40:28,00:40:34,"in the ground by being buried in dung heaps. And then 200 years later, there was another historian"
00:40:34,00:40:40,"called Diodorus Siculus, sorry Greg, I don't know how you pronounce that, and he also said that these"
00:40:40,00:40:45,"egg hatching was really amazing that the Egyptians did, and then throughout history, you get loads of"
00:40:45,00:40:51,people writing about what great egg hatches the Egyptians are. And I was reading an article about
00:40:51,00:40:56,"the modern day egg hatches in Egypt, and they said that they still use all the old techniques,"
00:40:56,00:41:01,"including this way of telling if it's too hot, which is they put them next to their eyelids,"
00:41:01,00:41:06,because that's one of the most sensitive parts of your body is. And apparently it's still done
00:41:06,00:41:11,"today, and they've been doing it for 1000s of years. I had no idea that it was still happening today,"
00:41:11,00:41:17,"that's very, very cool. Yeah. Yeah, it's not amazing. Wow. And it's extraordinary the ability to,"
00:41:17,00:41:22,"I guess, they were mass producing egg, because what's interesting is that chicken eggs were not eaten"
00:41:22,00:41:26,"in Egypt for like all the foreign egg period, you know, so when you're thinking of pharaohs and"
00:41:26,00:41:31,"tombs and pyramids, they don't have chicken to tall, and then they were introduced, as you say,"
00:41:31,00:41:36,"about 500 BCA probably, and then they went mad for them. They were like, yeah, we love eggs,"
00:41:36,00:41:40,"it's brilliant. They're producing tens of thousands of them. So like I say, it wasn't ancient, ancient"
00:41:40,00:41:47,"ancient Egypt. It was just before the Romans. Yeah. I mean, we're tensed, yeah. I would argue that"
00:41:47,00:41:52,"is ancient Egypt, depending on where you're looking for them, which is now. This is the problem with"
00:41:52,00:41:57,"ancient Egypt, is that ancient Egyptians were aware of themselves as an ancient culture. So they"
00:41:57,00:42:02,"were ancient Egyptian pharaohs who did archaeology on ancient Egyptian pharaohs, which is amazing,"
00:42:02,00:42:08,"they were kind of... And this Herodotus used to travel, apparently he traveled to Egypt to go and"
00:42:08,00:42:13,look at the ancient stuff. So an ancient Greek philosopher and writer went to Egypt to go and look
00:42:13,00:42:19,"at the old stuff, which is quite cool. Yeah. And so, yeah, and everyone who went to Egypt or wrote"
00:42:19,00:42:23,"about the Egyptians always seemed to mention these amazing egg buildings, which they used to make their"
00:42:23,00:42:29,"eggs. So in the 18th century, there was a French scientist called René Antoine, first show,"
00:42:29,00:42:35,"called René, and he said that Egypt should be more proud of its hatcheries than of its pyramids."
00:42:35,00:42:40,"Fair enough. Real more, actually, who, yeah, he was one of the people who went and reported on them."
00:42:40,00:42:47,"He, I love him, because he's the guy who almost gave his paper, but then didn't. So he was a guy who"
00:42:47,00:42:52,"got mainly an entomologist, and he studied paper wasps, and he suddenly looked at paper wasps,"
00:42:52,00:42:56,"and he said, ""Oh my god, these guys are chewing up wood into pulp, and then mashing it together to"
00:42:56,00:43:02,"make paper. Guys, we should do this."" And he wrote that in a paper, which wasn't on paper, ironically,"
00:43:02,00:43:07,"for people ignored it, and then they didn't, we didn't figure out how to make the paper that we"
00:43:07,00:43:14,"know today for about another hundred years. So, I've always loved the idea that wasps were making paper"
00:43:14,00:43:17,"for just thousands of years before we forget it out. Yeah. What did they do with it, though?"
00:43:17,00:43:21,"Good point. They're not writing ulysses, are they? They never call, they're never right."
00:43:21,00:43:25,But he's one of the brilliant men of this 18th century. There are lots of some fantastic
00:43:25,00:43:29,"French scientists at this period, sort of milling around being quite fencing clever, and he was an"
00:43:29,00:43:34,"entomologist, but he had all sorts of interest. But what was really fun about him is that he was"
00:43:34,00:43:41,"really fascinated by birds as well as insects, and he used to advise King Louis XV as well, who was"
00:43:41,00:43:48,"the King of France after Louis XIV, and Louis XV to go back to eggs. Louis XV was really into his"
00:43:48,00:43:53,"soft boiled eggs. He really enjoyed them, and he would have them every Sunday, and he had an"
00:43:53,00:44:00,"ability to swipe the top of the egg off with a single blow of his fork, like a little execution thing."
00:44:00,00:44:05,"Which point was Louis was this? Louis XV. So, pre-Revolution."
00:44:05,00:44:10,"Pre-Revolution, 17th. There's a bit of irony there that he was able to do that."
00:44:10,00:44:16,"Yeah, absolutely. He could, he could guillotine his egg with a single blow, and people would gather"
00:44:16,00:44:23,"to watch the King eat his Sunday egg, and the valet would announce it by hushing the room and saying"
00:44:23,00:44:27,"the King shall now eat his egg, and then everyone would go quiet, and then he would do a little swish"
00:44:27,00:44:32,"thing to capitate the egg. And some people in the audience started thinking, yeah, that's a good idea."
00:44:32,00:44:41,"Can I just say, like, I don't want to put myself as some kind of amazing French King, but I can"
00:44:41,00:44:48,"chop the top of an egg in one swish as well. No, you can't. I can't. What I'm saying is it's not"
00:44:48,00:44:54,"exactly swallowing a Rubik's cube, as far as skills go, isn't it? That's not great. No, you're right."
00:44:54,00:44:58,"I do essentially, France has got talent. It was a much less good job."
00:44:58,00:45:01,"By James, can you do it in front of an audience? Because that's where the pressure is. It's like going"
00:45:01,00:45:05,"on, you know, a quiz show. We can all answer stuff, you know, in our lounge, but when you've got"
00:45:05,00:45:10,"people watching, that's when the pressure's on. You're absolutely right. You're so right, I would"
00:45:10,00:45:15,"almost certainly freeze on the pressure. And also, you specified that he was doing it with a"
00:45:15,00:45:20,fork for God's sake. This was in the early days of forks. People barely knew which way around to hold
00:45:20,00:45:27,"them and he's decapitating eggs. Okay, fine. He nailed it. Yeah. Did you see a few months ago, archaeologists"
00:45:27,00:45:33,"found some Roman eggs, 1,700 years old. They were chicken eggs that have not been opened,"
00:45:33,00:45:37,and they'd been deposited as part of their sort of an offering to the gods. And they accidentally
00:45:37,00:45:45,"cracked them, and the smell was intense. Wow. 1,700 year old rotten egg, really, really intense,"
00:45:45,00:45:52,"sulfur-y smell, pretty for long. I have eaten 100 year egg. I don't know if anyone else has"
00:45:52,00:45:58,"had that. Wow. That's what it's called. Like in Chinese cuisine, they call it the 100 year egg,"
00:45:58,00:46:03,"but actually, I think it's just a very slightly gone-off egg. Or something. They could get in some way,"
00:46:03,00:46:09,"then it smells a bit sulfurous, and it tastes a bit kind of bitter, but I don't think it's 100 years old."
00:46:09,00:46:15,"It's not dated back to TV season time. Okay, no. No, you've got a supply issue. I mean, you've got this case."
00:46:15,00:46:23,"But yeah, I can only imagine what the 1,000 year old, or 2,700 years old, yeah, it's from the"
00:46:23,00:46:28,"I think 4th century, so I think a couple of the eggs, they didn't crack. So they've got two preserved"
00:46:28,00:46:33,"Roman eggs, and then I think they broke a couple. Those must be the oldest, extant, hen's eggs in the"
00:46:33,00:46:38,"world. Surely. There can't be any older than that. I don't know. I've not asked around, but it's"
00:46:38,00:46:43,"pretty good. Because one of the eggs, one of the eggs in the world will be the oldest one, won't you?"
00:46:43,00:46:48,"That's just maths. It's true. I don't even know if that's maths, you know. That's philosophy."
00:46:48,00:46:55,"Philosophy. With the Romans, super keen, because it's weird when you look at the popularity of"
00:46:55,00:47:01,"eating chicken, it really didn't become the meat of choice. It wasn't particularly popular meat"
00:47:01,00:47:05,"until the last couple of hundred years, maybe I think people ate such a wide variety of bird."
00:47:05,00:47:08,"But the Romans were quite into chicken, right? Yeah, they were. I mean, they also had sacred"
00:47:08,00:47:13,"chickens too. So there's that famous story of Claudia's pulcare, who was a Roman general, a"
00:47:13,00:47:19,"naval general, and he was just before a battle. He was going to do the thing called augury,"
00:47:20,00:47:27,"or I think the word is ornithomancy, where you're trying to fortune tell using birds, and what he did"
00:47:27,00:47:31,"is he put down some corn for the bird to eat, the chicken to eat, and the hope would be that the chicken"
00:47:31,00:47:35,"would eat the corn, and that's a good omen for your battle. And the chicken didn't eat, and all the"
00:47:35,00:47:38,"soldiers on the ships were freaking out. They were like, ""Oh, my God, we're going to lose the battle."""
00:47:38,00:47:42,"And so Claudia's pulcare, he freaked out, he picked up the chicken, and he threw it over the side"
00:47:42,00:47:49,"and said, ""Maybe it's thirsty."" And it did not go well. They lost the battle, the soldiers panicked,"
00:47:49,00:47:53,"because he drowned the chicken, and there was a sort of inquiry afterwards about doing this terrible"
00:47:53,00:47:57,"thing to a sacred chicken. The first thing is there, because obviously the chicken not eating"
00:47:57,00:48:02,"has nothing to do with the battle, but in a way, it does, because he threw it over a bar,"
00:48:02,00:48:06,"and everyone got worried about it, and there's like a placebo. Yeah, it's a morale issue. Yeah,"
00:48:06,00:48:14,"it is a placebo effect. It's kind of funny. So the Soviet Union tried to incubate some eggs in space,"
00:48:16,00:48:21,"and it worked, eventually. They brought quails, because they're kind of smaller than chickens. A lot"
00:48:21,00:48:27,"easier to have a quail in a spaceship than it is to have a chicken. So they had a problem,"
00:48:27,00:48:33,"and that was when the chickens were born, or when the quails were born, they couldn't eat or drink."
00:48:33,00:48:37,"And that is because if you get a quail, when it's born, it can't lift its head up, because it's not"
00:48:37,00:48:41,"strong enough, but that's fine, because all its food is on the ground. And if it wants to eat is on"
00:48:41,00:48:45,"the ground, so it just kind of lies there with its head on the ground and eats and eats and eats"
00:48:45,00:48:50,"it eventually gets strong enough to lift its head up. But in space, of course, you don't have the"
00:48:50,00:48:55,"gravity to bring the head down to the ground, so its head and neck were just kind of floating around"
00:48:55,00:49:00,"in the space, and it meant that they couldn't feed. So if you put some food down for the quails,"
00:49:00,00:49:06,"they couldn't eat it. And so the cos... Well, doesn't the food float? Exactly. Can you not lift the"
00:49:06,00:49:11,"food to the level of the floating quail? You can, and that's what they did, but they had to do it"
00:49:11,00:49:18,every two hours. And these cosmonauts had other things to be getting on with. They couldn't just be
00:49:18,00:49:24,"feeding the quails every two hours. No. And so eventually, unfortunately, the quails cracked it."
00:49:24,00:49:28,"Did they actually? Yeah, they did, but then they tried it again a bit later, and they made tiny"
00:49:28,00:49:33,"little hammocks for the quails, which were all in the exit place, and then they could hold the food"
00:49:33,00:49:39,"in place as well, and so they, the next lot were fine. I had pet quails when I was young. Yeah,"
00:49:39,00:49:44,"cos I'm allergic to cats and dogs and other animals, and my dad was like, ""Get you a bird,"
00:49:44,00:49:48,"but we don't really want a bird in the house, so we'll get you some quails."" So I had some quails"
00:49:48,00:49:53,in the garden. Did you try all the animals until you settled on quails? It feels like you tried
00:49:53,00:49:58,"cats allergic, tried dogs allergic, tried marmots allergic. Yeah, I tried Indian ants, they were"
00:49:58,00:50:05,"feral and furious. They tried to steal my gold. And then I tried a pet man, but he tried to eat me."
00:50:08,00:50:11,"We ended up with quail. Yeah, I'd sad that he actually, my brother, who is a very small at the time,"
00:50:11,00:50:16,"he crushed the quail eggs in his hand accidentally, cos he didn't understand his own strength,"
00:50:16,00:50:21,"and so that was the end of our quail kind of, like, Lenny from a mice and men, or whatever. Yeah, it was."
00:50:21,00:50:26,"It was a sort of sad moment. Quails and men is a slightly more reparked version of a mice and men,"
00:50:28,00:50:39,"it's a bit middle-class, isn't it? Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for"

00:51:02,00:51:07,"These days, buying books is actually quite hard. So, yeah, I mean, Waterstone is a good place,"
00:51:07,00:51:13,"independent book shops lovely, Amazon have got it. The audiobook is me reading it, and people seem"
