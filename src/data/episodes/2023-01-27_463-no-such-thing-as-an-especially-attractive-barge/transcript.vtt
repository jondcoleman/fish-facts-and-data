00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:15.960
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.180
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.540
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.620
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.820
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.980
 and James Harkin.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.340
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.140
 of our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.880
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.760
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.560
 My fact this week is that to combat people sleeping

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.800
 during church, priests used to employ a sluggered waker

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.780
 who would walk around the congregation poking people awake

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.280
 with a very long stick.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.120
 - Brilliant.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.540
 - Yeah, this is an amazing thing.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.100
 I was reading-- - Fancy that job, Andy?

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.240
 - I think it sounds quite fun.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.080
 - Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.560
 - You wouldn't make many friends,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.260
 but you're not in the business to make friends.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.100
 - Oh no.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.020
 - You're in the business to keep people awake,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.860
 listening to the sermon.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.860
 - Exactly.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.220
 I reckon you'd be great at it, yeah.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.060
 - Why?

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.500
 - You've just got authority about you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.740
 and we all respect you so much.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.220
 - When you put it like that, I suppose,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.260
 yeah, I would be a prettiest.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.660
 You think I like correcting people

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.180
 for minor errors they've made?

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.380
 - Yeah, and you really piss people off,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 so it sort of feels--

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.460
 (all laughing)

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.660
 - You're not losing anything, you know, people.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.220
 - I've already got zero status in this society.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.700
 - Yeah, the congregation don't like you anyway.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.960
 - I mean, I'm disliked enough that it doesn't matter if I'm,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.800
 yeah.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.720
 - And you always walk around with a massive stick,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.040
 prod people with it.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.280
 - Actually, that's an even better reason, yeah.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.680
 How long was the stick, do we know?

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.480
 - Well, in some cases, they'd be 10 feet long,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.280
 because you've got long pews, don't you?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.320
 Very long pews, so if you've got someone

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.040
 at the end of a pew and you need to reach them,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.640
 you've got your stick needing to--

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.920
 - That's the slugger maker saying, isn't it?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.760
 I would touch him with a 10-foot pole.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.920
 (all laughing)

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280
 - I read about this in a book that I was checking out

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.100
 called "Old Church Life" by a guy called William Andrews,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.500
 and it's a very old book, and it's full of really odd,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.620
 quirky little nuggets about the church back in the day.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.020
 And so these people would be paid good money to go around.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.860
 - Well, money.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.540
 - Well, but money, yeah, yeah.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.380
 - They were paid.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.220
 - I think for a lot of--

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.980
 - I thought they were the wealthiest,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.500
 most high status people in society, but yeah.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.060
 - They were, and although some of them were given

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.740
 a small amount of land to live on near the church.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.580
 - Nice.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.100
 - And in one case, there's a place called Yule Grave

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.820
 in the Midlands, and they had one who was entitled

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.220
 to a hat, as well as the small wage.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.940
 And then one in Wakefield, who also got hats, shoes,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.240
 and hoses, like that's part of the job.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.660
 - They turned sleepfield into Wakefield.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.500
 - Brilliant.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.660
 - That's what they had on their batch.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.500
 (all laughing)

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.520
 - It is a part-time job.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.840
 You wouldn't expect it to pay a full salary.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.240
 It's only when there's a sermon on, isn't it?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.580
 - Absolutely, yeah.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.720
 And often they did other things, other jobs as well,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.160
 and that was just a bit of it.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.240
 But sometimes women got separate treatment,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.140
 and nicer treatment, so sometimes they'd have a stick

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.540
 with a knob on one end and a little brush on the other.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.420
 And as a woman, you got a little tickle.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.620
 Whereas a man, you got knobs around the face.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.780
 (all laughing)

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.680
 - Everyday sexism.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.740
 - There's a guy called Obadiah Turner,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.020
 who wrote a journal.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.620
 He was from Massachusetts, living around 1640s.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.900
 And he in particular had a fox's tail

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.860
 on one side of his stick.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.020
 And on the other one, he had a long thorn,

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.620
 which he used to prick people.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.240
 So it wasn't just a little whack around the head.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.000
 He actually stabbed you with it.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.120
 And he said there was someone called Mr. Tompkins,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.440
 who fell asleep.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.080
 And he pricked him with his long prick.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.960
 And the guy woke up and said, "Bust the woodchuck!"

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.920
 And apparently he'd been dreaming

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.040
 about a woodchuck biting his hand.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.640
 When actually, you know when you're asleep,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.000
 and you kind of integrate the alarm into your dream?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.840
 - Yes.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.080
 - Well that's what he'd done.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.600
 - Is he saying bastard woodchuck?

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.040
 - Bus the woodchuck.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.360
 - That's a good church.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.220
 It's a good church appropriate, swear, swear.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.060
 - Yeah.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.900
 - You haven't said anything wrong.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.740
 - It's a midst oath, isn't it?

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.580
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.140
 - Do you think it was more or less annoying

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.460
 for the priest giving the sermon

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.740
 that rather than have people falling asleep quietly,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.880
 it was just a constant cacophony of,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.860
 "Ow, fuck, bust the woodchuck!"

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.060
 (laughing)

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.900
 - That's a good point.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.500
 I'm not sure it was about being annoyed

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.620
 so much as the people in the church

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.340
 are supposed to be listening to the word of God.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.180
 - Exactly.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.020
 - Yeah.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.900
 - So, who's got ultimate authority over this system?

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.840
 Is it the sluggard waker has autonomy

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.920
 and is allowed to basically stand at the front

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.360
 and see people falling asleep?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.920
 Or does the priest have to say,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.840
 "There, pew three, seat four."

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.840
 - No, the priest is doing his gig.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.680
 - Yeah, okay, okay.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.800
 - Yeah, yeah, sluggard's there

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.280
 to make sure it all goes smoothly.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.960
 - That's a skill of the job,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.440
 it's the only skill of the job,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.800
 it's spotting the sleeping people.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.120
 If this priest has to keep telling you,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.000
 then you're being fired.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.120
 - Here's a person who needed a bit of skill,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.360
 Betty Finch, who was a sluggard waker in Warrington.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.320
 She was known locally as the bobber,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.180
 because the way that she woke people up

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.660
 is she had a fishing rod,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.740
 and she had a little bob,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.020
 like a little weight on the end of her fishing rod,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.380
 and she used to swing it round

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.100
 and wake people up with the rod.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.260
 - And if you did it repeatedly,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.620
 she got hooked into your cheek

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.740
 and just reeled you up.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.460
 (all laughing)

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.900
 - She was the only,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.140
 I've found a few names of the actual people given that up.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.700
 She was the only woman with a job I found.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.500
 So, I feel like a very sort of male dominated industry.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.340
 - Yeah.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.180
 And as I said,

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.820
 they did often have other roles in the church,

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.000
 and they, one of them seemed to be dog whipping,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.480
 which was an important thing to do,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.660
 because in church services, in times of yore,

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.160
 and we're talking about a long period of time,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.280
 sluggard wakers existed, I think.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.220
 - Yeah, yeah, 1600s. - So for many months of years.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.800
 So, farmers would often, if they're going to church,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.280
 they'd be like, well, I'm gonna use this chance

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.560
 to bring all my sheep, sell them at market.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.480
 So, they go sell the sheep at market,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.320
 go to church,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.880
 and they've got all their sheep dogs in church.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.080
 So, you've just got a bunch of sheep dogs running around.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.280
 So, yeah, the sluggard waker also

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.760
 whips the dogs out of the church during services.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.460
 Well, can we give the proper name of this position?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.540
 The knock nobler.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.540
 - The knock nobler.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.380
 - What's that name?

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.620
 - That's the person who has to chase the dogs out of church.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.780
 - Distracting, I would have thought.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.020
 - That's like the Benny Hill show down there.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.380
 (laughing)

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.740
 - Yeah, then no, that's the knock nobler,

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.700
 or the dog noper, that was another one.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.540
 Who just has to get in there and whip the dogs,

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.060
 and they have special tools as well.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.940
 So, the dog whipper, who might also be the sluggard waker,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.580
 was sometimes issued with a special set of tongs

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.300
 for those hard to reach dogs.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.800
 If the dog had hidden in a crevice or something

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.000
 in the church, you'd have to use the tongs.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.040
 - Yeah, I've seen those.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.800
 - We have been, this is really exciting,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.040
 we've been somewhere which has a dog whippers flat.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.400
 - What's a flat?

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.280
 - A flat like an apartment.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.120
 - Oh, right.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.560
 - So, we've been somewhere, was it the Sidney Opera House?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.880
 - That's right.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.520
 Yeah, very late with you when it was being built,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.560
 they thought that's just okay.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.360
 No, it's Exeter, we went to Exeter on tour last year.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.000
 And Exeter's got a cathedral, a lovely cathedral,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.740
 which I visited.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.900
 Didn't see any of you guys there, yeah.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.440
 No praying.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.180
 (all laughing)

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.060
 - Well, we had confidence in our research.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.060
 We didn't really feel like we had to go and get help

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.900
 from the Almighty.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.480
 - I was like, please, God, please,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.680
 I just need one good fact about lasagnas.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.500
 - Well, it's not an actual apartment, it's a room.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.380
 But it is a room, it's a really nicely placed room.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.020
 So, as you go into the cathedral,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.380
 it's just above you there.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.820
 And it looks out onto the nave.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.080
 It's a viewing spot basically.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.360
 So you can be on 24-hour shift looking for dogs

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.200
 in the cathedral.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.840
 - What, and then you have to descend quickly

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.920
 as soon as you see a dog.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.160
 - Yeah, there's a pole, you slide down it, yeah.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.060
 - Swing on a zipline.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.900
 - That's cool.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.520
 - Do you think that's where whippets come from?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.160
 They maybe were the worst-behaved whippets.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.200
 - And you needed to whip it often.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.040
 - Oh, really?

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.880
 - No.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.600
 - Definitely the origin.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.800
 - I think it did really used to piss priests off, by the way.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.360
 I know we're saying, would they go through the...

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.540
 - It really did, and there was in American Boston

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.100
 in the 1600s, there was such fury from a priest over there

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.380
 that he suggested that a cage be made

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.900
 so that you would drag the sleeping person into it

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.700
 and cage them up like a bird

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.140
 and just let them have to wake up and deal with that.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.300
 And that was off the back of someone being woken up

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.020
 and in a rage, attacking the sluggered waker,

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.380
 or tithing man as they were often...

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.220
 - Tithing man.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.180
 - Tithing man, as they were often called in America.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.500
 - They're called that, interesting.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.420
 'Cause a tithe is the bit of your income you give

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.060
 to the church, a tenth of your income.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.600
 - So probably, as well as doing this,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.620
 they collected the money.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.320
 - They're actually very busy people, the sluggered wakers.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.460
 - They also rang the curfew bell.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.460
 So we had, in this country, a curfew bell

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.080
 against early medieval times,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.900
 which was, I think the original aim of it was

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.340
 to keep people from having rebellious, seditious meetings.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.540
 But anyway, it was quite useful because it stopped fires

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.780
 'cause curfew, literally coming from the French,

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.340
 I think, to cover the fire.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.500
 Couvre-feur is like time to cover your fires now.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.340
 And it tended to be eight o'clock.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.380
 And so at eight p.m. every evening,

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.820
 then you'd have the curfew bell rang.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.260
 It was like cover your fires and go to bed early.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.100
 - Even for Andy, who's famously not a night owl,

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.180
 you wouldn't want to have to be in at eight o'clock every day.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.880
 - Even I normally make it to the watershed at nine p.m.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.820
 (laughing)

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.780
 - What, half an hour of root TV?

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.700
 (laughing)

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.940
 Praying for your sins of watching it afterwards.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.420
 - Have you guys heard of the role of the beggar banger?

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.260
 - Beggar banger.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.100
 - Banger?

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.940
 - The beggar banger.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.780
 Yeah.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.860
 - No, what was that?

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.100
 - It's not as exciting as it sounds.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.380
 It's someone who was responsible for controlling

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.860
 the length of stay of any unwanted strangers in the parish.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.700
 - Okay.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.980
 - They were known as the beggar banger.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.020
 - Was that employed by the church?

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.860
 'Cause that's not a very churchy,

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.180
 welcoming thing to do.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.380
 As a church, you are supposed to embrace

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.740
 particularly beggars and paupers, aren't you?

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.220
 - Charity has its limits, Anna, and you know.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.420
 - As Jesus said.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.940
 (laughing)

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.380
 Are you guys aware of Acts of the Apostles,

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.940
 chapter 20, verse seven to 12?

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.940
 - Can you just stop me off and I'll--

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.980
 - Okay, so Paul was preaching.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:59.820
 - Oh, yeah.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.420
 - Okay, and he was preaching, he was doing this speech,

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.340
 and it was a very long speech.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.740
 And there's a guy called Eutychus.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.500
 And Eutychus was listening,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.260
 but it was a really, really boring speech.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.020
 So he fell asleep in the middle of St. Paul's preaching.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.660
 And as he fell asleep,

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.660
 he fell out of a third-floor window and died.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.620
 (laughing)

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.980
 So this is what the Bible says will happen to you

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.060
 if you fall asleep while someone's preaching.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.940
 - And that's why churches are always on the ground floor.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.100
 - Yeah, you get very few on the top of skyscrapers.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.940
 - Yeah.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.020
 - Just thinking a third-floor window is pretty,

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.780
 is a risky place to risk falling asleep.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.740
 - Well, quite, probably don't sit there

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.220
 if St. Paul's doing it for some reason.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.940
 Anyway, luckily Paul went down, picked him up,

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.220
 brought him upstairs and said,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.620
 "Oh, don't worry, he's fine."

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.460
 Even though everyone could see he was dead.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.780
 But then a bit later, he did come back alive.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.620
 - Oh, wow.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.900
 - Any more explanation on that?

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.740
 He just--

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.780
 - It's the Bible, Dan.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.300
 That's the kind of thing that happens in the Bible.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.380
 - Yeah, zombies, very common.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.220
 - I've read this book.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.580
 Have you guys heard of Pew Openers as a job?

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.420
 - No.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.740
 - A Pew Opener was someone who basically was an usher.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.060
 He would collect you at the front.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.300
 He would walk you to your pew

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.900
 and they used to have little doors.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.460
 And he would open up the door

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.220
 and he would allow you to not have to do that on your own.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.740
 And he got paid a very minimal amount for doing that.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.700
 And you could also pew rent.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.820
 So you could rent the actual row that you wanted.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.620
 You know, he was a concierge kind of character.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.660
 - That's quite interesting.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.180
 'Cause if you go to church,

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.660
 you'll find that the same people every week

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.340
 go to the same church, right?

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.780
 And they all tend to sit in the same places.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.620
 And if a new person comes into the church

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.380
 and sits in one of those places, there are eruptions.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.980
 - Do you think the Pew Opener would say, excuse me,

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.260
 I think that's actually where, madam?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.180
 'Cause you certainly, and I imagine he did this mostly

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.020
 for the wealthy families.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.940
 They would have their own pewies where they would sit.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.300
 And he'd be the one guiding them to them.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.260
 - Have you guys ever been to a church

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.240
 with a boxed pew system?

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.080
 - No, what's that?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.900
 - Those are good.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.340
 So, you know, pews are in rows normally.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.900
 And some church, some Georgian and earlier churches

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.100
 would have boxed pews.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.580
 So it's kind of a little pen that you sit in.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.140
 - So the Murrays don't have to sit with the riffraff?

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.820
 - Well, you know, or any surname, any family.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.140
 Yeah, yeah, any family of good standing.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.460
 No, no, no, but that was it.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.140
 (laughing)

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.140
 We once did an ostentatious photo shoot in a church

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:20.980
 which had those.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.300
 That was very, very interesting.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.460
 - That's what they were made for.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.900
 (laughing)

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.540
 Do you know someone else whose job it was

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.180
 to guide you to your seat?

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.020
 - Yeah, it could be.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.860
 It would be the deaconess.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.780
 And the deaconess seems to be one of the only official

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.940
 church jobs you could get as a woman.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.140
 And from like really early church time.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.220
 And basically, so one of her jobs would be

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.820
 to guide you to your pew.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.700
 Another job would be like you'd help distribute communion.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.780
 You could take communion to people in the community

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.540
 who couldn't make it to church.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.420
 And they were basically ordained.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.420
 And the reason they came into being really

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.060
 was to stop male church officials

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.140
 from seeing naked women.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.620
 So their initial job was baptism.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.620
 Because, yeah.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.420
 Because baptism was almost always adults then.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.260
 - Right.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.580
 - And it was--

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.780
 - You could always get your kit off.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.020
 - You got your kit off, you went into a river,

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.780
 and it was very improper for a male priest

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.220
 to be seeing a company of women into the water.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.140
 So that would be her job.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.620
 She'd undress the woman, hold the veil up

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.260
 so none of the clergy could see.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.980
 Go into the water with her, baptize her,

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.820
 and pop out again.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.660
 - That's awesome.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.740
 - Do you guys know what a pedo-baptist is?

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.580
 - Here we go.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.020
 - That's someone who baptizes children?

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.220
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.620
 - It's, you're very close.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.700
 It's someone who believes in baptizing children.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.100
 Yeah, there's a big divide in the church

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.780
 for pedo-baptists and credo-baptists.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.060
 - Did they have John the Baptist

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.220
 and John the pedo-baptist?

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.620
 - Yeah, it's funny.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.340
 Only one of them's made it to the big time, hasn't he?

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.660
 - What was the other--

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.500
 - Credo-baptists.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.340
 - Credo-baptists.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.180
 And there are people who believe

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.180
 you should only be baptized once you have been able

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.020
 to come to an adult understanding of God on your own.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.300
 - Because credo is Latin for I believe, right?

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.780
 And so the idea is that you can say yourself

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.340
 that you believe that as opposed to a child

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.620
 who doesn't really understand what it all means.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.780
 - What have they done to deserve that?

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.140
 - Well, I always thought it was just about

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.180
 protecting them to get into heaven, so.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.460
 - Ah, that's interesting,

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.700
 because it seems like Hannah and I are credos.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.540
 - Yeah.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.860
 - But damn, it sounds from what you're saying.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.700
 - Big ol' pedos.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.940
 (laughing)

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.140
 - Interesting.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.180
 - I've never heard those.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.140
 - Those terms.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.060
 No, I don't think they get bandied around, actually.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.060
 I don't know why.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.300
 - I said I'm a credophile.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.540
 (laughing)

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:42.340
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.540
 and that is Anna.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.820
 - My fact this week is that the Queen of France

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.020
 once pranked a girl at court by secretly taking in her clothes

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.940
 to make her think she was pregnant.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.580
 This is this great, yeah, pretty mean.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.220
 This is this great, great story

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.660
 from the memoir of Hortense Mancini,

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.660
 and she was one of the Mancini sisters who were so fun,

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.740
 but her uncle was a guy called Cardinal Mazarin,

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.460
 who was the closest person to the royal family in France,

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.180
 really, and Cardinal Mazarin decided

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.860
 that he would start teasing his six-year-old niece.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.900
 - That's the thing, that's the thing.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.180
 You hear this fact and you think,

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.380
 "Oh, it's a clever prank to play on someone

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.660
 who's probably, what, 20 or maybe a T.A."

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.820
 That's not a six-year-old.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.500
 - Yeah, that's what makes it so funny.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.860
 So there's this girl called Marianne, who's six-year-old,

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.740
 and she's the person who's writing the account, Hortense.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.340
 It's her little sister, and Cardinal Mazarin says,

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.940
 "Hey, you've got an admirer,

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.220
 and he's got you pregnant, hasn't he?"

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.660
 And then they would take her clothes away

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.020
 and secretly take them in so they got tighter and tighter,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.500
 so she thought that she was pregnant,

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.980
 and the whole court got in on this gag, you know?

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.500
 It was just hilarity for everyone in the court.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.500
 - Bullion, isn't it, really?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.260
 - Oh, look, it's a fine line, isn't it?

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.100
 Between are you laughing with her or laughing at her?

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.100
 - Yeah, it's a fine line, and I think they crossed it.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.420
 - Anyway, the queen, it was Anne of Austria,

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.100
 and she was the queen mother at that time.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.940
 She had been married to King Louis,

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.380
 and then she'd been the queen regent,

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.300
 so she was referred to as the queen.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.660
 She turned up by the six-year-old's bedside,

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.980
 the consulter said, "Gosh, yes, you are a pregnant, aren't you?"

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.940
 And then they planted a live infant in her bed,

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.780
 which we think was a baby of one of the servants.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.460
 - This is next level, I think.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.140
 - Yeah, this is Jeremy Beedle level.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.140
 - This is crazy, though, yeah.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.460
 This is amazing, and then, what happened next?

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.380
 - Well, the queen offered to be the godmother,

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.540
 said, "Well done, you."

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.900
 And then, I think they probably, at some point, came clean.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.740
 I don't think they made her raise the child.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.580
 I think the person whose child it was would have objected.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.140
 - Well, they asked her who the father was, didn't they?

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.260
 And she said it could only either be the king

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.220
 or the conch de gouiche.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.220
 - Yes.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.420
 - Because they were the only ones who she'd kissed.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.260
 - Yes.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.340
 - And she was, it was quite sweet.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.380
 - Although the conch de gouiche was a known absolute playboy.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.220
 So...

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.860
 - Right, right.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.060
 She wouldn't have known that, she's six.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.780
 - She said that, he just gave a little kiss on the cheek.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.180
 I quite like this in the memoirs from Hortense,

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.980
 who was three years older than her at the time,

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.380
 so she would have been nine.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.940
 And she said, "She was very proud

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.300
 "to know the truth of the matter,

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.060
 "and I never tired of laughing about it,

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.980
 "just to show that I knew it."

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.460
 Which is such a relatable thing

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.540
 when you're a slightly older sibling,

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.540
 doing that over-the-top laughing to be like,

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.380
 "Yeah, I get it."

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.220
 - "Oh, yeah, I get it."

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.620
 - "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.460
 "Yeah, I kissed."

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.780
 - "Please don't do this kind of thing to me.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.180
 "I feel like an idiot."

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.580
 - I was looking up pregnancy pranks.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.420
 - Oh, yeah, cool.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.460
 - There aren't many good ones.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.100
 It's mostly pranks that you,

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.740
 if you're pregnant, can pull on people around you.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.580
 - Oh, right.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.500
 It's not like, 'cause you could throw a water balloon

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.900
 at someone in the night,

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.540
 and then they think their waters are broken.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.380
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.220
 - Yeah.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.060
 - That's one.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:50.900
 - That's one.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.060
 - If you're pregnant, you could walk around

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.700
 with like a doll hanging between your legs.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.300
 So it looks as if you're--

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.140
 - Right.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.820
 - You've given birth without noticing.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.660
 - Yeah.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.660
 - Yeah, these are all about the level of the ones I found.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.500
 The only one I found that was any good potentially

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.500
 was using your pregnancy to help someone else

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.900
 with their pregnancy prank,

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.940
 where you can pee on their pregnancy test.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:11.780
 - Oh, yes.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.660
 - So it'll come up as a yes.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.500
 - Yes, right.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.540
 - And then she'll be able to say to whoever, you know,

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.420
 "That's really funny." - Oh, look at me, yeah.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.020
 - Here's the thing that men don't really know

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.620
 much about pregnancy tests.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.540
 So you could literally probably just take a vape

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.140
 and draw a line on it and say, "Hey, look, I'm pregnant."

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.220
 - You can take a COVID test.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.980
 I'm not pregnant, but you do have COVID.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.740
 (all laughing)

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.020
 This book is, it was published in 1675.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.940
 And I guess at the time,

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.540
 it's sort of quite sort of timely we're talking about it.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.500
 It's sort of the Prince Harry memoir of its day,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.780
 to an extent, because it was very much a--

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.180
 - What an amazing attempt to make this book relevant

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.700
 to absolutely other than that.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.540
 - I mean, it just totally is.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.380
 - Absolutely bang on.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.220
 - It just totally is.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.060
 - Who is this?

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:56.880
 - That's what it was.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.720
 - Hortense.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.560
 - Yeah, Hortense.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.640
 - Did she get a frostbyss and penis?

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.060
 - Well, no, this was the first time that, you know,

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.780
 this is someone who was amongst the royals.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.340
 She was almost basically a queen at one point.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.420
 And it was a book that was published

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.260
 when women weren't really writing books either

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.620
 about their personal life.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.660
 And so when it came out, it was a huge bit of news.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.500
 It was--

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.340
 - And it was scandalous.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.160
 - Yeah.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.340
 - And she filled it with gossip.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.500
 It would have been like with Prince Harry's book,

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.340
 going out and everyone going,

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.380
 "Oh, wow, you've actually said that.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.780
 God, cool."

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.620
 - Wow.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.400
 - I've never heard of her prior to reading up on this,

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.980
 but she wrote her autobiography.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:34.940
 And then a couple of years later,

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.860
 her sister wrote her autobiography as well.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.540
 And as you say, they led just an incredibly,

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.460
 interestingly bizarre, fun, but also quite tragic light.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.020
 They were in marriages, which were very unloved

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:47.860
 and which fell apart.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.620
 They had to flee the country from time to time

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.020
 because of being exiled as a result

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.700
 of their dubious affairs and so on,

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.460
 and their husbands being furious.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.980
 It's a real rollicking adventure.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.740
 - Well, let's quickly mention this husband

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.180
 that she had in front-- - Yes.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.060
 - Who appears to have been slightly unhinged.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:05.980
 - Oh man, yeah.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.620
 - He believed that milkmaid shouldn't touch cow's udders

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.020
 in case they became aroused by them.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.260
 - Yeah, there are a couple of accounts of this.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.940
 This is just, let's give his name.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.060
 He's called Amon Chal Duller Port Duller Mayeray.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:20.900
 All right, that was his name.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.860
 And he was incredibly rich, wasn't he?

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.700
 - He was.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.300
 He was like the richest man in Europe, pretty much.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.140
 - Yeah.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.900
 And he, so I read that account that he was worried

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.500
 about milkmaids finding milking sexy,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.020
 but then I read another account saying he worried

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.500
 that men might get aroused

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.660
 by the sight of milkmaids doing their milking.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.620
 - Yes.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.340
 - I actually think, Hortense didn't rise

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.100
 about any of these things, actually.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.740
 These all came from a guy called Abbey de Choisy,

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.660
 who was, he wrote his memoirs and they came out

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.820
 after he died and they're all about the story

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.140
 of how he went to live in the countryside in France,

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.620
 pretended to be a woman and seduced a load of young girls.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.940
 And he apparently was friends with Perot

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.460
 who wrote a lot of fairy tales.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.500
 So we think actually a lot of it might not have been true.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.340
 - Okay, interesting.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.460
 - But he was the one who wrote all this stuff

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.060
 about this crazy guy.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.060
 - And he was basically the idea with Armand Charle

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.460
 was that he was incredibly pious, wasn't he?

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.980
 And very religious.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.980
 And I imposed really strict rules like that.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.660
 So I thought everyone was gonna be aroused all the time,

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.020
 did things like he had a collection of priceless works

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.580
 of art that he'd inherited.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.740
 And in fact, from Cardinal Mazarin.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.020
 And he went around knocking all their genitals off

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.380
 because he thought the genitals were improper.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.740
 You know, he'd slashed tapestries.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.460
 He'd painted black bits of penis and balls and nipple

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.900
 on various paintings.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.500
 - There are so many different accounts.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.580
 So one of the things I read is that he did that specifically

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.460
 because he was worried that she, Hortense,

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.500
 was gonna get aroused by them.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.500
 - To be fair, she did have quite a few affairs.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.100
 - She did, she had a time. - To be fair, she had a time.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.300
 - She was leaving around.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.380
 - And she almost married Charles II

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.540
 when I mentioned before that she almost became queen.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.980
 So Cardinal Mazarin, who was sort of,

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.220
 he was their uncle and he was very much taking them

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.060
 around town and trying to set them up and arrange marriages.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.420
 Charles II met Hortense, fell in love with her

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.780
 and thought, I've got to marry her, made the offer.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.140
 And he said, no, because Charles II was an exile.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.180
 And he said, no, you've got, you know, you got your name,

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.020
 but you've got no money, you've got no title.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.260
 I don't know your prospects.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.340
 And so he denied it.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.460
 And then only a few months later, even weeks,

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.500
 Charles II suddenly is restored back as king.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.140
 And so Mazarin comes running back saying,

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.340
 actually Hortense would love to take your offer.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.420
 And he says, no, I'm afraid that's not going to happen.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.340
 - Such a shame.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.180
 - Yeah.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.460
 - This could have been a queen of England.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.780
 - Yeah, a little bit.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.140
 - They did hang out in England.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.300
 Hortense definitely fled to England

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.540
 and spent a lot of time at court.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.540
 And she was super fun, livened the whole place up.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.620
 And the thing is, they were this Italian family.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.980
 And we should say they were called the Mazarinettes

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.540
 and there were seven of them all together.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.020
 And they were the seven nieces of the Cardinal.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.500
 And they all looked quite different.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.940
 They were dark skinned when everyone was very pale skinned.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.260
 - They looked similar to each other,

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.340
 but different to normal other people.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.140
 - To normal noble women, yes, who were all very pale.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.300
 They all seemed to have the same name.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.700
 There were two Laura's, two Anne-Marie's and one Marianne,

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.140
 which is quite confusing.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.460
 But yeah, they were fun and Hortense especially.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.860
 So at one point when she ran away from Armand Charles,

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.820
 she ended up in a convent,

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.180
 or I think she was put in a convent

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.660
 to try and make her behave.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.140
 But she became best friends with this woman

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.020
 called Manmoselle de Cossel,

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.380
 who maybe she was in a relationship with

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.380
 or had a little fling with.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.580
 Maybe they were just really close friends.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.780
 And they sort of played practical jokes

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.180
 on the nuns quite a lot.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.660
 - They all thought they were pregnant.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.500
 - They, yeah.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.500
 I promised I haven't had sex all the nuns.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.500
 Yeah, she did things like she filled two chests with water

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.980
 and apparently the water leaked through

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.580
 onto the nun's beds.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.260
 But she had this really cool adventure in the convent

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.420
 where her husband came to try and kidnap her away

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.220
 when he found she was misbehaving.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.820
 And her, Manmoselle Cossel, found,

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.620
 it's like the stuff of fantasies.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.580
 They found a little hole in a grate in the parlor

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.380
 which they could just squeeze through to escape.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.340
 And so they squeezed through this grate

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.060
 and they climbed out the outside.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.700
 And then they actually realized it was a false alarm

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.540
 and their friends were visiting, not her husband.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.380
 - This is the story of the sound of music.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.220
 (laughing)

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.980
 This is, there are baddies in a convent,

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.940
 squeezing through a gate, come on.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.620
 - Yep, well then they squeezed back in

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.460
 'cause they were like,

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.940
 "Oh, we're gonna look stupid, it's just our mates."

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.580
 And she got stuck in this grate

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.660
 between two iron bars for about 20 minutes.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.340
 And Manmoselle Cossel, that's like tug her out

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.020
 and then they ended up covered in soot

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.380
 on the parlor floor, snogging.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.580
 No, I've embellished some of the ending, but yeah, sounds fun.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.380
 - After she died, her husband caught up with her

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.260
 and had wanted actually to repatriate her for ages,

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.100
 but hadn't managed to do it. - It's so much easier

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.700
 to catch up with someone after they die.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.100
 - Well, exactly, it's really, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.220
 - Well, he caught up with her, he caught her body,

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.940
 he put it in a sealed coffin, great, fair play,

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.020
 it's what you meant to do.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.020
 And then he just carried it around Europe

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.660
 on a sort of weird posthumous honeymoon

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.860
 to all the places they had been together in life

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.700
 for four months, a long time.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.340
 And then eventually, he left her in a country churchyard

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.500
 and then eventually when he died later,

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.700
 they were buried next to each other.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.260
 I don't know how she would have felt about that.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.860
 - And then during the revolution,

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.140
 they got chucked in the sand.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.100
 - Yeah, so it has a...

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.580
 - An unhappy ending, not a few other people.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.740
 (laughing)

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.220
 - Obviously, you know, I'm a big fan of the aristocracy.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.860
 - I read an article that she introduced champagne to Britain.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.060
 - I read that. - Yeah, I think popularized.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.100
 - Popularized, yeah. - Oh, really?

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.300
 - I think she was fun.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.100
 - Oh my God, then this is the most fun thing about her.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.300
 I did all this reading and then finally, at the end,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.940
 find this one article which talks about

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.060
 this extraordinary saloon that she opened up in the 17th.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.060
 - I think Salon.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.700
 - I think a saloon is a Wild West Indian car.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.380
 - Is it not a saloon? - It's a saloon.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.380
 - No, no, no, all the ladies in London used to come.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.540
 They had to leave their guns in the car.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.660
 - And at those swinging doors,

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.700
 the piano player, they would stop when Hortense walked in.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.020
 That's it, yeah.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.180
 So we're calling it Salon, so really.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.020
 - Let's go with Salon for the moment.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:13.860
 - Let's call it for that, yeah.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.820
 - Because it was kind of French,

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.580
 so let's say a saloon, but with a French angle, like Salon.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.980
 So let's land on Salon.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.820
 - I mean, that's definitely.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.660
 - That's what they were called.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.780
 - That's what like Salons, very popular in those days.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.620
 Have Salon.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.380
 - So she ran this, let me get to the fucking facts.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.340
 She's 17th century London.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.340
 She had basically this extraordinary like book club

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.300
 that she ran next to St. James's Palace

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.220
 and all the ladies who were encouraging not to do this,

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.740
 to have intellectual conversation, to read books

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.980
 and discuss them with each other,

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.580
 to share their ideas, their philosophies would go.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.820
 They would drink champagne

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.780
 and they would do all this stuff together.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.340
 And she was just such a,

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.820
 the article describes her as an influencer of the time.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.660
 - Definitely.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.900
 The interesting thing was these Salons

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.700
 were massive in France, weren't they?

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.780
 They were like a huge thing in France at the time

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.740
 and all the middle class and upper class women

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.980
 would go to these Salons and kind of learn things,

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.940
 but she was the one who brought it to London.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.780
 - Yeah.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.220
 - 'Cause it didn't exist here at the time.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.380
 - Yeah, you could say that really podcasts

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.700
 are the Salons of the present day.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.860
 - It wasn't.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.540
 - Well, we're discussing things.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.940
 - We allow one woman on our podcast.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.980
 - That's true.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.300
 - Yes, traditionally a male environment.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.180
 - Okay.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.020
 It's loose.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.460
 - It's a discussion, isn't it?

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.180
 We've all got champagne.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.340
 - Oh, God, yeah, I wouldn't come to this

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.300
 if that wasn't promised.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.380
 - But she, I mean, this was how great her influence was,

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.180
 particularly with quite obscure texts.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.260
 If she introduced a text to be read,

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.420
 it would get round town

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.060
 that this was like something that was amazing

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.900
 and it would boost up a big run of it with translations

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.020
 because people suddenly were going,

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:49.940
 what are they reading there?

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.220
 And we have to be part of that.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.860
 - It was very much the Richard and Judy's Book Club

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:54.700
 of its day.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.540
 - Yes, exactly.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.380
 That's what it was.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.380
 - That's more of a salon.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.340
 - Yeah, that is a book club.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.060
 - The one interesting about Hortense, if you Google her,

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.100
 the first image, the painting that comes up of her

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.740
 is of her looking very beautiful

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.420
 and then just a little nipple hanging out from the move.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:12.260
 Did you see that?

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.100
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.460
 - And there's only a few paintings of her that are around,

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.460
 but that's one of the surviving ones.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.300
 - I think that might be just your history

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.340
 is deciding what pictures you get.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.580
 - Yeah, that's possible.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.180
 - It's interesting you'd have that painted in

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.020
 to an official portrait, not official,

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.620
 but a portrait of you ends up with a bit of nipple in.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.380
 It's just a general portrait that you get done

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.020
 to show that you're a sexy person, like Janet Jackson.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.540
 - Yeah, that was why she did that, wasn't it?

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.940
 - But the thing is with Janet Jackson,

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.900
 it was a malfunction, right, where she quickly covered up.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.460
 But with a painting, you'd have to sit there

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.460
 for about three days.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.300
 - That's a hell of a malfunction.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.300
 - We'll accidentally follow it out.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.540
 (laughing)

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.940
 - Maybe the artist was just too embarrassed.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.660
 You know when like someone has green in their teeth

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.140
 and they just, you'd want to say, but you don't say it,

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.420
 he's like, "Oh, I just got to paint it in, I guess."

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.260
 (laughing)

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.840
 (upbeat music)

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.900
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.540
 and that is James.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.940
 - Okay, my fact this week is that according

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.260
 to their origin story, the Minions serve

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.020
 the most evil person on earth,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.460
 but they were conveniently frozen in a cave

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:24.020
 and unable to serve anyone between 1933 and 1945.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.180
 (laughing)

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.660
 - Wow, is this official Minions' Canon?

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.620
 - I believe it is.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.460
 - Yeah, where is it?

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.500
 - Yeah, it's in the movie.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.940
 - It's in the movie, it's in the second movie, yeah.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.020
 - Oh, wow.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.620
 - The dates, you've altered the dates there,

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.140
 but that is part of the period when they were frozen.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.620
 - I gave the dates for Hitler,

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.100
 and half of them the dates for the Minions.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.020
 - Exactly.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.460
 - But basically, there's this thing on the internet

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.740
 that people keep doing this meme where they say,

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.140
 "Ah, the Minions, they serve the most evil person,

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.540
 "but what were they doing during World War II?"

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.980
 And it's like a big joke that,

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.260
 "Ah, they haven't thought of this,

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.380
 "but of course they have thought of it,

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.300
 "and it is in the movie, which I haven't seen."

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.420
 - Yeah, so we should say who the Minions are,

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.140
 but there's these little yellow creatures

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.700
 who are in the film Despicable Me,

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.540
 and then all the other sequels.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.860
 - And then the film Minions.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.660
 - So they were henchmen that got their own

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.380
 spin-off series, and Minions was 2015,

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.420
 and in the opening sequence, it tells you the history,

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.100
 so it says that they serve various evil masters

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.180
 from the T-Rex all the way through to--

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.580
 - When did they get out of the cave?

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.620
 Sorry to interrupt you, Dan.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.460
 - So they go into the cave in 1812.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.340
 That's when they first go in,

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.100
 and they emerge in 1968, I think,

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.180
 to avoid being so obviously avoiding the Nazis.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.540
 - So 1812 would have been just after

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.860
 Napoleon's retreat from Moscow.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.940
 - Yeah, yeah, well, it's very cold

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.500
 in when they were treating, so--

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.500
 - Exactly. - There we go.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.940
 - All right, I'm going with the lore.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.780
 I love it.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.940
 - I wonder who they're serving now,

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.820
 who's the most evil person on a--

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.580
 - Few candidates, aren't there?

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.860
 None in this room, sorry, I'm looking around, I'm sorry.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:50.820
 (laughing)

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.980
 The director, one of the co-directors of the films,

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.220
 is Pierre Coffin, Peter Coffin.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.060
 - Peter Coffin, yeah.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:57.900
 - But his name doesn't actually,

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.060
 Coffin in French doesn't mean Coffin.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.300
 - What does it mean?

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.660
 - I don't think it means anything,

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.700
 but the word "Couffin" means basket,

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.420
 which is very close, so I really thought

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.540
 it was called Peter Coffin,

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.060
 and then I thought it was called Peter Basket,

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.620
 and actually, he isn't called either.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.460
 (laughing)

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.500
 - But he does the voices of lots of the Minions, right?

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.940
 - Lots of them, yeah.

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.980
 - All of them apart from Baby One, yeah.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.060
 - Well, there's Jermaine Clement

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.420
 from Flight of the Comcords does one.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.260
 - Does he voice them?

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.300
 - No, one, literally one Minion,

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.380
 and then this guy, and someone else,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.660
 but this guy does 899 Minions.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.180
 - Oh, wow, I think so, there's another director,

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.020
 there's a co-director of the film,

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:32.860
 so I think that's another-- - Yeah,

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.020
 who also does some Minion voices.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.140
 - The language sounds so difficult to do,

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.140
 'cause every word is, I think,

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.340
 a real word from one language or another.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.500
 - I think there's some gibberish in there.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.340
 - There's gibberish as well.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.420
 - It's mixed in with loads of other languages.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.540
 - But they sound so funny to listen to,

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.500
 I just, I love the sound of the Minion's language,

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.980
 like it's really funny.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.980
 - Have you seen them all?

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.020
 - No, I haven't seen any of them, I've just watched some.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.460
 - Yeah, I've seen Minions in bits,

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.660
 you know, you walk in and out

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.340
 while the kid's watching a movie,

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.460
 and then you're asked to leave the cinema

00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.740
 'cause where's your kid, you know,

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.860
 and it's like, "All right, I'm outta here, jeez."

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.100
 - Yeah, he's cool, Coffin,

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.380
 and I think that one of the reasons

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.500
 that the Minions speak this combination of languages

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.540
 is that he is very multilingual, I think,

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.340
 so he's like half Indonesian, half French,

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.540
 grew up in Cambodia and Japan,

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.340
 and, yeah, invented this language.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.940
 And interestingly, when it's dubbed into other languages,

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.420
 it gets changed, because you notice

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.020
 that they say English words enough,

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.300
 you're like, "Oh, they must be talking about toast now,"

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.100
 or bananas, famously.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.940
 But in other languages, they'll sub those words

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.300
 for that language. - Interesting.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.140
 So they'll still use the Indonesian

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.380
 and the different places,

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.260
 but then whenever there was an English word,

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.980
 they use whatever country you're in the world.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.100
 - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, that's interesting.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.260
 - Or just drop in more local words where they can.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.100
 - That's cool.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.620
 Yeah, his mom was a famous novelist, wasn't she?

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.460
 - Was she?

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.420
 - N.H.Dini, Coffin's mom, was called.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:48.940
 I'd never heard of her inside of this,

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.420
 but she is an Indonesian novelist and feminist.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.940
 - Very nice.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.340
 - At least two of the Minions' films

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.700
 have been banned or altered by censors in China.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.380
 - Oh, really? - Who dislike various aspects

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.220
 of the plot.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.860
 So there's, and I just, I really like this.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.420
 So the film, The Rise of Gru,

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.020
 which I think is one of the most recent ones,

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.500
 the Chinese censors added an entirely different bit

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.780
 of the film at the end of it,

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.400
 clarifying that one of the characters

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.260
 who previously been involved in a heist in the film,

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.700
 you know, fictional film, fictional heist, everything,

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.780
 was caught and served 20 years in prison for the heist.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.380
 I mean, fuck yeah. - That's so good.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.020
 (laughing)

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.060
 - They also say that Gru returned to his family

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.620
 and his biggest accomplishment was his free children.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.460
 - Gosh.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.980
 - And apparently the reason that they've done this,

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:40.060
 most people think is to promote China's three child policy.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:40.900
 - Oh no.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.740
 - Which they've been trying to do

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.060
 to increase the birth rate over the last few years.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.620
 - Wow. - Guys.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.900
 - I was reading about other animated villains

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.100
 of various guys. - Oh great, okay.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.180
 - And so Scar, The Lion King.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.140
 - Yeah.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.740
 - No spoilers, please, I haven't seen it.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.260
 - I think I can avoid spoilers.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:58.100
 - Great.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.300
 - Who is sexier, Scar or Mufasa?

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.860
 - According to just us or you?

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.700
 - According to you.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.780
 - Are they both lions?

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.620
 - Yep.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.460
 - Mufasa.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.300
 - Mufasa.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.540
 - Okay, it says equal to the lions.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.660
 - I find them both equally attractive at the lions.

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.140
 - Lions can be more or less sexier than each other.

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.260
 They're apparently completely impossible

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.220
 for James to compete.

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.060
 (laughing)

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.580
 - I thought it was a subjective question.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.420
 - Do you find all, you must think there are some animals

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.980
 which are sexier than other animals in the same species.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.180
 - Have that buff kangaroo.

00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:24.940
 (laughing)

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.380
 - I'm not sure that that is true.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.380
 - Do you think of all humans as being equally sexy?

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.220
 - Absolutely.

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.060
 (laughing)

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.620
 - Apart from my wife of course,

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.940
 they're slightly less sexy than other animals.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:35.780
 (laughing)

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.180
 - Wait, doesn't your cat have a modeling contract though?

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:39.180
 - No, she doesn't.

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:43.100
 She has appeared in some adverts.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.820
 - So you must think she's sexy.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.620
 - You don't have to be sexy to be in an advert.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.940
 That's not what they are always cast for.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:48.780
 - No, you're right.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.620
 - But the difference here is--

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.460
 - Captain Bird's work.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.180
 What a terrible example of the sexiest man on TV.

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.180
 - He's so hot, yeah.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.900
 (laughing)

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.260
 - Can I just say I don't find my cat sexy?

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.580
 - Yeah, you're allowed to say this.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.020
 It can be a model and not sexy.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.180
 It's the human personality,

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.500
 which is adding to the sexiness of these characters as well.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.100
 - Well, they've got voices, haven't they?

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.180
 Yeah, they're human voices.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.900
 And I'm speaking in English, yeah, yeah.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.980
 - For me, I would say that physically,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.300
 Mufasa definitely sexier,

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.780
 but in terms of personality and voice,

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.540
 Scar, of course, is more sexy.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:19.940
 - Okay, well.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.540
 - Scar's like old and manky looks.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.260
 - No, but I know that's why I said.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.100
 - No, I know.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.060
 No, no, and he personality-wise is evil.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.580
 - Okay, well, can I say one of you is right and wrong?

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.540
 - Mufasa is less sexy than Scar.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.060
 Scar is the sexier one, physically,

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.620
 and would be in the real world as well.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.700
 In fact, specifically in the real world.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.860
 So this is a study about

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.980
 what makes a lion sexy or unsexy.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.540
 And for years, they've been thinking about-

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.980
 - Come on, you're talking from a lion's perspective.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.140
 That was the whole point.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.980
 - This is about what, main darkness.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.820
 - Right, yeah.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.100
 - 'Cause some lions have really, really light mains,

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.980
 and some have really, really dark ones.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.620
 You know, scientists have been trying to work out for years.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.380
 What does this have any effect at all?

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.740
 And they just introduced these fake lions,

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.220
 and they could sort the mains around.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.660
 And you could attach them with Velcro,

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.020
 so you could whip off a mane and then reattach it.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.100
 And the dark mains were very much preferred

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.540
 by the lady lions, lionesses, as they're also known.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.820
 But interestingly, dark-mained lions

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.700
 have more abnormal sperm,

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:18.860
 because they have heat stress,

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.340
 because their mains are so dark,

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.500
 they keep absorbing sunlight,

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.140
 and they have to eat smaller meals as well,

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.340
 because they get more heat stress,

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.660
 and if they eat a massive, great meal,

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.700
 you know, it warms you up.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:28.540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.820
 - You know, sometimes you have a huge meal.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.500
 - I'm so hot on that.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.420
 - Oh, no, no, no, no, mate, sperm are deformed.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.140
 (all laughing)

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:36.980
 Would you like a dessert?

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.780
 No, they're deformed enough already.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.460
 (all laughing)

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.020
 - That's why I make my husband,

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.500
 dye his hair peroxide blonde before every meal.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.740
 (all laughing)

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.500
 You've got to watch out.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.260
 - I'm sure that peroxide's good for him.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.260
 (all laughing)

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.900
 - Lex Luthor, do you know what made him evil?

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.500
 He's the villain in the Superman universe.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.340
 - I actually don't.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.780
 No, I don't have a handle on what he came from.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.620
 - What is he?

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:01.780
 He's just like a rich guy.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.340
 - He's a rich guy, but he was a scientist,

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.820
 and it was basically Superman made him bald,

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.940
 and that is why.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.780
 - Bald?

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:08.620
 - Yeah.

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.460
 - As in no hair.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.260
 - So he used to have a huge amount of ginger hair on his head,

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.660
 and there was an incident between Superman and Lex Luthor,

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.180
 where they were in a science lab.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.380
 Lex Luthor was trying to make something really good.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.260
 Superman had to blow it out

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.540
 because something went a bit wrong,

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.220
 and in the big Superman blow that he did,

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.980
 it just pushed these chemicals onto Lex Luthor's head,

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:29.820
 made him bald.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.580
 He was so furious, he became a supervillain.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.340
 - And that's an overreaction.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.180
 - It's an overreaction.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.220
 - He's got temper issues with us.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.900
 - What's amazing is this is a retroactive story

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.220
 to explain why he suddenly goes bald,

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.980
 because you know part of like comic book artistry,

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.220
 they would hand it to sort of as it was ghost artists

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.820
 to come in and do the sort of comic strips and help them.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.060
 One of the guys who was in charge of it one week,

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.380
 mistaken Lex Luthor for one of the bald henchmen

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.020
 and accidentally drew Lex Luthor as a bald headed man.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.780
 And so it was a total mistake

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.020
 and it ran for a couple of weeks.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.860
 It went out and then another one went out

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.020
 and that just had to be it.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:05.940
 So he had no hair.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.220
 So the only reason he's bald is an artistic mistake.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.700
 - Who the hell is proof reading this?

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.500
 That's like releasing a few scenes from The Lion King

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.500
 where a hyena plays Scar and no one notices.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.980
 And then what?

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.300
 - Lex Luthor would buck the trend of most supervillains

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.020
 because villains in fiction and particularly depictions

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.380
 of villains are generally more pointy than heroes.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.820
 Yeah, there's the sense of, you know,

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.940
 you can draw Mickey Mouse with three circles.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.940
 - But if he was bad, it would be triangles.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.100
 - Well, yeah.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.460
 So I was reading an explanation about this,

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.180
 about the graphology of films and so on.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.820
 Darth Vader literally has a triangle

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.660
 on the front of his face.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.780
 - Oh yeah, he does.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.060
 - More scary.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.420
 - But more sexy very often.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.900
 I mean, they genuinely are made to be a bit attractive,

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:48.740
 I think.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.180
 - Sorry, Darth Vader.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.460
 - He's got a dark main Darth Vader actually.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.460
 So he is more attractive to female Vaders.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.980
 - Yeah, he was king of the prize.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:02.580
 More like, more than women actually.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.940
 - Is he not sexy Darth Vader?

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.780
 - Darth Vader?

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.060
 - He's got a sexy voice, doesn't he?

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.300
 - Have you seen Under the Helmet?

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.420
 - I haven't seen any of the-

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.260
 - Okay, no.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.100
 - Don't look under the helmet.

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:11.940
 - Don't look under the helmet.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:12.780
 - Keep that helmet on.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.020
 If you're making out with Darth Vader,

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.180
 just keep that helmet on.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.020
 - Yeah.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.020
 - I think in Disney films,

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.940
 the female villains are acknowledged as sexy

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.020
 in fact there's a book called The Enchanted Screen,

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.100
 the Unknown History of Fairytale Films.

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:26.940
 - Who are you thinking of?

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.780
 - Which says-

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.340
 - That woman in The Little Mermaid.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.420
 The big octopus.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.420
 - That's what she learned, yeah.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.060
 - Pick the one example that she does in the film.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.940
 Although she's got some nice lipstick on.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.060
 - There's arguments about whether or not she's an octopus

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.940
 because she's only got six arms.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.780
 But then-

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.820
 - Human arms or octopus?

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.660
 - Well, here's the thing.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.500
 - She's got tentacles, hasn't she?

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.340
 - Right.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.180
 - She has tentacles.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.940
 The argument is she does have two human arms,

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.740
 which makes it eight, which, yeah.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.060
 - Hang on, isn't there a QI fact

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.940
 that octopuses have six legs and two arms?

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.020
 - Two, like pedipals, yeah.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:00.060
 - Yeah, because they use their legs to walk

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.580
 and they use their arms to grab things.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.740
 - So they've got it bang on.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.500
 - She's a perfect octopus.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.340
 Six legs, two arms.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.980
 - Yeah, I guess so, except that she's a myrrh something, right?

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.820
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.060
 - So I don't know, do you count the human part

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.260
 in with the octopus part?

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.100
 - That's right.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:15.940
 - I don't know, I don't know.

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:16.780
 - Anna, I think you were saying something about-

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:17.820
 - I don't know that you're spending too much time

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.580
 on some weird forums, Dan.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.620
 (laughing)

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.140
 I was just saying that in "Snow White,"

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.780
 that queen in "Snow White" is acknowledged,

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.940
 according to this book, it says,

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.940
 "As is well-known, animators all preferred drawing her

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.180
 "when they were making "Snow White"

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.700
 "because she was very complex as a woman

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.660
 "and much more erotic than "Snow White."

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.980
 And she isn't everything in "Corrella de Vil," she is,

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.300
 and it's sort of-

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.620
 - They're kind of glamorous, yeah.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.500
 - They're glamorous, certainly, yeah.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.740
 - Maybe it's glam.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:46.700
 - I think it's glam, yeah.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.500
 - They're glamorous, they're powerful, they're independent,

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.340
 they know what they want.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.940
 They want to skin dogs to make a coat.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.380
 I like a woman with ambitions.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.900
 (laughing)

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.020
 - And he's old, you know what I'm saying, yeah.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.740
 - One thing that they do often have, villains,

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.860
 I think this is more men than women, actually,

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.980
 but they often have terrible skin.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.740
 And dermatologists are not happy about this,

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.900
 'cause they say it may foster a tendency

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.580
 towards prejudice in society.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.580
 Because all the bad guys in movies have bad skin,

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.940
 if you see someone with bad skin,

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.260
 you're gonna think they're bad.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.140
 And really, there's quite a lot of people

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.580
 who are saying that really, you shouldn't do this.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:25.260
 We should stop having scars, we should stop having-

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.100
 - Yes.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.300
 - I'm trying to think you have bad skin.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.940
 - Well, for example, almost all James Bond villains,

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.260
 even in the- - I think in Christoph Waltz

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.020
 in "Anything He's In," as like-

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.100
 - Exactly. - Scars, doesn't he?

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.380
 - But the most recent Bond movie has two villains,

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.220
 both of whom have facial disfigurements,

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.180
 "Have You About Them" has one in a previous film,

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.380
 and it's like- - The bad is Roger Rabbit.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.060
 - There is a lot of it when you start looking.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.420
 - I thought you just meant acne.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.420
 'Cause I think, I mean, scars are kind of cool,

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.800
 but being covered in acne,

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.780
 I can see that that would like be insulting.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.540
 - No, no, no, no, but it's lots of people

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.620
 who suffered facial scarring for whatever reason.

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.340
 And then you see film after film after film,

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.740
 the baddie is a baddie because they've suffered

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.940
 some facial scarring. - Two face, the Joker.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, man is full of it as well.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.300
 - When you start, you do realize, yeah, this is mad.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.660
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.900
 - Just another backstory,

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.620
 and another World War II related backstory, Donald Duck.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.940
 There's a theory about him that I quite like, so basically.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.620
 - Is there anything to do with this cock-screw-shaped penis?

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.020
 (both laughing)

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.460
 Like the old ducks are.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.900
 - I think you can probably make it to do with that,

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.300
 I believe in you.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.260
 But before World War II, Donald Duck existed,

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.740
 obviously as part of the Disney franchise,

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.020
 lots of shorts with him,

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:38.900
 but he was quite a light-hearted, fun-loving duck.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.860
 - Can I just quickly say, lots of shorts, but no trousers.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.940
 - Very good. - Thank you.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.460
 - Thank you for that.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:48.220
 So as we know now, Donald Duck, bad temper, right?

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.060
 That's what he's famous for,

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.340
 he's always shouting at his nephews.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.180
 He's very...

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.740
 (mimicking duck noises)

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.860
 - That's uncanny change, that's a good impression.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.100
 - Really good, yeah.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.180
 - I didn't know you could do that.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.460
 - It's not a good tempered noise.

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.180
 It's not a happy noise.

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.460
 So he changed, and the theory is that he,

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.740
 it was the war that changed him

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:11.140
 because he is the only character in the Disney franchise

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.980
 who actually saw active service.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.820
 - Stop it!

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:14.660
 (laughing)

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.020
 - He was on the beaches at Normandy.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.620
 He only wanted a piece of bread.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:18.980
 (laughing)

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.380
 What do you mean he saw active service?

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.660
 - He saw all those cartoons.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.220
 - You know all the propaganda cartoons

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.420
 that Disney released during the war?

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.020
 Loads and loads of propaganda cartoons.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.100
 So all the characters featured in these,

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.540
 but they didn't go actually into battle

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.580
 except Donald Duck, who did.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.540
 - In which theatre?

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.380
 - What do you mean?

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.020
 - In which theatre of the war did he fight?

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.380
 - He, the Pacific.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.820
 - Sorry, I didn't say that.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.540
 - I actually think it might have been the Pacific.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:42.900
 - Well, he is a duck.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.060
 He would make sense for him to be in the water.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:45.900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.340
 He should be, maybe, if he's in any of the services.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.460
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.380
 - But I can't remember to be fair,

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.940
 but he's seen serving, shown serving in the US military

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.540
 in one of the propaganda films,

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.540
 fighting an air battle against the Nazis.

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.940
 - Oh, an air battle?

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.580
 - Well, he is a duck after all.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.540
 (laughing)

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.260
 Makes sense that he should be in the air floss.

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.420
 - He's the perfect weapon.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.260
 (laughing)

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.180
 - He doesn't even need a plane.

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.620
 - No, wow.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.860
 And you're saying that he's got PTSD, effectively.

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.500
 - Well, straight after the World War II,

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.500
 his temper got worse.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.620
 He became very sensitive to loud noises.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.620
 You know, if his nephews make a racket,

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.860
 he gets upset, and that's the idea.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.180
 And actually, in a recent duck tales,

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.380
 he had to have anger management courses.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.220
 - Wow.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.060
 - So that's the theory.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.260
 He's got PTSD from the war,

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.980
 and all the evidence is there, I think.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.460
 - Whenever anyone was shooting, they would go, "Duck!"

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.700
 (laughing)

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.280
 (upbeat music)

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:39.020
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.820
 and that is Andy.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.740
 - My fact is that every barge firm on the River Thames

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.940
 used to have its own signature whistle.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:47.940
 - Oh my God.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.780
 (laughing)

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.380
 - Oh, that's very cool.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.220
 - Yeah.

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.860
 - This fact, Andy, I reckon,

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.860
 if you put all of your facts into an AI,

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:56.700
 (laughing)

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.220
 this is what they might come up with.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:02.240
 - London whistling and a means of transport,

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.220
 this is not very popular anymore, yep.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.100
 - Yeah, seemingly dull.

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.380
 - But really interesting when you get into it.

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:09.220
 - Well, let's find out.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.100
 - Yeah, exactly, you'd be the judge at home.

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.300
 - So anyway, this was on a British library blog post

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.580
 about the decline of whistling,

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:17.220
 which is absolutely meat and drink to me, obviously.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.260
 And it's about Lighterman.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:22.140
 Lighterman were the men, almost exclusively,

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.300
 who steered barges to their destinations,

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.300
 and barges are basically flat-bottom boats

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.180
 that were used to transport lots of cargo.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.620
 So you might dock your ship in the river,

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:31.600
 'cause there isn't a proper dock,

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.580
 you just drop it in the middle of the river,

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:34.540
 and then you have to unload it,

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.040
 and the barges are the things that go back and forth,

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.700
 emptying them out or loading them up.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.980
 And there were different barge firms,

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.300
 and every barge firm had its own whistle,

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.700
 and it was so you could identify yourself at night.

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:45.860
 There we go.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:46.700
 - Who's was that?

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.980
 - Yeah, that's the sexiest of all the barge firms.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:50.260
 James obviously doesn't see any difference

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.100
 between sexiness and barge firms.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.780
 - To me, barges are all the same.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.220
 (laughing)

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.140
 - Yeah, so barges, barges are great.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.500
 The apprenticeship used to be five years long,

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.140
 just for the Thames.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.620
 - Oh, Anna's been on a barge.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.180
 You've looked after a barge, haven't you?

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.740
 - Yeah, well, a canal boat,

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.340
 so not one of the big Thames barges,

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.540
 which you had to sail.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.620
 - Oh, narrow. - Must be the same.

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:12.220
 - No, James, please.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.660
 We're gonna get deeply into the difference

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.600
 between a narrow boat, a barge, all of it.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.580
 (laughing)

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.540
 - But the apprenticeships lasted for so long,

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.380
 didn't they?

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:23.900
 So they were introduced, I think, in 1555,

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.220
 and that was when Parliament established

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.740
 the company of Waterman and Lightman,

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.380
 because they needed to regulate the industry,

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:35.220
 and I think it only stopped maybe 500 years later.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.820
 - I think it was 2007, the government suggested.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.900
 Maybe we don't need to spend five years learning.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.540
 - More so more than 500 years, exactly.

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.980
 I mean, it is tough, but come on.

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.620
 Also, there are no working barges on the Thames anymore,

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.900
 so it does seem quite weird to be doing that.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:49.820
 - I think it's a good thing

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.220
 that we stopped people learning how to barge

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.140
 and getting them to do maths instead these days.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.660
 (laughing)

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.660
 - Well, it takes just two years of training now

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.380
 and six months of local knowledge training, which is--

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.220
 - But then there are people just trashing barges

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.260
 into each other and--

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.380
 - Yeah, it's woefully inadequate, it's ridiculous.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.500
 - We've seen the Thames here.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.620
 - So you're saying there's no barges these days,

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.620
 but they're clearly barged.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.060
 - Well, there are barges for other purposes,

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.820
 so it's not really for freight anymore,

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:21.180
 it's for tourism, or for taking restaurant barges,

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.500
 or I don't think there are any that are having

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.220
 iron deposited from Europe and carrying them up.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.060
 - There were two, right?

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.820
 - You had the Lighterman,

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.460
 which is carrying all those goods back and forth,

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:32.500
 but then you had the Waterman,

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.260
 who were the people that carried people across,

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.780
 which was a massively important thing back in the day,

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.900
 because getting across from the south side of London

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.340
 to the north was an incredibly hard thing sometimes.

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.240
 - Or the other way.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.740
 - Or the other way, even if you, why would you go south?

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:47.580
 (laughing)

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:48.420
 - Good point.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.260
 (laughing)

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:50.100
 - I live south.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.180
 (laughing)

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.980
 Yeah, so people like Peeps write about it,

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.460
 saying it was the quickest way to get across,

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:59.060
 because often the clogging on the bridges

00:47:59.060 --> 00:47:59.900
 would be so great, it was just--

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.340
 - What you say bridges was bridge, wasn't it?

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.260
 - Bridge, London Bridge, was the only one east of Kingston,

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.340
 which is a lot of river with one bridge across it,

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.860
 so they were massively important.

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.940
 And get this, I love this, so loads of their trade

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.460
 came from transporting people to the theater,

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.180
 so that was why you would go to the South Bank,

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.860
 it's 'cause it was where all the theaters were,

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.260
 so that was a huge bit of trade for the Waterman.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.140
 And then when Covent Garden set up,

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.540
 where we're recording this podcast,

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.980
 their trade suffered massively,

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:28.540
 'cause there was suddenly theaters north of the river,

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:29.660
 and no one had to cross the river

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.380
 anymore to go and see a show.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.060
 - But you could still get carried down the river, couldn't you?

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.460
 If you lived in Chelsea and you had to get to Covent Garden.

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.900
 - Oh yeah, that's true,

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.820
 although there were other means of getting

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.140
 from Chelsea to Covent Garden.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:44.660
 So they were so angry about the loss of their trade,

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:47.420
 and they campaigned so much to Charles I,

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.940
 when he was king, that in 1635,

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.900
 he banned taxi cabs in the city,

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.940
 unless they were traveling three miles out of the city.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:57.780
 - No way, to keep the barges in business.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.060
 - Keep the barges happy.

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.580
 - I try to find any notable lighter men.

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.860
 So the closest I found, well, Danny Dyer,

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.020
 who's a quite famous character,

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.940
 his family, he came from a long line of lighter men.

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.020
 - Really, is that right?

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.660
 - That's interesting, that seems classic.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.700
 - But one that I thought was a bit relevant to us

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.980
 was I found that a comedian came from a long line of lighter men,

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.100
 and it was a comedian who was called Malcolm Hardy.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.140
 And during the boom of alternative comedy

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.260
 in London, particularly, he was a great voice,

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.740
 and he used to open clubs,

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.140
 and they were known as dangerous clubs

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.900
 because you would have heckles from the audience,

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.620
 he would heckle the act coming.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.060
 You know, I don't know about the next act,

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.580
 they might be a bit shit, I think they are.

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.980
 Please welcome to the stage, you know,

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.300
 and then bring you down to the stage.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.780
 (laughing)

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:44.740
 - Cheers, Malcolm, thank you.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.580
 - So he was an amazing character,

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.620
 and he wasn't a lightsman himself,

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.740
 but he did live on the Thames.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.460
 He had a boat that he lived on,

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.340
 and sadly, quite a few years ago,

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.700
 he fell into the Thames and died.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:58.500
 But what is interesting about Malcolm Hardy

00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.900
 is he's very relevant to us,

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:01.180
 and even the listeners of this show,

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:05.020
 because he opened up a club in Greenwich called Up the Creek,

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.620
 which is where we do all of our live shows often in London,

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.620
 and that is the Malcolm Hardy Club.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.420
 - Have you heard of the Trojan barge?

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.900
 - No. - No.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:18.740
 - So this was during the 80 years war,

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.300
 and the Anglo-Spanish war,

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.740
 'cause they kind of coincided with each other,

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:25.580
 and it was the city of Braida,

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:29.260
 and the Dutch and the English were trying to capture it,

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.940
 and the way they did it was with a Trojan barge.

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:36.500
 There was a canal or a small, like a shallow river

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.060
 that went into the city,

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.780
 and they had a barge with a load of peat in it,

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.460
 a load of moss. - Nice.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:45.460
 - One for you, and they all hid underneath the peat,

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:46.980
 and they got into the city,

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.140
 and then jumped out and then took the city.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:49.980
 - That's brilliant.

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:53.100
 - And it was kind of like one of the turning points of that war.

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.260
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.580
 - So wait, when you say that barge with a load of peat,

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.740
 they didn't put peat on top of the barge and disguise it.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:50:59.580
 They did, they disguised the barge.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.660
 - They hid underneath, no, no, the barge,

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.460
 everyone knew it was a barge.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.260
 Everyone knew it was a barge full of peat,

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.220
 but what they didn't know is that there were soldiers

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.380
 in between the barge and the peat.

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.220
 - That's incredible.

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:14.060
 - And the soldiers used the peat to kind of hide themselves

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:15.700
 even once they got off the barge,

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:19.860
 so the people of Braida would be attacked by moss men.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.140
 - This is like the moving forest in my birth base.

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.620
 - Yes, it's been attacked by a bunch of peat.

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:25.460
 - That's very tall.

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.780
 - That is so cool.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.020
 But did they have to snorkel through the peat?

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:31.900
 'Cause peat, I think, was being very heavy, very dark.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:34.140
 If you're lying with peat, basically buried under peat,

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:34.980
 that's not good for you.

00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.660
 - Probably the amount of peat above them

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.940
 wasn't so much that they all suffocated.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:40.500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I see that.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.980
 - Yeah, I was just imagining like a little flat hat

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:43.820
 that you're kind of wearing.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.620
 - Yeah, but you can't have too little peat

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:46.580
 'cause otherwise they'll see.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.180
 Wait, isn't there something under that peat?

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.580
 - Probably a folding locks amount of peat that they used.

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.940
 And that was the amount that they used, I think.

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:52.780
 - Brilliant.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:53.620
 Well, that's military planning for you.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:54.700
 That's your guess, Chris.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:58.060
 - They actually did do a previous run

00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.980
 with another peat barge.

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.260
 So yeah, they did it with just like one or two soldiers

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:03.380
 to see if it was gonna work.

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:04.220
 And it did work.

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.700
 And then the next time they did it properly.

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.540
 - That's so funny.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.940
 What do those soldiers then do once they're in the city?

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.380
 But there are only two of them.

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.580
 Peat, get your peat!

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.020
 Anyone want some peat?

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.620
 Fellow Braida people.

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:17.420
 - I don't have any frame of reference

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.380
 to the '80 Years War.

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:23.060
 - No, and nor do I in this short paragraph that I've written.

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:24.900
 But yeah, it was basically the,

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.700
 I think it was just, I'm gonna be wrong,

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.740
 but I think it was just before the Glorious Revolution.

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:31.180
 So I think it was whenever that was.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.020
 - '60, '88.

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:32.860
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.300
 - It's one of those mid-European mid-century wars.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.580
 - Yeah, they all merged.

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.580
 - The '80 Years War, the Hundred Years War,

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:40.460
 the '27 Years War.

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.580
 - They weren't very creative with the names, were they?

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:44.580
 - I've got one more barge, I think, for you.

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.420
 - Yeah.

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:46.740
 - This is actually sent in by a listener.

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:49.100
 This is sent in by Hannah Watson a while ago.

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.500
 In 2004, there was a sightseeing barge trip

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:54.300
 happening in Texas, right, on a lake called Lake Travis.

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.660
 There were 60 people on board.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.780
 Unfortunately, the barge then passed a place

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:01.220
 called Hippie Hollow, which contains what was certainly then

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:05.060
 the only public nude beach in Texas.

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.220
 Every single person on the barge moved to one side

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.580
 of the boat in the hope of seeing somebody naked.

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.460
 And it capsized, and it fits them all in the water.

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:13.300
 - Beautiful.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.880
 (upbeat music)

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.360
 (upbeat music)

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.360
 - Okay, that's it.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.360
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.720
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.440

 It's also got a link to Club Fish,

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.160
 our secret members club,

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.360
 where you can hear all sorts of bonus content.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.200
 Do that now.

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.560
 Otherwise, come back here next week.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.800

 Goodbye.

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.160
 (upbeat music)

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.740
 (upbeat music)

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.320
