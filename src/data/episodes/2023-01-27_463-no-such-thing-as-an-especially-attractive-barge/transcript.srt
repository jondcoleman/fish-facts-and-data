1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:15,960
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,180
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,540
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,620
 My name is Dan Shriver.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,820
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,980
 and James Harkin.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,340
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,140
 of our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,880
 And in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,760
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,560
 My fact this week is that to combat people sleeping

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,800
 during church, priests used to employ a sluggered waker

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,780
 who would walk around the congregation poking people awake

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,280
 with a very long stick.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,120
 - Brilliant.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,540
 - Yeah, this is an amazing thing.

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,100
 I was reading-- - Fancy that job, Andy?

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,240
 - I think it sounds quite fun.

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,080
 - Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,560
 - You wouldn't make many friends,

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,260
 but you're not in the business to make friends.

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,100
 - Oh no.

24
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,020
 - You're in the business to keep people awake,

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,860
 listening to the sermon.

26
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,860
 - Exactly.

27
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,220
 I reckon you'd be great at it, yeah.

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,060
 - Why?

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,500
 - You've just got authority about you

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,740
 and we all respect you so much.

31
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,220
 - When you put it like that, I suppose,

32
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,260
 yeah, I would be a prettiest.

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,660
 You think I like correcting people

34
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,180
 for minor errors they've made?

35
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,380
 - Yeah, and you really piss people off,

36
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,380
 so it sort of feels--

37
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,460
 (all laughing)

38
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,660
 - You're not losing anything, you know, people.

39
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,220
 - I've already got zero status in this society.

40
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,700
 - Yeah, the congregation don't like you anyway.

41
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,960
 - I mean, I'm disliked enough that it doesn't matter if I'm,

42
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,800
 yeah.

43
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,720
 - And you always walk around with a massive stick,

44
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,040
 prod people with it.

45
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,280
 - Actually, that's an even better reason, yeah.

46
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,680
 How long was the stick, do we know?

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,480
 - Well, in some cases, they'd be 10 feet long,

48
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,280
 because you've got long pews, don't you?

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,320
 Very long pews, so if you've got someone

50
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,040
 at the end of a pew and you need to reach them,

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,640
 you've got your stick needing to--

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,920
 - That's the slugger maker saying, isn't it?

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,760
 I would touch him with a 10-foot pole.

54
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,920
 (all laughing)

55
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,280
 - I read about this in a book that I was checking out

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,100
 called "Old Church Life" by a guy called William Andrews,

57
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,500
 and it's a very old book, and it's full of really odd,

58
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,620
 quirky little nuggets about the church back in the day.

59
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,020
 And so these people would be paid good money to go around.

60
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,860
 - Well, money.

61
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,540
 - Well, but money, yeah, yeah.

62
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,380
 - They were paid.

63
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,220
 - I think for a lot of--

64
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,980
 - I thought they were the wealthiest,

65
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,500
 most high status people in society, but yeah.

66
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,060
 - They were, and although some of them were given

67
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,740
 a small amount of land to live on near the church.

68
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,580
 - Nice.

69
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,100
 - And in one case, there's a place called Yule Grave

70
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,820
 in the Midlands, and they had one who was entitled

71
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,220
 to a hat, as well as the small wage.

72
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,940
 And then one in Wakefield, who also got hats, shoes,

73
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,240
 and hoses, like that's part of the job.

74
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,660
 - They turned sleepfield into Wakefield.

75
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,500
 - Brilliant.

76
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,660
 - That's what they had on their batch.

77
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,500
 (all laughing)

78
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,520
 - It is a part-time job.

79
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,840
 You wouldn't expect it to pay a full salary.

80
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,240
 It's only when there's a sermon on, isn't it?

81
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,580
 - Absolutely, yeah.

82
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,720
 And often they did other things, other jobs as well,

83
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
 and that was just a bit of it.

84
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,240
 But sometimes women got separate treatment,

85
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,140
 and nicer treatment, so sometimes they'd have a stick

86
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,540
 with a knob on one end and a little brush on the other.

87
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,420
 And as a woman, you got a little tickle.

88
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,620
 Whereas a man, you got knobs around the face.

89
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,780
 (all laughing)

90
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,680
 - Everyday sexism.

91
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,740
 - There's a guy called Obadiah Turner,

92
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,020
 who wrote a journal.

93
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,620
 He was from Massachusetts, living around 1640s.

94
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,900
 And he in particular had a fox's tail

95
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,860
 on one side of his stick.

96
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,020
 And on the other one, he had a long thorn,

97
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,620
 which he used to prick people.

98
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,240
 So it wasn't just a little whack around the head.

99
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,000
 He actually stabbed you with it.

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,120
 And he said there was someone called Mr. Tompkins,

101
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,440
 who fell asleep.

102
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,080
 And he pricked him with his long prick.

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,960
 And the guy woke up and said, "Bust the woodchuck!"

104
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,920
 And apparently he'd been dreaming

105
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,040
 about a woodchuck biting his hand.

106
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,640
 When actually, you know when you're asleep,

107
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,000
 and you kind of integrate the alarm into your dream?

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
 - Yes.

109
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,080
 - Well that's what he'd done.

110
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,600
 - Is he saying bastard woodchuck?

111
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,040
 - Bus the woodchuck.

112
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,360
 - That's a good church.

113
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,220
 It's a good church appropriate, swear, swear.

114
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,060
 - Yeah.

115
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,900
 - You haven't said anything wrong.

116
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,740
 - It's a midst oath, isn't it?

117
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,580
 - Yeah, yeah.

118
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,140
 - Do you think it was more or less annoying

119
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,460
 for the priest giving the sermon

120
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,740
 that rather than have people falling asleep quietly,

121
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,880
 it was just a constant cacophony of,

122
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,860
 "Ow, fuck, bust the woodchuck!"

123
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,060
 (laughing)

124
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,900
 - That's a good point.

125
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,500
 I'm not sure it was about being annoyed

126
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,620
 so much as the people in the church

127
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,340
 are supposed to be listening to the word of God.

128
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,180
 - Exactly.

129
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,020
 - Yeah.

130
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,900
 - So, who's got ultimate authority over this system?

131
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,840
 Is it the sluggard waker has autonomy

132
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,920
 and is allowed to basically stand at the front

133
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,360
 and see people falling asleep?

134
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,920
 Or does the priest have to say,

135
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,840
 "There, pew three, seat four."

136
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
 - No, the priest is doing his gig.

137
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,680
 - Yeah, okay, okay.

138
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,800
 - Yeah, yeah, sluggard's there

139
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,280
 to make sure it all goes smoothly.

140
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,960
 - That's a skill of the job,

141
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,440
 it's the only skill of the job,

142
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,800
 it's spotting the sleeping people.

143
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,120
 If this priest has to keep telling you,

144
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,000
 then you're being fired.

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,120
 - Here's a person who needed a bit of skill,

146
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,360
 Betty Finch, who was a sluggard waker in Warrington.

147
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,320
 She was known locally as the bobber,

148
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,180
 because the way that she woke people up

149
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,660
 is she had a fishing rod,

150
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,740
 and she had a little bob,

151
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,020
 like a little weight on the end of her fishing rod,

152
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,380
 and she used to swing it round

153
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,100
 and wake people up with the rod.

154
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,260
 - And if you did it repeatedly,

155
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,620
 she got hooked into your cheek

156
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,740
 and just reeled you up.

157
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,460
 (all laughing)

158
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,900
 - She was the only,

159
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,140
 I've found a few names of the actual people given that up.

160
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,700
 She was the only woman with a job I found.

161
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,500
 So, I feel like a very sort of male dominated industry.

162
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,340
 - Yeah.

163
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,180
 And as I said,

164
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,820
 they did often have other roles in the church,

165
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,000
 and they, one of them seemed to be dog whipping,

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,480
 which was an important thing to do,

167
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,660
 because in church services, in times of yore,

168
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,160
 and we're talking about a long period of time,

169
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,280
 sluggard wakers existed, I think.

170
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,220
 - Yeah, yeah, 1600s. - So for many months of years.

171
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,800
 So, farmers would often, if they're going to church,

172
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,280
 they'd be like, well, I'm gonna use this chance

173
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,560
 to bring all my sheep, sell them at market.

174
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,480
 So, they go sell the sheep at market,

175
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,320
 go to church,

176
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,880
 and they've got all their sheep dogs in church.

177
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,080
 So, you've just got a bunch of sheep dogs running around.

178
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,280
 So, yeah, the sluggard waker also

179
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,760
 whips the dogs out of the church during services.

180
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,460
 Well, can we give the proper name of this position?

181
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,540
 The knock nobler.

182
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,540
 - The knock nobler.

183
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,380
 - What's that name?

184
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,620
 - That's the person who has to chase the dogs out of church.

185
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,780
 - Distracting, I would have thought.

186
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,020
 - That's like the Benny Hill show down there.

187
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,380
 (laughing)

188
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,740
 - Yeah, then no, that's the knock nobler,

189
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,700
 or the dog noper, that was another one.

190
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,540
 Who just has to get in there and whip the dogs,

191
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,060
 and they have special tools as well.

192
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,940
 So, the dog whipper, who might also be the sluggard waker,

193
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,580
 was sometimes issued with a special set of tongs

194
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,300
 for those hard to reach dogs.

195
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,800
 If the dog had hidden in a crevice or something

196
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,000
 in the church, you'd have to use the tongs.

197
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,040
 - Yeah, I've seen those.

198
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,800
 - We have been, this is really exciting,

199
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,040
 we've been somewhere which has a dog whippers flat.

200
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,400
 - What's a flat?

201
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,280
 - A flat like an apartment.

202
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,120
 - Oh, right.

203
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,560
 - So, we've been somewhere, was it the Sidney Opera House?

204
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,880
 - That's right.

205
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,520
 Yeah, very late with you when it was being built,

206
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,560
 they thought that's just okay.

207
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,360
 No, it's Exeter, we went to Exeter on tour last year.

208
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,000
 And Exeter's got a cathedral, a lovely cathedral,

209
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,740
 which I visited.

210
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,900
 Didn't see any of you guys there, yeah.

211
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,440
 No praying.

212
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,180
 (all laughing)

213
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,060
 - Well, we had confidence in our research.

214
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,060
 We didn't really feel like we had to go and get help

215
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,900
 from the Almighty.

216
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,480
 - I was like, please, God, please,

217
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,680
 I just need one good fact about lasagnas.

218
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,500
 - Well, it's not an actual apartment, it's a room.

219
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,380
 But it is a room, it's a really nicely placed room.

220
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,020
 So, as you go into the cathedral,

221
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,380
 it's just above you there.

222
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,820
 And it looks out onto the nave.

223
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,080
 It's a viewing spot basically.

224
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,360
 So you can be on 24-hour shift looking for dogs

225
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,200
 in the cathedral.

226
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,840
 - What, and then you have to descend quickly

227
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,920
 as soon as you see a dog.

228
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,160
 - Yeah, there's a pole, you slide down it, yeah.

229
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,060
 - Swing on a zipline.

230
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,900
 - That's cool.

231
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,520
 - Do you think that's where whippets come from?

232
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,160
 They maybe were the worst-behaved whippets.

233
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,200
 - And you needed to whip it often.

234
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,040
 - Oh, really?

235
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,880
 - No.

236
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,600
 - Definitely the origin.

237
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,800
 - I think it did really used to piss priests off, by the way.

238
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,360
 I know we're saying, would they go through the...

239
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,540
 - It really did, and there was in American Boston

240
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,100
 in the 1600s, there was such fury from a priest over there

241
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,380
 that he suggested that a cage be made

242
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,900
 so that you would drag the sleeping person into it

243
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,700
 and cage them up like a bird

244
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,140
 and just let them have to wake up and deal with that.

245
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,300
 And that was off the back of someone being woken up

246
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,020
 and in a rage, attacking the sluggered waker,

247
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,380
 or tithing man as they were often...

248
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,220
 - Tithing man.

249
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,180
 - Tithing man, as they were often called in America.

250
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,500
 - They're called that, interesting.

251
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,420
 'Cause a tithe is the bit of your income you give

252
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,060
 to the church, a tenth of your income.

253
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,600
 - So probably, as well as doing this,

254
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,620
 they collected the money.

255
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,320
 - They're actually very busy people, the sluggered wakers.

256
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,460
 - They also rang the curfew bell.

257
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,460
 So we had, in this country, a curfew bell

258
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,080
 against early medieval times,

259
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,900
 which was, I think the original aim of it was

260
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,340
 to keep people from having rebellious, seditious meetings.

261
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,540
 But anyway, it was quite useful because it stopped fires

262
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,780
 'cause curfew, literally coming from the French,

263
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,340
 I think, to cover the fire.

264
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,500
 Couvre-feur is like time to cover your fires now.

265
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,340
 And it tended to be eight o'clock.

266
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,380
 And so at eight p.m. every evening,

267
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,820
 then you'd have the curfew bell rang.

268
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,260
 It was like cover your fires and go to bed early.

269
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,100
 - Even for Andy, who's famously not a night owl,

270
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,180
 you wouldn't want to have to be in at eight o'clock every day.

271
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,880
 - Even I normally make it to the watershed at nine p.m.

272
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,820
 (laughing)

273
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,780
 - What, half an hour of root TV?

274
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,700
 (laughing)

275
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,940
 Praying for your sins of watching it afterwards.

276
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,420
 - Have you guys heard of the role of the beggar banger?

277
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,260
 - Beggar banger.

278
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,100
 - Banger?

279
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,940
 - The beggar banger.

280
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,780
 Yeah.

281
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,860
 - No, what was that?

282
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,100
 - It's not as exciting as it sounds.

283
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,380
 It's someone who was responsible for controlling

284
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,860
 the length of stay of any unwanted strangers in the parish.

285
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,700
 - Okay.

286
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,980
 - They were known as the beggar banger.

287
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,020
 - Was that employed by the church?

288
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,860
 'Cause that's not a very churchy,

289
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,180
 welcoming thing to do.

290
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,380
 As a church, you are supposed to embrace

291
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,740
 particularly beggars and paupers, aren't you?

292
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,220
 - Charity has its limits, Anna, and you know.

293
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,420
 - As Jesus said.

294
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,940
 (laughing)

295
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,380
 Are you guys aware of Acts of the Apostles,

296
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,940
 chapter 20, verse seven to 12?

297
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,940
 - Can you just stop me off and I'll--

298
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,980
 - Okay, so Paul was preaching.

299
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,820
 - Oh, yeah.

300
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,420
 - Okay, and he was preaching, he was doing this speech,

301
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,340
 and it was a very long speech.

302
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,740
 And there's a guy called Eutychus.

303
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,500
 And Eutychus was listening,

304
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,260
 but it was a really, really boring speech.

305
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,020
 So he fell asleep in the middle of St. Paul's preaching.

306
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,660
 And as he fell asleep,

307
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,660
 he fell out of a third-floor window and died.

308
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,620
 (laughing)

309
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,980
 So this is what the Bible says will happen to you

310
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,060
 if you fall asleep while someone's preaching.

311
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,940
 - And that's why churches are always on the ground floor.

312
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,100
 - Yeah, you get very few on the top of skyscrapers.

313
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,940
 - Yeah.

314
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,020
 - Just thinking a third-floor window is pretty,

315
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,780
 is a risky place to risk falling asleep.

316
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,740
 - Well, quite, probably don't sit there

317
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,220
 if St. Paul's doing it for some reason.

318
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,940
 Anyway, luckily Paul went down, picked him up,

319
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,220
 brought him upstairs and said,

320
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,620
 "Oh, don't worry, he's fine."

321
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,460
 Even though everyone could see he was dead.

322
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,780
 But then a bit later, he did come back alive.

323
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,620
 - Oh, wow.

324
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,900
 - Any more explanation on that?

325
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,740
 He just--

326
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,780
 - It's the Bible, Dan.

327
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,300
 That's the kind of thing that happens in the Bible.

328
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,380
 - Yeah, zombies, very common.

329
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,220
 - I've read this book.

330
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,580
 Have you guys heard of Pew Openers as a job?

331
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,420
 - No.

332
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,740
 - A Pew Opener was someone who basically was an usher.

333
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,060
 He would collect you at the front.

334
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,300
 He would walk you to your pew

335
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,900
 and they used to have little doors.

336
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,460
 And he would open up the door

337
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,220
 and he would allow you to not have to do that on your own.

338
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,740
 And he got paid a very minimal amount for doing that.

339
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,700
 And you could also pew rent.

340
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,820
 So you could rent the actual row that you wanted.

341
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,620
 You know, he was a concierge kind of character.

342
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,660
 - That's quite interesting.

343
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,180
 'Cause if you go to church,

344
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,660
 you'll find that the same people every week

345
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,340
 go to the same church, right?

346
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,780
 And they all tend to sit in the same places.

347
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,620
 And if a new person comes into the church

348
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,380
 and sits in one of those places, there are eruptions.

349
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,980
 - Do you think the Pew Opener would say, excuse me,

350
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,260
 I think that's actually where, madam?

351
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,180
 'Cause you certainly, and I imagine he did this mostly

352
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,020
 for the wealthy families.

353
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,940
 They would have their own pewies where they would sit.

354
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,300
 And he'd be the one guiding them to them.

355
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,260
 - Have you guys ever been to a church

356
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,240
 with a boxed pew system?

357
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,080
 - No, what's that?

358
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,900
 - Those are good.

359
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,340
 So, you know, pews are in rows normally.

360
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,900
 And some church, some Georgian and earlier churches

361
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,100
 would have boxed pews.

362
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,580
 So it's kind of a little pen that you sit in.

363
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,140
 - So the Murrays don't have to sit with the riffraff?

364
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,820
 - Well, you know, or any surname, any family.

365
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,140
 Yeah, yeah, any family of good standing.

366
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,460
 No, no, no, but that was it.

367
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,140
 (laughing)

368
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,140
 We once did an ostentatious photo shoot in a church

369
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,980
 which had those.

370
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,300
 That was very, very interesting.

371
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,460
 - That's what they were made for.

372
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,900
 (laughing)

373
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,540
 Do you know someone else whose job it was

374
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,180
 to guide you to your seat?

375
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,020
 - Yeah, it could be.

376
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,860
 It would be the deaconess.

377
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,780
 And the deaconess seems to be one of the only official

378
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,940
 church jobs you could get as a woman.

379
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,140
 And from like really early church time.

380
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,220
 And basically, so one of her jobs would be

381
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,820
 to guide you to your pew.

382
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,700
 Another job would be like you'd help distribute communion.

383
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,780
 You could take communion to people in the community

384
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,540
 who couldn't make it to church.

385
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,420
 And they were basically ordained.

386
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,420
 And the reason they came into being really

387
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,060
 was to stop male church officials

388
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,140
 from seeing naked women.

389
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,620
 So their initial job was baptism.

390
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,620
 Because, yeah.

391
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,420
 Because baptism was almost always adults then.

392
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,260
 - Right.

393
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,580
 - And it was--

394
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,780
 - You could always get your kit off.

395
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,020
 - You got your kit off, you went into a river,

396
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,780
 and it was very improper for a male priest

397
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,220
 to be seeing a company of women into the water.

398
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,140
 So that would be her job.

399
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,620
 She'd undress the woman, hold the veil up

400
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,260
 so none of the clergy could see.

401
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,980
 Go into the water with her, baptize her,

402
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,820
 and pop out again.

403
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,660
 - That's awesome.

404
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,740
 - Do you guys know what a pedo-baptist is?

405
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,580
 - Here we go.

406
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,020
 - That's someone who baptizes children?

407
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,220
 - Yeah, yeah.

408
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,620
 - It's, you're very close.

409
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,700
 It's someone who believes in baptizing children.

410
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,100
 Yeah, there's a big divide in the church

411
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,780
 for pedo-baptists and credo-baptists.

412
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,060
 - Did they have John the Baptist

413
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,220
 and John the pedo-baptist?

414
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,620
 - Yeah, it's funny.

415
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,340
 Only one of them's made it to the big time, hasn't he?

416
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,660
 - What was the other--

417
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,500
 - Credo-baptists.

418
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,340
 - Credo-baptists.

419
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,180
 And there are people who believe

420
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,180
 you should only be baptized once you have been able

421
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,020
 to come to an adult understanding of God on your own.

422
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,300
 - Because credo is Latin for I believe, right?

423
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,780
 And so the idea is that you can say yourself

424
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,340
 that you believe that as opposed to a child

425
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,620
 who doesn't really understand what it all means.

426
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,780
 - What have they done to deserve that?

427
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,140
 - Well, I always thought it was just about

428
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,180
 protecting them to get into heaven, so.

429
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,460
 - Ah, that's interesting,

430
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,700
 because it seems like Hannah and I are credos.

431
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,540
 - Yeah.

432
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,860
 - But damn, it sounds from what you're saying.

433
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,700
 - Big ol' pedos.

434
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,940
 (laughing)

435
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,140
 - Interesting.

436
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,180
 - I've never heard those.

437
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,140
 - Those terms.

438
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,060
 No, I don't think they get bandied around, actually.

439
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,060
 I don't know why.

440
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,300
 - I said I'm a credophile.

441
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,540
 (laughing)

442
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:42,340
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

443
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,540
 and that is Anna.

444
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,820
 - My fact this week is that the Queen of France

445
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,020
 once pranked a girl at court by secretly taking in her clothes

446
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,940
 to make her think she was pregnant.

447
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,580
 This is this great, yeah, pretty mean.

448
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,220
 This is this great, great story

449
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,660
 from the memoir of Hortense Mancini,

450
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,660
 and she was one of the Mancini sisters who were so fun,

451
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,740
 but her uncle was a guy called Cardinal Mazarin,

452
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,460
 who was the closest person to the royal family in France,

453
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,180
 really, and Cardinal Mazarin decided

454
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,860
 that he would start teasing his six-year-old niece.

455
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,900
 - That's the thing, that's the thing.

456
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,180
 You hear this fact and you think,

457
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,380
 "Oh, it's a clever prank to play on someone

458
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,660
 who's probably, what, 20 or maybe a T.A."

459
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,820
 That's not a six-year-old.

460
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,500
 - Yeah, that's what makes it so funny.

461
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,860
 So there's this girl called Marianne, who's six-year-old,

462
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,740
 and she's the person who's writing the account, Hortense.

463
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,340
 It's her little sister, and Cardinal Mazarin says,

464
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,940
 "Hey, you've got an admirer,

465
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,220
 and he's got you pregnant, hasn't he?"

466
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,660
 And then they would take her clothes away

467
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,020
 and secretly take them in so they got tighter and tighter,

468
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,500
 so she thought that she was pregnant,

469
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,980
 and the whole court got in on this gag, you know?

470
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,500
 It was just hilarity for everyone in the court.

471
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
 - Bullion, isn't it, really?

472
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,260
 - Oh, look, it's a fine line, isn't it?

473
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,100
 Between are you laughing with her or laughing at her?

474
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,100
 - Yeah, it's a fine line, and I think they crossed it.

475
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,420
 - Anyway, the queen, it was Anne of Austria,

476
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,100
 and she was the queen mother at that time.

477
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,940
 She had been married to King Louis,

478
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,380
 and then she'd been the queen regent,

479
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,300
 so she was referred to as the queen.

480
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,660
 She turned up by the six-year-old's bedside,

481
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,980
 the consulter said, "Gosh, yes, you are a pregnant, aren't you?"

482
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,940
 And then they planted a live infant in her bed,

483
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,780
 which we think was a baby of one of the servants.

484
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,460
 - This is next level, I think.

485
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,140
 - Yeah, this is Jeremy Beedle level.

486
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,140
 - This is crazy, though, yeah.

487
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,460
 This is amazing, and then, what happened next?

488
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,380
 - Well, the queen offered to be the godmother,

489
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,540
 said, "Well done, you."

490
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,900
 And then, I think they probably, at some point, came clean.

491
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,740
 I don't think they made her raise the child.

492
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,580
 I think the person whose child it was would have objected.

493
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,140
 - Well, they asked her who the father was, didn't they?

494
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,260
 And she said it could only either be the king

495
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,220
 or the conch de gouiche.

496
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,220
 - Yes.

497
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,420
 - Because they were the only ones who she'd kissed.

498
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,260
 - Yes.

499
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,340
 - And she was, it was quite sweet.

500
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

501
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,380
 - Although the conch de gouiche was a known absolute playboy.

502
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,220
 So...

503
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,860
 - Right, right.

504
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,060
 She wouldn't have known that, she's six.

505
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,780
 - She said that, he just gave a little kiss on the cheek.

506
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,180
 I quite like this in the memoirs from Hortense,

507
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,980
 who was three years older than her at the time,

508
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,380
 so she would have been nine.

509
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,940
 And she said, "She was very proud

510
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,300
 "to know the truth of the matter,

511
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,060
 "and I never tired of laughing about it,

512
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,980
 "just to show that I knew it."

513
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,460
 Which is such a relatable thing

514
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,540
 when you're a slightly older sibling,

515
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,540
 doing that over-the-top laughing to be like,

516
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,380
 "Yeah, I get it."

517
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,220
 - "Oh, yeah, I get it."

518
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,620
 - "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,460
 "Yeah, I kissed."

520
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,780
 - "Please don't do this kind of thing to me.

521
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,180
 "I feel like an idiot."

522
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,580
 - I was looking up pregnancy pranks.

523
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,420
 - Oh, yeah, cool.

524
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,460
 - There aren't many good ones.

525
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,100
 It's mostly pranks that you,

526
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,740
 if you're pregnant, can pull on people around you.

527
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,580
 - Oh, right.

528
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,500
 It's not like, 'cause you could throw a water balloon

529
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,900
 at someone in the night,

530
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,540
 and then they think their waters are broken.

531
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,380
 - Yeah, yeah.

532
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,220
 - Yeah.

533
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,060
 - That's one.

534
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,900
 - That's one.

535
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,060
 - If you're pregnant, you could walk around

536
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,700
 with like a doll hanging between your legs.

537
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,300
 So it looks as if you're--

538
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,140
 - Right.

539
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,820
 - You've given birth without noticing.

540
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,660
 - Yeah.

541
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660
 - Yeah, these are all about the level of the ones I found.

542
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,500
 The only one I found that was any good potentially

543
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 was using your pregnancy to help someone else

544
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,900
 with their pregnancy prank,

545
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,940
 where you can pee on their pregnancy test.

546
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,780
 - Oh, yes.

547
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,660
 - So it'll come up as a yes.

548
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,500
 - Yes, right.

549
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,540
 - And then she'll be able to say to whoever, you know,

550
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,420
 "That's really funny." - Oh, look at me, yeah.

551
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,020
 - Here's the thing that men don't really know

552
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,620
 much about pregnancy tests.

553
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,540
 So you could literally probably just take a vape

554
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,140
 and draw a line on it and say, "Hey, look, I'm pregnant."

555
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,220
 - You can take a COVID test.

556
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,980
 I'm not pregnant, but you do have COVID.

557
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,740
 (all laughing)

558
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,020
 This book is, it was published in 1675.

559
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,940
 And I guess at the time,

560
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,540
 it's sort of quite sort of timely we're talking about it.

561
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,500
 It's sort of the Prince Harry memoir of its day,

562
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,780
 to an extent, because it was very much a--

563
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,180
 - What an amazing attempt to make this book relevant

564
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,700
 to absolutely other than that.

565
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,540
 - I mean, it just totally is.

566
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,380
 - Absolutely bang on.

567
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,220
 - It just totally is.

568
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,060
 - Who is this?

569
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,880
 - That's what it was.

570
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,720
 - Hortense.

571
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,560
 - Yeah, Hortense.

572
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,640
 - Did she get a frostbyss and penis?

573
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,060
 - Well, no, this was the first time that, you know,

574
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,780
 this is someone who was amongst the royals.

575
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,340
 She was almost basically a queen at one point.

576
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,420
 And it was a book that was published

577
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,260
 when women weren't really writing books either

578
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,620
 about their personal life.

579
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,660
 And so when it came out, it was a huge bit of news.

580
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,500
 It was--

581
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,340
 - And it was scandalous.

582
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,160
 - Yeah.

583
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,340
 - And she filled it with gossip.

584
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,500
 It would have been like with Prince Harry's book,

585
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,340
 going out and everyone going,

586
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,380
 "Oh, wow, you've actually said that.

587
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,780
 God, cool."

588
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,620
 - Wow.

589
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,400
 - I've never heard of her prior to reading up on this,

590
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,980
 but she wrote her autobiography.

591
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,940
 And then a couple of years later,

592
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,860
 her sister wrote her autobiography as well.

593
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,540
 And as you say, they led just an incredibly,

594
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,460
 interestingly bizarre, fun, but also quite tragic light.

595
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,020
 They were in marriages, which were very unloved

596
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,860
 and which fell apart.

597
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,620
 They had to flee the country from time to time

598
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,020
 because of being exiled as a result

599
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,700
 of their dubious affairs and so on,

600
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,460
 and their husbands being furious.

601
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,980
 It's a real rollicking adventure.

602
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,740
 - Well, let's quickly mention this husband

603
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,180
 that she had in front-- - Yes.

604
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,060
 - Who appears to have been slightly unhinged.

605
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,980
 - Oh man, yeah.

606
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,620
 - He believed that milkmaid shouldn't touch cow's udders

607
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,020
 in case they became aroused by them.

608
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,260
 - Yeah, there are a couple of accounts of this.

609
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,940
 This is just, let's give his name.

610
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,060
 He's called Amon Chal Duller Port Duller Mayeray.

611
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,900
 All right, that was his name.

612
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,860
 And he was incredibly rich, wasn't he?

613
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,700
 - He was.

614
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,300
 He was like the richest man in Europe, pretty much.

615
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,140
 - Yeah.

616
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,900
 And he, so I read that account that he was worried

617
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,500
 about milkmaids finding milking sexy,

618
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,020
 but then I read another account saying he worried

619
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,500
 that men might get aroused

620
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,660
 by the sight of milkmaids doing their milking.

621
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,620
 - Yes.

622
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,340
 - I actually think, Hortense didn't rise

623
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,100
 about any of these things, actually.

624
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,740
 These all came from a guy called Abbey de Choisy,

625
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,660
 who was, he wrote his memoirs and they came out

626
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,820
 after he died and they're all about the story

627
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,140
 of how he went to live in the countryside in France,

628
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,620
 pretended to be a woman and seduced a load of young girls.

629
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,940
 And he apparently was friends with Perot

630
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,460
 who wrote a lot of fairy tales.

631
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,500
 So we think actually a lot of it might not have been true.

632
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,340
 - Okay, interesting.

633
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,460
 - But he was the one who wrote all this stuff

634
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,060
 about this crazy guy.

635
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,060
 - And he was basically the idea with Armand Charle

636
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,460
 was that he was incredibly pious, wasn't he?

637
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,980
 And very religious.

638
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,980
 And I imposed really strict rules like that.

639
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,660
 So I thought everyone was gonna be aroused all the time,

640
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,020
 did things like he had a collection of priceless works

641
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,580
 of art that he'd inherited.

642
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,740
 And in fact, from Cardinal Mazarin.

643
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,020
 And he went around knocking all their genitals off

644
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,380
 because he thought the genitals were improper.

645
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,740
 You know, he'd slashed tapestries.

646
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,460
 He'd painted black bits of penis and balls and nipple

647
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,900
 on various paintings.

648
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,500
 - There are so many different accounts.

649
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,580
 So one of the things I read is that he did that specifically

650
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,460
 because he was worried that she, Hortense,

651
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,500
 was gonna get aroused by them.

652
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
 - To be fair, she did have quite a few affairs.

653
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,100
 - She did, she had a time. - To be fair, she had a time.

654
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,300
 - She was leaving around.

655
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,380
 - And she almost married Charles II

656
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,540
 when I mentioned before that she almost became queen.

657
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,980
 So Cardinal Mazarin, who was sort of,

658
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,220
 he was their uncle and he was very much taking them

659
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,060
 around town and trying to set them up and arrange marriages.

660
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,420
 Charles II met Hortense, fell in love with her

661
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,780
 and thought, I've got to marry her, made the offer.

662
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,140
 And he said, no, because Charles II was an exile.

663
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,180
 And he said, no, you've got, you know, you got your name,

664
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,020
 but you've got no money, you've got no title.

665
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,260
 I don't know your prospects.

666
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,340
 And so he denied it.

667
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,460
 And then only a few months later, even weeks,

668
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,500
 Charles II suddenly is restored back as king.

669
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,140
 And so Mazarin comes running back saying,

670
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,340
 actually Hortense would love to take your offer.

671
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,420
 And he says, no, I'm afraid that's not going to happen.

672
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,340
 - Such a shame.

673
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,180
 - Yeah.

674
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,460
 - This could have been a queen of England.

675
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,780
 - Yeah, a little bit.

676
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,140
 - They did hang out in England.

677
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,300
 Hortense definitely fled to England

678
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,540
 and spent a lot of time at court.

679
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,540
 And she was super fun, livened the whole place up.

680
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,620
 And the thing is, they were this Italian family.

681
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,980
 And we should say they were called the Mazarinettes

682
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,540
 and there were seven of them all together.

683
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,020
 And they were the seven nieces of the Cardinal.

684
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,500
 And they all looked quite different.

685
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,940
 They were dark skinned when everyone was very pale skinned.

686
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,260
 - They looked similar to each other,

687
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,340
 but different to normal other people.

688
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,140
 - To normal noble women, yes, who were all very pale.

689
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,300
 They all seemed to have the same name.

690
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,700
 There were two Laura's, two Anne-Marie's and one Marianne,

691
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,140
 which is quite confusing.

692
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,460
 But yeah, they were fun and Hortense especially.

693
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,860
 So at one point when she ran away from Armand Charles,

694
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,820
 she ended up in a convent,

695
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,180
 or I think she was put in a convent

696
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,660
 to try and make her behave.

697
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,140
 But she became best friends with this woman

698
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,020
 called Manmoselle de Cossel,

699
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,380
 who maybe she was in a relationship with

700
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,380
 or had a little fling with.

701
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,580
 Maybe they were just really close friends.

702
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,780
 And they sort of played practical jokes

703
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,180
 on the nuns quite a lot.

704
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,660
 - They all thought they were pregnant.

705
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,500
 - They, yeah.

706
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,500
 I promised I haven't had sex all the nuns.

707
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,500
 Yeah, she did things like she filled two chests with water

708
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,980
 and apparently the water leaked through

709
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,580
 onto the nun's beds.

710
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,260
 But she had this really cool adventure in the convent

711
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,420
 where her husband came to try and kidnap her away

712
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,220
 when he found she was misbehaving.

713
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,820
 And her, Manmoselle Cossel, found,

714
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,620
 it's like the stuff of fantasies.

715
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,580
 They found a little hole in a grate in the parlor

716
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,380
 which they could just squeeze through to escape.

717
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,340
 And so they squeezed through this grate

718
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,060
 and they climbed out the outside.

719
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,700
 And then they actually realized it was a false alarm

720
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,540
 and their friends were visiting, not her husband.

721
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,380
 - This is the story of the sound of music.

722
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,220
 (laughing)

723
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,980
 This is, there are baddies in a convent,

724
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,940
 squeezing through a gate, come on.

725
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,620
 - Yep, well then they squeezed back in

726
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,460
 'cause they were like,

727
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,940
 "Oh, we're gonna look stupid, it's just our mates."

728
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,580
 And she got stuck in this grate

729
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,660
 between two iron bars for about 20 minutes.

730
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,340
 And Manmoselle Cossel, that's like tug her out

731
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,020
 and then they ended up covered in soot

732
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,380
 on the parlor floor, snogging.

733
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,580
 No, I've embellished some of the ending, but yeah, sounds fun.

734
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,380
 - After she died, her husband caught up with her

735
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,260
 and had wanted actually to repatriate her for ages,

736
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,100
 but hadn't managed to do it. - It's so much easier

737
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,700
 to catch up with someone after they die.

738
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,100
 - Well, exactly, it's really, yeah, yeah, yeah.

739
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,220
 - Well, he caught up with her, he caught her body,

740
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,940
 he put it in a sealed coffin, great, fair play,

741
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,020
 it's what you meant to do.

742
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,020
 And then he just carried it around Europe

743
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,660
 on a sort of weird posthumous honeymoon

744
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,860
 to all the places they had been together in life

745
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,700
 for four months, a long time.

746
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,340
 And then eventually, he left her in a country churchyard

747
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,500
 and then eventually when he died later,

748
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,700
 they were buried next to each other.

749
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,260
 I don't know how she would have felt about that.

750
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,860
 - And then during the revolution,

751
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,140
 they got chucked in the sand.

752
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,100
 - Yeah, so it has a...

753
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,580
 - An unhappy ending, not a few other people.

754
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,740
 (laughing)

755
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,220
 - Obviously, you know, I'm a big fan of the aristocracy.

756
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,860
 - I read an article that she introduced champagne to Britain.

757
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,060
 - I read that. - Yeah, I think popularized.

758
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,100
 - Popularized, yeah. - Oh, really?

759
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,300
 - I think she was fun.

760
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,100
 - Oh my God, then this is the most fun thing about her.

761
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,300
 I did all this reading and then finally, at the end,

762
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,940
 find this one article which talks about

763
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,060
 this extraordinary saloon that she opened up in the 17th.

764
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,060
 - I think Salon.

765
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,700
 - I think a saloon is a Wild West Indian car.

766
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,380
 - Is it not a saloon? - It's a saloon.

767
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,380
 - No, no, no, all the ladies in London used to come.

768
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,540
 They had to leave their guns in the car.

769
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,660
 - And at those swinging doors,

770
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,700
 the piano player, they would stop when Hortense walked in.

771
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,020
 That's it, yeah.

772
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,180
 So we're calling it Salon, so really.

773
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,020
 - Let's go with Salon for the moment.

774
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,860
 - Let's call it for that, yeah.

775
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,820
 - Because it was kind of French,

776
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,580
 so let's say a saloon, but with a French angle, like Salon.

777
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,980
 So let's land on Salon.

778
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,820
 - I mean, that's definitely.

779
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,660
 - That's what they were called.

780
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,780
 - That's what like Salons, very popular in those days.

781
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,620
 Have Salon.

782
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,380
 - So she ran this, let me get to the fucking facts.

783
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,340
 She's 17th century London.

784
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,340
 She had basically this extraordinary like book club

785
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,300
 that she ran next to St. James's Palace

786
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,220
 and all the ladies who were encouraging not to do this,

787
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,740
 to have intellectual conversation, to read books

788
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,980
 and discuss them with each other,

789
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,580
 to share their ideas, their philosophies would go.

790
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,820
 They would drink champagne

791
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,780
 and they would do all this stuff together.

792
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,340
 And she was just such a,

793
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,820
 the article describes her as an influencer of the time.

794
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,660
 - Definitely.

795
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,900
 The interesting thing was these Salons

796
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,700
 were massive in France, weren't they?

797
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,780
 They were like a huge thing in France at the time

798
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,740
 and all the middle class and upper class women

799
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,980
 would go to these Salons and kind of learn things,

800
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,940
 but she was the one who brought it to London.

801
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,780
 - Yeah.

802
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,220
 - 'Cause it didn't exist here at the time.

803
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,380
 - Yeah, you could say that really podcasts

804
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,700
 are the Salons of the present day.

805
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,860
 - It wasn't.

806
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,540
 - Well, we're discussing things.

807
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,940
 - We allow one woman on our podcast.

808
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,980
 - That's true.

809
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,300
 - Yes, traditionally a male environment.

810
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,180
 - Okay.

811
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,020
 It's loose.

812
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,460
 - It's a discussion, isn't it?

813
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,180
 We've all got champagne.

814
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,340
 - Oh, God, yeah, I wouldn't come to this

815
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,300
 if that wasn't promised.

816
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,380
 - But she, I mean, this was how great her influence was,

817
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,180
 particularly with quite obscure texts.

818
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,260
 If she introduced a text to be read,

819
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,420
 it would get round town

820
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,060
 that this was like something that was amazing

821
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,900
 and it would boost up a big run of it with translations

822
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,020
 because people suddenly were going,

823
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,940
 what are they reading there?

824
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,220
 And we have to be part of that.

825
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,860
 - It was very much the Richard and Judy's Book Club

826
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,700
 of its day.

827
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,540
 - Yes, exactly.

828
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,380
 That's what it was.

829
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,380
 - That's more of a salon.

830
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,340
 - Yeah, that is a book club.

831
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

832
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,060
 - The one interesting about Hortense, if you Google her,

833
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,100
 the first image, the painting that comes up of her

834
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,740
 is of her looking very beautiful

835
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,420
 and then just a little nipple hanging out from the move.

836
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,260
 Did you see that?

837
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,100
 - Yeah, yeah.

838
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,460
 - And there's only a few paintings of her that are around,

839
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
 but that's one of the surviving ones.

840
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,300
 - I think that might be just your history

841
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,340
 is deciding what pictures you get.

842
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,580
 - Yeah, that's possible.

843
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,180
 - It's interesting you'd have that painted in

844
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,020
 to an official portrait, not official,

845
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,620
 but a portrait of you ends up with a bit of nipple in.

846
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,380
 It's just a general portrait that you get done

847
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,020
 to show that you're a sexy person, like Janet Jackson.

848
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,540
 - Yeah, that was why she did that, wasn't it?

849
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,940
 - But the thing is with Janet Jackson,

850
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,900
 it was a malfunction, right, where she quickly covered up.

851
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,460
 But with a painting, you'd have to sit there

852
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,460
 for about three days.

853
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,300
 - That's a hell of a malfunction.

854
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,300
 - We'll accidentally follow it out.

855
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,540
 (laughing)

856
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,940
 - Maybe the artist was just too embarrassed.

857
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,660
 You know when like someone has green in their teeth

858
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,140
 and they just, you'd want to say, but you don't say it,

859
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,420
 he's like, "Oh, I just got to paint it in, I guess."

860
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,260
 (laughing)

861
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,840
 (upbeat music)

862
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,900
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

863
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,540
 and that is James.

864
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,940
 - Okay, my fact this week is that according

865
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,260
 to their origin story, the Minions serve

866
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,020
 the most evil person on earth,

867
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,460
 but they were conveniently frozen in a cave

868
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,020
 and unable to serve anyone between 1933 and 1945.

869
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,180
 (laughing)

870
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,660
 - Wow, is this official Minions' Canon?

871
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,620
 - I believe it is.

872
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,460
 - Yeah, where is it?

873
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,500
 - Yeah, it's in the movie.

874
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,940
 - It's in the movie, it's in the second movie, yeah.

875
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,020
 - Oh, wow.

876
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,620
 - The dates, you've altered the dates there,

877
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,140
 but that is part of the period when they were frozen.

878
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,620
 - I gave the dates for Hitler,

879
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,100
 and half of them the dates for the Minions.

880
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,020
 - Exactly.

881
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,460
 - But basically, there's this thing on the internet

882
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,740
 that people keep doing this meme where they say,

883
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,140
 "Ah, the Minions, they serve the most evil person,

884
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,540
 "but what were they doing during World War II?"

885
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,980
 And it's like a big joke that,

886
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,260
 "Ah, they haven't thought of this,

887
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,380
 "but of course they have thought of it,

888
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,300
 "and it is in the movie, which I haven't seen."

889
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,420
 - Yeah, so we should say who the Minions are,

890
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,140
 but there's these little yellow creatures

891
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,700
 who are in the film Despicable Me,

892
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,540
 and then all the other sequels.

893
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,860
 - And then the film Minions.

894
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,660
 - So they were henchmen that got their own

895
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,380
 spin-off series, and Minions was 2015,

896
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,420
 and in the opening sequence, it tells you the history,

897
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,100
 so it says that they serve various evil masters

898
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,180
 from the T-Rex all the way through to--

899
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,580
 - When did they get out of the cave?

900
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,620
 Sorry to interrupt you, Dan.

901
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,460
 - So they go into the cave in 1812.

902
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,340
 That's when they first go in,

903
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,100
 and they emerge in 1968, I think,

904
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,180
 to avoid being so obviously avoiding the Nazis.

905
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,540
 - So 1812 would have been just after

906
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,860
 Napoleon's retreat from Moscow.

907
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,940
 - Yeah, yeah, well, it's very cold

908
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,500
 in when they were treating, so--

909
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
 - Exactly. - There we go.

910
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,940
 - All right, I'm going with the lore.

911
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,780
 I love it.

912
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,940
 - I wonder who they're serving now,

913
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,820
 who's the most evil person on a--

914
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,580
 - Few candidates, aren't there?

915
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,860
 None in this room, sorry, I'm looking around, I'm sorry.

916
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,820
 (laughing)

917
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,980
 The director, one of the co-directors of the films,

918
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,220
 is Pierre Coffin, Peter Coffin.

919
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,060
 - Peter Coffin, yeah.

920
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,900
 - But his name doesn't actually,

921
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,060
 Coffin in French doesn't mean Coffin.

922
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,300
 - What does it mean?

923
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,660
 - I don't think it means anything,

924
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,700
 but the word "Couffin" means basket,

925
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,420
 which is very close, so I really thought

926
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,540
 it was called Peter Coffin,

927
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,060
 and then I thought it was called Peter Basket,

928
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,620
 and actually, he isn't called either.

929
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,460
 (laughing)

930
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,500
 - But he does the voices of lots of the Minions, right?

931
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,940
 - Lots of them, yeah.

932
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,980
 - All of them apart from Baby One, yeah.

933
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,060
 - Well, there's Jermaine Clement

934
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,420
 from Flight of the Comcords does one.

935
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,260
 - Does he voice them?

936
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,300
 - No, one, literally one Minion,

937
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,380
 and then this guy, and someone else,

938
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,660
 but this guy does 899 Minions.

939
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,180
 - Oh, wow, I think so, there's another director,

940
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,020
 there's a co-director of the film,

941
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,860
 so I think that's another-- - Yeah,

942
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,020
 who also does some Minion voices.

943
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,140
 - The language sounds so difficult to do,

944
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,140
 'cause every word is, I think,

945
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,340
 a real word from one language or another.

946
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,500
 - I think there's some gibberish in there.

947
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,340
 - There's gibberish as well.

948
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,420
 - It's mixed in with loads of other languages.

949
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,540
 - But they sound so funny to listen to,

950
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,500
 I just, I love the sound of the Minion's language,

951
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,980
 like it's really funny.

952
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
 - Have you seen them all?

953
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,020
 - No, I haven't seen any of them, I've just watched some.

954
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,460
 - Yeah, I've seen Minions in bits,

955
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,660
 you know, you walk in and out

956
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,340
 while the kid's watching a movie,

957
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,460
 and then you're asked to leave the cinema

958
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,740
 'cause where's your kid, you know,

959
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,860
 and it's like, "All right, I'm outta here, jeez."

960
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,100
 - Yeah, he's cool, Coffin,

961
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,380
 and I think that one of the reasons

962
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,500
 that the Minions speak this combination of languages

963
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,540
 is that he is very multilingual, I think,

964
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,340
 so he's like half Indonesian, half French,

965
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,540
 grew up in Cambodia and Japan,

966
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,340
 and, yeah, invented this language.

967
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,940
 And interestingly, when it's dubbed into other languages,

968
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,420
 it gets changed, because you notice

969
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,020
 that they say English words enough,

970
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,300
 you're like, "Oh, they must be talking about toast now,"

971
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,100
 or bananas, famously.

972
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,940
 But in other languages, they'll sub those words

973
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,300
 for that language. - Interesting.

974
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,140
 So they'll still use the Indonesian

975
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,380
 and the different places,

976
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,260
 but then whenever there was an English word,

977
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,980
 they use whatever country you're in the world.

978
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,100
 - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, that's interesting.

979
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,260
 - Or just drop in more local words where they can.

980
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,100
 - That's cool.

981
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,620
 Yeah, his mom was a famous novelist, wasn't she?

982
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,460
 - Was she?

983
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,420
 - N.H.Dini, Coffin's mom, was called.

984
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,940
 I'd never heard of her inside of this,

985
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,420
 but she is an Indonesian novelist and feminist.

986
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,940
 - Very nice.

987
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,340
 - At least two of the Minions' films

988
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,700
 have been banned or altered by censors in China.

989
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,380
 - Oh, really? - Who dislike various aspects

990
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,220
 of the plot.

991
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,860
 So there's, and I just, I really like this.

992
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,420
 So the film, The Rise of Gru,

993
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,020
 which I think is one of the most recent ones,

994
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,500
 the Chinese censors added an entirely different bit

995
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,780
 of the film at the end of it,

996
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,400
 clarifying that one of the characters

997
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,260
 who previously been involved in a heist in the film,

998
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,700
 you know, fictional film, fictional heist, everything,

999
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,780
 was caught and served 20 years in prison for the heist.

1000
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,380
 I mean, fuck yeah. - That's so good.

1001
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,020
 (laughing)

1002
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,060
 - They also say that Gru returned to his family

1003
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,620
 and his biggest accomplishment was his free children.

1004
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,460
 - Gosh.

1005
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,980
 - And apparently the reason that they've done this,

1006
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,060
 most people think is to promote China's three child policy.

1007
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,900
 - Oh no.

1008
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,740
 - Which they've been trying to do

1009
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,060
 to increase the birth rate over the last few years.

1010
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,620
 - Wow. - Guys.

1011
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,900
 - I was reading about other animated villains

1012
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,100
 of various guys. - Oh great, okay.

1013
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,180
 - And so Scar, The Lion King.

1014
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,140
 - Yeah.

1015
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,740
 - No spoilers, please, I haven't seen it.

1016
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,260
 - I think I can avoid spoilers.

1017
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,100
 - Great.

1018
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,300
 - Who is sexier, Scar or Mufasa?

1019
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,860
 - According to just us or you?

1020
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,700
 - According to you.

1021
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,780
 - Are they both lions?

1022
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,620
 - Yep.

1023
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,460
 - Mufasa.

1024
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,300
 - Mufasa.

1025
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,540
 - Okay, it says equal to the lions.

1026
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,660
 - I find them both equally attractive at the lions.

1027
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,140
 - Lions can be more or less sexier than each other.

1028
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,260
 They're apparently completely impossible

1029
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,220
 for James to compete.

1030
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,060
 (laughing)

1031
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,580
 - I thought it was a subjective question.

1032
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,420
 - Do you find all, you must think there are some animals

1033
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,980
 which are sexier than other animals in the same species.

1034
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,180
 - Have that buff kangaroo.

1035
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,940
 (laughing)

1036
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,380
 - I'm not sure that that is true.

1037
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,380
 - Do you think of all humans as being equally sexy?

1038
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,220
 - Absolutely.

1039
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,060
 (laughing)

1040
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,620
 - Apart from my wife of course,

1041
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,940
 they're slightly less sexy than other animals.

1042
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,780
 (laughing)

1043
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,180
 - Wait, doesn't your cat have a modeling contract though?

1044
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
 - No, she doesn't.

1045
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:43,100
 She has appeared in some adverts.

1046
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,820
 - So you must think she's sexy.

1047
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,620
 - You don't have to be sexy to be in an advert.

1048
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,940
 That's not what they are always cast for.

1049
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,780
 - No, you're right.

1050
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,620
 - But the difference here is--

1051
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,460
 - Captain Bird's work.

1052
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,180
 What a terrible example of the sexiest man on TV.

1053
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,180
 - He's so hot, yeah.

1054
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,900
 (laughing)

1055
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,260
 - Can I just say I don't find my cat sexy?

1056
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,580
 - Yeah, you're allowed to say this.

1057
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,020
 It can be a model and not sexy.

1058
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,180
 It's the human personality,

1059
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,500
 which is adding to the sexiness of these characters as well.

1060
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,100
 - Well, they've got voices, haven't they?

1061
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,180
 Yeah, they're human voices.

1062
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,900
 And I'm speaking in English, yeah, yeah.

1063
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,980
 - For me, I would say that physically,

1064
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,300
 Mufasa definitely sexier,

1065
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,780
 but in terms of personality and voice,

1066
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,540
 Scar, of course, is more sexy.

1067
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,940
 - Okay, well.

1068
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,540
 - Scar's like old and manky looks.

1069
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,260
 - No, but I know that's why I said.

1070
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,100
 - No, I know.

1071
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,060
 No, no, and he personality-wise is evil.

1072
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,580
 - Okay, well, can I say one of you is right and wrong?

1073
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,540
 - Mufasa is less sexy than Scar.

1074
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,060
 Scar is the sexier one, physically,

1075
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,620
 and would be in the real world as well.

1076
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,700
 In fact, specifically in the real world.

1077
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,860
 So this is a study about

1078
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,980
 what makes a lion sexy or unsexy.

1079
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,540
 And for years, they've been thinking about-

1080
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,980
 - Come on, you're talking from a lion's perspective.

1081
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,140
 That was the whole point.

1082
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,980
 - This is about what, main darkness.

1083
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,820
 - Right, yeah.

1084
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,100
 - 'Cause some lions have really, really light mains,

1085
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,980
 and some have really, really dark ones.

1086
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,620
 You know, scientists have been trying to work out for years.

1087
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,380
 What does this have any effect at all?

1088
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,740
 And they just introduced these fake lions,

1089
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,220
 and they could sort the mains around.

1090
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,660
 And you could attach them with Velcro,

1091
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,020
 so you could whip off a mane and then reattach it.

1092
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,100
 And the dark mains were very much preferred

1093
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,540
 by the lady lions, lionesses, as they're also known.

1094
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,820
 But interestingly, dark-mained lions

1095
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,700
 have more abnormal sperm,

1096
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,860
 because they have heat stress,

1097
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,340
 because their mains are so dark,

1098
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,500
 they keep absorbing sunlight,

1099
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,140
 and they have to eat smaller meals as well,

1100
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,340
 because they get more heat stress,

1101
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,660
 and if they eat a massive, great meal,

1102
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,700
 you know, it warms you up.

1103
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1104
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,820
 - You know, sometimes you have a huge meal.

1105
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1106
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,500
 - I'm so hot on that.

1107
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,420
 - Oh, no, no, no, no, mate, sperm are deformed.

1108
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,140
 (all laughing)

1109
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,980
 Would you like a dessert?

1110
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,780
 No, they're deformed enough already.

1111
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,460
 (all laughing)

1112
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,020
 - That's why I make my husband,

1113
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,500
 dye his hair peroxide blonde before every meal.

1114
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,740
 (all laughing)

1115
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,500
 You've got to watch out.

1116
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,260
 - I'm sure that peroxide's good for him.

1117
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,260
 (all laughing)

1118
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,900
 - Lex Luthor, do you know what made him evil?

1119
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,500
 He's the villain in the Superman universe.

1120
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,340
 - I actually don't.

1121
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,780
 No, I don't have a handle on what he came from.

1122
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,620
 - What is he?

1123
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,780
 He's just like a rich guy.

1124
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,340
 - He's a rich guy, but he was a scientist,

1125
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,820
 and it was basically Superman made him bald,

1126
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,940
 and that is why.

1127
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,780
 - Bald?

1128
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,620
 - Yeah.

1129
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,460
 - As in no hair.

1130
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,260
 - So he used to have a huge amount of ginger hair on his head,

1131
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,660
 and there was an incident between Superman and Lex Luthor,

1132
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,180
 where they were in a science lab.

1133
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,380
 Lex Luthor was trying to make something really good.

1134
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,260
 Superman had to blow it out

1135
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,540
 because something went a bit wrong,

1136
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,220
 and in the big Superman blow that he did,

1137
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,980
 it just pushed these chemicals onto Lex Luthor's head,

1138
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,820
 made him bald.

1139
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,580
 He was so furious, he became a supervillain.

1140
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,340
 - And that's an overreaction.

1141
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,180
 - It's an overreaction.

1142
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,220
 - He's got temper issues with us.

1143
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,900
 - What's amazing is this is a retroactive story

1144
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,220
 to explain why he suddenly goes bald,

1145
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,980
 because you know part of like comic book artistry,

1146
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,220
 they would hand it to sort of as it was ghost artists

1147
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,820
 to come in and do the sort of comic strips and help them.

1148
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,060
 One of the guys who was in charge of it one week,

1149
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,380
 mistaken Lex Luthor for one of the bald henchmen

1150
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,020
 and accidentally drew Lex Luthor as a bald headed man.

1151
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,780
 And so it was a total mistake

1152
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,020
 and it ran for a couple of weeks.

1153
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,860
 It went out and then another one went out

1154
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,020
 and that just had to be it.

1155
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,940
 So he had no hair.

1156
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,220
 So the only reason he's bald is an artistic mistake.

1157
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,700
 - Who the hell is proof reading this?

1158
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,500
 That's like releasing a few scenes from The Lion King

1159
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,500
 where a hyena plays Scar and no one notices.

1160
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,980
 And then what?

1161
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,300
 - Lex Luthor would buck the trend of most supervillains

1162
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,020
 because villains in fiction and particularly depictions

1163
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,380
 of villains are generally more pointy than heroes.

1164
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,820
 Yeah, there's the sense of, you know,

1165
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,940
 you can draw Mickey Mouse with three circles.

1166
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,940
 - But if he was bad, it would be triangles.

1167
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,100
 - Well, yeah.

1168
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,460
 So I was reading an explanation about this,

1169
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,180
 about the graphology of films and so on.

1170
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,820
 Darth Vader literally has a triangle

1171
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,660
 on the front of his face.

1172
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,780
 - Oh yeah, he does.

1173
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,060
 - More scary.

1174
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,420
 - But more sexy very often.

1175
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,900
 I mean, they genuinely are made to be a bit attractive,

1176
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,740
 I think.

1177
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,180
 - Sorry, Darth Vader.

1178
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,460
 - He's got a dark main Darth Vader actually.

1179
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,460
 So he is more attractive to female Vaders.

1180
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,980
 - Yeah, he was king of the prize.

1181
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:02,580
 More like, more than women actually.

1182
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,940
 - Is he not sexy Darth Vader?

1183
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,780
 - Darth Vader?

1184
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,060
 - He's got a sexy voice, doesn't he?

1185
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,300
 - Have you seen Under the Helmet?

1186
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,420
 - I haven't seen any of the-

1187
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,260
 - Okay, no.

1188
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,100
 - Don't look under the helmet.

1189
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,940
 - Don't look under the helmet.

1190
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,780
 - Keep that helmet on.

1191
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,020
 If you're making out with Darth Vader,

1192
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,180
 just keep that helmet on.

1193
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,020
 - Yeah.

1194
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,020
 - I think in Disney films,

1195
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,940
 the female villains are acknowledged as sexy

1196
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,020
 in fact there's a book called The Enchanted Screen,

1197
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,100
 the Unknown History of Fairytale Films.

1198
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,940
 - Who are you thinking of?

1199
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,780
 - Which says-

1200
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,340
 - That woman in The Little Mermaid.

1201
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,420
 The big octopus.

1202
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
 - That's what she learned, yeah.

1203
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,060
 - Pick the one example that she does in the film.

1204
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,940
 Although she's got some nice lipstick on.

1205
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,060
 - There's arguments about whether or not she's an octopus

1206
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,940
 because she's only got six arms.

1207
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,780
 But then-

1208
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,820
 - Human arms or octopus?

1209
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,660
 - Well, here's the thing.

1210
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,500
 - She's got tentacles, hasn't she?

1211
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,340
 - Right.

1212
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,180
 - She has tentacles.

1213
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,940
 The argument is she does have two human arms,

1214
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,740
 which makes it eight, which, yeah.

1215
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,060
 - Hang on, isn't there a QI fact

1216
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,940
 that octopuses have six legs and two arms?

1217
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,020
 - Two, like pedipals, yeah.

1218
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,060
 - Yeah, because they use their legs to walk

1219
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,580
 and they use their arms to grab things.

1220
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,740
 - So they've got it bang on.

1221
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,500
 - She's a perfect octopus.

1222
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,340
 Six legs, two arms.

1223
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,980
 - Yeah, I guess so, except that she's a myrrh something, right?

1224
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,820
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1225
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,060
 - So I don't know, do you count the human part

1226
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,260
 in with the octopus part?

1227
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,100
 - That's right.

1228
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,940
 - I don't know, I don't know.

1229
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,780
 - Anna, I think you were saying something about-

1230
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,820
 - I don't know that you're spending too much time

1231
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,580
 on some weird forums, Dan.

1232
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,620
 (laughing)

1233
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,140
 I was just saying that in "Snow White,"

1234
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,780
 that queen in "Snow White" is acknowledged,

1235
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,940
 according to this book, it says,

1236
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,940
 "As is well-known, animators all preferred drawing her

1237
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,180
 "when they were making "Snow White"

1238
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,700
 "because she was very complex as a woman

1239
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,660
 "and much more erotic than "Snow White."

1240
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,980
 And she isn't everything in "Corrella de Vil," she is,

1241
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,300
 and it's sort of-

1242
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,620
 - They're kind of glamorous, yeah.

1243
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,500
 - They're glamorous, certainly, yeah.

1244
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,740
 - Maybe it's glam.

1245
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,700
 - I think it's glam, yeah.

1246
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,500
 - They're glamorous, they're powerful, they're independent,

1247
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,340
 they know what they want.

1248
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,940
 They want to skin dogs to make a coat.

1249
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,380
 I like a woman with ambitions.

1250
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,900
 (laughing)

1251
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,020
 - And he's old, you know what I'm saying, yeah.

1252
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,740
 - One thing that they do often have, villains,

1253
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,860
 I think this is more men than women, actually,

1254
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,980
 but they often have terrible skin.

1255
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,740
 And dermatologists are not happy about this,

1256
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,900
 'cause they say it may foster a tendency

1257
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,580
 towards prejudice in society.

1258
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,580
 Because all the bad guys in movies have bad skin,

1259
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,940
 if you see someone with bad skin,

1260
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,260
 you're gonna think they're bad.

1261
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,140
 And really, there's quite a lot of people

1262
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,580
 who are saying that really, you shouldn't do this.

1263
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,260
 We should stop having scars, we should stop having-

1264
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,100
 - Yes.

1265
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,300
 - I'm trying to think you have bad skin.

1266
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,940
 - Well, for example, almost all James Bond villains,

1267
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,260
 even in the- - I think in Christoph Waltz

1268
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,020
 in "Anything He's In," as like-

1269
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,100
 - Exactly. - Scars, doesn't he?

1270
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,380
 - But the most recent Bond movie has two villains,

1271
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,220
 both of whom have facial disfigurements,

1272
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,180
 "Have You About Them" has one in a previous film,

1273
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,380
 and it's like- - The bad is Roger Rabbit.

1274
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,060
 - There is a lot of it when you start looking.

1275
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,420
 - I thought you just meant acne.

1276
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,420
 'Cause I think, I mean, scars are kind of cool,

1277
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,800
 but being covered in acne,

1278
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,780
 I can see that that would like be insulting.

1279
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,540
 - No, no, no, no, but it's lots of people

1280
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,620
 who suffered facial scarring for whatever reason.

1281
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,340
 And then you see film after film after film,

1282
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,740
 the baddie is a baddie because they've suffered

1283
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,940
 some facial scarring. - Two face, the Joker.

1284
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, man is full of it as well.

1285
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,300
 - When you start, you do realize, yeah, this is mad.

1286
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,660
 - Yeah, that's true.

1287
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,900
 - Just another backstory,

1288
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,620
 and another World War II related backstory, Donald Duck.

1289
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,940
 There's a theory about him that I quite like, so basically.

1290
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,620
 - Is there anything to do with this cock-screw-shaped penis?

1291
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,020
 (both laughing)

1292
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,460
 Like the old ducks are.

1293
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,900
 - I think you can probably make it to do with that,

1294
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,300
 I believe in you.

1295
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,260
 But before World War II, Donald Duck existed,

1296
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,740
 obviously as part of the Disney franchise,

1297
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,020
 lots of shorts with him,

1298
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,900
 but he was quite a light-hearted, fun-loving duck.

1299
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,860
 - Can I just quickly say, lots of shorts, but no trousers.

1300
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,940
 - Very good. - Thank you.

1301
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,460
 - Thank you for that.

1302
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,220
 So as we know now, Donald Duck, bad temper, right?

1303
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,060
 That's what he's famous for,

1304
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,340
 he's always shouting at his nephews.

1305
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,180
 He's very...

1306
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,740
 (mimicking duck noises)

1307
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,860
 - That's uncanny change, that's a good impression.

1308
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,100
 - Really good, yeah.

1309
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,180
 - I didn't know you could do that.

1310
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,460
 - It's not a good tempered noise.

1311
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,180
 It's not a happy noise.

1312
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,460
 So he changed, and the theory is that he,

1313
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,740
 it was the war that changed him

1314
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:11,140
 because he is the only character in the Disney franchise

1315
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,980
 who actually saw active service.

1316
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,820
 - Stop it!

1317
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,660
 (laughing)

1318
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,020
 - He was on the beaches at Normandy.

1319
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,620
 He only wanted a piece of bread.

1320
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,980
 (laughing)

1321
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,380
 What do you mean he saw active service?

1322
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,660
 - He saw all those cartoons.

1323
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,220
 - You know all the propaganda cartoons

1324
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,420
 that Disney released during the war?

1325
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,020
 Loads and loads of propaganda cartoons.

1326
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,100
 So all the characters featured in these,

1327
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,540
 but they didn't go actually into battle

1328
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,580
 except Donald Duck, who did.

1329
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,540
 - In which theatre?

1330
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,380
 - What do you mean?

1331
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,020
 - In which theatre of the war did he fight?

1332
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,380
 - He, the Pacific.

1333
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,820
 - Sorry, I didn't say that.

1334
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,540
 - I actually think it might have been the Pacific.

1335
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,900
 - Well, he is a duck.

1336
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,060
 He would make sense for him to be in the water.

1337
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:45,900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1338
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,340
 He should be, maybe, if he's in any of the services.

1339
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,460
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1340
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,380
 - But I can't remember to be fair,

1341
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,940
 but he's seen serving, shown serving in the US military

1342
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,540
 in one of the propaganda films,

1343
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,540
 fighting an air battle against the Nazis.

1344
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,940
 - Oh, an air battle?

1345
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,580
 - Well, he is a duck after all.

1346
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,540
 (laughing)

1347
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,260
 Makes sense that he should be in the air floss.

1348
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,420
 - He's the perfect weapon.

1349
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,260
 (laughing)

1350
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,180
 - He doesn't even need a plane.

1351
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,620
 - No, wow.

1352
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,860
 And you're saying that he's got PTSD, effectively.

1353
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,500
 - Well, straight after the World War II,

1354
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,500
 his temper got worse.

1355
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,620
 He became very sensitive to loud noises.

1356
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,620
 You know, if his nephews make a racket,

1357
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,860
 he gets upset, and that's the idea.

1358
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,180
 And actually, in a recent duck tales,

1359
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,380
 he had to have anger management courses.

1360
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,220
 - Wow.

1361
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,060
 - So that's the theory.

1362
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,260
 He's got PTSD from the war,

1363
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,980
 and all the evidence is there, I think.

1364
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,460
 - Whenever anyone was shooting, they would go, "Duck!"

1365
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,700
 (laughing)

1366
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,280
 (upbeat music)

1367
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,020
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1368
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,820
 and that is Andy.

1369
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,740
 - My fact is that every barge firm on the River Thames

1370
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,940
 used to have its own signature whistle.

1371
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,940
 - Oh my God.

1372
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,780
 (laughing)

1373
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,380
 - Oh, that's very cool.

1374
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,220
 - Yeah.

1375
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,860
 - This fact, Andy, I reckon,

1376
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,860
 if you put all of your facts into an AI,

1377
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,700
 (laughing)

1378
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,220
 this is what they might come up with.

1379
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:02,240
 - London whistling and a means of transport,

1380
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,220
 this is not very popular anymore, yep.

1381
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,100
 - Yeah, seemingly dull.

1382
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,380
 - But really interesting when you get into it.

1383
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,220
 - Well, let's find out.

1384
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,100
 - Yeah, exactly, you'd be the judge at home.

1385
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,300
 - So anyway, this was on a British library blog post

1386
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,580
 about the decline of whistling,

1387
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,220
 which is absolutely meat and drink to me, obviously.

1388
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,260
 And it's about Lighterman.

1389
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,140
 Lighterman were the men, almost exclusively,

1390
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,300
 who steered barges to their destinations,

1391
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,300
 and barges are basically flat-bottom boats

1392
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,180
 that were used to transport lots of cargo.

1393
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,620
 So you might dock your ship in the river,

1394
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,600
 'cause there isn't a proper dock,

1395
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,580
 you just drop it in the middle of the river,

1396
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,540
 and then you have to unload it,

1397
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,040
 and the barges are the things that go back and forth,

1398
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,700
 emptying them out or loading them up.

1399
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,980
 And there were different barge firms,

1400
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,300
 and every barge firm had its own whistle,

1401
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,700
 and it was so you could identify yourself at night.

1402
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,860
 There we go.

1403
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,700
 - Who's was that?

1404
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,980
 - Yeah, that's the sexiest of all the barge firms.

1405
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,260
 James obviously doesn't see any difference

1406
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,100
 between sexiness and barge firms.

1407
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,780
 - To me, barges are all the same.

1408
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,220
 (laughing)

1409
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,140
 - Yeah, so barges, barges are great.

1410
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,500
 The apprenticeship used to be five years long,

1411
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,140
 just for the Thames.

1412
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,620
 - Oh, Anna's been on a barge.

1413
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,180
 You've looked after a barge, haven't you?

1414
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,740
 - Yeah, well, a canal boat,

1415
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,340
 so not one of the big Thames barges,

1416
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,540
 which you had to sail.

1417
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,620
 - Oh, narrow. - Must be the same.

1418
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,220
 - No, James, please.

1419
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,660
 We're gonna get deeply into the difference

1420
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,600
 between a narrow boat, a barge, all of it.

1421
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,580
 (laughing)

1422
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,540
 - But the apprenticeships lasted for so long,

1423
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,380
 didn't they?

1424
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,900
 So they were introduced, I think, in 1555,

1425
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,220
 and that was when Parliament established

1426
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,740
 the company of Waterman and Lightman,

1427
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,380
 because they needed to regulate the industry,

1428
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:35,220
 and I think it only stopped maybe 500 years later.

1429
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,820
 - I think it was 2007, the government suggested.

1430
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,900
 Maybe we don't need to spend five years learning.

1431
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,540
 - More so more than 500 years, exactly.

1432
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,980
 I mean, it is tough, but come on.

1433
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,620
 Also, there are no working barges on the Thames anymore,

1434
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,900
 so it does seem quite weird to be doing that.

1435
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,820
 - I think it's a good thing

1436
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,220
 that we stopped people learning how to barge

1437
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,140
 and getting them to do maths instead these days.

1438
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,660
 (laughing)

1439
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,660
 - Well, it takes just two years of training now

1440
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,380
 and six months of local knowledge training, which is--

1441
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,220
 - But then there are people just trashing barges

1442
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,260
 into each other and--

1443
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,380
 - Yeah, it's woefully inadequate, it's ridiculous.

1444
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,500
 - We've seen the Thames here.

1445
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,620
 - So you're saying there's no barges these days,

1446
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,620
 but they're clearly barged.

1447
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,060
 - Well, there are barges for other purposes,

1448
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,820
 so it's not really for freight anymore,

1449
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,180
 it's for tourism, or for taking restaurant barges,

1450
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,500
 or I don't think there are any that are having

1451
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,220
 iron deposited from Europe and carrying them up.

1452
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,060
 - There were two, right?

1453
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,820
 - You had the Lighterman,

1454
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,460
 which is carrying all those goods back and forth,

1455
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,500
 but then you had the Waterman,

1456
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,260
 who were the people that carried people across,

1457
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,780
 which was a massively important thing back in the day,

1458
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,900
 because getting across from the south side of London

1459
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,340
 to the north was an incredibly hard thing sometimes.

1460
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,240
 - Or the other way.

1461
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,740
 - Or the other way, even if you, why would you go south?

1462
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:47,580
 (laughing)

1463
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,420
 - Good point.

1464
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,260
 (laughing)

1465
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,100
 - I live south.

1466
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,180
 (laughing)

1467
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,980
 Yeah, so people like Peeps write about it,

1468
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,460
 saying it was the quickest way to get across,

1469
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,060
 because often the clogging on the bridges

1470
00:47:59,060 --> 00:47:59,900
 would be so great, it was just--

1471
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,340
 - What you say bridges was bridge, wasn't it?

1472
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,260
 - Bridge, London Bridge, was the only one east of Kingston,

1473
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,340
 which is a lot of river with one bridge across it,

1474
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,860
 so they were massively important.

1475
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,940
 And get this, I love this, so loads of their trade

1476
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,460
 came from transporting people to the theater,

1477
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,180
 so that was why you would go to the South Bank,

1478
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,860
 it's 'cause it was where all the theaters were,

1479
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,260
 so that was a huge bit of trade for the Waterman.

1480
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,140
 And then when Covent Garden set up,

1481
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,540
 where we're recording this podcast,

1482
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,980
 their trade suffered massively,

1483
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,540
 'cause there was suddenly theaters north of the river,

1484
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,660
 and no one had to cross the river

1485
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,380
 anymore to go and see a show.

1486
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,060
 - But you could still get carried down the river, couldn't you?

1487
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,460
 If you lived in Chelsea and you had to get to Covent Garden.

1488
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,900
 - Oh yeah, that's true,

1489
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,820
 although there were other means of getting

1490
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,140
 from Chelsea to Covent Garden.

1491
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,660
 So they were so angry about the loss of their trade,

1492
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,420
 and they campaigned so much to Charles I,

1493
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,940
 when he was king, that in 1635,

1494
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,900
 he banned taxi cabs in the city,

1495
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,940
 unless they were traveling three miles out of the city.

1496
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,780
 - No way, to keep the barges in business.

1497
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,060
 - Keep the barges happy.

1498
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,580
 - I try to find any notable lighter men.

1499
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,860
 So the closest I found, well, Danny Dyer,

1500
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,020
 who's a quite famous character,

1501
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,940
 his family, he came from a long line of lighter men.

1502
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,020
 - Really, is that right?

1503
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,660
 - That's interesting, that seems classic.

1504
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,700
 - But one that I thought was a bit relevant to us

1505
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,980
 was I found that a comedian came from a long line of lighter men,

1506
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,100
 and it was a comedian who was called Malcolm Hardy.

1507
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,140
 And during the boom of alternative comedy

1508
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,260
 in London, particularly, he was a great voice,

1509
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,740
 and he used to open clubs,

1510
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,140
 and they were known as dangerous clubs

1511
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,900
 because you would have heckles from the audience,

1512
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,620
 he would heckle the act coming.

1513
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,060
 You know, I don't know about the next act,

1514
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,580
 they might be a bit shit, I think they are.

1515
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,980
 Please welcome to the stage, you know,

1516
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,300
 and then bring you down to the stage.

1517
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,780
 (laughing)

1518
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,740
 - Cheers, Malcolm, thank you.

1519
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,580
 - So he was an amazing character,

1520
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,620
 and he wasn't a lightsman himself,

1521
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,740
 but he did live on the Thames.

1522
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,460
 He had a boat that he lived on,

1523
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,340
 and sadly, quite a few years ago,

1524
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,700
 he fell into the Thames and died.

1525
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,500
 But what is interesting about Malcolm Hardy

1526
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,900
 is he's very relevant to us,

1527
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,180
 and even the listeners of this show,

1528
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:05,020
 because he opened up a club in Greenwich called Up the Creek,

1529
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,620
 which is where we do all of our live shows often in London,

1530
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,620
 and that is the Malcolm Hardy Club.

1531
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,420
 - Have you heard of the Trojan barge?

1532
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,900
 - No. - No.

1533
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,740
 - So this was during the 80 years war,

1534
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,300
 and the Anglo-Spanish war,

1535
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,740
 'cause they kind of coincided with each other,

1536
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,580
 and it was the city of Braida,

1537
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,260
 and the Dutch and the English were trying to capture it,

1538
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,940
 and the way they did it was with a Trojan barge.

1539
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,500
 There was a canal or a small, like a shallow river

1540
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,060
 that went into the city,

1541
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,780
 and they had a barge with a load of peat in it,

1542
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,460
 a load of moss. - Nice.

1543
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,460
 - One for you, and they all hid underneath the peat,

1544
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,980
 and they got into the city,

1545
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,140
 and then jumped out and then took the city.

1546
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:49,980
 - That's brilliant.

1547
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,100
 - And it was kind of like one of the turning points of that war.

1548
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,260
 - Really? - Yeah.

1549
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,580
 - So wait, when you say that barge with a load of peat,

1550
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,740
 they didn't put peat on top of the barge and disguise it.

1551
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,580
 They did, they disguised the barge.

1552
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,660
 - They hid underneath, no, no, the barge,

1553
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,460
 everyone knew it was a barge.

1554
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,260
 Everyone knew it was a barge full of peat,

1555
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,220
 but what they didn't know is that there were soldiers

1556
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,380
 in between the barge and the peat.

1557
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,220
 - That's incredible.

1558
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:14,060
 - And the soldiers used the peat to kind of hide themselves

1559
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,700
 even once they got off the barge,

1560
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,860
 so the people of Braida would be attacked by moss men.

1561
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,140
 - This is like the moving forest in my birth base.

1562
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,620
 - Yes, it's been attacked by a bunch of peat.

1563
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,460
 - That's very tall.

1564
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,780
 - That is so cool.

1565
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,020
 But did they have to snorkel through the peat?

1566
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,900
 'Cause peat, I think, was being very heavy, very dark.

1567
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,140
 If you're lying with peat, basically buried under peat,

1568
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:34,980
 that's not good for you.

1569
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,660
 - Probably the amount of peat above them

1570
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,940
 wasn't so much that they all suffocated.

1571
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I see that.

1572
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,980
 - Yeah, I was just imagining like a little flat hat

1573
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,820
 that you're kind of wearing.

1574
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,620
 - Yeah, but you can't have too little peat

1575
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,580
 'cause otherwise they'll see.

1576
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,180
 Wait, isn't there something under that peat?

1577
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,580
 - Probably a folding locks amount of peat that they used.

1578
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,940
 And that was the amount that they used, I think.

1579
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:52,780
 - Brilliant.

1580
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,620
 Well, that's military planning for you.

1581
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,700
 That's your guess, Chris.

1582
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,060
 - They actually did do a previous run

1583
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,980
 with another peat barge.

1584
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,260
 So yeah, they did it with just like one or two soldiers

1585
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,380
 to see if it was gonna work.

1586
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,220
 And it did work.

1587
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,700
 And then the next time they did it properly.

1588
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,540
 - That's so funny.

1589
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,940
 What do those soldiers then do once they're in the city?

1590
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,380
 But there are only two of them.

1591
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,580
 Peat, get your peat!

1592
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,020
 Anyone want some peat?

1593
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,620
 Fellow Braida people.

1594
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,420
 - I don't have any frame of reference

1595
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,380
 to the '80 Years War.

1596
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:23,060
 - No, and nor do I in this short paragraph that I've written.

1597
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,900
 But yeah, it was basically the,

1598
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,700
 I think it was just, I'm gonna be wrong,

1599
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,740
 but I think it was just before the Glorious Revolution.

1600
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,180
 So I think it was whenever that was.

1601
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,020
 - '60, '88.

1602
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:32,860
 - Yeah, yeah.

1603
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,300
 - It's one of those mid-European mid-century wars.

1604
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,580
 - Yeah, they all merged.

1605
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,580
 - The '80 Years War, the Hundred Years War,

1606
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,460
 the '27 Years War.

1607
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,580
 - They weren't very creative with the names, were they?

1608
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,580
 - I've got one more barge, I think, for you.

1609
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,420
 - Yeah.

1610
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,740
 - This is actually sent in by a listener.

1611
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,100
 This is sent in by Hannah Watson a while ago.

1612
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,500
 In 2004, there was a sightseeing barge trip

1613
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,300
 happening in Texas, right, on a lake called Lake Travis.

1614
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,660
 There were 60 people on board.

1615
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,780
 Unfortunately, the barge then passed a place

1616
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,220
 called Hippie Hollow, which contains what was certainly then

1617
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:05,060
 the only public nude beach in Texas.

1618
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,220
 Every single person on the barge moved to one side

1619
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,580
 of the boat in the hope of seeing somebody naked.

1620
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,460
 And it capsized, and it fits them all in the water.

1621
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,300
 - Beautiful.

1622
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,880
 (upbeat music)

1623
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,360
 (upbeat music)

1624
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,360
 - Okay, that's it.

1625
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,360
 That is all of our facts.
