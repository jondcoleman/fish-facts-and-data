00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:15,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:15,00:00:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:19,00:00:21,from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:22,My name is Dan Shriver.
00:00:22,00:00:25,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:25,00:00:26,and James Harkin.
00:00:26,00:00:29,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:29,00:00:32,of our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:32,00:00:35,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:35,00:00:38,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact."
00:00:38,00:00:41,My fact this week is that to combat people sleeping
00:00:41,00:00:45,"during church, priests used to employ a sluggered waker"
00:00:45,00:00:48,who would walk around the congregation poking people awake
00:00:48,00:00:51,with a very long stick.
00:00:51,00:00:52,- Brilliant.
00:00:52,00:00:53,"- Yeah, this is an amazing thing."
00:00:53,00:00:55,"I was reading-- - Fancy that job, Andy?"
00:00:55,00:00:56,- I think it sounds quite fun.
00:00:56,00:00:57,"- Yeah, it does, doesn't it?"
00:00:57,00:00:58,"- You wouldn't make many friends,"
00:00:58,00:01:00,but you're not in the business to make friends.
00:01:00,00:01:01,- Oh no.
00:01:01,00:01:02,"- You're in the business to keep people awake,"
00:01:02,00:01:02,listening to the sermon.
00:01:02,00:01:03,- Exactly.
00:01:03,00:01:05,"I reckon you'd be great at it, yeah."
00:01:05,00:01:06,- Why?
00:01:06,00:01:07,- You've just got authority about you
00:01:07,00:01:09,and we all respect you so much.
00:01:09,00:01:11,"- When you put it like that, I suppose,"
00:01:11,00:01:13,"yeah, I would be a prettiest."
00:01:13,00:01:14,You think I like correcting people
00:01:14,00:01:17,for minor errors they've made?
00:01:17,00:01:18,"- Yeah, and you really piss people off,"
00:01:18,00:01:19,so it sort of feels--
00:01:19,00:01:21,(all laughing)
00:01:21,00:01:23,"- You're not losing anything, you know, people."
00:01:23,00:01:26,- I've already got zero status in this society.
00:01:26,00:01:27,"- Yeah, the congregation don't like you anyway."
00:01:27,00:01:29,"- I mean, I'm disliked enough that it doesn't matter if I'm,"
00:01:29,00:01:30,yeah.
00:01:30,00:01:32,"- And you always walk around with a massive stick,"
00:01:32,00:01:34,prod people with it.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"- Actually, that's an even better reason, yeah."
00:01:36,00:01:37,"How long was the stick, do we know?"
00:01:37,00:01:39,"- Well, in some cases, they'd be 10 feet long,"
00:01:39,00:01:41,"because you've got long pews, don't you?"
00:01:41,00:01:43,"Very long pews, so if you've got someone"
00:01:43,00:01:45,"at the end of a pew and you need to reach them,"
00:01:45,00:01:46,you've got your stick needing to--
00:01:46,00:01:47,"- That's the slugger maker saying, isn't it?"
00:01:47,00:01:49,I would touch him with a 10-foot pole.
00:01:49,00:01:52,(all laughing)
00:01:52,00:01:55,- I read about this in a book that I was checking out
00:01:55,00:01:58,"called ""Old Church Life"" by a guy called William Andrews,"
00:01:58,00:02:01,"and it's a very old book, and it's full of really odd,"
00:02:01,00:02:04,quirky little nuggets about the church back in the day.
00:02:04,00:02:08,And so these people would be paid good money to go around.
00:02:08,00:02:08,"- Well, money."
00:02:08,00:02:10,"- Well, but money, yeah, yeah."
00:02:10,00:02:11,- They were paid.
00:02:11,00:02:12,- I think for a lot of--
00:02:12,00:02:12,"- I thought they were the wealthiest,"
00:02:12,00:02:15,"most high status people in society, but yeah."
00:02:15,00:02:17,"- They were, and although some of them were given"
00:02:17,00:02:19,a small amount of land to live on near the church.
00:02:19,00:02:20,- Nice.
00:02:20,00:02:23,"- And in one case, there's a place called Yule Grave"
00:02:23,00:02:25,"in the Midlands, and they had one who was entitled"
00:02:25,00:02:29,"to a hat, as well as the small wage."
00:02:29,00:02:31,"And then one in Wakefield, who also got hats, shoes,"
00:02:31,00:02:35,"and hoses, like that's part of the job."
00:02:35,00:02:37,- They turned sleepfield into Wakefield.
00:02:37,00:02:38,- Brilliant.
00:02:38,00:02:39,- That's what they had on their batch.
00:02:39,00:02:40,(all laughing)
00:02:40,00:02:41,- It is a part-time job.
00:02:41,00:02:43,You wouldn't expect it to pay a full salary.
00:02:43,00:02:45,"It's only when there's a sermon on, isn't it?"
00:02:45,00:02:46,"- Absolutely, yeah."
00:02:46,00:02:48,"And often they did other things, other jobs as well,"
00:02:48,00:02:50,and that was just a bit of it.
00:02:50,00:02:52,"But sometimes women got separate treatment,"
00:02:52,00:02:56,"and nicer treatment, so sometimes they'd have a stick"
00:02:56,00:02:58,with a knob on one end and a little brush on the other.
00:02:58,00:03:00,"And as a woman, you got a little tickle."
00:03:00,00:03:02,"Whereas a man, you got knobs around the face."
00:03:02,00:03:03,(all laughing)
00:03:03,00:03:04,- Everyday sexism.
00:03:04,00:03:06,"- There's a guy called Obadiah Turner,"
00:03:06,00:03:08,who wrote a journal.
00:03:08,00:03:11,"He was from Massachusetts, living around 1640s."
00:03:11,00:03:15,And he in particular had a fox's tail
00:03:15,00:03:17,on one side of his stick.
00:03:17,00:03:20,"And on the other one, he had a long thorn,"
00:03:20,00:03:21,which he used to prick people.
00:03:21,00:03:24,So it wasn't just a little whack around the head.
00:03:24,00:03:26,He actually stabbed you with it.
00:03:26,00:03:28,"And he said there was someone called Mr. Tompkins,"
00:03:28,00:03:29,who fell asleep.
00:03:29,00:03:32,And he pricked him with his long prick.
00:03:32,00:03:35,"And the guy woke up and said, ""Bust the woodchuck!"""
00:03:35,00:03:37,And apparently he'd been dreaming
00:03:37,00:03:40,about a woodchuck biting his hand.
00:03:40,00:03:41,"When actually, you know when you're asleep,"
00:03:41,00:03:44,and you kind of integrate the alarm into your dream?
00:03:44,00:03:44,- Yes.
00:03:44,00:03:46,- Well that's what he'd done.
00:03:46,00:03:48,- Is he saying bastard woodchuck?
00:03:48,00:03:50,- Bus the woodchuck.
00:03:50,00:03:51,- That's a good church.
00:03:51,00:03:54,"It's a good church appropriate, swear, swear."
00:03:54,00:03:55,- Yeah.
00:03:55,00:03:55,- You haven't said anything wrong.
00:03:55,00:03:56,"- It's a midst oath, isn't it?"
00:03:56,00:03:57,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:03:57,00:03:59,- Do you think it was more or less annoying
00:03:59,00:04:00,for the priest giving the sermon
00:04:00,00:04:02,"that rather than have people falling asleep quietly,"
00:04:02,00:04:04,"it was just a constant cacophony of,"
00:04:04,00:04:07,"""Ow, fuck, bust the woodchuck!"""
00:04:07,00:04:10,(laughing)
00:04:10,00:04:10,- That's a good point.
00:04:10,00:04:12,I'm not sure it was about being annoyed
00:04:12,00:04:14,so much as the people in the church
00:04:14,00:04:16,are supposed to be listening to the word of God.
00:04:16,00:04:17,- Exactly.
00:04:17,00:04:18,- Yeah.
00:04:18,00:04:19,"- So, who's got ultimate authority over this system?"
00:04:19,00:04:21,Is it the sluggard waker has autonomy
00:04:21,00:04:23,and is allowed to basically stand at the front
00:04:23,00:04:25,and see people falling asleep?
00:04:25,00:04:26,"Or does the priest have to say,"
00:04:26,00:04:29,"""There, pew three, seat four."""
00:04:29,00:04:31,"- No, the priest is doing his gig."
00:04:31,00:04:32,"- Yeah, okay, okay."
00:04:32,00:04:33,"- Yeah, yeah, sluggard's there"
00:04:33,00:04:35,to make sure it all goes smoothly.
00:04:35,00:04:36,"- That's a skill of the job,"
00:04:36,00:04:38,"it's the only skill of the job,"
00:04:38,00:04:39,it's spotting the sleeping people.
00:04:39,00:04:41,"If this priest has to keep telling you,"
00:04:41,00:04:42,then you're being fired.
00:04:42,00:04:44,"- Here's a person who needed a bit of skill,"
00:04:44,00:04:48,"Betty Finch, who was a sluggard waker in Warrington."
00:04:48,00:04:50,"She was known locally as the bobber,"
00:04:50,00:04:52,because the way that she woke people up
00:04:52,00:04:53,"is she had a fishing rod,"
00:04:53,00:04:54,"and she had a little bob,"
00:04:54,00:04:57,"like a little weight on the end of her fishing rod,"
00:04:57,00:04:58,and she used to swing it round
00:04:58,00:05:01,and wake people up with the rod.
00:05:01,00:05:02,"- And if you did it repeatedly,"
00:05:02,00:05:03,she got hooked into your cheek
00:05:03,00:05:04,and just reeled you up.
00:05:04,00:05:06,(all laughing)
00:05:06,00:05:07,"- She was the only,"
00:05:07,00:05:10,I've found a few names of the actual people given that up.
00:05:10,00:05:11,She was the only woman with a job I found.
00:05:11,00:05:14,"So, I feel like a very sort of male dominated industry."
00:05:14,00:05:15,- Yeah.
00:05:15,00:05:16,"And as I said,"
00:05:16,00:05:17,"they did often have other roles in the church,"
00:05:17,00:05:20,"and they, one of them seemed to be dog whipping,"
00:05:20,00:05:21,"which was an important thing to do,"
00:05:21,00:05:24,"because in church services, in times of yore,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,"and we're talking about a long period of time,"
00:05:26,00:05:27,"sluggard wakers existed, I think."
00:05:27,00:05:30,"- Yeah, yeah, 1600s. - So for many months of years."
00:05:30,00:05:32,"So, farmers would often, if they're going to church,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,"they'd be like, well, I'm gonna use this chance"
00:05:34,00:05:36,"to bring all my sheep, sell them at market."
00:05:36,00:05:38,"So, they go sell the sheep at market,"
00:05:38,00:05:39,"go to church,"
00:05:39,00:05:40,and they've got all their sheep dogs in church.
00:05:40,00:05:43,"So, you've just got a bunch of sheep dogs running around."
00:05:43,00:05:45,"So, yeah, the sluggard waker also"
00:05:45,00:05:47,whips the dogs out of the church during services.
00:05:47,00:05:50,"Well, can we give the proper name of this position?"
00:05:50,00:05:51,The knock nobler.
00:05:51,00:05:52,- The knock nobler.
00:05:52,00:05:53,- What's that name?
00:05:53,00:05:55,- That's the person who has to chase the dogs out of church.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"- Distracting, I would have thought."
00:05:57,00:06:00,- That's like the Benny Hill show down there.
00:06:00,00:06:01,(laughing)
00:06:01,00:06:02,"- Yeah, then no, that's the knock nobler,"
00:06:02,00:06:04,"or the dog noper, that was another one."
00:06:04,00:06:07,"Who just has to get in there and whip the dogs,"
00:06:07,00:06:09,and they have special tools as well.
00:06:09,00:06:12,"So, the dog whipper, who might also be the sluggard waker,"
00:06:12,00:06:15,was sometimes issued with a special set of tongs
00:06:15,00:06:17,for those hard to reach dogs.
00:06:17,00:06:19,If the dog had hidden in a crevice or something
00:06:19,00:06:22,"in the church, you'd have to use the tongs."
00:06:22,00:06:23,"- Yeah, I've seen those."
00:06:23,00:06:24,"- We have been, this is really exciting,"
00:06:24,00:06:29,we've been somewhere which has a dog whippers flat.
00:06:29,00:06:30,- What's a flat?
00:06:30,00:06:31,- A flat like an apartment.
00:06:31,00:06:32,"- Oh, right."
00:06:32,00:06:35,"- So, we've been somewhere, was it the Sidney Opera House?"
00:06:35,00:06:36,- That's right.
00:06:36,00:06:39,"Yeah, very late with you when it was being built,"
00:06:39,00:06:40,they thought that's just okay.
00:06:40,00:06:43,"No, it's Exeter, we went to Exeter on tour last year."
00:06:43,00:06:46,"And Exeter's got a cathedral, a lovely cathedral,"
00:06:46,00:06:47,which I visited.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"Didn't see any of you guys there, yeah."
00:06:49,00:06:51,No praying.
00:06:51,00:06:53,(all laughing)
00:06:53,00:06:56,"- Well, we had confidence in our research."
00:06:56,00:06:58,We didn't really feel like we had to go and get help
00:06:58,00:06:58,from the Almighty.
00:06:58,00:07:00,"- I was like, please, God, please,"
00:07:00,00:07:03,I just need one good fact about lasagnas.
00:07:03,00:07:07,"- Well, it's not an actual apartment, it's a room."
00:07:07,00:07:10,"But it is a room, it's a really nicely placed room."
00:07:10,00:07:12,"So, as you go into the cathedral,"
00:07:12,00:07:13,it's just above you there.
00:07:13,00:07:14,And it looks out onto the nave.
00:07:14,00:07:16,It's a viewing spot basically.
00:07:16,00:07:19,So you can be on 24-hour shift looking for dogs
00:07:19,00:07:20,in the cathedral.
00:07:20,00:07:21,"- What, and then you have to descend quickly"
00:07:21,00:07:22,as soon as you see a dog.
00:07:22,00:07:26,"- Yeah, there's a pole, you slide down it, yeah."
00:07:26,00:07:28,- Swing on a zipline.
00:07:28,00:07:28,- That's cool.
00:07:28,00:07:30,- Do you think that's where whippets come from?
00:07:30,00:07:33,They maybe were the worst-behaved whippets.
00:07:33,00:07:35,- And you needed to whip it often.
00:07:35,00:07:36,"- Oh, really?"
00:07:36,00:07:36,- No.
00:07:36,00:07:38,- Definitely the origin.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"- I think it did really used to piss priests off, by the way."
00:07:41,00:07:44,"I know we're saying, would they go through the..."
00:07:44,00:07:47,"- It really did, and there was in American Boston"
00:07:47,00:07:52,"in the 1600s, there was such fury from a priest over there"
00:07:52,00:07:55,that he suggested that a cage be made
00:07:55,00:07:57,so that you would drag the sleeping person into it
00:07:57,00:07:59,and cage them up like a bird
00:07:59,00:08:02,and just let them have to wake up and deal with that.
00:08:02,00:08:04,And that was off the back of someone being woken up
00:08:04,00:08:08,"and in a rage, attacking the sluggered waker,"
00:08:08,00:08:10,or tithing man as they were often...
00:08:10,00:08:11,- Tithing man.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"- Tithing man, as they were often called in America."
00:08:13,00:08:15,"- They're called that, interesting."
00:08:15,00:08:17,'Cause a tithe is the bit of your income you give
00:08:17,00:08:19,"to the church, a tenth of your income."
00:08:19,00:08:20,"- So probably, as well as doing this,"
00:08:20,00:08:22,they collected the money.
00:08:22,00:08:25,"- They're actually very busy people, the sluggered wakers."
00:08:25,00:08:27,- They also rang the curfew bell.
00:08:27,00:08:31,"So we had, in this country, a curfew bell"
00:08:31,00:08:34,"against early medieval times,"
00:08:34,00:08:37,"which was, I think the original aim of it was"
00:08:37,00:08:42,"to keep people from having rebellious, seditious meetings."
00:08:42,00:08:44,"But anyway, it was quite useful because it stopped fires"
00:08:44,00:08:46,"'cause curfew, literally coming from the French,"
00:08:46,00:08:48,"I think, to cover the fire."
00:08:48,00:08:51,Couvre-feur is like time to cover your fires now.
00:08:51,00:08:54,And it tended to be eight o'clock.
00:08:54,00:08:56,"And so at eight p.m. every evening,"
00:08:56,00:08:57,then you'd have the curfew bell rang.
00:08:57,00:09:00,It was like cover your fires and go to bed early.
00:09:00,00:09:04,"- Even for Andy, who's famously not a night owl,"
00:09:04,00:09:06,you wouldn't want to have to be in at eight o'clock every day.
00:09:06,00:09:08,- Even I normally make it to the watershed at nine p.m.
00:09:08,00:09:09,(laughing)
00:09:09,00:09:11,"- What, half an hour of root TV?"
00:09:11,00:09:13,(laughing)
00:09:13,00:09:16,Praying for your sins of watching it afterwards.
00:09:16,00:09:19,- Have you guys heard of the role of the beggar banger?
00:09:19,00:09:20,- Beggar banger.
00:09:20,00:09:21,- Banger?
00:09:21,00:09:21,- The beggar banger.
00:09:21,00:09:22,Yeah.
00:09:22,00:09:23,"- No, what was that?"
00:09:23,00:09:26,- It's not as exciting as it sounds.
00:09:26,00:09:28,It's someone who was responsible for controlling
00:09:28,00:09:31,the length of stay of any unwanted strangers in the parish.
00:09:31,00:09:32,- Okay.
00:09:32,00:09:33,- They were known as the beggar banger.
00:09:33,00:09:35,- Was that employed by the church?
00:09:35,00:09:36,"'Cause that's not a very churchy,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,welcoming thing to do.
00:09:38,00:09:40,"As a church, you are supposed to embrace"
00:09:40,00:09:42,"particularly beggars and paupers, aren't you?"
00:09:42,00:09:45,"- Charity has its limits, Anna, and you know."
00:09:45,00:09:46,- As Jesus said.
00:09:46,00:09:47,(laughing)
00:09:47,00:09:51,"Are you guys aware of Acts of the Apostles,"
00:09:51,00:09:53,"chapter 20, verse seven to 12?"
00:09:53,00:09:56,- Can you just stop me off and I'll--
00:09:56,00:09:58,"- Okay, so Paul was preaching."
00:09:58,00:09:59,"- Oh, yeah."
00:09:59,00:10:01,"- Okay, and he was preaching, he was doing this speech,"
00:10:01,00:10:03,and it was a very long speech.
00:10:03,00:10:06,And there's a guy called Eutychus.
00:10:06,00:10:08,"And Eutychus was listening,"
00:10:08,00:10:10,"but it was a really, really boring speech."
00:10:10,00:10:14,So he fell asleep in the middle of St. Paul's preaching.
00:10:14,00:10:15,"And as he fell asleep,"
00:10:15,00:10:18,he fell out of a third-floor window and died.
00:10:18,00:10:20,(laughing)
00:10:20,00:10:22,So this is what the Bible says will happen to you
00:10:22,00:10:25,if you fall asleep while someone's preaching.
00:10:25,00:10:26,- And that's why churches are always on the ground floor.
00:10:26,00:10:30,"- Yeah, you get very few on the top of skyscrapers."
00:10:30,00:10:30,- Yeah.
00:10:30,00:10:32,"- Just thinking a third-floor window is pretty,"
00:10:32,00:10:34,is a risky place to risk falling asleep.
00:10:34,00:10:37,"- Well, quite, probably don't sit there"
00:10:37,00:10:40,if St. Paul's doing it for some reason.
00:10:40,00:10:43,"Anyway, luckily Paul went down, picked him up,"
00:10:43,00:10:45,"brought him upstairs and said,"
00:10:45,00:10:47,"""Oh, don't worry, he's fine."""
00:10:47,00:10:49,Even though everyone could see he was dead.
00:10:49,00:10:52,"But then a bit later, he did come back alive."
00:10:52,00:10:53,"- Oh, wow."
00:10:53,00:10:54,- Any more explanation on that?
00:10:54,00:10:55,He just--
00:10:55,00:10:56,"- It's the Bible, Dan."
00:10:56,00:10:58,That's the kind of thing that happens in the Bible.
00:10:58,00:11:00,"- Yeah, zombies, very common."
00:11:00,00:11:01,- I've read this book.
00:11:01,00:11:03,Have you guys heard of Pew Openers as a job?
00:11:03,00:11:04,- No.
00:11:04,00:11:06,- A Pew Opener was someone who basically was an usher.
00:11:06,00:11:08,He would collect you at the front.
00:11:08,00:11:09,He would walk you to your pew
00:11:09,00:11:10,and they used to have little doors.
00:11:10,00:11:12,And he would open up the door
00:11:12,00:11:15,and he would allow you to not have to do that on your own.
00:11:15,00:11:17,And he got paid a very minimal amount for doing that.
00:11:17,00:11:19,And you could also pew rent.
00:11:19,00:11:22,So you could rent the actual row that you wanted.
00:11:22,00:11:24,"You know, he was a concierge kind of character."
00:11:24,00:11:25,- That's quite interesting.
00:11:25,00:11:27,"'Cause if you go to church,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,you'll find that the same people every week
00:11:29,00:11:31,"go to the same church, right?"
00:11:31,00:11:33,And they all tend to sit in the same places.
00:11:33,00:11:36,And if a new person comes into the church
00:11:36,00:11:39,"and sits in one of those places, there are eruptions."
00:11:39,00:11:41,"- Do you think the Pew Opener would say, excuse me,"
00:11:41,00:11:44,"I think that's actually where, madam?"
00:11:44,00:11:47,"'Cause you certainly, and I imagine he did this mostly"
00:11:47,00:11:48,for the wealthy families.
00:11:48,00:11:50,They would have their own pewies where they would sit.
00:11:50,00:11:53,And he'd be the one guiding them to them.
00:11:53,00:11:54,- Have you guys ever been to a church
00:11:54,00:11:57,with a boxed pew system?
00:11:57,00:11:58,"- No, what's that?"
00:11:58,00:11:58,- Those are good.
00:11:58,00:12:00,"So, you know, pews are in rows normally."
00:12:00,00:12:03,"And some church, some Georgian and earlier churches"
00:12:03,00:12:05,would have boxed pews.
00:12:05,00:12:07,So it's kind of a little pen that you sit in.
00:12:07,00:12:10,- So the Murrays don't have to sit with the riffraff?
00:12:10,00:12:12,"- Well, you know, or any surname, any family."
00:12:12,00:12:15,"Yeah, yeah, any family of good standing."
00:12:15,00:12:16,"No, no, no, but that was it."
00:12:16,00:12:18,(laughing)
00:12:18,00:12:20,We once did an ostentatious photo shoot in a church
00:12:20,00:12:20,which had those.
00:12:20,00:12:22,"That was very, very interesting."
00:12:22,00:12:23,- That's what they were made for.
00:12:23,00:12:24,(laughing)
00:12:24,00:12:26,Do you know someone else whose job it was
00:12:26,00:12:28,to guide you to your seat?
00:12:28,00:12:29,"- Yeah, it could be."
00:12:29,00:12:30,It would be the deaconess.
00:12:30,00:12:33,And the deaconess seems to be one of the only official
00:12:33,00:12:35,church jobs you could get as a woman.
00:12:35,00:12:38,And from like really early church time.
00:12:38,00:12:40,"And basically, so one of her jobs would be"
00:12:40,00:12:42,to guide you to your pew.
00:12:42,00:12:45,Another job would be like you'd help distribute communion.
00:12:45,00:12:47,You could take communion to people in the community
00:12:47,00:12:49,who couldn't make it to church.
00:12:49,00:12:52,And they were basically ordained.
00:12:52,00:12:55,And the reason they came into being really
00:12:55,00:12:57,was to stop male church officials
00:12:57,00:12:59,from seeing naked women.
00:12:59,00:13:02,So their initial job was baptism.
00:13:02,00:13:05,"Because, yeah."
00:13:05,00:13:08,Because baptism was almost always adults then.
00:13:08,00:13:09,- Right.
00:13:09,00:13:10,- And it was--
00:13:10,00:13:11,- You could always get your kit off.
00:13:11,00:13:14,"- You got your kit off, you went into a river,"
00:13:14,00:13:16,and it was very improper for a male priest
00:13:16,00:13:19,to be seeing a company of women into the water.
00:13:19,00:13:20,So that would be her job.
00:13:20,00:13:22,"She'd undress the woman, hold the veil up"
00:13:22,00:13:24,so none of the clergy could see.
00:13:24,00:13:26,"Go into the water with her, baptize her,"
00:13:26,00:13:27,and pop out again.
00:13:27,00:13:28,- That's awesome.
00:13:28,00:13:30,- Do you guys know what a pedo-baptist is?
00:13:30,00:13:31,- Here we go.
00:13:31,00:13:35,- That's someone who baptizes children?
00:13:35,00:13:36,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:36,00:13:37,"- It's, you're very close."
00:13:37,00:13:41,It's someone who believes in baptizing children.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"Yeah, there's a big divide in the church"
00:13:43,00:13:45,for pedo-baptists and credo-baptists.
00:13:45,00:13:47,- Did they have John the Baptist
00:13:47,00:13:48,and John the pedo-baptist?
00:13:48,00:13:49,"- Yeah, it's funny."
00:13:49,00:13:52,"Only one of them's made it to the big time, hasn't he?"
00:13:52,00:13:53,- What was the other--
00:13:53,00:13:54,- Credo-baptists.
00:13:54,00:13:55,- Credo-baptists.
00:13:55,00:13:56,And there are people who believe
00:13:56,00:13:58,you should only be baptized once you have been able
00:13:58,00:14:00,to come to an adult understanding of God on your own.
00:14:00,00:14:02,"- Because credo is Latin for I believe, right?"
00:14:02,00:14:04,And so the idea is that you can say yourself
00:14:04,00:14:06,that you believe that as opposed to a child
00:14:06,00:14:08,who doesn't really understand what it all means.
00:14:08,00:14:09,- What have they done to deserve that?
00:14:09,00:14:12,"- Well, I always thought it was just about"
00:14:12,00:14:14,"protecting them to get into heaven, so."
00:14:14,00:14:15,"- Ah, that's interesting,"
00:14:15,00:14:17,because it seems like Hannah and I are credos.
00:14:17,00:14:18,- Yeah.
00:14:18,00:14:19,"- But damn, it sounds from what you're saying."
00:14:19,00:14:20,- Big ol' pedos.
00:14:20,00:14:22,(laughing)
00:14:22,00:14:26,- Interesting.
00:14:26,00:14:27,- I've never heard those.
00:14:27,00:14:28,- Those terms.
00:14:28,00:14:30,"No, I don't think they get bandied around, actually."
00:14:30,00:14:32,I don't know why.
00:14:32,00:14:33,- I said I'm a credophile.
00:14:33,00:14:35,(laughing)
00:14:35,00:14:42,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:14:42,00:14:44,and that is Anna.
00:14:44,00:14:46,- My fact this week is that the Queen of France
00:14:46,00:14:51,once pranked a girl at court by secretly taking in her clothes
00:14:51,00:14:52,to make her think she was pregnant.
00:14:55,00:14:58,"This is this great, yeah, pretty mean."
00:14:58,00:15:01,"This is this great, great story"
00:15:01,00:15:04,"from the memoir of Hortense Mancini,"
00:15:04,00:15:08,"and she was one of the Mancini sisters who were so fun,"
00:15:08,00:15:12,"but her uncle was a guy called Cardinal Mazarin,"
00:15:12,00:15:16,"who was the closest person to the royal family in France,"
00:15:16,00:15:19,"really, and Cardinal Mazarin decided"
00:15:19,00:15:22,that he would start teasing his six-year-old niece.
00:15:22,00:15:23,"- That's the thing, that's the thing."
00:15:23,00:15:25,"You hear this fact and you think,"
00:15:25,00:15:27,"""Oh, it's a clever prank to play on someone"
00:15:27,00:15:29,"who's probably, what, 20 or maybe a T.A."""
00:15:29,00:15:30,That's not a six-year-old.
00:15:30,00:15:33,"- Yeah, that's what makes it so funny."
00:15:33,00:15:36,"So there's this girl called Marianne, who's six-year-old,"
00:15:36,00:15:38,"and she's the person who's writing the account, Hortense."
00:15:38,00:15:41,"It's her little sister, and Cardinal Mazarin says,"
00:15:41,00:15:42,"""Hey, you've got an admirer,"
00:15:42,00:15:45,"and he's got you pregnant, hasn't he?"""
00:15:45,00:15:47,And then they would take her clothes away
00:15:47,00:15:50,"and secretly take them in so they got tighter and tighter,"
00:15:50,00:15:51,"so she thought that she was pregnant,"
00:15:51,00:15:54,"and the whole court got in on this gag, you know?"
00:15:54,00:15:56,It was just hilarity for everyone in the court.
00:15:56,00:15:58,"- Bullion, isn't it, really?"
00:15:58,00:16:01,"- Oh, look, it's a fine line, isn't it?"
00:16:01,00:16:03,Between are you laughing with her or laughing at her?
00:16:03,00:16:06,"- Yeah, it's a fine line, and I think they crossed it."
00:16:06,00:16:08,"- Anyway, the queen, it was Anne of Austria,"
00:16:08,00:16:11,and she was the queen mother at that time.
00:16:11,00:16:12,"She had been married to King Louis,"
00:16:12,00:16:14,"and then she'd been the queen regent,"
00:16:14,00:16:16,so she was referred to as the queen.
00:16:16,00:16:18,"She turned up by the six-year-old's bedside,"
00:16:18,00:16:21,"the consulter said, ""Gosh, yes, you are a pregnant, aren't you?"""
00:16:21,00:16:24,"And then they planted a live infant in her bed,"
00:16:24,00:16:26,which we think was a baby of one of the servants.
00:16:26,00:16:28,"- This is next level, I think."
00:16:28,00:16:30,"- Yeah, this is Jeremy Beedle level."
00:16:30,00:16:32,"- This is crazy, though, yeah."
00:16:32,00:16:34,"This is amazing, and then, what happened next?"
00:16:34,00:16:36,"- Well, the queen offered to be the godmother,"
00:16:36,00:16:37,"said, ""Well done, you."""
00:16:37,00:16:39,"And then, I think they probably, at some point, came clean."
00:16:39,00:16:41,I don't think they made her raise the child.
00:16:41,00:16:44,I think the person whose child it was would have objected.
00:16:44,00:16:47,"- Well, they asked her who the father was, didn't they?"
00:16:47,00:16:49,And she said it could only either be the king
00:16:49,00:16:51,or the conch de gouiche.
00:16:51,00:16:52,- Yes.
00:16:52,00:16:54,- Because they were the only ones who she'd kissed.
00:16:54,00:16:55,- Yes.
00:16:55,00:16:56,"- And she was, it was quite sweet."
00:16:56,00:16:57,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:57,00:17:00,- Although the conch de gouiche was a known absolute playboy.
00:17:00,00:17:01,So...
00:17:01,00:17:02,"- Right, right."
00:17:02,00:17:04,"She wouldn't have known that, she's six."
00:17:04,00:17:06,"- She said that, he just gave a little kiss on the cheek."
00:17:06,00:17:09,"I quite like this in the memoirs from Hortense,"
00:17:09,00:17:10,"who was three years older than her at the time,"
00:17:10,00:17:12,so she would have been nine.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"And she said, ""She was very proud"
00:17:14,00:17:16,"""to know the truth of the matter,"
00:17:16,00:17:18,"""and I never tired of laughing about it,"
00:17:18,00:17:19,"""just to show that I knew it."""
00:17:19,00:17:21,Which is such a relatable thing
00:17:21,00:17:23,"when you're a slightly older sibling,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,"doing that over-the-top laughing to be like,"
00:17:25,00:17:26,"""Yeah, I get it."""
00:17:26,00:17:27,"- ""Oh, yeah, I get it."""
00:17:27,00:17:28,"- ""Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:28,00:17:29,"""Yeah, I kissed."""
00:17:29,00:17:31,"- ""Please don't do this kind of thing to me."
00:17:31,00:17:33,"""I feel like an idiot."""
00:17:33,00:17:35,- I was looking up pregnancy pranks.
00:17:35,00:17:36,"- Oh, yeah, cool."
00:17:36,00:17:37,- There aren't many good ones.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"It's mostly pranks that you,"
00:17:39,00:17:41,"if you're pregnant, can pull on people around you."
00:17:41,00:17:42,"- Oh, right."
00:17:42,00:17:44,"It's not like, 'cause you could throw a water balloon"
00:17:44,00:17:45,"at someone in the night,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,and then they think their waters are broken.
00:17:47,00:17:48,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:17:48,00:17:49,- Yeah.
00:17:49,00:17:50,- That's one.
00:17:50,00:17:50,- That's one.
00:17:50,00:17:53,"- If you're pregnant, you could walk around"
00:17:53,00:17:55,with like a doll hanging between your legs.
00:17:55,00:17:57,So it looks as if you're--
00:17:57,00:17:58,- Right.
00:17:58,00:17:59,- You've given birth without noticing.
00:17:59,00:18:00,- Yeah.
00:18:00,00:18:02,"- Yeah, these are all about the level of the ones I found."
00:18:02,00:18:04,The only one I found that was any good potentially
00:18:04,00:18:06,was using your pregnancy to help someone else
00:18:06,00:18:07,"with their pregnancy prank,"
00:18:07,00:18:10,where you can pee on their pregnancy test.
00:18:10,00:18:11,"- Oh, yes."
00:18:11,00:18:12,- So it'll come up as a yes.
00:18:12,00:18:13,"- Yes, right."
00:18:13,00:18:15,"- And then she'll be able to say to whoever, you know,"
00:18:15,00:18:17,"""That's really funny."" - Oh, look at me, yeah."
00:18:17,00:18:19,- Here's the thing that men don't really know
00:18:19,00:18:20,much about pregnancy tests.
00:18:20,00:18:23,So you could literally probably just take a vape
00:18:23,00:18:27,"and draw a line on it and say, ""Hey, look, I'm pregnant."""
00:18:27,00:18:31,- You can take a COVID test.
00:18:31,00:18:32,"I'm not pregnant, but you do have COVID."
00:18:32,00:18:35,(all laughing)
00:18:35,00:18:39,"This book is, it was published in 1675."
00:18:39,00:18:40,"And I guess at the time,"
00:18:40,00:18:43,it's sort of quite sort of timely we're talking about it.
00:18:43,00:18:45,"It's sort of the Prince Harry memoir of its day,"
00:18:45,00:18:48,"to an extent, because it was very much a--"
00:18:48,00:18:51,- What an amazing attempt to make this book relevant
00:18:51,00:18:52,to absolutely other than that.
00:18:52,00:18:53,"- I mean, it just totally is."
00:18:53,00:18:54,- Absolutely bang on.
00:18:54,00:18:55,- It just totally is.
00:18:55,00:18:56,- Who is this?
00:18:56,00:18:56,- That's what it was.
00:18:56,00:18:57,- Hortense.
00:18:57,00:18:58,"- Yeah, Hortense."
00:18:58,00:19:00,- Did she get a frostbyss and penis?
00:19:00,00:19:04,"- Well, no, this was the first time that, you know,"
00:19:04,00:19:05,this is someone who was amongst the royals.
00:19:05,00:19:09,She was almost basically a queen at one point.
00:19:09,00:19:11,And it was a book that was published
00:19:11,00:19:13,when women weren't really writing books either
00:19:13,00:19:14,about their personal life.
00:19:14,00:19:18,"And so when it came out, it was a huge bit of news."
00:19:18,00:19:19,It was--
00:19:19,00:19:20,- And it was scandalous.
00:19:20,00:19:21,- Yeah.
00:19:21,00:19:22,- And she filled it with gossip.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"It would have been like with Prince Harry's book,"
00:19:24,00:19:25,"going out and everyone going,"
00:19:25,00:19:27,"""Oh, wow, you've actually said that."
00:19:27,00:19:28,"God, cool."""
00:19:28,00:19:29,- Wow.
00:19:29,00:19:32,"- I've never heard of her prior to reading up on this,"
00:19:32,00:19:33,but she wrote her autobiography.
00:19:33,00:19:34,"And then a couple of years later,"
00:19:34,00:19:37,her sister wrote her autobiography as well.
00:19:37,00:19:40,"And as you say, they led just an incredibly,"
00:19:40,00:19:44,"interestingly bizarre, fun, but also quite tragic light."
00:19:44,00:19:47,"They were in marriages, which were very unloved"
00:19:47,00:19:47,and which fell apart.
00:19:47,00:19:50,They had to flee the country from time to time
00:19:50,00:19:53,because of being exiled as a result
00:19:53,00:19:55,"of their dubious affairs and so on,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,and their husbands being furious.
00:19:57,00:19:58,It's a real rollicking adventure.
00:19:58,00:20:00,"- Well, let's quickly mention this husband"
00:20:00,00:20:02,that she had in front-- - Yes.
00:20:02,00:20:05,- Who appears to have been slightly unhinged.
00:20:05,00:20:05,"- Oh man, yeah."
00:20:05,00:20:09,- He believed that milkmaid shouldn't touch cow's udders
00:20:09,00:20:13,in case they became aroused by them.
00:20:13,00:20:15,"- Yeah, there are a couple of accounts of this."
00:20:15,00:20:16,"This is just, let's give his name."
00:20:16,00:20:20,He's called Amon Chal Duller Port Duller Mayeray.
00:20:20,00:20:20,"All right, that was his name."
00:20:20,00:20:22,"And he was incredibly rich, wasn't he?"
00:20:22,00:20:23,- He was.
00:20:23,00:20:25,"He was like the richest man in Europe, pretty much."
00:20:25,00:20:26,- Yeah.
00:20:26,00:20:28,"And he, so I read that account that he was worried"
00:20:28,00:20:31,"about milkmaids finding milking sexy,"
00:20:31,00:20:33,but then I read another account saying he worried
00:20:33,00:20:34,that men might get aroused
00:20:34,00:20:36,by the sight of milkmaids doing their milking.
00:20:36,00:20:37,- Yes.
00:20:37,00:20:40,"- I actually think, Hortense didn't rise"
00:20:40,00:20:43,"about any of these things, actually."
00:20:43,00:20:46,"These all came from a guy called Abbey de Choisy,"
00:20:46,00:20:49,"who was, he wrote his memoirs and they came out"
00:20:49,00:20:51,after he died and they're all about the story
00:20:51,00:20:55,"of how he went to live in the countryside in France,"
00:20:55,00:20:58,pretended to be a woman and seduced a load of young girls.
00:20:58,00:21:00,And he apparently was friends with Perot
00:21:00,00:21:02,who wrote a lot of fairy tales.
00:21:02,00:21:04,So we think actually a lot of it might not have been true.
00:21:04,00:21:05,"- Okay, interesting."
00:21:05,00:21:06,- But he was the one who wrote all this stuff
00:21:06,00:21:08,about this crazy guy.
00:21:08,00:21:10,- And he was basically the idea with Armand Charle
00:21:10,00:21:12,"was that he was incredibly pious, wasn't he?"
00:21:12,00:21:13,And very religious.
00:21:13,00:21:15,And I imposed really strict rules like that.
00:21:15,00:21:18,"So I thought everyone was gonna be aroused all the time,"
00:21:18,00:21:22,did things like he had a collection of priceless works
00:21:22,00:21:23,of art that he'd inherited.
00:21:23,00:21:26,"And in fact, from Cardinal Mazarin."
00:21:26,00:21:30,And he went around knocking all their genitals off
00:21:30,00:21:32,because he thought the genitals were improper.
00:21:32,00:21:33,"You know, he'd slashed tapestries."
00:21:33,00:21:37,He'd painted black bits of penis and balls and nipple
00:21:37,00:21:38,on various paintings.
00:21:38,00:21:40,- There are so many different accounts.
00:21:40,00:21:43,So one of the things I read is that he did that specifically
00:21:43,00:21:46,"because he was worried that she, Hortense,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,was gonna get aroused by them.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"- To be fair, she did have quite a few affairs."
00:21:50,00:21:53,"- She did, she had a time. - To be fair, she had a time."
00:21:53,00:21:54,- She was leaving around.
00:21:54,00:21:56,- And she almost married Charles II
00:21:56,00:21:58,when I mentioned before that she almost became queen.
00:21:58,00:22:01,"So Cardinal Mazarin, who was sort of,"
00:22:01,00:22:05,he was their uncle and he was very much taking them
00:22:05,00:22:08,around town and trying to set them up and arrange marriages.
00:22:08,00:22:10,"Charles II met Hortense, fell in love with her"
00:22:10,00:22:12,"and thought, I've got to marry her, made the offer."
00:22:12,00:22:15,"And he said, no, because Charles II was an exile."
00:22:15,00:22:17,"And he said, no, you've got, you know, you got your name,"
00:22:17,00:22:19,"but you've got no money, you've got no title."
00:22:19,00:22:20,I don't know your prospects.
00:22:20,00:22:21,And so he denied it.
00:22:21,00:22:23,"And then only a few months later, even weeks,"
00:22:23,00:22:26,Charles II suddenly is restored back as king.
00:22:26,00:22:29,"And so Mazarin comes running back saying,"
00:22:29,00:22:31,actually Hortense would love to take your offer.
00:22:31,00:22:33,"And he says, no, I'm afraid that's not going to happen."
00:22:33,00:22:34,- Such a shame.
00:22:34,00:22:35,- Yeah.
00:22:35,00:22:36,- This could have been a queen of England.
00:22:36,00:22:37,"- Yeah, a little bit."
00:22:37,00:22:39,- They did hang out in England.
00:22:39,00:22:40,Hortense definitely fled to England
00:22:40,00:22:41,and spent a lot of time at court.
00:22:41,00:22:43,"And she was super fun, livened the whole place up."
00:22:43,00:22:45,"And the thing is, they were this Italian family."
00:22:45,00:22:47,And we should say they were called the Mazarinettes
00:22:47,00:22:49,and there were seven of them all together.
00:22:49,00:22:52,And they were the seven nieces of the Cardinal.
00:22:52,00:22:54,And they all looked quite different.
00:22:54,00:22:56,They were dark skinned when everyone was very pale skinned.
00:22:56,00:22:58,"- They looked similar to each other,"
00:22:58,00:23:00,but different to normal other people.
00:23:00,00:23:04,"- To normal noble women, yes, who were all very pale."
00:23:04,00:23:05,They all seemed to have the same name.
00:23:05,00:23:08,"There were two Laura's, two Anne-Marie's and one Marianne,"
00:23:08,00:23:10,which is quite confusing.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"But yeah, they were fun and Hortense especially."
00:23:13,00:23:15,"So at one point when she ran away from Armand Charles,"
00:23:15,00:23:17,"she ended up in a convent,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,or I think she was put in a convent
00:23:19,00:23:20,to try and make her behave.
00:23:20,00:23:23,But she became best friends with this woman
00:23:23,00:23:25,"called Manmoselle de Cossel,"
00:23:25,00:23:27,who maybe she was in a relationship with
00:23:27,00:23:28,or had a little fling with.
00:23:28,00:23:30,Maybe they were just really close friends.
00:23:30,00:23:32,And they sort of played practical jokes
00:23:32,00:23:34,on the nuns quite a lot.
00:23:34,00:23:35,- They all thought they were pregnant.
00:23:35,00:23:36,"- They, yeah."
00:23:36,00:23:40,I promised I haven't had sex all the nuns.
00:23:40,00:23:44,"Yeah, she did things like she filled two chests with water"
00:23:44,00:23:45,and apparently the water leaked through
00:23:45,00:23:47,onto the nun's beds.
00:23:47,00:23:50,But she had this really cool adventure in the convent
00:23:50,00:23:52,where her husband came to try and kidnap her away
00:23:52,00:23:54,when he found she was misbehaving.
00:23:54,00:23:56,"And her, Manmoselle Cossel, found,"
00:23:56,00:23:58,it's like the stuff of fantasies.
00:23:58,00:24:01,They found a little hole in a grate in the parlor
00:24:01,00:24:04,which they could just squeeze through to escape.
00:24:04,00:24:06,And so they squeezed through this grate
00:24:06,00:24:09,and they climbed out the outside.
00:24:09,00:24:10,And then they actually realized it was a false alarm
00:24:10,00:24:12,"and their friends were visiting, not her husband."
00:24:12,00:24:14,- This is the story of the sound of music.
00:24:14,00:24:15,(laughing)
00:24:15,00:24:18,"This is, there are baddies in a convent,"
00:24:18,00:24:20,"squeezing through a gate, come on."
00:24:20,00:24:23,"- Yep, well then they squeezed back in"
00:24:23,00:24:24,"'cause they were like,"
00:24:24,00:24:25,"""Oh, we're gonna look stupid, it's just our mates."""
00:24:25,00:24:27,And she got stuck in this grate
00:24:27,00:24:30,between two iron bars for about 20 minutes.
00:24:30,00:24:33,"And Manmoselle Cossel, that's like tug her out"
00:24:33,00:24:35,and then they ended up covered in soot
00:24:35,00:24:37,"on the parlor floor, snogging."
00:24:37,00:24:40,"No, I've embellished some of the ending, but yeah, sounds fun."
00:24:40,00:24:44,"- After she died, her husband caught up with her"
00:24:44,00:24:48,"and had wanted actually to repatriate her for ages,"
00:24:48,00:24:49,but hadn't managed to do it. - It's so much easier
00:24:49,00:24:50,to catch up with someone after they die.
00:24:50,00:24:53,"- Well, exactly, it's really, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:53,00:24:57,"- Well, he caught up with her, he caught her body,"
00:24:57,00:24:59,"he put it in a sealed coffin, great, fair play,"
00:24:59,00:25:01,it's what you meant to do.
00:25:01,00:25:04,And then he just carried it around Europe
00:25:04,00:25:06,on a sort of weird posthumous honeymoon
00:25:06,00:25:09,to all the places they had been together in life
00:25:09,00:25:12,"for four months, a long time."
00:25:12,00:25:16,"And then eventually, he left her in a country churchyard"
00:25:16,00:25:18,"and then eventually when he died later,"
00:25:18,00:25:19,they were buried next to each other.
00:25:19,00:25:21,I don't know how she would have felt about that.
00:25:21,00:25:22,"- And then during the revolution,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,they got chucked in the sand.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"- Yeah, so it has a..."
00:25:26,00:25:28,"- An unhappy ending, not a few other people."
00:25:28,00:25:30,(laughing)
00:25:30,00:25:34,"- Obviously, you know, I'm a big fan of the aristocracy."
00:25:34,00:25:38,- I read an article that she introduced champagne to Britain.
00:25:38,00:25:41,"- I read that. - Yeah, I think popularized."
00:25:41,00:25:43,"- Popularized, yeah. - Oh, really?"
00:25:43,00:25:44,- I think she was fun.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"- Oh my God, then this is the most fun thing about her."
00:25:46,00:25:48,"I did all this reading and then finally, at the end,"
00:25:48,00:25:49,find this one article which talks about
00:25:49,00:25:53,this extraordinary saloon that she opened up in the 17th.
00:25:53,00:25:54,- I think Salon.
00:25:54,00:25:56,- I think a saloon is a Wild West Indian car.
00:25:56,00:25:58,- Is it not a saloon? - It's a saloon.
00:25:58,00:26:00,"- No, no, no, all the ladies in London used to come."
00:26:00,00:26:02,They had to leave their guns in the car.
00:26:02,00:26:03,"- And at those swinging doors,"
00:26:03,00:26:06,"the piano player, they would stop when Hortense walked in."
00:26:06,00:26:08,"That's it, yeah."
00:26:08,00:26:11,"So we're calling it Salon, so really."
00:26:11,00:26:13,- Let's go with Salon for the moment.
00:26:13,00:26:13,"- Let's call it for that, yeah."
00:26:13,00:26:14,"- Because it was kind of French,"
00:26:14,00:26:18,"so let's say a saloon, but with a French angle, like Salon."
00:26:18,00:26:20,So let's land on Salon.
00:26:20,00:26:22,"- I mean, that's definitely."
00:26:22,00:26:23,- That's what they were called.
00:26:23,00:26:25,"- That's what like Salons, very popular in those days."
00:26:25,00:26:26,Have Salon.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"- So she ran this, let me get to the fucking facts."
00:26:29,00:26:31,She's 17th century London.
00:26:31,00:26:34,She had basically this extraordinary like book club
00:26:34,00:26:36,that she ran next to St. James's Palace
00:26:36,00:26:39,"and all the ladies who were encouraging not to do this,"
00:26:39,00:26:41,"to have intellectual conversation, to read books"
00:26:41,00:26:42,"and discuss them with each other,"
00:26:42,00:26:45,"to share their ideas, their philosophies would go."
00:26:45,00:26:46,They would drink champagne
00:26:46,00:26:48,and they would do all this stuff together.
00:26:48,00:26:51,"And she was just such a,"
00:26:51,00:26:53,the article describes her as an influencer of the time.
00:26:53,00:26:54,- Definitely.
00:26:54,00:26:55,The interesting thing was these Salons
00:26:55,00:26:57,"were massive in France, weren't they?"
00:26:57,00:26:59,They were like a huge thing in France at the time
00:26:59,00:27:01,and all the middle class and upper class women
00:27:01,00:27:03,"would go to these Salons and kind of learn things,"
00:27:03,00:27:05,but she was the one who brought it to London.
00:27:05,00:27:06,- Yeah.
00:27:06,00:27:08,- 'Cause it didn't exist here at the time.
00:27:08,00:27:11,"- Yeah, you could say that really podcasts"
00:27:11,00:27:14,are the Salons of the present day.
00:27:14,00:27:15,- It wasn't.
00:27:15,00:27:17,"- Well, we're discussing things."
00:27:17,00:27:19,- We allow one woman on our podcast.
00:27:19,00:27:20,- That's true.
00:27:20,00:27:23,"- Yes, traditionally a male environment."
00:27:23,00:27:26,- Okay.
00:27:26,00:27:27,It's loose.
00:27:27,00:27:29,"- It's a discussion, isn't it?"
00:27:29,00:27:31,We've all got champagne.
00:27:31,00:27:33,"- Oh, God, yeah, I wouldn't come to this"
00:27:33,00:27:35,if that wasn't promised.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"- But she, I mean, this was how great her influence was,"
00:27:37,00:27:40,particularly with quite obscure texts.
00:27:40,00:27:42,"If she introduced a text to be read,"
00:27:42,00:27:43,it would get round town
00:27:43,00:27:45,that this was like something that was amazing
00:27:45,00:27:47,and it would boost up a big run of it with translations
00:27:47,00:27:49,"because people suddenly were going,"
00:27:49,00:27:49,what are they reading there?
00:27:49,00:27:52,And we have to be part of that.
00:27:52,00:27:53,- It was very much the Richard and Judy's Book Club
00:27:53,00:27:54,of its day.
00:27:54,00:27:55,"- Yes, exactly."
00:27:55,00:27:56,That's what it was.
00:27:56,00:27:57,- That's more of a salon.
00:27:57,00:27:59,"- Yeah, that is a book club."
00:27:59,00:28:00,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:00,00:28:02,"- The one interesting about Hortense, if you Google her,"
00:28:02,00:28:05,"the first image, the painting that comes up of her"
00:28:05,00:28:07,is of her looking very beautiful
00:28:07,00:28:11,and then just a little nipple hanging out from the move.
00:28:11,00:28:12,Did you see that?
00:28:12,00:28:13,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:28:13,00:28:16,"- And there's only a few paintings of her that are around,"
00:28:16,00:28:17,but that's one of the surviving ones.
00:28:17,00:28:19,- I think that might be just your history
00:28:19,00:28:21,is deciding what pictures you get.
00:28:21,00:28:23,"- Yeah, that's possible."
00:28:23,00:28:25,- It's interesting you'd have that painted in
00:28:25,00:28:27,"to an official portrait, not official,"
00:28:27,00:28:29,but a portrait of you ends up with a bit of nipple in.
00:28:29,00:28:32,It's just a general portrait that you get done
00:28:32,00:28:36,"to show that you're a sexy person, like Janet Jackson."
00:28:36,00:28:37,"- Yeah, that was why she did that, wasn't it?"
00:28:37,00:28:38,"- But the thing is with Janet Jackson,"
00:28:38,00:28:41,"it was a malfunction, right, where she quickly covered up."
00:28:41,00:28:43,"But with a painting, you'd have to sit there"
00:28:43,00:28:44,for about three days.
00:28:44,00:28:45,- That's a hell of a malfunction.
00:28:45,00:28:46,- We'll accidentally follow it out.
00:28:46,00:28:48,(laughing)
00:28:48,00:28:51,- Maybe the artist was just too embarrassed.
00:28:51,00:28:53,You know when like someone has green in their teeth
00:28:53,00:28:56,"and they just, you'd want to say, but you don't say it,"
00:28:56,00:28:58,"he's like, ""Oh, I just got to paint it in, I guess."""
00:28:58,00:29:00,(laughing)
00:29:00,00:29:02,(upbeat music)
00:29:02,00:29:06,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:29:06,00:29:08,and that is James.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"- Okay, my fact this week is that according"
00:29:10,00:29:14,"to their origin story, the Minions serve"
00:29:14,00:29:17,"the most evil person on earth,"
00:29:17,00:29:19,but they were conveniently frozen in a cave
00:29:19,00:29:24,and unable to serve anyone between 1933 and 1945.
00:29:24,00:29:26,(laughing)
00:29:26,00:29:28,"- Wow, is this official Minions' Canon?"
00:29:28,00:29:29,- I believe it is.
00:29:29,00:29:30,"- Yeah, where is it?"
00:29:30,00:29:31,"- Yeah, it's in the movie."
00:29:31,00:29:33,"- It's in the movie, it's in the second movie, yeah."
00:29:33,00:29:35,"- Oh, wow."
00:29:35,00:29:36,"- The dates, you've altered the dates there,"
00:29:36,00:29:39,but that is part of the period when they were frozen.
00:29:39,00:29:40,"- I gave the dates for Hitler,"
00:29:40,00:29:42,and half of them the dates for the Minions.
00:29:42,00:29:43,- Exactly.
00:29:43,00:29:45,"- But basically, there's this thing on the internet"
00:29:45,00:29:48,"that people keep doing this meme where they say,"
00:29:48,00:29:51,"""Ah, the Minions, they serve the most evil person,"
00:29:51,00:29:53,"""but what were they doing during World War II?"""
00:29:53,00:29:54,"And it's like a big joke that,"
00:29:54,00:29:56,"""Ah, they haven't thought of this,"
00:29:56,00:29:57,"""but of course they have thought of it,"
00:29:57,00:29:59,"""and it is in the movie, which I haven't seen."""
00:29:59,00:30:01,"- Yeah, so we should say who the Minions are,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,but there's these little yellow creatures
00:30:03,00:30:04,"who are in the film Despicable Me,"
00:30:04,00:30:05,and then all the other sequels.
00:30:05,00:30:06,- And then the film Minions.
00:30:06,00:30:08,- So they were henchmen that got their own
00:30:08,00:30:11,"spin-off series, and Minions was 2015,"
00:30:11,00:30:13,"and in the opening sequence, it tells you the history,"
00:30:13,00:30:16,so it says that they serve various evil masters
00:30:16,00:30:19,from the T-Rex all the way through to--
00:30:19,00:30:20,- When did they get out of the cave?
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Sorry to interrupt you, Dan."
00:30:21,00:30:23,- So they go into the cave in 1812.
00:30:23,00:30:25,"That's when they first go in,"
00:30:25,00:30:28,"and they emerge in 1968, I think,"
00:30:28,00:30:32,to avoid being so obviously avoiding the Nazis.
00:30:32,00:30:33,- So 1812 would have been just after
00:30:33,00:30:34,Napoleon's retreat from Moscow.
00:30:34,00:30:36,"- Yeah, yeah, well, it's very cold"
00:30:36,00:30:38,"in when they were treating, so--"
00:30:38,00:30:39,- Exactly. - There we go.
00:30:39,00:30:41,"- All right, I'm going with the lore."
00:30:41,00:30:42,I love it.
00:30:42,00:30:43,"- I wonder who they're serving now,"
00:30:43,00:30:45,who's the most evil person on a--
00:30:45,00:30:47,"- Few candidates, aren't there?"
00:30:47,00:30:49,"None in this room, sorry, I'm looking around, I'm sorry."
00:30:49,00:30:50,(laughing)
00:30:50,00:30:52,"The director, one of the co-directors of the films,"
00:30:52,00:30:56,"is Pierre Coffin, Peter Coffin."
00:30:56,00:30:57,"- Peter Coffin, yeah."
00:30:57,00:30:57,"- But his name doesn't actually,"
00:30:57,00:31:00,Coffin in French doesn't mean Coffin.
00:31:00,00:31:01,- What does it mean?
00:31:01,00:31:02,"- I don't think it means anything,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,"but the word ""Couffin"" means basket,"
00:31:06,00:31:07,"which is very close, so I really thought"
00:31:07,00:31:08,"it was called Peter Coffin,"
00:31:08,00:31:10,"and then I thought it was called Peter Basket,"
00:31:10,00:31:11,"and actually, he isn't called either."
00:31:11,00:31:12,(laughing)
00:31:12,00:31:15,"- But he does the voices of lots of the Minions, right?"
00:31:15,00:31:16,"- Lots of them, yeah."
00:31:16,00:31:18,"- All of them apart from Baby One, yeah."
00:31:18,00:31:20,"- Well, there's Jermaine Clement"
00:31:20,00:31:21,from Flight of the Comcords does one.
00:31:21,00:31:22,- Does he voice them?
00:31:22,00:31:24,"- No, one, literally one Minion,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,"and then this guy, and someone else,"
00:31:26,00:31:29,but this guy does 899 Minions.
00:31:29,00:31:31,"- Oh, wow, I think so, there's another director,"
00:31:31,00:31:32,"there's a co-director of the film,"
00:31:32,00:31:32,"so I think that's another-- - Yeah,"
00:31:32,00:31:34,who also does some Minion voices.
00:31:34,00:31:36,"- The language sounds so difficult to do,"
00:31:36,00:31:37,"'cause every word is, I think,"
00:31:37,00:31:39,a real word from one language or another.
00:31:39,00:31:40,- I think there's some gibberish in there.
00:31:40,00:31:41,- There's gibberish as well.
00:31:41,00:31:43,- It's mixed in with loads of other languages.
00:31:43,00:31:45,"- But they sound so funny to listen to,"
00:31:45,00:31:47,"I just, I love the sound of the Minion's language,"
00:31:47,00:31:48,like it's really funny.
00:31:48,00:31:49,- Have you seen them all?
00:31:49,00:31:52,"- No, I haven't seen any of them, I've just watched some."
00:31:52,00:31:54,"- Yeah, I've seen Minions in bits,"
00:31:54,00:31:55,"you know, you walk in and out"
00:31:55,00:31:57,"while the kid's watching a movie,"
00:31:57,00:31:58,and then you're asked to leave the cinema
00:31:58,00:31:59,"'cause where's your kid, you know,"
00:31:59,00:32:02,"and it's like, ""All right, I'm outta here, jeez."""
00:32:02,00:32:04,"- Yeah, he's cool, Coffin,"
00:32:04,00:32:05,and I think that one of the reasons
00:32:05,00:32:07,that the Minions speak this combination of languages
00:32:07,00:32:09,"is that he is very multilingual, I think,"
00:32:09,00:32:11,"so he's like half Indonesian, half French,"
00:32:11,00:32:13,"grew up in Cambodia and Japan,"
00:32:13,00:32:16,"and, yeah, invented this language."
00:32:16,00:32:18,"And interestingly, when it's dubbed into other languages,"
00:32:18,00:32:21,"it gets changed, because you notice"
00:32:21,00:32:23,"that they say English words enough,"
00:32:23,00:32:25,"you're like, ""Oh, they must be talking about toast now,"""
00:32:25,00:32:27,"or bananas, famously."
00:32:27,00:32:29,"But in other languages, they'll sub those words"
00:32:29,00:32:31,for that language. - Interesting.
00:32:31,00:32:33,So they'll still use the Indonesian
00:32:33,00:32:34,"and the different places,"
00:32:34,00:32:36,"but then whenever there was an English word,"
00:32:36,00:32:37,they use whatever country you're in the world.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"- Yeah, yeah. - Oh, that's interesting."
00:32:39,00:32:41,- Or just drop in more local words where they can.
00:32:41,00:32:42,- That's cool.
00:32:42,00:32:44,"Yeah, his mom was a famous novelist, wasn't she?"
00:32:44,00:32:45,- Was she?
00:32:45,00:32:47,"- N.H.Dini, Coffin's mom, was called."
00:32:47,00:32:48,"I'd never heard of her inside of this,"
00:32:48,00:32:51,but she is an Indonesian novelist and feminist.
00:32:51,00:32:53,- Very nice.
00:32:53,00:32:55,- At least two of the Minions' films
00:32:55,00:32:58,have been banned or altered by censors in China.
00:32:58,00:33:01,"- Oh, really? - Who dislike various aspects"
00:33:01,00:33:02,of the plot.
00:33:02,00:33:03,"So there's, and I just, I really like this."
00:33:03,00:33:05,"So the film, The Rise of Gru,"
00:33:05,00:33:08,"which I think is one of the most recent ones,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,the Chinese censors added an entirely different bit
00:33:11,00:33:12,"of the film at the end of it,"
00:33:12,00:33:14,clarifying that one of the characters
00:33:14,00:33:17,"who previously been involved in a heist in the film,"
00:33:17,00:33:19,"you know, fictional film, fictional heist, everything,"
00:33:19,00:33:22,was caught and served 20 years in prison for the heist.
00:33:22,00:33:24,"I mean, fuck yeah. - That's so good."
00:33:24,00:33:26,(laughing)
00:33:26,00:33:29,- They also say that Gru returned to his family
00:33:29,00:33:32,and his biggest accomplishment was his free children.
00:33:32,00:33:33,- Gosh.
00:33:33,00:33:35,"- And apparently the reason that they've done this,"
00:33:35,00:33:40,most people think is to promote China's three child policy.
00:33:40,00:33:40,- Oh no.
00:33:40,00:33:41,- Which they've been trying to do
00:33:41,00:33:44,to increase the birth rate over the last few years.
00:33:44,00:33:45,- Wow. - Guys.
00:33:45,00:33:47,- I was reading about other animated villains
00:33:47,00:33:49,"of various guys. - Oh great, okay."
00:33:49,00:33:53,"- And so Scar, The Lion King."
00:33:53,00:33:54,- Yeah.
00:33:54,00:33:55,"- No spoilers, please, I haven't seen it."
00:33:55,00:33:57,- I think I can avoid spoilers.
00:33:57,00:33:58,- Great.
00:33:58,00:34:00,"- Who is sexier, Scar or Mufasa?"
00:34:00,00:34:01,- According to just us or you?
00:34:01,00:34:02,- According to you.
00:34:02,00:34:03,- Are they both lions?
00:34:03,00:34:04,- Yep.
00:34:04,00:34:05,- Mufasa.
00:34:05,00:34:06,- Mufasa.
00:34:06,00:34:07,"- Okay, it says equal to the lions."
00:34:07,00:34:09,- I find them both equally attractive at the lions.
00:34:09,00:34:11,- Lions can be more or less sexier than each other.
00:34:11,00:34:12,They're apparently completely impossible
00:34:12,00:34:13,for James to compete.
00:34:13,00:34:15,(laughing)
00:34:15,00:34:16,- I thought it was a subjective question.
00:34:16,00:34:19,"- Do you find all, you must think there are some animals"
00:34:19,00:34:21,which are sexier than other animals in the same species.
00:34:21,00:34:23,- Have that buff kangaroo.
00:34:23,00:34:24,(laughing)
00:34:24,00:34:27,- I'm not sure that that is true.
00:34:27,00:34:29,- Do you think of all humans as being equally sexy?
00:34:29,00:34:30,- Absolutely.
00:34:30,00:34:31,(laughing)
00:34:31,00:34:32,"- Apart from my wife of course,"
00:34:32,00:34:34,they're slightly less sexy than other animals.
00:34:34,00:34:35,(laughing)
00:34:35,00:34:38,"- Wait, doesn't your cat have a modeling contract though?"
00:34:38,00:34:39,"- No, she doesn't."
00:34:39,00:34:43,She has appeared in some adverts.
00:34:43,00:34:44,- So you must think she's sexy.
00:34:44,00:34:46,- You don't have to be sexy to be in an advert.
00:34:46,00:34:47,That's not what they are always cast for.
00:34:47,00:34:48,"- No, you're right."
00:34:48,00:34:49,- But the difference here is--
00:34:49,00:34:50,- Captain Bird's work.
00:34:50,00:34:52,What a terrible example of the sexiest man on TV.
00:34:52,00:34:53,"- He's so hot, yeah."
00:34:53,00:34:54,(laughing)
00:34:54,00:34:57,- Can I just say I don't find my cat sexy?
00:34:57,00:34:58,"- Yeah, you're allowed to say this."
00:34:58,00:35:00,It can be a model and not sexy.
00:35:00,00:35:04,"It's the human personality,"
00:35:04,00:35:06,which is adding to the sexiness of these characters as well.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"- Well, they've got voices, haven't they?"
00:35:08,00:35:09,"Yeah, they're human voices."
00:35:09,00:35:10,"And I'm speaking in English, yeah, yeah."
00:35:10,00:35:12,"- For me, I would say that physically,"
00:35:12,00:35:14,"Mufasa definitely sexier,"
00:35:14,00:35:16,"but in terms of personality and voice,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,"Scar, of course, is more sexy."
00:35:18,00:35:19,"- Okay, well."
00:35:19,00:35:21,- Scar's like old and manky looks.
00:35:21,00:35:23,"- No, but I know that's why I said."
00:35:23,00:35:24,"- No, I know."
00:35:24,00:35:27,"No, no, and he personality-wise is evil."
00:35:27,00:35:29,"- Okay, well, can I say one of you is right and wrong?"
00:35:29,00:35:32,- Mufasa is less sexy than Scar.
00:35:32,00:35:35,"Scar is the sexier one, physically,"
00:35:35,00:35:37,and would be in the real world as well.
00:35:37,00:35:38,"In fact, specifically in the real world."
00:35:38,00:35:39,So this is a study about
00:35:39,00:35:41,what makes a lion sexy or unsexy.
00:35:41,00:35:43,"And for years, they've been thinking about-"
00:35:43,00:35:45,"- Come on, you're talking from a lion's perspective."
00:35:45,00:35:47,That was the whole point.
00:35:47,00:35:48,"- This is about what, main darkness."
00:35:48,00:35:49,"- Right, yeah."
00:35:49,00:35:52,"- 'Cause some lions have really, really light mains,"
00:35:52,00:35:53,"and some have really, really dark ones."
00:35:53,00:35:56,"You know, scientists have been trying to work out for years."
00:35:56,00:35:58,What does this have any effect at all?
00:35:58,00:36:01,"And they just introduced these fake lions,"
00:36:01,00:36:03,and they could sort the mains around.
00:36:03,00:36:04,"And you could attach them with Velcro,"
00:36:04,00:36:07,so you could whip off a mane and then reattach it.
00:36:07,00:36:10,And the dark mains were very much preferred
00:36:10,00:36:13,"by the lady lions, lionesses, as they're also known."
00:36:13,00:36:15,"But interestingly, dark-mained lions"
00:36:15,00:36:17,"have more abnormal sperm,"
00:36:17,00:36:18,"because they have heat stress,"
00:36:18,00:36:20,"because their mains are so dark,"
00:36:20,00:36:22,"they keep absorbing sunlight,"
00:36:22,00:36:24,"and they have to eat smaller meals as well,"
00:36:24,00:36:25,"because they get more heat stress,"
00:36:25,00:36:26,"and if they eat a massive, great meal,"
00:36:26,00:36:27,"you know, it warms you up."
00:36:27,00:36:28,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:28,00:36:29,"- You know, sometimes you have a huge meal."
00:36:29,00:36:30,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:30,00:36:31,- I'm so hot on that.
00:36:31,00:36:33,"- Oh, no, no, no, no, mate, sperm are deformed."
00:36:33,00:36:36,(all laughing)
00:36:36,00:36:36,Would you like a dessert?
00:36:36,00:36:38,"No, they're deformed enough already."
00:36:38,00:36:40,(all laughing)
00:36:40,00:36:42,"- That's why I make my husband,"
00:36:42,00:36:44,dye his hair peroxide blonde before every meal.
00:36:44,00:36:45,(all laughing)
00:36:45,00:36:47,You've got to watch out.
00:36:47,00:36:49,- I'm sure that peroxide's good for him.
00:36:49,00:36:52,(all laughing)
00:36:52,00:36:53,"- Lex Luthor, do you know what made him evil?"
00:36:53,00:36:56,He's the villain in the Superman universe.
00:36:56,00:36:57,- I actually don't.
00:36:57,00:36:59,"No, I don't have a handle on what he came from."
00:36:59,00:37:00,- What is he?
00:37:00,00:37:01,He's just like a rich guy.
00:37:01,00:37:03,"- He's a rich guy, but he was a scientist,"
00:37:03,00:37:05,"and it was basically Superman made him bald,"
00:37:05,00:37:06,and that is why.
00:37:06,00:37:07,- Bald?
00:37:07,00:37:08,- Yeah.
00:37:08,00:37:09,- As in no hair.
00:37:09,00:37:12,"- So he used to have a huge amount of ginger hair on his head,"
00:37:12,00:37:15,"and there was an incident between Superman and Lex Luthor,"
00:37:15,00:37:18,where they were in a science lab.
00:37:18,00:37:20,Lex Luthor was trying to make something really good.
00:37:20,00:37:22,Superman had to blow it out
00:37:22,00:37:23,"because something went a bit wrong,"
00:37:23,00:37:26,"and in the big Superman blow that he did,"
00:37:26,00:37:28,"it just pushed these chemicals onto Lex Luthor's head,"
00:37:28,00:37:29,made him bald.
00:37:29,00:37:32,"He was so furious, he became a supervillain."
00:37:32,00:37:34,- And that's an overreaction.
00:37:34,00:37:35,- It's an overreaction.
00:37:35,00:37:37,- He's got temper issues with us.
00:37:37,00:37:39,- What's amazing is this is a retroactive story
00:37:39,00:37:42,"to explain why he suddenly goes bald,"
00:37:42,00:37:44,"because you know part of like comic book artistry,"
00:37:44,00:37:47,they would hand it to sort of as it was ghost artists
00:37:47,00:37:50,to come in and do the sort of comic strips and help them.
00:37:50,00:37:53,"One of the guys who was in charge of it one week,"
00:37:53,00:37:55,mistaken Lex Luthor for one of the bald henchmen
00:37:55,00:37:59,and accidentally drew Lex Luthor as a bald headed man.
00:37:59,00:38:00,And so it was a total mistake
00:38:00,00:38:02,and it ran for a couple of weeks.
00:38:02,00:38:03,It went out and then another one went out
00:38:03,00:38:05,and that just had to be it.
00:38:05,00:38:05,So he had no hair.
00:38:05,00:38:08,So the only reason he's bald is an artistic mistake.
00:38:08,00:38:09,- Who the hell is proof reading this?
00:38:09,00:38:11,That's like releasing a few scenes from The Lion King
00:38:11,00:38:14,where a hyena plays Scar and no one notices.
00:38:14,00:38:16,And then what?
00:38:16,00:38:19,- Lex Luthor would buck the trend of most supervillains
00:38:19,00:38:23,because villains in fiction and particularly depictions
00:38:23,00:38:27,of villains are generally more pointy than heroes.
00:38:27,00:38:29,"Yeah, there's the sense of, you know,"
00:38:29,00:38:31,you can draw Mickey Mouse with three circles.
00:38:31,00:38:33,"- But if he was bad, it would be triangles."
00:38:33,00:38:35,"- Well, yeah."
00:38:35,00:38:36,"So I was reading an explanation about this,"
00:38:36,00:38:38,about the graphology of films and so on.
00:38:38,00:38:39,Darth Vader literally has a triangle
00:38:39,00:38:40,on the front of his face.
00:38:40,00:38:41,"- Oh yeah, he does."
00:38:41,00:38:43,- More scary.
00:38:43,00:38:45,- But more sexy very often.
00:38:45,00:38:47,"I mean, they genuinely are made to be a bit attractive,"
00:38:47,00:38:48,I think.
00:38:48,00:38:51,"- Sorry, Darth Vader."
00:38:51,00:38:53,- He's got a dark main Darth Vader actually.
00:38:53,00:38:55,So he is more attractive to female Vaders.
00:38:55,00:38:57,"- Yeah, he was king of the prize."
00:38:57,00:39:02,"More like, more than women actually."
00:39:02,00:39:04,- Is he not sexy Darth Vader?
00:39:04,00:39:05,- Darth Vader?
00:39:05,00:39:07,"- He's got a sexy voice, doesn't he?"
00:39:07,00:39:08,- Have you seen Under the Helmet?
00:39:08,00:39:09,- I haven't seen any of the-
00:39:09,00:39:10,"- Okay, no."
00:39:10,00:39:11,- Don't look under the helmet.
00:39:11,00:39:11,- Don't look under the helmet.
00:39:11,00:39:12,- Keep that helmet on.
00:39:12,00:39:14,"If you're making out with Darth Vader,"
00:39:14,00:39:15,just keep that helmet on.
00:39:15,00:39:16,- Yeah.
00:39:16,00:39:17,"- I think in Disney films,"
00:39:17,00:39:20,the female villains are acknowledged as sexy
00:39:20,00:39:24,"in fact there's a book called The Enchanted Screen,"
00:39:24,00:39:26,the Unknown History of Fairytale Films.
00:39:26,00:39:26,- Who are you thinking of?
00:39:26,00:39:27,- Which says-
00:39:27,00:39:29,- That woman in The Little Mermaid.
00:39:29,00:39:30,The big octopus.
00:39:30,00:39:31,"- That's what she learned, yeah."
00:39:31,00:39:35,- Pick the one example that she does in the film.
00:39:35,00:39:36,Although she's got some nice lipstick on.
00:39:36,00:39:39,- There's arguments about whether or not she's an octopus
00:39:39,00:39:40,because she's only got six arms.
00:39:40,00:39:42,But then-
00:39:42,00:39:44,- Human arms or octopus?
00:39:44,00:39:45,"- Well, here's the thing."
00:39:45,00:39:46,"- She's got tentacles, hasn't she?"
00:39:46,00:39:47,- Right.
00:39:47,00:39:48,- She has tentacles.
00:39:48,00:39:49,"The argument is she does have two human arms,"
00:39:49,00:39:51,"which makes it eight, which, yeah."
00:39:51,00:39:53,"- Hang on, isn't there a QI fact"
00:39:53,00:39:55,that octopuses have six legs and two arms?
00:39:55,00:39:57,"- Two, like pedipals, yeah."
00:39:57,00:40:00,"- Yeah, because they use their legs to walk"
00:40:00,00:40:01,and they use their arms to grab things.
00:40:01,00:40:02,- So they've got it bang on.
00:40:02,00:40:04,- She's a perfect octopus.
00:40:04,00:40:05,"Six legs, two arms."
00:40:05,00:40:08,"- Yeah, I guess so, except that she's a myrrh something, right?"
00:40:08,00:40:09,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:09,00:40:12,"- So I don't know, do you count the human part"
00:40:12,00:40:14,in with the octopus part?
00:40:14,00:40:15,- That's right.
00:40:15,00:40:15,"- I don't know, I don't know."
00:40:15,00:40:16,"- Anna, I think you were saying something about-"
00:40:16,00:40:17,- I don't know that you're spending too much time
00:40:17,00:40:19,"on some weird forums, Dan."
00:40:19,00:40:21,(laughing)
00:40:21,00:40:23,"I was just saying that in ""Snow White,"""
00:40:23,00:40:25,"that queen in ""Snow White"" is acknowledged,"
00:40:25,00:40:27,"according to this book, it says,"
00:40:27,00:40:30,"""As is well-known, animators all preferred drawing her"
00:40:30,00:40:32,"""when they were making ""Snow White"""
00:40:32,00:40:33,"""because she was very complex as a woman"
00:40:33,00:40:36,"""and much more erotic than ""Snow White."""
00:40:36,00:40:38,"And she isn't everything in ""Corrella de Vil,"" she is,"
00:40:38,00:40:41,and it's sort of-
00:40:41,00:40:42,"- They're kind of glamorous, yeah."
00:40:42,00:40:44,"- They're glamorous, certainly, yeah."
00:40:44,00:40:45,- Maybe it's glam.
00:40:45,00:40:46,"- I think it's glam, yeah."
00:40:46,00:40:48,"- They're glamorous, they're powerful, they're independent,"
00:40:48,00:40:49,they know what they want.
00:40:49,00:40:51,They want to skin dogs to make a coat.
00:40:51,00:40:53,I like a woman with ambitions.
00:40:53,00:40:54,(laughing)
00:40:54,00:40:58,"- And he's old, you know what I'm saying, yeah."
00:40:58,00:41:00,"- One thing that they do often have, villains,"
00:41:00,00:41:02,"I think this is more men than women, actually,"
00:41:02,00:41:04,but they often have terrible skin.
00:41:04,00:41:08,"And dermatologists are not happy about this,"
00:41:08,00:41:10,'cause they say it may foster a tendency
00:41:10,00:41:13,towards prejudice in society.
00:41:13,00:41:16,"Because all the bad guys in movies have bad skin,"
00:41:16,00:41:17,"if you see someone with bad skin,"
00:41:17,00:41:19,you're gonna think they're bad.
00:41:19,00:41:21,"And really, there's quite a lot of people"
00:41:21,00:41:22,"who are saying that really, you shouldn't do this."
00:41:22,00:41:25,"We should stop having scars, we should stop having-"
00:41:25,00:41:26,- Yes.
00:41:26,00:41:27,- I'm trying to think you have bad skin.
00:41:27,00:41:29,"- Well, for example, almost all James Bond villains,"
00:41:29,00:41:31,even in the- - I think in Christoph Waltz
00:41:31,00:41:33,"in ""Anything He's In,"" as like-"
00:41:33,00:41:34,"- Exactly. - Scars, doesn't he?"
00:41:34,00:41:36,"- But the most recent Bond movie has two villains,"
00:41:36,00:41:38,"both of whom have facial disfigurements,"
00:41:38,00:41:40,"""Have You About Them"" has one in a previous film,"
00:41:40,00:41:42,and it's like- - The bad is Roger Rabbit.
00:41:42,00:41:45,- There is a lot of it when you start looking.
00:41:45,00:41:46,- I thought you just meant acne.
00:41:46,00:41:48,"'Cause I think, I mean, scars are kind of cool,"
00:41:48,00:41:49,"but being covered in acne,"
00:41:49,00:41:53,I can see that that would like be insulting.
00:41:53,00:41:55,"- No, no, no, no, but it's lots of people"
00:41:55,00:41:58,who suffered facial scarring for whatever reason.
00:41:58,00:42:01,"And then you see film after film after film,"
00:42:01,00:42:03,the baddie is a baddie because they've suffered
00:42:03,00:42:05,"some facial scarring. - Two face, the Joker."
00:42:05,00:42:07,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, man is full of it as well."
00:42:07,00:42:10,"- When you start, you do realize, yeah, this is mad."
00:42:10,00:42:11,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:42:11,00:42:12,"- Just another backstory,"
00:42:12,00:42:16,"and another World War II related backstory, Donald Duck."
00:42:16,00:42:19,"There's a theory about him that I quite like, so basically."
00:42:19,00:42:22,- Is there anything to do with this cock-screw-shaped penis?
00:42:22,00:42:24,(both laughing)
00:42:24,00:42:25,Like the old ducks are.
00:42:25,00:42:27,"- I think you can probably make it to do with that,"
00:42:27,00:42:29,I believe in you.
00:42:29,00:42:31,"But before World War II, Donald Duck existed,"
00:42:31,00:42:32,"obviously as part of the Disney franchise,"
00:42:32,00:42:34,"lots of shorts with him,"
00:42:34,00:42:38,"but he was quite a light-hearted, fun-loving duck."
00:42:38,00:42:41,"- Can I just quickly say, lots of shorts, but no trousers."
00:42:41,00:42:42,- Very good. - Thank you.
00:42:42,00:42:44,- Thank you for that.
00:42:44,00:42:48,"So as we know now, Donald Duck, bad temper, right?"
00:42:48,00:42:49,"That's what he's famous for,"
00:42:49,00:42:51,he's always shouting at his nephews.
00:42:51,00:42:52,He's very...
00:42:52,00:42:54,(mimicking duck noises)
00:42:54,00:42:56,"- That's uncanny change, that's a good impression."
00:42:56,00:42:58,"- Really good, yeah."
00:42:58,00:42:59,- I didn't know you could do that.
00:42:59,00:43:00,- It's not a good tempered noise.
00:43:00,00:43:02,It's not a happy noise.
00:43:02,00:43:05,"So he changed, and the theory is that he,"
00:43:05,00:43:06,it was the war that changed him
00:43:06,00:43:11,because he is the only character in the Disney franchise
00:43:11,00:43:12,who actually saw active service.
00:43:12,00:43:13,- Stop it!
00:43:13,00:43:14,(laughing)
00:43:14,00:43:16,- He was on the beaches at Normandy.
00:43:16,00:43:17,He only wanted a piece of bread.
00:43:17,00:43:18,(laughing)
00:43:18,00:43:20,What do you mean he saw active service?
00:43:20,00:43:21,- He saw all those cartoons.
00:43:21,00:43:23,- You know all the propaganda cartoons
00:43:23,00:43:24,that Disney released during the war?
00:43:24,00:43:26,Loads and loads of propaganda cartoons.
00:43:26,00:43:28,"So all the characters featured in these,"
00:43:28,00:43:30,but they didn't go actually into battle
00:43:30,00:43:32,"except Donald Duck, who did."
00:43:32,00:43:34,- In which theatre?
00:43:34,00:43:35,- What do you mean?
00:43:35,00:43:37,- In which theatre of the war did he fight?
00:43:37,00:43:38,"- He, the Pacific."
00:43:38,00:43:39,"- Sorry, I didn't say that."
00:43:39,00:43:41,- I actually think it might have been the Pacific.
00:43:41,00:43:42,"- Well, he is a duck."
00:43:42,00:43:45,He would make sense for him to be in the water.
00:43:45,00:43:45,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:45,00:43:48,"He should be, maybe, if he's in any of the services."
00:43:48,00:43:49,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:49,00:43:51,"- But I can't remember to be fair,"
00:43:51,00:43:53,"but he's seen serving, shown serving in the US military"
00:43:53,00:43:55,"in one of the propaganda films,"
00:43:55,00:43:57,fighting an air battle against the Nazis.
00:43:57,00:43:58,"- Oh, an air battle?"
00:43:58,00:44:00,"- Well, he is a duck after all."
00:44:00,00:44:01,(laughing)
00:44:01,00:44:03,Makes sense that he should be in the air floss.
00:44:03,00:44:04,- He's the perfect weapon.
00:44:04,00:44:05,(laughing)
00:44:05,00:44:06,- He doesn't even need a plane.
00:44:06,00:44:07,"- No, wow."
00:44:07,00:44:09,"And you're saying that he's got PTSD, effectively."
00:44:09,00:44:11,"- Well, straight after the World War II,"
00:44:11,00:44:12,his temper got worse.
00:44:12,00:44:14,He became very sensitive to loud noises.
00:44:14,00:44:16,"You know, if his nephews make a racket,"
00:44:16,00:44:18,"he gets upset, and that's the idea."
00:44:18,00:44:20,"And actually, in a recent duck tales,"
00:44:20,00:44:22,he had to have anger management courses.
00:44:22,00:44:23,- Wow.
00:44:23,00:44:24,- So that's the theory.
00:44:24,00:44:25,"He's got PTSD from the war,"
00:44:25,00:44:26,"and all the evidence is there, I think."
00:44:26,00:44:29,"- Whenever anyone was shooting, they would go, ""Duck!"""
00:44:29,00:44:31,(laughing)
00:44:31,00:44:34,(upbeat music)
00:44:36,00:44:39,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:44:39,00:44:40,and that is Andy.
00:44:40,00:44:43,- My fact is that every barge firm on the River Thames
00:44:43,00:44:45,used to have its own signature whistle.
00:44:45,00:44:47,- Oh my God.
00:44:47,00:44:48,(laughing)
00:44:48,00:44:50,"- Oh, that's very cool."
00:44:50,00:44:51,- Yeah.
00:44:51,00:44:52,"- This fact, Andy, I reckon,"
00:44:52,00:44:55,"if you put all of your facts into an AI,"
00:44:55,00:44:56,(laughing)
00:44:56,00:44:58,this is what they might come up with.
00:44:58,00:45:02,"- London whistling and a means of transport,"
00:45:02,00:45:04,"this is not very popular anymore, yep."
00:45:04,00:45:06,"- Yeah, seemingly dull."
00:45:06,00:45:08,- But really interesting when you get into it.
00:45:08,00:45:09,"- Well, let's find out."
00:45:09,00:45:11,"- Yeah, exactly, you'd be the judge at home."
00:45:11,00:45:13,"- So anyway, this was on a British library blog post"
00:45:13,00:45:14,"about the decline of whistling,"
00:45:14,00:45:17,"which is absolutely meat and drink to me, obviously."
00:45:17,00:45:18,And it's about Lighterman.
00:45:18,00:45:22,"Lighterman were the men, almost exclusively,"
00:45:22,00:45:24,"who steered barges to their destinations,"
00:45:24,00:45:26,and barges are basically flat-bottom boats
00:45:26,00:45:28,that were used to transport lots of cargo.
00:45:28,00:45:30,"So you might dock your ship in the river,"
00:45:30,00:45:31,"'cause there isn't a proper dock,"
00:45:31,00:45:33,"you just drop it in the middle of the river,"
00:45:33,00:45:34,"and then you have to unload it,"
00:45:34,00:45:37,"and the barges are the things that go back and forth,"
00:45:37,00:45:38,emptying them out or loading them up.
00:45:38,00:45:39,"And there were different barge firms,"
00:45:39,00:45:42,"and every barge firm had its own whistle,"
00:45:42,00:45:44,and it was so you could identify yourself at night.
00:45:44,00:45:45,There we go.
00:45:45,00:45:46,- Who's was that?
00:45:46,00:45:48,"- Yeah, that's the sexiest of all the barge firms."
00:45:48,00:45:50,James obviously doesn't see any difference
00:45:50,00:45:51,between sexiness and barge firms.
00:45:51,00:45:52,"- To me, barges are all the same."
00:45:52,00:45:54,(laughing)
00:45:54,00:45:57,"- Yeah, so barges, barges are great."
00:45:57,00:45:59,"The apprenticeship used to be five years long,"
00:45:59,00:46:01,just for the Thames.
00:46:01,00:46:02,"- Oh, Anna's been on a barge."
00:46:02,00:46:04,"You've looked after a barge, haven't you?"
00:46:04,00:46:05,"- Yeah, well, a canal boat,"
00:46:05,00:46:07,"so not one of the big Thames barges,"
00:46:07,00:46:08,which you had to sail.
00:46:08,00:46:09,"- Oh, narrow. - Must be the same."
00:46:09,00:46:12,"- No, James, please."
00:46:12,00:46:13,We're gonna get deeply into the difference
00:46:13,00:46:15,"between a narrow boat, a barge, all of it."
00:46:15,00:46:16,(laughing)
00:46:16,00:46:18,"- But the apprenticeships lasted for so long,"
00:46:18,00:46:19,didn't they?
00:46:19,00:46:23,"So they were introduced, I think, in 1555,"
00:46:23,00:46:26,and that was when Parliament established
00:46:26,00:46:27,"the company of Waterman and Lightman,"
00:46:27,00:46:30,"because they needed to regulate the industry,"
00:46:30,00:46:35,and I think it only stopped maybe 500 years later.
00:46:35,00:46:37,"- I think it was 2007, the government suggested."
00:46:37,00:46:39,Maybe we don't need to spend five years learning.
00:46:39,00:46:42,"- More so more than 500 years, exactly."
00:46:42,00:46:43,"I mean, it is tough, but come on."
00:46:43,00:46:46,"Also, there are no working barges on the Thames anymore,"
00:46:46,00:46:48,so it does seem quite weird to be doing that.
00:46:48,00:46:49,- I think it's a good thing
00:46:49,00:46:52,that we stopped people learning how to barge
00:46:52,00:46:55,and getting them to do maths instead these days.
00:46:55,00:46:57,(laughing)
00:46:57,00:47:00,"- Well, it takes just two years of training now"
00:47:00,00:47:02,"and six months of local knowledge training, which is--"
00:47:02,00:47:04,- But then there are people just trashing barges
00:47:04,00:47:05,into each other and--
00:47:05,00:47:07,"- Yeah, it's woefully inadequate, it's ridiculous."
00:47:07,00:47:09,- We've seen the Thames here.
00:47:09,00:47:11,"- So you're saying there's no barges these days,"
00:47:11,00:47:12,but they're clearly barged.
00:47:12,00:47:15,"- Well, there are barges for other purposes,"
00:47:15,00:47:16,"so it's not really for freight anymore,"
00:47:16,00:47:21,"it's for tourism, or for taking restaurant barges,"
00:47:21,00:47:23,or I don't think there are any that are having
00:47:23,00:47:26,iron deposited from Europe and carrying them up.
00:47:26,00:47:27,"- There were two, right?"
00:47:27,00:47:28,"- You had the Lighterman,"
00:47:28,00:47:31,"which is carrying all those goods back and forth,"
00:47:31,00:47:32,"but then you had the Waterman,"
00:47:32,00:47:35,"who were the people that carried people across,"
00:47:35,00:47:37,"which was a massively important thing back in the day,"
00:47:37,00:47:40,because getting across from the south side of London
00:47:40,00:47:43,to the north was an incredibly hard thing sometimes.
00:47:43,00:47:44,- Or the other way.
00:47:44,00:47:46,"- Or the other way, even if you, why would you go south?"
00:47:46,00:47:47,(laughing)
00:47:47,00:47:48,- Good point.
00:47:48,00:47:49,(laughing)
00:47:49,00:47:50,- I live south.
00:47:50,00:47:51,(laughing)
00:47:51,00:47:53,"Yeah, so people like Peeps write about it,"
00:47:53,00:47:56,"saying it was the quickest way to get across,"
00:47:56,00:47:59,because often the clogging on the bridges
00:47:59,00:47:59,"would be so great, it was just--"
00:47:59,00:48:02,"- What you say bridges was bridge, wasn't it?"
00:48:02,00:48:05,"- Bridge, London Bridge, was the only one east of Kingston,"
00:48:05,00:48:07,"which is a lot of river with one bridge across it,"
00:48:07,00:48:08,so they were massively important.
00:48:08,00:48:11,"And get this, I love this, so loads of their trade"
00:48:11,00:48:14,"came from transporting people to the theater,"
00:48:14,00:48:16,"so that was why you would go to the South Bank,"
00:48:16,00:48:17,"it's 'cause it was where all the theaters were,"
00:48:17,00:48:20,so that was a huge bit of trade for the Waterman.
00:48:20,00:48:22,"And then when Covent Garden set up,"
00:48:22,00:48:24,"where we're recording this podcast,"
00:48:24,00:48:26,"their trade suffered massively,"
00:48:26,00:48:28,"'cause there was suddenly theaters north of the river,"
00:48:28,00:48:29,and no one had to cross the river
00:48:29,00:48:31,anymore to go and see a show.
00:48:31,00:48:34,"- But you could still get carried down the river, couldn't you?"
00:48:34,00:48:36,If you lived in Chelsea and you had to get to Covent Garden.
00:48:36,00:48:37,"- Oh yeah, that's true,"
00:48:37,00:48:39,although there were other means of getting
00:48:39,00:48:41,from Chelsea to Covent Garden.
00:48:41,00:48:44,"So they were so angry about the loss of their trade,"
00:48:44,00:48:47,"and they campaigned so much to Charles I,"
00:48:47,00:48:49,"when he was king, that in 1635,"
00:48:49,00:48:52,"he banned taxi cabs in the city,"
00:48:52,00:48:55,unless they were traveling three miles out of the city.
00:48:55,00:48:57,"- No way, to keep the barges in business."
00:48:57,00:48:59,- Keep the barges happy.
00:48:59,00:49:01,- I try to find any notable lighter men.
00:49:01,00:49:04,"So the closest I found, well, Danny Dyer,"
00:49:04,00:49:07,"who's a quite famous character,"
00:49:07,00:49:09,"his family, he came from a long line of lighter men."
00:49:09,00:49:11,"- Really, is that right?"
00:49:11,00:49:12,"- That's interesting, that seems classic."
00:49:12,00:49:14,- But one that I thought was a bit relevant to us
00:49:14,00:49:18,"was I found that a comedian came from a long line of lighter men,"
00:49:18,00:49:22,and it was a comedian who was called Malcolm Hardy.
00:49:22,00:49:25,And during the boom of alternative comedy
00:49:25,00:49:28,"in London, particularly, he was a great voice,"
00:49:28,00:49:29,"and he used to open clubs,"
00:49:29,00:49:31,and they were known as dangerous clubs
00:49:31,00:49:33,"because you would have heckles from the audience,"
00:49:33,00:49:35,he would heckle the act coming.
00:49:35,00:49:37,"You know, I don't know about the next act,"
00:49:37,00:49:38,"they might be a bit shit, I think they are."
00:49:38,00:49:39,"Please welcome to the stage, you know,"
00:49:39,00:49:41,and then bring you down to the stage.
00:49:41,00:49:42,(laughing)
00:49:42,00:49:44,"- Cheers, Malcolm, thank you."
00:49:44,00:49:46,"- So he was an amazing character,"
00:49:46,00:49:48,"and he wasn't a lightsman himself,"
00:49:48,00:49:49,but he did live on the Thames.
00:49:49,00:49:51,"He had a boat that he lived on,"
00:49:51,00:49:53,"and sadly, quite a few years ago,"
00:49:53,00:49:55,he fell into the Thames and died.
00:49:55,00:49:58,But what is interesting about Malcolm Hardy
00:49:58,00:49:59,"is he's very relevant to us,"
00:49:59,00:50:01,"and even the listeners of this show,"
00:50:01,00:50:05,"because he opened up a club in Greenwich called Up the Creek,"
00:50:05,00:50:08,"which is where we do all of our live shows often in London,"
00:50:08,00:50:10,and that is the Malcolm Hardy Club.
00:50:10,00:50:13,- Have you heard of the Trojan barge?
00:50:13,00:50:14,- No. - No.
00:50:14,00:50:18,"- So this was during the 80 years war,"
00:50:18,00:50:20,"and the Anglo-Spanish war,"
00:50:20,00:50:22,"'cause they kind of coincided with each other,"
00:50:22,00:50:25,"and it was the city of Braida,"
00:50:25,00:50:29,"and the Dutch and the English were trying to capture it,"
00:50:29,00:50:32,and the way they did it was with a Trojan barge.
00:50:32,00:50:36,"There was a canal or a small, like a shallow river"
00:50:36,00:50:38,"that went into the city,"
00:50:38,00:50:40,"and they had a barge with a load of peat in it,"
00:50:40,00:50:42,a load of moss. - Nice.
00:50:42,00:50:45,"- One for you, and they all hid underneath the peat,"
00:50:45,00:50:46,"and they got into the city,"
00:50:46,00:50:49,and then jumped out and then took the city.
00:50:49,00:50:49,- That's brilliant.
00:50:49,00:50:53,- And it was kind of like one of the turning points of that war.
00:50:53,00:50:54,- Really? - Yeah.
00:50:54,00:50:56,"- So wait, when you say that barge with a load of peat,"
00:50:56,00:50:58,they didn't put peat on top of the barge and disguise it.
00:50:58,00:50:59,"They did, they disguised the barge."
00:50:59,00:51:01,"- They hid underneath, no, no, the barge,"
00:51:01,00:51:03,everyone knew it was a barge.
00:51:03,00:51:05,"Everyone knew it was a barge full of peat,"
00:51:05,00:51:08,but what they didn't know is that there were soldiers
00:51:08,00:51:10,in between the barge and the peat.
00:51:10,00:51:11,- That's incredible.
00:51:11,00:51:14,- And the soldiers used the peat to kind of hide themselves
00:51:14,00:51:15,"even once they got off the barge,"
00:51:15,00:51:19,so the people of Braida would be attacked by moss men.
00:51:19,00:51:22,- This is like the moving forest in my birth base.
00:51:22,00:51:24,"- Yes, it's been attacked by a bunch of peat."
00:51:24,00:51:25,- That's very tall.
00:51:25,00:51:26,- That is so cool.
00:51:26,00:51:29,But did they have to snorkel through the peat?
00:51:29,00:51:31,"'Cause peat, I think, was being very heavy, very dark."
00:51:31,00:51:34,"If you're lying with peat, basically buried under peat,"
00:51:34,00:51:34,that's not good for you.
00:51:34,00:51:36,- Probably the amount of peat above them
00:51:36,00:51:38,wasn't so much that they all suffocated.
00:51:38,00:51:40,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I see that."
00:51:40,00:51:42,"- Yeah, I was just imagining like a little flat hat"
00:51:42,00:51:43,that you're kind of wearing.
00:51:43,00:51:45,"- Yeah, but you can't have too little peat"
00:51:45,00:51:46,'cause otherwise they'll see.
00:51:46,00:51:48,"Wait, isn't there something under that peat?"
00:51:48,00:51:50,- Probably a folding locks amount of peat that they used.
00:51:50,00:51:51,"And that was the amount that they used, I think."
00:51:51,00:51:52,- Brilliant.
00:51:52,00:51:53,"Well, that's military planning for you."
00:51:53,00:51:54,"That's your guess, Chris."
00:51:54,00:51:58,- They actually did do a previous run
00:51:58,00:51:59,with another peat barge.
00:51:59,00:52:02,"So yeah, they did it with just like one or two soldiers"
00:52:02,00:52:03,to see if it was gonna work.
00:52:03,00:52:04,And it did work.
00:52:04,00:52:05,And then the next time they did it properly.
00:52:05,00:52:06,- That's so funny.
00:52:06,00:52:07,What do those soldiers then do once they're in the city?
00:52:07,00:52:09,But there are only two of them.
00:52:09,00:52:11,"Peat, get your peat!"
00:52:11,00:52:13,Anyone want some peat?
00:52:13,00:52:14,Fellow Braida people.
00:52:14,00:52:17,- I don't have any frame of reference
00:52:17,00:52:18,to the '80 Years War.
00:52:18,00:52:23,"- No, and nor do I in this short paragraph that I've written."
00:52:23,00:52:24,"But yeah, it was basically the,"
00:52:24,00:52:27,"I think it was just, I'm gonna be wrong,"
00:52:27,00:52:29,but I think it was just before the Glorious Revolution.
00:52:29,00:52:31,So I think it was whenever that was.
00:52:31,00:52:32,"- '60, '88."
00:52:32,00:52:32,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:52:32,00:52:35,- It's one of those mid-European mid-century wars.
00:52:35,00:52:36,"- Yeah, they all merged."
00:52:36,00:52:38,"- The '80 Years War, the Hundred Years War,"
00:52:38,00:52:40,the '27 Years War.
00:52:40,00:52:42,"- They weren't very creative with the names, were they?"
00:52:42,00:52:44,"- I've got one more barge, I think, for you."
00:52:44,00:52:45,- Yeah.
00:52:45,00:52:46,- This is actually sent in by a listener.
00:52:46,00:52:49,This is sent in by Hannah Watson a while ago.
00:52:49,00:52:51,"In 2004, there was a sightseeing barge trip"
00:52:51,00:52:54,"happening in Texas, right, on a lake called Lake Travis."
00:52:54,00:52:55,There were 60 people on board.
00:52:55,00:52:57,"Unfortunately, the barge then passed a place"
