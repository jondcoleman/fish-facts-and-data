00:00:14,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another Working from Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:19,00:00:24,a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin"
00:00:28,00:00:32,and Anatojinsky and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our
00:00:32,00:00:37,four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:37,00:00:43,"Starting with fact number one, that's my fact. My fact this week is before hermit crabs,"
00:00:43,00:00:51,"we're called hermit crabs, there was a hermit called Crab. This is a man called Roger Crab,"
00:00:51,00:00:57,"who his dates were 1621 to 1680 and he was an English soldier, he was a habidasher,"
00:00:57,00:01:04,"he was a herbal doctor, an author and a hermit and he predates the naming of hermit crabs."
00:01:04,00:01:09,"So did he live in a kind of shell, which he would periodically exchange for a very slightly"
00:01:09,00:01:15,"larger shell? Are hermit crabs named after him? Well, hermit crabs I believe are named after"
00:01:15,00:01:19,hermits generally but I don't think he was such a famous hermit that he sort of defined the whole
00:01:19,00:01:25,"species. He was semi-famous, right? Isn't there a thought that he was a hatter and there's a"
00:01:25,00:01:29,"thought that Lewis Carroll's mad hatter was maybe based on him because he was also, it seems,"
00:01:29,00:01:34,"quite mad. Yeah, I couldn't find anything that sort of truly links that other than people saying"
00:01:34,00:01:37,"it was thought. Did you get anywhere with that? No, like people were writing about him a lot in"
00:01:37,00:01:42,"the 19th century when Lewis Carroll was also writing, you know, people would reflect back on"
00:01:42,00:01:47,"his life, there were quite a lot of sources, so maybe he was your famous mad hatter. But he wasn't,"
00:01:47,00:01:53,"was he, when was he alive? He was 1600s. Oh, okay, cool. They just talked about him a lot."
00:01:53,00:01:58,"Hermit crabs were named in the 1700s, so he predates them only just, but he gets there."
00:01:58,00:02:03,"It's sad, isn't it, in a way, that, you know, he never knew that those animals,"
00:02:03,00:02:07,"but if he was a really famous hermit, like you guys are saying, then hermit crabs might"
00:02:07,00:02:12,"have been based on him, you know? Yeah. It's possible. Yeah. And he had sort of a sad life,"
00:02:12,00:02:16,"even though I guess he claimed to like it. Didn't he, by the end of his life, he was all about"
00:02:16,00:02:22,"denying himself sort of all pleasures. Yes. And he didn't, he limit himself to potatoes and carrots,"
00:02:22,00:02:26,"and then he sort of quit that and just lived off bran and turnip leaves, and then he quit that."
00:02:26,00:02:30,"And by the end of his life, apparently he was living off dock leaves and grass. Yeah,"
00:02:30,00:02:36,"he was just eating grass at the end. I don't know if directly mouth to ground, or if he turned it"
00:02:36,00:02:41,"into a sort of picked it and put it in a bowl. Anna, you wrote something last week, which I read,"
00:02:41,00:02:45,"which says that you can't eat grass. Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? So I'm not quite sure how"
00:02:45,00:02:51,"he was surviving, maybe he had a cow's stomach implanted into his own body. Because what you need"
00:02:51,00:02:55,"is like cows have the right bacteria in their stomachs, which means that they can break down"
00:02:55,00:03:00,"the cellulose and get to the good stuff inside the grass, but we don't have it in our stomach. So,"
00:03:00,00:03:03,"unless he's licked a few cows to get the bacteria, I don't know how he's, I mean,"
00:03:03,00:03:09,maybe he died almost immediately after deciding to eat only grass. It is the last thing on his menu
00:03:09,00:03:13,"of diet changes. So I think we can assume it might have played a part in that. No, he was,"
00:03:13,00:03:18,"yeah, and he was accused of witchcraft in his lifetime as well, because he used to make prophecies."
00:03:18,00:03:24,"I couldn't actually find any of his prophecies, but... I bet I'll die really soon after adopting"
00:03:24,00:03:32,"this brand new diet. But yeah, so good to know he existed. I'd never heard of Roger Crab before."
00:03:32,00:03:37,"He seems like a proper hermit too. He seems like an in it for life hermit, because we briefly"
00:03:37,00:03:42,mentioned before that you used to be able to kind of hire a hermit for your garden if you're a land
00:03:42,00:03:46,"owner. Yes. Which is more, they're more in it for the money. There's a guy who's written,"
00:03:46,00:03:50,"Gordon Campbell is his name, he's written a book, which has got one of the best book titles ever."
00:03:50,00:03:57,It's called The Hermit in the Garden from Imperial Rome to Ornamental Gnome. And he tracked down a
00:03:57,00:04:02,"load of newspaper adverts, which were kind of hiring hermits or advertising for hermits."
00:04:02,00:04:08,So some said you get £50 a year for life as long as you live underground for the rest of your life
00:04:08,00:04:14,and no one sees you. That's one offer. And I think you could ring a bell and a servant would bring
00:04:14,00:04:17,"you stuff, but you weren't allowed to chat to anyone and you had to grow your hair and your"
00:04:17,00:04:21,"fingernails. So it's really unclear what the land owner gets out of this, but someone took"
00:04:21,00:04:25,"that for four years and stuck it out for that long. But there are so few shops underground,"
00:04:25,00:04:30,it's hard to work out what you'd spend your £50 on. I think Amazon would deliver to your underground
00:04:30,00:04:35,place. That's a good point. There was one guy called Charles Hamilton who offered a job on his
00:04:35,00:04:40,"Surrey estate, which was £700 in exchange for seven years of hermiting. So it's like a fixed-term"
00:04:40,00:04:46,contract. And the successful applicant took the job and then was founded a local pub three weeks
00:04:46,00:04:55,into the hermit shop. Wow. Yeah. He lasted longer than I would. I think he was also in that book.
00:04:55,00:05:00,"He talked about Peter the Great's hermitage, which was very much more on the side of not a proper"
00:05:00,00:05:07,"hermitage. I've been to the hermitage in St. Petersburg and if a hermit lived there, he was"
00:05:07,00:05:13,"living at large. Yeah. So actually, that was an even bigger upgrade compared to Peter the Great's"
00:05:13,00:05:17,"original one. But he originally decided to build a hermitage in his garden, which was sort of a"
00:05:17,00:05:22,"retreat from matters of state. And this was in the 1700s when it was quite popular,"
00:05:22,00:05:28,the hermit lifestyle. And this was described as being a hermitage and that it had no servant.
00:05:28,00:05:36,So you were really living like a feral human. And it was two floors and the dining room was on
00:05:36,00:05:40,the upper floor and the kitchen was on the lower floor. And there were no stairs going from the
00:05:40,00:05:46,"lower floor to the upper floor. So the guests, when they arrived, had to be hoisted on chair lift."
00:05:46,00:05:50,"So on their individual chairs, hoisted up onto the upper floor to eat. And then when the table was"
00:05:50,00:05:56,"loaded with food, it would be descended through the floor onto the ground floor, loaded up with food,"
00:05:56,00:06:00,and then hoisted up onto the upper floor again. Sounds so cool.
00:06:00,00:06:04,Who's doing the hoisting if there are no servants? Because I thought I'd read that there were just
00:06:04,00:06:09,"no servants on the first floor. Like, obviously, there'll be loads of servants doing all the"
00:06:09,00:06:17,"pulling and cooking. Yeah. That's not really living an ascetic life, is it? If, you know,"
00:06:17,00:06:24,"you only have servants on one of your floors. Come on, he's making an effort. Fair enough."
00:06:25,00:06:30,"There are more modern hermits, aren't there? There was a guy in America called Billy Barr who"
00:06:30,00:06:37,lived in the Rocky Mountains. And he's really cool because he got bored quite soon into being a hermit
00:06:37,00:06:43,"or living on his own, let's say. And so he decided to kind of make a diary. And he started measuring"
00:06:43,00:06:48,the snow levels and all the animal tracks and when the first birdsong would be every year.
00:06:48,00:06:54,"And he did it for 44 years. And now his notes can be used to measure climate change,"
00:06:54,00:06:59,"which I think is really cool. They're actually using his diary to say, ""Ah, wait a minute. In"
00:06:59,00:07:02,"1970 something, the birds sang on this date and now they're singing on this date."""
00:07:02,00:07:08,Are there any awkward entries in the diary which they have to just skip over where he--
00:07:08,00:07:15,"Wow. In 1976, he started masturbating in June, but in 1970-80, he started masturbating in May."
00:07:15,00:07:18,What does this tell us about the temperature in the Rocky Mountains?
00:07:21,00:07:28,"I found a pro hermit in the UK who seems to be operating in the UK, or definitely he's done"
00:07:28,00:07:34,stints here. So he's an Indian artist called Ansuman Biswas. And he was recruited in 2002
00:07:34,00:07:40,"by Staffordshire Council to live for a weekend, a weekend of being a hermit in place."
00:07:40,00:07:44,"That's so ridiculous. Well, we've all been in our house for three months."
00:07:47,00:07:52,"So that was 2002. He was paid 600 quid to live in a grotto for a weekend, not bad."
00:07:52,00:07:58,"Then in 2009, there's a news report of Manchester Museum hiring a hermit, guess who it is? It's"
00:07:58,00:08:05,"Indian artist Ansuman Biswas again. And then he's done another one. Recently, this year,"
00:08:05,00:08:10,he was going to do the Horniman Museum in South London and live there. He was going to be locked
00:08:10,00:08:14,"in their clock tower. But unfortunately, due to everyone staying at home, he was not allowed"
00:08:14,00:08:22,"to become a hermit. That's so amazing. So when lockdown finishes, he gets to go and lock down"
00:08:22,00:08:28,"again. Really? Yeah, I wonder if hermits have generally been furloughed across the board."
00:08:28,00:08:36,"Apparently, I was reading a Victorian source reflecting back on hermits throughout time,"
00:08:36,00:08:40,and it was such a religious thing. And all religions seem to have this tradition about
00:08:40,00:08:45,self-denying. And this source was saying that basically the women did it properly and the men
00:08:45,00:08:51,didn't really do it. So it said that basically there's a division between hermits proper and
00:08:51,00:08:57,"recluses. And hermits proper tend to see quite a lot of people have guests go out into the world,"
00:08:57,00:09:01,and then recluses are the ones that don't see anyone. And it said it was basically done down
00:09:01,00:09:06,"gender lines. So the recluses would be women and they would see nobody. But then actually,"
00:09:06,00:09:11,"I think because anchoresses were the recluses, essentially, and they were meant to be hermits."
00:09:11,00:09:16,"Again, Julian of Norwich, a very, very famous example, and they essentially were Agneons,"
00:09:16,00:09:21,"I think, which so they would deliberately have their hermitages built in the middle of quite a"
00:09:21,00:09:26,busy thoroughfare. Like in the Trafford Centre or something. Yeah. And then you would just go
00:09:26,00:09:32,"and sit next to her and say, ""Oh, I'm feeling a bit sad today. I've been doing some sins."""
00:09:33,00:09:37,"And then she'd help you. She'd say, ""Well, at least you don't live in a box in the Trafford"
00:09:37,00:09:42,"Centre with anyone allowed to come up to you anytime."" My friend Jenny lived in a box in"
00:09:42,00:09:46,"the Trafford Centre for a little while. Did she? Yeah, Jenny Ryan actually from the chase."
00:09:46,00:09:50,"No way. Yeah, she did. I don't know if that's on record. I suppose it must be."
00:09:50,00:09:55,What do you mean she... I don't fully know what this box is. Is it just a cardboard box?
00:09:55,00:09:57,Do you remember David Blaine? Yeah.
00:09:57,00:10:02,"He lived in a box for a while. Well, I think this was pre-Blaine. She was in a competition"
00:10:02,00:10:06,where she had to go and sit in a box for as long as possible in the Trafford Centre.
00:10:06,00:10:09,"Wow, cool. I think this is right. It might be the Arndale Centre. But the basics are..."
00:10:09,00:10:12,The basics of the story are true.
00:10:12,00:10:16,Wow. So did you visit her in the box and tell her your problems?
00:10:16,00:10:20,It was a long time ago. I don't think so. I think I was at university.
00:10:20,00:10:24,You can't remember if you visited your friend in a box in a mall.
00:10:24,00:10:31,The fact that I can't remember it suggests I didn't. But it also suggests that I'm a terrible
00:10:31,00:10:37,friend. So I don't know which way to go. There was also... So the more sort of social hermits
00:10:37,00:10:42,"we mentioned a long time ago on the podcast, the stylites, which I find so interesting."
00:10:42,00:10:49,"The idea this was during the Byzantine Empire, you would have... So we're talking sort of the year"
00:10:49,00:10:59,432. It would be just... Byzantine Empire. So around 432.
00:10:59,00:11:04,"Oh, a magnificent but very short-lived empire. It's like a weekend hermitage, that empire."
00:11:04,00:11:15,So the idea of this was it was gigantic poles in the city centres and people would climb up them
00:11:15,00:11:18,and they would become hermits up there and just stay there for their lifetime. And
00:11:18,00:11:22,they would like the pulley systems. It would send up food to them and they would stand and preach.
00:11:22,00:11:27,"So they were hermits, but they were also giving out sort of religious advice the whole time."
00:11:27,00:11:30,"It would be their soapboxes, it were."
00:11:30,00:11:32,It feels a bit unfair. Have you heard of Mary of Egypt?
00:11:32,00:11:39,No. She was a very early hermit and she isolated herself to atone for her insatiable carnal appetites.
00:11:39,00:11:42,Which just seemed to be she liked having sex with people.
00:11:42,00:11:45,"Oh wait, did she also step on top of a massive pole?"
00:11:45,00:11:53,"But all the stories about her say she wasn't even charging money to have sex with people,"
00:11:53,00:11:55,as if that was the worst element of the story.
00:11:55,00:12:02,"But she ended up still naked, didn't she? At the end, didn't someone stumble upon her in the desert?"
00:12:02,00:12:06,"And she was unclothed. So I'm not saying she wasn't sticking to her vows, but..."
00:12:06,00:12:07,It's very hot in the desert.
00:12:07,00:12:09,It was hot.
00:12:09,00:12:15,Couple of things on hermit crabs. So hermit crabs are really great.
00:12:15,00:12:22,There we go. That's all we got. No. Do you know how old the oldest pet hermit crab known
00:12:22,00:12:26,is? God. I'd say about 35.
00:12:26,00:12:28,That's good. Dan?
00:12:28,00:12:29,15 days.
00:12:29,00:12:33,15 days. Okay. I'm underegging it this time.
00:12:33,00:12:37,I'm in an Argo middle. So 13 years old.
00:12:37,00:12:44,"James is closest. It's 42. It was 42 last year. And it's... He lives at a retirement home,"
00:12:44,00:12:45,which is very nice.
00:12:45,00:12:45,Oh yeah.
00:12:45,00:12:50,Because his owner also lives at a retirement home and it's called the Shell Point Retirement
00:12:50,00:12:54,"Community. He's hoping to move into a bigger retirement home next year, isn't he?"
00:12:54,00:13:01,"But they do. They upgrade their homes, don't they? It's the most incredible thing about them."
00:13:01,00:13:06,And the way that they do it is... It makes our property ladder look very simple.
00:13:06,00:13:11,"So a hermit crab will have its shell on its back, its house on its arse."
00:13:11,00:13:15,And then its arse starts getting bigger and its house becomes too small for it.
00:13:15,00:13:20,"And so it'll find another shell that's a bit bigger, but often this shell will be too big."
00:13:20,00:13:24,"It's like a mansion. And so then they'll have to wait for another hermit crab to come along,"
00:13:24,00:13:28,that's sort of a different size. And then enough hermit crabs have to come along
00:13:28,00:13:33,in all different sizes that they can line up from smallest to largest.
00:13:33,00:13:36,"And then the largest one can move into the vacant,"
00:13:36,00:13:40,hugest shell. And everyone else can move up one shell.
00:13:40,00:13:41,That's amazing.
00:13:41,00:13:45,It's insane. How are they organizing it? It doesn't make any sense.
00:13:45,00:13:49,"It's brilliant. It's so cool. And there are videos of it, right, online."
00:13:49,00:13:53,"People have to Google ""hermit crabs moving house"" and look at the videos because they're"
00:13:53,00:13:55,absolutely amazing. It's incredible.
00:13:55,00:13:59,But sometimes two chains kind of get to the same shell at the same time.
00:13:59,00:14:04,And then the two biggest hermit crabs have to have a fight with each other to see who's
00:14:04,00:14:09,going to get the big shell. And everyone in your queue is going to get a new house
00:14:09,00:14:11,if you win the fight. Do you know what I mean?
00:14:11,00:14:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:14:11,00:14:15,"And so all the little guys are watching these two big guys fighting thinking,"
00:14:15,00:14:20,"""I hope my guy wins."" But then sometimes they swap queues and go to it and see that one of"
00:14:20,00:14:24,the other guys is doing a bit better in the fight and kind of sneak over and join his team.
00:14:24,00:14:25,That is amazing.
00:14:25,00:14:27,Incredible. That is amazing.
00:14:27,00:14:36,"They also, there's cases of gangs of hermit crabs coming to steal a single hermit crab's shell."
00:14:36,00:14:41,So they nick it for their mate. And I read that that's the reason that they have extremely
00:14:41,00:14:46,long penises because if you're having sex as a hermit crab and you leave your shell to go have
00:14:46,00:14:52,"sex because of your smaller penis, then you're leaving your home open for burglary."
00:14:52,00:14:59,"So by having a very long penis, you can stay indoors at home, but send your penis out for sex."
00:14:59,00:15:00,I'll get through the letterbox.
00:15:00,00:15:01,Exactly.
00:15:01,00:15:08,"So if you're a shy hermit crab, you have more sperm than if you're a brave hermit crab."
00:15:09,00:15:13,Really? This was found out by scientists who startled hermit crabs.
00:15:13,00:15:19,"So they would take a crab from its tank, kind of scare it and then put it back."
00:15:19,00:15:23,And then the crab would go into its shell because it was scared.
00:15:23,00:15:27,And then they would measure how long it would take before he came back out again to see if
00:15:27,00:15:32,"everything was okay. And they compared that with the amount of sperm in their sperm metaphors,"
00:15:32,00:15:36,which is what they used to make. They have little bundles of sperm.
00:15:36,00:15:39,And they found that the ones who were shy have more sperm than the ones who are brave.
00:15:39,00:15:48,"Do they know why? Well, is it that what they said is that there are two different approaches."
00:15:48,00:15:52,"You can either have a live fast, die young approach where you just go out and do it or"
00:15:52,00:15:58,like the more successful ones have a stay safe and protect your giant sperm package approach.
00:15:58,00:16:05,Right. So it was the idea that they sort of know they've got this valuable package.
00:16:05,00:16:06,And they're really trying to preserve it.
00:16:06,00:16:10,"Yeah. But the ones who have got less good package of sperm,"
00:16:10,00:16:16,they have to go out and find the females. It has to be more outgoing.
00:16:16,00:16:21,So actually me staying in my room and reading throughout my university years was just because
00:16:21,00:16:24,I'm an exceptionally high quality male. Is that what we're saying?
00:16:24,00:16:28,Or that you were storing up a lot of sperm in the tank that other people were utilizing.
00:16:34,00:16:38,Okay. It is time for fact number two. And that is James.
00:16:38,00:16:46,Okay. My fact this week is that Magna Carta smells of newly pressed sheets with traces of old socks.
00:16:46,00:16:52,So this is the Institute of Digital Archaeology.
00:16:52,00:16:55,"And they're planning an exhibition called Sensational Books,"
00:16:55,00:17:00,which will be at the Bodleian in Oxford and at the New York Public Library.
00:17:00,00:17:05,And what they've done is they've taken a load of old books and they've taken the essence of
00:17:05,00:17:10,the smell from all of these books. And you're going to be able to go and smell what these old
00:17:10,00:17:15,books smell like basically. And what they do is they take the book and they put it in a sealed
00:17:15,00:17:21,chamber and they fire a load of air over it for 24 hours. And then they capture the particulates or
00:17:21,00:17:26,"the little kind of molecules from the book. And then they can take those filters,"
00:17:26,00:17:30,"they spin them around, spin them around, spin them around until they turn into like some kind of"
00:17:30,00:17:36,paste. And then that paste they can use to synthesize the odor. So they can work out
00:17:36,00:17:40,exactly what's in it and they can make new versions of it. But if you're one of the first
00:17:40,00:17:45,"people to go to the exhibition, you'll be able to get the actual smell that they found from the box."
00:17:45,00:17:49,"So it's one of those things that if you're in the first couple of people who go,"
00:17:49,00:17:52,"you're going to get the really good stuff. And if you go a few weeks after it's open,"
00:17:52,00:17:57,"then you're going to get something that smells exactly the same, but isn't the true Magna Carta"
00:17:57,00:18:00,"smell. Okay. Well, because they would have really created it based on those chemicals."
00:18:00,00:18:06,"So basically, we've invented the smell printing press 600 years after the actual printing press."
00:18:06,00:18:12,"Yeah, you could say that kind of. These face makes it look like you can't say that."
00:18:12,00:18:17,Are they going to release a Magna Carta scratch and sniff? Because that'd be awesome.
00:18:17,00:18:22,I think they might do that. I think I might have said this before that I went to a smell
00:18:22,00:18:26,"museum in Sunderland once and I got a book, which you could get all the smells of different"
00:18:26,00:18:30,things. And it was a scratch and sniff thing. And you could smell the sun and you could smell
00:18:30,00:18:35,like the death mask of Toots and Car Moon and stuff like that. Wow. That's what I'm suggesting.
00:18:35,00:18:38,"Okay. Yeah. Some of the better smells that are going to be in this exhibition,"
00:18:38,00:18:44,"CS Lewis's private collection smell is going to be, you can smell his cigars very slightly"
00:18:44,00:18:50,"in the background. That's incredible. Isn't that cool? And there's going to be books from Boston,"
00:18:50,00:18:54,which smell a bit like molasses. Because do you remember there was a big flood of molasses in
00:18:54,00:18:58,Boston where there's like sugar went down the street and I think killed a few people. But
00:18:58,00:19:04,"is it someone's diary writing about the molasses flood saying, oh no, it's coming in the door?"
00:19:04,00:19:09,I think it would probably be someone's library from the time which got covered in molasses.
00:19:09,00:19:14,But yeah. Wow. I hope that that hermit who recorded all the snow isn't going to have his diary
00:19:14,00:19:23,"done because it's going to be a heavy center semen. Okay. Can we talk about Magda Carter, please?"
00:19:23,00:19:28,"Yeah. We should say what it was, sort of like, what is this thing?"
00:19:28,00:19:35,"Basically, King John, we had a king who was spending loads of money on stupid things,"
00:19:35,00:19:39,like going battling in France and stuff like that. And then we had all the barons in Britain
00:19:39,00:19:45,"who owned all the land, but the king was basically really pissing them off quite a lot."
00:19:45,00:19:50,And he was making them give him money and he was doing nasty things to their families and stuff
00:19:50,00:19:55,"like that. And so they'd had enough and they were like, fuck this, we're going to get rid of the king."
00:19:55,00:19:59,"One time they tried to assassinate him. And then a few years later, they went down and they said,"
00:19:59,00:20:03,"look, we have had enough. And he said, okay, okay, okay, I'll make a load of new laws that"
00:20:03,00:20:09,"stop me from being an asshole. And they said, right, fine. And so they all agreed to all these"
00:20:09,00:20:16,"laws. And then a few weeks later, he went, only joking. Pranked you. I was crossing my fingers."
00:20:16,00:20:22,"Yeah. He contacted the Pope saying, I've been forced to sign this dreadful document. Can you"
00:20:22,00:20:28,"cancel it? And the Pope did so. He said, oh yeah, I'll issue a papal bull. And so that was 10 weeks"
00:20:28,00:20:32,after he signed it. I thought it was this huge founding document of English law and liberty.
00:20:32,00:20:35,"And it turns out it lasted 10 weeks. Well, it didn't because it became,"
00:20:35,00:20:39,it was reissued 10 years later and then it did stay on the statute books. But do you know what
00:20:39,00:20:44,he had to give the Pope in exchange for the Pope admitting to that? He had to give him
00:20:44,00:20:49,"England. And that has never been reneged on. So the way he got the Pope on site, the Pope was"
00:20:49,00:20:54,actually really pissed off with John because there was this absurd situation where King John wanted
00:20:54,00:20:59,"one Archbishop of Canterbury, the Barons wanted another. They thought, so the Pope picked a third"
00:20:59,00:21:03,"and then King John just hadn't let the third come into England. And the Pope would like,"
00:21:03,00:21:08,"you know, got really pissed off and banned England from doing any kind of mass or anything."
00:21:08,00:21:13,"So the Pope hated John. So John got him back on site by saying, I'll give you the whole of England"
00:21:13,00:21:20,as a papal fiefdom. And we'll pay sort of rent to hire it off you every year if you say that I
00:21:20,00:21:25,"don't need to stick to this Magna Carta. And formally, the papacy has never resigned its claim."
00:21:25,00:21:32,"So technically, it could come up to England and say, can I claim sort of a few centuries of rent"
00:21:32,00:21:40,off you please? That sounds classic King John. He sounds like he just got a lot of stuff wrong
00:21:40,00:21:45,"because he was never meant to be king, was he? He was seen as the worst of the brothers or the"
00:21:45,00:21:52,"sons of the previous King. Most famous of all, if you don't know King John, is he plays the lion"
00:21:52,00:21:57,"in the Robin Hood Disney animation? Justin Hood in your head, who we're talking about."
00:21:57,00:22:02,"And he had many brothers, one of who was Richard the Lionheart, and his father,"
00:22:02,00:22:08,"the King, gave them all bits of land. So Henry, his oldest son was given Normandy in England,"
00:22:08,00:22:13,"and Jeffrey was given Brittany. They all got given stuff, except for King John,"
00:22:13,00:22:18,"who was just given a nickname, which was Lackland, because he was given absolutely nothing."
00:22:18,00:22:23,"So he must have been such a prick as a young man for his father, the King, to be handing out"
00:22:23,00:22:26,"all this lovely land to people, and he says, I'll give you this, and I'll give you this,"
00:22:26,00:22:32,"and I'll give you this, and you're going to get the nickname Lackland. He must have been awful"
00:22:32,00:22:38,"as a young person as well. Or he was meant to be a priest or something like this,"
00:22:38,00:22:42,"but then the other three all died, didn't they? And slowly but surely, he got closer to the throne."
00:22:42,00:22:46,It really is very hard to find a revisionist historian who's willing to back John up.
00:22:47,00:22:52,"Most people will say, well, there's another side to this story, but he was basically a dickhead."
00:22:52,00:22:57,"Not that the Barons were the greatest guys ever, right? They just wanted power for themselves,"
00:22:57,00:23:00,"but I hadn't realized that the Barons, before Magna Carta was signed, and they were trying to"
00:23:00,00:23:07,"negotiate with John or overthrow him, took control of London. So while John was off fighting his"
00:23:07,00:23:12,"wars in France, the Barons marched into London, surrounded by walls, and just took over completely,"
00:23:12,00:23:16,"and he came back to find it ruled by Barons. And the way they'd got in, he said,"
00:23:16,00:23:20,how on earth did you get in? Because it's surrounded by these walls. It's meant to be defended.
00:23:20,00:23:26,And they said they just found a ladder lying up against the wall and all climbed over it.
00:23:26,00:23:30,"And I just find it so weird that to take control of a city, you could just leave a ladder,"
00:23:30,00:23:35,"a surreptitiously lying against the wall, and the whole army of Barons climbs over it."
00:23:35,00:23:36,That's so good. It's bizarre.
00:23:36,00:23:41,"But then after Magna Carta and after it was repealed, the French came along and took over"
00:23:41,00:23:45,"London, which you don't often read about in like in schools and stuff. But basically,"
00:23:45,00:23:50,there was a civil war straight afterwards between the King and the Barons. And the Barons were
00:23:50,00:23:56,"known as the Northerners, which I like. And the French came along and King Louis just came along"
00:23:56,00:24:02,"and went to London and was proclaimed King. Was proclaimed King. And then at the end of the war,"
00:24:02,00:24:08,"when he went back in the end, he signed a treaty saying, oh no, I wasn't King. No, honestly, I wasn't."
00:24:08,00:24:15,"But he was given 10,000 marks to do so. So basically King John just bought him up."
00:24:15,00:24:19,"And said, is that a lot of money we're talking?"
00:24:19,00:24:22,"10,000 marks? Well, I assume it must be."
00:24:22,00:24:25,"It seems unlikely he would have backed off for not a lot of money, doesn't it?"
00:24:25,00:24:29,"I mean, he was in control of more than half of England. I'm sure it was more than a fiver."
00:24:29,00:24:31,It seems like it was a lot done. Yeah.
00:24:31,00:24:34,"Yeah. Well, no, they were just giving away a lot of weird things at the time,"
00:24:34,00:24:39,like England to the Pope. Just curious what the equivalents were.
00:24:39,00:24:43,"But it didn't do King John any good, all this stuff, because he died in 1216,"
00:24:43,00:24:47,"so the year after Magna Carta. And at the time, he was also not popular,"
00:24:47,00:24:53,"because the medieval writer, Matthew Parris, wrote that hell itself is made fouler by the"
00:24:53,00:24:59,presence of John. Why did we book him to deliver the eulogy? What's going on?
00:24:59,00:25:06,"There were some weird clauses in Magna Carta, weren't there? Given that it's held up as this,"
00:25:06,00:25:12,"like the start of, it's a British constitution, basically. It was the start of the rule of law"
00:25:12,00:25:15,"in England, and then what became Britain. A lot of individual people mentioned."
00:25:15,00:25:20,Like shoutouts. Were there birthday shoutouts in the Magna Carta?
00:25:20,00:25:24,"Shoutout to the Lionheart. It was basically that, but the opposite of a shoutout,"
00:25:24,00:25:30,"saying you're banned from ever holding royal office. And so if any of these people are listening,"
00:25:30,00:25:37,"Engelard de Segoigne, Peter Guy, Philip and Mark, and your brothers, and Jeffrey, your nephew,"
00:25:38,00:25:45,none of you can have. And your mum. And your mum. None of these people can hold royal office.
00:25:45,00:25:49,"Very specific. It's a profounding constitution to name Bill, Bob and Mary."
00:25:49,00:25:55,"They had one bit in Magna Carta, which basically had complete freedom of immigration."
00:25:55,00:25:59,"As long as you were a merchant, you're allowed to come to Britain and work as much as you wanted."
00:25:59,00:26:03,"James, this is you're throwing a cat amongst the pigeons here."
00:26:05,00:26:10,"It's quite interesting, isn't it? And they also, they said that no one shall be arrested or imprisoned"
00:26:10,00:26:14,on the appeal of a woman for the death of any person except her husband.
00:26:14,00:26:19,"Yeah. I'm constantly accusing people of murder, and if my word would take them seriously,"
00:26:19,00:26:25,"there was this thought that women were constantly saying, oh, this bloke murdered someone,"
00:26:25,00:26:31,and weren't to be trusted. But I think one of the reasons it was thought to be happening is because
00:26:31,00:26:36,"women are exempt from trial by battle. So if as a man, you accuse someone else of having murdered"
00:26:36,00:26:42,"someone, then you could do a trial by battle where you'd have to fight that person and you might die."
00:26:42,00:26:46,And so often men ask their wives to accuse the person instead.
00:26:46,00:26:50,If you were in a battle with that person who you accused of being a murderer and you lost
00:26:50,00:26:53,"that battle, your final words would be like, see, I told you it was a murder."
00:26:53,00:26:58,It's like Minority Report. It's a predicted murder.
00:27:01,00:27:05,So we thought there were only a few of the Magna Carta's around the place.
00:27:05,00:27:11,We thought we knew how many there were. And the most recent discovery of one was in 2015.
00:27:11,00:27:17,"And this was a 1300 one, which is so recently to have found a new one of these."
00:27:17,00:27:24,It was found in a scrapbook in a council archive in a sandwich in Kent.
00:27:24,00:27:29,And the really nice thing was it was kind of sandwiched into the scrapbook.
00:27:30,00:27:34,"Yeah, it's just in there folded up and it's a bit tatty and it's a bit moldy and it's a"
00:27:34,00:27:39,"bit wet, but it's still a Magna Carta from 1300. So it's worth up to 10 million pounds."
00:27:39,00:27:44,"They're all different shapes, aren't they? Because they're on parchment made of sheep's"
00:27:44,00:27:50,"bodies, made of sheepskin. And so I didn't realise that basically the thing that you wrote on,"
00:27:50,00:27:53,"it was dictated to by the shape of the sheep. So if you had a really fat sheep,"
00:27:53,00:27:55,then you had a particularly big parchment.
00:27:55,00:28:01,That's why he was writing and his brothers and his mum. He was just trying to fill the space.
00:28:01,00:28:06,I've seen Magna Carta. You've seen Magna Carta?
00:28:06,00:28:13,"Yeah, I went to, there was an exhibition at the British Library in 2015, I think it was."
00:28:13,00:28:19,"And they only, they didn't let many people in. I think there was 1217 people were allowed in"
00:28:19,00:28:26,"to see it as a nod to the deck. Oh, because it was signed in 1215, but they let in 1217 people."
00:28:26,00:28:30,Dan climbed in through the roof.
00:28:30,00:28:38,"Sorry, you're right. It was 1215 people. No, really. Amazing."
00:28:38,00:28:43,"Oh man, imagine if I was at the end of the queue and I'd counter them all and like,"
00:28:43,00:28:49,"""We're fine, we're fine, we're getting in."" You have ticket number 1217."
00:28:49,00:28:57,"Yes. It was amazing to see. It was, it felt like you were,"
00:28:57,00:29:03,"you were witnessing the foundations of not only British law, but American as well."
00:29:03,00:29:06,"It was, it was, was it, how was it kept? Was it in a box?"
00:29:06,00:29:09,"No, it was, no, cause, oh yeah, yeah, like a C3."
00:29:09,00:29:16,"Imagine if you went to see that and it's just in a box, you're like,"
00:29:16,00:29:20,"""Can we look inside the box?"" No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:29:20,00:29:22,Jenny Ryan is inside the box and she's busy thinking.
00:29:22,00:29:31,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy."
00:29:31,00:29:35,My fact is that Ford has a car wash made of giant ostrich feather dusters.
00:29:35,00:29:39,"The whole car wash. The whole thing, yeah."
00:29:40,00:29:47,"It's really good. It's this huge frame. So it's, it's at their factory in Valencia in Spain and"
00:29:47,00:29:51,"it's, it's to clean the cars, but not exactly the way that a car wash does,"
00:29:51,00:29:56,"but it looks exactly like a car wash. So once the frames are stamped and welded together,"
00:29:56,00:30:00,"they need painting, but they've still got some dust on them probably at that point."
00:30:00,00:30:04,"And that car painters hate the dust because obviously you're just painting dust,"
00:30:04,00:30:07,"you're not painting the car, it doesn't give you a nice smooth coat."
00:30:07,00:30:13,"So it goes through this huge machine, which is lined with massive sort of,"
00:30:13,00:30:17,"it looks like a really upsetting Donna Kebab covered in feathers,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,like those elephant legs that you're getting in Kebab shops.
00:30:19,00:30:22,"It's that, but it's just covered and swirling round and round and round and it's covered in"
00:30:22,00:30:26,"ostrich feathers. Like, so to get rid of the dust that they have these feathers,"
00:30:26,00:30:30,is there no better material that we've invented over the last 100 years?
00:30:30,00:30:35,"You would think there would be, but it turns out that ostrich feathers in particular"
00:30:35,00:30:40,"are really good for dusters because they have these tiny little sort of barbules,"
00:30:40,00:30:44,"these sort of micro hooks, which are really good at picking up the dust."
00:30:44,00:30:47,"And they also, they prevent static electricity from building up,"
00:30:47,00:30:51,"which is also useful for the process. So yeah, so this is their process."
00:30:51,00:30:54,"So if you whack an ostrich, are they really dusty? Do they,"
00:30:54,00:30:59,do they just emit huge plumes? I guess.
00:31:00,00:31:06,"BMW says that it, in 2004 release, BMW said it exclusively uses ostrich feathers to dust"
00:31:06,00:31:10,"all of its cars. And yeah, because they claim, because of this innate static charge,"
00:31:10,00:31:13,not found to the same degree in other feathers.
00:31:13,00:31:16,I thought they used emu. That's interesting. I wonder if they've swapped.
00:31:16,00:31:20,"Or maybe they do emu in Australia, but they certainly in 2004."
00:31:20,00:31:23,"No, they don't. They've actually got, they've got an emu farm in Bavaria,"
00:31:23,00:31:26,which is where they get their emu feathers from.
00:31:26,00:31:30,"So maybe that's, oh wow, yeah, maybe they've gone to ostrich."
00:31:30,00:31:32,"Well, ostrich and emu are pretty similar, aren't they?"
00:31:32,00:31:34,Yeah. Sorry to be reductive about it.
00:31:34,00:31:38,"So ostrich feathers, they are now used for cars,"
00:31:38,00:31:42,"but they've been really popular as fashion items for quite a long time, haven't they?"
00:31:42,00:31:47,"And if you were an ostrich farmer, you could make millions from just getting the feathers"
00:31:47,00:31:50,off your ostriches and selling them on. So cool.
00:31:50,00:31:53,"They used to have feather palaces in South Africa,"
00:31:53,00:31:56,"which aren't what they sound like, because that would be a terrible building material."
00:31:57,00:32:00,It was just around about the 1880s.
00:32:00,00:32:05,"And South Africa provided about 85% of the world's ostrich feather supply, I think."
00:32:05,00:32:09,And the feather palaces were palaces built by people who got rich off the back of ostrich feathers.
00:32:09,00:32:10,That's still there.
00:32:10,00:32:16,"They went out of fashion because of, there was a, I think it was morning fashions changed."
00:32:16,00:32:21,"So it used to be, or big daft hats stopped being in fashion, basically."
00:32:21,00:32:23,"Well, it was partly because of cars."
00:32:23,00:32:26,Yeah. I went to the Hat Museum and they said it was because of cars.
00:32:26,00:32:30,"Because when you get into a car, if you have a big hat with a feather on top,"
00:32:30,00:32:32,then it's going to get squashed by the top of the car.
00:32:32,00:32:36,"Yeah, or knocked off as you get in and you have to replace your hat at the end of every car journey."
00:32:36,00:32:39,"You go, ""Oh, shit. It's on the road somewhere."""
00:32:39,00:32:42,And also there was actually quite a strong campaign.
00:32:42,00:32:45,This is in America where they thought they were going to widen the market.
00:32:45,00:32:49,"There was a really strong protection of birds movement in America, which I didn't know about."
00:32:49,00:32:51,This was around the turn of the 20th century.
00:32:51,00:32:57,"And these two women, Harriet Hemingway and Minna Hall, led this campaign against hat plumes,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,which were all the rage.
00:32:59,00:33:03,And they used to hold these big swarries and invite loads of women to their parties
00:33:03,00:33:07,and then persuade them not to have bird feathers on their hats.
00:33:07,00:33:08,And it really worked.
00:33:08,00:33:13,And it ended up being banned in Massachusetts to have feathers used in the bird trade on your hats.
00:33:13,00:33:15,And so that kind of screwed the industry too.
00:33:15,00:33:19,Yeah. Does anyone have stuff just more generally on ostriches?
00:33:19,00:33:20,Yeah.
00:33:20,00:33:20,Yeah.
00:33:20,00:33:23,"Oh, great. Dad, you sounded like you were really up for it."
00:33:23,00:33:24,So let's hear it.
00:33:24,00:33:28,Yep. So ostriches are so fast.
00:33:28,00:33:30,They are ridiculously fast.
00:33:30,00:33:34,"So they've got a land speed that they can reach the top speed of 43 miles per hour,"
00:33:34,00:33:37,which is insane.
00:33:37,00:33:41,And it's too fast even for them to be able to work out what to do.
00:33:41,00:33:44,"Like if it was us running, we would lose all control."
00:33:44,00:33:48,And this is where the feathers and their wings come into huge use.
00:33:48,00:33:52,They act as basically rudders for them as they're running.
00:33:52,00:33:56,"So when they reach these speeds, they can bring their wings up and they can zigzag"
00:33:56,00:34:00,using their wings to sort of push them in directions with the wind against them.
00:34:00,00:34:01,"Oh, that's clever."
00:34:01,00:34:02,Yeah. It's extraordinary.
00:34:02,00:34:07,And they can break suddenly by pushing their wings out and using their feathers to sort of break the
00:34:07,00:34:08,wind on them.
00:34:08,00:34:12,"It's an incredible thing, but that is so fast."
00:34:12,00:34:13,Have we talked about their penises?
00:34:13,00:34:16,"It's not yet, but I think everyone knew it was coming."
00:34:16,00:34:17,"Okay, great."
00:34:17,00:34:23,"So very few birds have penises, 3% of bird species, the males have a penis,"
00:34:23,00:34:24,but ostriches are among them.
00:34:24,00:34:29,"But when they have an erection, what do you think it's full of?"
00:34:29,00:34:31,Blood.
00:34:31,00:34:33,Right. There we go. It's not blood.
00:34:33,00:34:35,"They've got blood, obviously."
00:34:35,00:34:37,"They're not saying ostriches don't have blood,"
00:34:37,00:34:39,but they don't fill their penises with it to get an erection.
00:34:39,00:34:41,They fill it with lymphatic fluid.
00:34:41,00:34:42,Sand.
00:34:42,00:34:42,Sand.
00:34:42,00:34:46,Just thinking what they have around.
00:34:46,00:34:49,"That's a very uncomfortable experience for the lady ostrich, I think."
00:34:49,00:34:51,It's full of sand.
00:34:51,00:34:55,"No, they're full of lymphatic fluid, which is so weird."
00:34:55,00:35:01,And there's a big problem because lymphatic fluid in an ostrich body is under much lower
00:35:01,00:35:02,pressure than blood.
00:35:02,00:35:05,Their lymph fluid pressure is much lower than their blood pressure.
00:35:05,00:35:09,And what this means is that they can keep an erection for a few seconds maximum.
00:35:09,00:35:10,"Oh, wow."
00:35:10,00:35:11,It's a real problem.
00:35:11,00:35:16,"And so it means all mating is incredibly short because it just,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,"as soon as they've got an erection, they have to have sex or they're not going."
00:35:18,00:35:20,"And all the males are constantly apologizing,"
00:35:20,00:35:22,"but all the females are constantly going,"
00:35:22,00:35:24,"""No, it honestly is completely normal."""
00:35:24,00:35:30,But how quickly can they get an erection again after they've deflated?
00:35:30,00:35:32,"Unclear, not sure."
00:35:32,00:35:34,You think it's like an up and down sort of...
00:35:34,00:35:38,"I think it's like when you're trying to blow up a balloon and you get that initial,"
00:35:38,00:35:40,"and then it goes back down because you've lost breath,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,"you can go right back into it, right?"
00:35:42,00:35:43,So...
00:35:43,00:35:47,"Dan, you've got to pinch your fingers over the seal when you bring it out the way."
00:35:47,00:35:50,"Sorry, are we talking about ostrich penises or balloons now?"
00:35:50,00:35:56,I'll go to your next children's party then.
00:35:56,00:36:00,I think it's that ostriches do get turned on by humans.
00:36:00,00:36:03,There was a study done quite recently which won an Ig Nobel Prize.
00:36:03,00:36:09,And it was that both male and female ostriches do way more mating dances
00:36:09,00:36:11,and movements when there are humans nearby.
00:36:11,00:36:13,"This is in farmed ostriches, I should say."
00:36:13,00:36:17,So it seems that they find the farmers attractive
00:36:17,00:36:19,and it makes them feel a bit more amorous.
00:36:19,00:36:24,And the guy who worked this out was a scientist called Charles Paxton.
00:36:24,00:36:30,But we have mentioned his work before because he was also the person who worked out
00:36:30,00:36:35,that a lot of people who saw sea monsters actually saw the penis of a whale.
00:36:35,00:36:35,Yes.
00:36:35,00:36:38,Because whales mate in threesomes.
00:36:38,00:36:41,And there's always one spare penis floating around.
00:36:41,00:36:45,And that very could be the idea where sea monsters come from.
00:36:45,00:36:47,What does this guy's CV look like?
00:36:47,00:36:52,That's so cool.
00:36:52,00:36:56,"They've got really big eggs, ostriches, obviously."
00:36:56,00:36:58,"Big bird, big eggs, makes sense."
00:36:58,00:37:01,Do you know how long it takes to cook an ostrich egg?
00:37:01,00:37:02,Hard boiled.
00:37:02,00:37:06,"Hard boiled, an hour, one hour."
00:37:06,00:37:07,"Yeah, good guess."
00:37:07,00:37:10,"Yeah, it's about an hour and a half, roughly, to cook an ostrich egg."
00:37:10,00:37:12,"I like trying a little bit softer, actually."
00:37:12,00:37:14,"Oh, well, there you go, perfect."
00:37:14,00:37:19,I found that out on a BBC website that gave recipes for boiling different kinds of eggs.
00:37:19,00:37:21,"So the next closest that they had on the list was a goose egg,"
00:37:21,00:37:24,which takes roughly 13 minutes to hard boil.
00:37:24,00:37:29,"So that's, in terms of size difference, that just gives you an idea of how big they are."
00:37:29,00:37:34,But what's weird is they have incredibly tiny eggs in relation to their body size.
00:37:35,00:37:39,So they should have much larger eggs than they do.
00:37:39,00:37:43,"Yeah, you could argue that they have the smallest eggs in the animal kingdom,"
00:37:43,00:37:46,"in their bird kingdom, right, compared to their body size."
00:37:46,00:37:49,"Oh, wow."
00:37:49,00:37:53,"Because, yeah, actually, when they're born, they are surprisingly cute because they're so tiny,"
00:37:53,00:37:54,but also creepily fast.
00:37:54,00:37:57,"So when they're three weeks to a month old, they look microscopic,"
00:37:57,00:38:00,but they can already run at 50 kilometers an hour.
00:38:00,00:38:02,And it's literally smaller than a chicken.
00:38:02,00:38:04,"It's a tiny, big, large snack."
00:38:04,00:38:06,That's so good.
00:38:06,00:38:08,"I was reading the other day, this is off topic,"
00:38:08,00:38:13,"but this was about a guy who saw an insect called a deer botfly,"
00:38:13,00:38:16,"and it was in the early 20th century, I think."
00:38:16,00:38:18,"And he wrote, he was an entomologist,"
00:38:18,00:38:23,and he wrote that he'd seen this botfly flying at 300 yards per second.
00:38:23,00:38:26,No.
00:38:26,00:38:27,If that was true.
00:38:27,00:38:29,"And this was, they reported it in the New York Times,"
00:38:29,00:38:31,it was such a fast insect.
00:38:31,00:38:33,"They were like, this guy has found the fastest insect ever."
00:38:33,00:38:38,"And it turns out now that we found other deer botflies,"
00:38:38,00:38:40,"and they're not flying nearly as they find quite fast,"
00:38:40,00:38:40,but not that fast.
00:38:40,00:38:46,"Because that is so fast that if it was in a 100 meter race with Usain Bolt,"
00:38:46,00:38:50,it would have reached the end before Usain Bolt had been able to react to the gun.
00:38:50,00:38:55,How nervous is this guy claiming to measure that?
00:38:55,00:38:56,How fast was he running?
00:38:56,00:38:59,But he claimed he was keeping up with it enough.
00:38:59,00:39:00,Exactly.
00:39:01,00:39:03,What he's seen is two botflies.
00:39:03,00:39:05,That's what he's seen.
00:39:05,00:39:07,That's impressive in its own way.
00:39:07,00:39:11,"What, you think he saw a botfly, then travelled 20 miles home,"
00:39:11,00:39:11,saw another one?
00:39:11,00:39:13,Cute.
00:39:13,00:39:14,It's you again.
00:39:14,00:39:23,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:39:23,00:39:25,and that is Anna.
00:39:25,00:39:28,"My fact this week is that according to Kellogg's,"
00:39:28,00:39:31,Tony the Tiger is an adult cartoon.
00:39:31,00:39:33,Oh boy.
00:39:33,00:39:38,"I think it's because he's naked, so it's obscene."
00:39:38,00:39:40,"I can't picture him, because I can't picture anything,"
00:39:40,00:39:44,"but on the boxes, do you only see his top half, then, his that?"
00:39:44,00:39:45,"No, you get his full body."
00:39:45,00:39:47,"Yeah, he's really buff as well."
00:39:47,00:39:47,And he's naked.
00:39:47,00:39:51,"Do you see his, you don't see his, no."
00:39:51,00:39:51,No.
00:39:51,00:39:53,I thought you didn't see his top.
00:39:53,00:39:54,I'm going to have to look it up.
00:39:54,00:39:56,Has he got like a bowl of cornflakes over his genitals?
00:39:56,00:39:57,Yeah.
00:39:57,00:40:00,"Actually, he has no genitals."
00:40:00,00:40:03,"Yeah, of course he doesn't."
00:40:03,00:40:04,He's a cartoon character.
00:40:04,00:40:04,He's...
00:40:04,00:40:05,He's been spayed.
00:40:05,00:40:07,He has been spayed.
00:40:07,00:40:10,"When you get spayed, they don't cut your penis up."
00:40:10,00:40:11,So what did I pay for?
00:40:11,00:40:17,"But hang on, Anna, with your chocolate,"
00:40:17,00:40:20,name a single cartoon character for children
00:40:20,00:40:22,whose penis is hanging out.
00:40:22,00:40:25,"Dan, I think we've established Tony the Tiger"
00:40:25,00:40:26,is not for children.
00:40:26,00:40:29,"But some of them wear trousers, right?"
00:40:29,00:40:30,Some of them wear trousers.
00:40:30,00:40:31,So you would assume that they...
00:40:31,00:40:34,They've got something underneath.
00:40:34,00:40:35,Although Winnie the Pooh doesn't.
00:40:35,00:40:37,"Winnie the Pooh, T-shirt, only no trousers."
00:40:37,00:40:37,Yeah.
00:40:37,00:40:38,Strong look.
00:40:38,00:40:38,Donald Duck.
00:40:38,00:40:40,"Donald Duck, you don't see that corkscrew duck penis"
00:40:40,00:40:41,"coming out of him, do you?"
00:40:41,00:40:45,Okay.
00:40:45,00:40:48,"Okay, let's be clear actually about why he's an adult cartoon"
00:40:48,00:40:51,because it's not ready to do with the pornographic elements.
00:40:51,00:40:53,This is about the government trying to reduce sugar
00:40:53,00:40:54,in children's cereals.
00:40:54,00:40:57,"So in 2017, the government said that by 2020, this year,"
00:40:57,00:41:00,sugary products that targeted children
00:41:00,00:41:03,"should have voluntarily, but still should have,"
00:41:03,00:41:06,reduce their sugar content by 20%.
00:41:06,00:41:08,"And so Ketlogs tried it out with frosties,"
00:41:08,00:41:11,took 20% of the sugar out.
00:41:11,00:41:12,I think there was sort of a tasting thing
00:41:12,00:41:14,"and everyone went, ""Well, this is absolutely disgusting."""
00:41:14,00:41:16,"And so rather than take the sugar out,"
00:41:16,00:41:20,they actually sort of rebranded frosties as an adult cereal.
00:41:20,00:41:22,And so the argument was that
00:41:22,00:41:24,they're not targeting children with frosties
00:41:24,00:41:26,"and they've removed all children's advertising,"
00:41:26,00:41:29,like anything on the pack that aims at children.
00:41:29,00:41:31,And they've said that there was a spokesperson
00:41:31,00:41:34,actually this year speaking on behalf of Ketlogs
00:41:34,00:41:36,"who said that with frosties,"
00:41:36,00:41:37,they're recruiting new shoppers into the brand
00:41:37,00:41:41,and in particular adult shoppers under 28 years old
00:41:41,00:41:42,in the pre-life family stage.
00:41:42,00:41:45,And so that was their defense.
00:41:45,00:41:47,And they said that they'd done some research
00:41:47,00:41:49,and found out that most of the people
00:41:49,00:41:51,"who eat frosties are millennials, did they?"
00:41:51,00:41:56,"They've, I don't know how rigorous the stats that they've got are,"
00:41:56,00:41:59,"but they certainly say that, yeah,"
00:41:59,00:42:00,their research tells them that it's mostly millennials
00:42:00,00:42:01,in the growing market.
00:42:01,00:42:03,"I read, I think it was in the article"
00:42:03,00:42:05,"in the Telegraph about this,"
00:42:05,00:42:09,where they said that it was only one in five people
00:42:09,00:42:10,"who eat frosties as a child,"
00:42:10,00:42:12,but then the Telegraph did also point out
00:42:12,00:42:14,that one in five people in the UK is a child.
00:42:14,00:42:17,So it's basically the same proportion.
00:42:17,00:42:20,So that makes sense that it's not targeting children
00:42:20,00:42:22,if it's the same proportion as the population.
00:42:22,00:42:24,"That makes sense, but it also means"
00:42:24,00:42:27,"that they're targeting children as well as adults, right?"
00:42:27,00:42:29,"Yeah, right. They're sort of targeting everyone."
00:42:29,00:42:31,Although apparently millennials have changed
00:42:31,00:42:32,the way that cereals are advertised now
00:42:32,00:42:34,because we are eating them more.
00:42:34,00:42:36,I suppose there was that cereal cafe
00:42:36,00:42:39,"that made a big hoohah and shawditch or somewhere,"
00:42:39,00:42:42,but they've started advertising cereals
00:42:42,00:42:43,to not be eaten at breakfast
00:42:43,00:42:45,because the idea is that millennials
00:42:45,00:42:47,don't have time in the morning to eat cereal.
00:42:47,00:42:48,"So if you watch adverts now,"
00:42:48,00:42:49,I think there's one with them sitting
00:42:49,00:42:52,"with Tony the Tiger on a sofa, these two blokes,"
00:42:52,00:42:55,"and it's obviously a mid-afternoon,"
00:42:55,00:42:58,and they're watching some telly and eating some cereal.
00:42:58,00:43:00,How can you tell it's mid-afternoon?
00:43:00,00:43:01,They're watching pointless.
00:43:01,00:43:08,So there were other rival figures for Tony the Tiger.
00:43:08,00:43:09,It could have been Katie the Kangaroo
00:43:09,00:43:12,or Elmo the Elephant or Newt the GNU.
00:43:12,00:43:14,Those were all rejected.
00:43:14,00:43:19,I just think Newt the GNU was rejected.
00:43:19,00:43:21,So that's fair enough.
00:43:21,00:43:23,But it's not alliterative
00:43:23,00:43:26,unless you don't pronounce the G in GNU.
00:43:26,00:43:28,What kind of maniac would not pronounce the G in GNU?
00:43:28,00:43:29,It's the most fun letter to say.
00:43:29,00:43:34,"And also, he's named after another animal."
00:43:34,00:43:35,That's a very good point.
00:43:35,00:43:38,I'm not surprised they didn't go with it is all I'm saying.
00:43:38,00:43:40,I think Newt will have known from the start he was doomed.
00:43:40,00:43:41,"I mean, because also young children,"
00:43:41,00:43:44,I'm not sure how familiar they are with the GNU
00:43:44,00:43:47,as an animal as opposed to the Tiger.
00:43:47,00:43:48,"Yeah, but that's a failing in education."
00:43:48,00:43:50,That's not the fault of the cereal firm.
00:43:50,00:43:53,They also were going to go for Henry the Hermit Crabbe
00:43:53,00:43:56,when he reached his penis out of his house.
00:43:56,00:44:00,Have you heard of Big Mix?
00:44:00,00:44:01,No.
00:44:01,00:44:03,What do you mean?
00:44:03,00:44:03,Sorry.
00:44:03,00:44:05,Big Mix was what?
00:44:05,00:44:09,Is that Mick apostrophe S or is it a mix of things?
00:44:09,00:44:13,It's mixed with two Xs and big has two Gs just so you know.
00:44:13,00:44:14,"Oh, wait a minute."
00:44:14,00:44:16,Is this the parents of Little Mix?
00:44:17,00:44:19,"Yeah, that's absolutely right."
00:44:19,00:44:23,It was a cereal released in 1990 by Kellogg's
00:44:23,00:44:25,and it sounds absolutely horrific.
00:44:25,00:44:28,It was multiple different cereals all mixed together in the same box.
00:44:28,00:44:31,"So, I mean, pretty well."
00:44:31,00:44:35,"But they had their own mascot, which was called Big Mix,"
00:44:35,00:44:37,and it was a chicken wolf moose pig.
00:44:37,00:44:41,And basically they've got this horrific cross-bred island
00:44:41,00:44:43,of Dr. Moreau animal on the front of the box.
00:44:43,00:44:45,"It's a cryptid, basically, of cereals."
00:44:45,00:44:47,That is terrifying.
00:44:47,00:44:48,It is frightening.
00:44:48,00:44:49,"Also, not for children."
00:44:49,00:44:52,"You know, the cereal mascots."
00:44:52,00:44:58,I challenge anyone to name a famous female cereal mascot.
00:44:58,00:44:58,"Oh, okay."
00:44:58,00:45:02,One of the Rice Krispie Elts?
00:45:02,00:45:02,Is there a female in there?
00:45:02,00:45:04,"Make, snap, crackle and pop."
00:45:04,00:45:04,Come on.
00:45:04,00:45:05,You think one of them's a gal?
00:45:05,00:45:06,I think they're all male.
00:45:06,00:45:07,Can't remember.
00:45:07,00:45:07,No.
00:45:07,00:45:08,"Oh, wow."
00:45:08,00:45:08,That's really...
00:45:08,00:45:08,Right.
00:45:08,00:45:11,There's a Wikipedia list of all the cereal mascots.
00:45:11,00:45:14,There is not a single famous mascot.
00:45:14,00:45:15,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:45:15,00:45:16,Let me try a few more guesses.
00:45:16,00:45:18,"Oh, yeah, you think you're going to be Wikipedia here?"
00:45:18,00:45:21,No.
00:45:21,00:45:22,"So, wow, that's amazing."
00:45:22,00:45:24,This is not incredible.
00:45:24,00:45:25,"I mean, I know this probably isn't the hill"
00:45:25,00:45:27,"that I should die on feminism-wise,"
00:45:27,00:45:31,but let's get a gal on the front of a cereal box.
00:45:31,00:45:33,"Women can eat cornflakes, too."
00:45:33,00:45:34,"Katie the kangaroo, I guess,"
00:45:34,00:45:36,would have been your closest then that we know of
00:45:36,00:45:37,in this conversation.
00:45:37,00:45:38,"Oh, that's true."
00:45:38,00:45:39,And she was the runner-up.
00:45:39,00:45:40,Yeah.
00:45:40,00:45:41,She was down to the...
00:45:41,00:45:42,They was down to the last two.
00:45:42,00:45:43,They got rid of Newt the canoe
00:45:43,00:45:44,and Elmo the elephant pretty quickly.
00:45:44,00:45:47,But Katie the kangaroo was the second last in the running.
00:45:47,00:45:49,"Things could have been so different, guys."
00:45:49,00:45:50,Not very.
00:45:50,00:45:51,We could have brought down the patriarchy
00:45:51,00:45:52,with Katie the kangaroo.
00:45:52,00:45:58,"So, in Japan, they're obviously mad about mascots."
00:45:58,00:46:00,"And the term for it is ""urochara."""
00:46:00,00:46:02,And you had three fundamental components
00:46:02,00:46:04,"to what made up a ""urochara."""
00:46:04,00:46:06,"So, the three things where it must convey"
00:46:06,00:46:08,a strong message of love for one's hometown.
00:46:08,00:46:12,Its movement should be unique and unstable or awkward.
00:46:13,00:46:17,And it should be unsophisticated or laid back and lovable.
00:46:17,00:46:18,"And it's such a big deal that they,"
00:46:18,00:46:22,"since about 2010, created the ""urochara"" grand prix,"
00:46:22,00:46:25,which is all of the mascots come together
00:46:25,00:46:28,to be named the ultimate Japanese mascot.
00:46:28,00:46:30,"Oh, I thought you were going to say it's a race,"
00:46:30,00:46:32,because they have that in soccer teams.
00:46:32,00:46:34,Football teams in England have like...
00:46:34,00:46:38,"Every year, they have a Grand National of mascots,"
00:46:38,00:46:40,where they're all running against each other on like a race.
00:46:40,00:46:41,Really cool.
00:46:41,00:46:42,Do they?
00:46:42,00:46:44,"Yeah, and the thing is, some of them,"
00:46:44,00:46:46,"some of the mascots is just a normal,"
00:46:46,00:46:49,quite fit human being with a big head on them.
00:46:49,00:46:51,And then some of them are in a massive costume
00:46:51,00:46:52,that you can hardly move in.
00:46:52,00:46:54,"So, it's just completely unfair."
00:46:54,00:46:55,But yeah.
00:46:55,00:46:57,You guys who like football will know about
00:46:57,00:46:59,Wes Bromwich's Boiler Man.
00:46:59,00:46:59,Won't you?
00:46:59,00:47:00,Much better than I do.
00:47:00,00:47:01,Which I hadn't seen before.
00:47:01,00:47:02,"Well, that's terrifying."
00:47:02,00:47:03,"It's a boiler with arms and legs,"
00:47:03,00:47:05,because they're sponsored by Boiler Company.
00:47:05,00:47:06,It was so funny.
00:47:06,00:47:08,I remember seeing that when it happened.
00:47:08,00:47:08,It was on Twitter.
00:47:08,00:47:11,And I thought this has to be a hoax.
00:47:11,00:47:13,Because Wes Bromwich was quite a big football team.
00:47:13,00:47:16,It was so weird.
00:47:16,00:47:18,"Boilers, I mean, boilers keep you warm."
00:47:18,00:47:19,They're cuddly.
00:47:19,00:47:22,They keep you warm and cosy in your home.
00:47:22,00:47:23,They're awkward.
00:47:23,00:47:23,Yeah.
00:47:23,00:47:25,"Like you said, they had to be."
00:47:25,00:47:25,Yeah.
00:47:25,00:47:28,You can make a lot of money by being a mascot.
00:47:28,00:47:31,"I didn't realize that if you were the mascot for, say,"
00:47:31,00:47:34,"a football team or an America baseball team, basketball team,"
00:47:34,00:47:37,"huge amounts of money,"
00:47:37,00:47:40,because it's usually one person who's got the gig.
00:47:40,00:47:42,It's not necessarily tens of...
00:47:42,00:47:43,"You know, I assumed it's a new person,"
00:47:43,00:47:45,"whoever's free on the day, jumped in the suit."
00:47:45,00:47:47,"In America, for sure, they make a lot of money."
00:47:47,00:47:48,Yeah.
00:47:48,00:47:50,Because it's not just the actual games.
00:47:50,00:47:52,"And, you know, there's a lot of games,"
00:47:52,00:47:55,particularly for like basketball and...
00:47:55,00:47:57,"Well, like every sport, there's a lot of games per season."
00:47:57,00:47:59,But it's also the private events
00:47:59,00:48:01,"that they get hired out for and public space events,"
00:48:01,00:48:02,like in malls.
00:48:02,00:48:03,And they're actually...
00:48:03,00:48:05,They were in a very privileged sporting position
00:48:05,00:48:06,"in America at the moment,"
00:48:06,00:48:09,because they are one of the only spectators
00:48:09,00:48:13,that are allowed to watch sporting matches at the moment.
00:48:13,00:48:14,"So while all the stands are empty,"
00:48:14,00:48:18,"the mascots inside, they're, you know, very COVID-proof."
00:48:18,00:48:20,"Yeah, that's got to qualify as PPE."
00:48:20,00:48:22,We need to get more supplies of mascot outfit.
00:48:22,00:48:27,"I would be very unhappy in hospital if I saw, you know,"
00:48:27,00:48:29,Fred the GNU turn up.
00:48:29,00:48:32,The boiler guy coming up to...
00:48:32,00:48:36,"Hi, Mr. Shriver, I'm here to deliver you wife's baby."
00:48:37,00:48:40,Have you heard of Cyril the Swan?
00:48:40,00:48:43,Is he from Swansea?
00:48:43,00:48:45,"Yes, mascot of Swansea City,"
00:48:45,00:48:47,and an absolute thug by all accounts.
00:48:47,00:48:51,"So in 2001, he got into a fight with Millwall's Zampa the Lion,"
00:48:51,00:48:55,tore off the lion's head and kicked it into the crowd
00:48:55,00:48:58,"before shouting, ""Don't fuck with the swans"" at the headless lion."
00:48:58,00:49:00,Wow.
00:49:00,00:49:01,Just find a thousand pounds for that.
00:49:01,00:49:02,Was he the one?
00:49:02,00:49:05,There was one who got into a fight with the three little pigs.
00:49:05,00:49:06,Was that him?
00:49:06,00:49:09,I don't actually know if it was him.
00:49:09,00:49:10,He has got form though.
00:49:10,00:49:14,"So he has been accused of throwing pork pies at West Ham fans,"
00:49:14,00:49:16,pushing over a dog mascot.
00:49:16,00:49:20,"He's had a touchline ban, which is quite a big thing, isn't it?"
00:49:20,00:49:22,It's quite serious to be banned from the touchline.
00:49:22,00:49:24,And he was represented at his...
00:49:24,00:49:26,"After attacking Zampa the Lion,"
00:49:26,00:49:28,he was represented at the Welsh FA hearing
00:49:28,00:49:31,by the same lawyer who defended Eric Cantona
00:49:31,00:49:33,after he kicked a fan in the head.
00:49:35,00:49:35,Amazing.
00:49:35,00:49:40,Is he actually raising awareness about how dangerous swans can be?
00:49:40,00:49:44,"He's not raising any awareness because his Wikipedia page says,"
00:49:44,00:49:46,"""As a mute swan, he doesn't give interviews."""
00:49:46,00:49:49,Maybe he is in character and he just goes around breaking people's arms.
00:49:49,00:49:53,With a single blow of his wing.
00:49:53,00:49:55,"Sorry, can we go back to..."
00:49:55,00:49:58,"I can't let this sit, not talked about."
00:49:58,00:50:00,Can we talk about these three little pigs
00:50:00,00:50:01,that you mentioned very quickly?
00:50:01,00:50:02,Yeah.
00:50:02,00:50:03,Does anyone have information on that?
00:50:03,00:50:04,"Because I can't really remember it,"
00:50:04,00:50:08,but there was definitely a big fight between three pigs
00:50:08,00:50:11,and one of the mascot.
00:50:11,00:50:12,And I can't remember who the other...
00:50:12,00:50:13,I don't think it was a swan.
00:50:13,00:50:15,"I think Bristol City were involved, but I just can't remember."
00:50:15,00:50:16,Surely it would have been a wolf.
00:50:16,00:50:18,If it wasn't a wolf mascot.
00:50:18,00:50:21,"Yeah, who blew down three stadiums."
00:50:21,00:50:22,You're so right.
00:50:22,00:50:23,You're so... It must have been.
00:50:23,00:50:25,"I'm sorry, I can't remember."
00:50:25,00:50:27,Do you know who won?
00:50:27,00:50:30,Because presumably that's three adult men in the pig costumes.
00:50:30,00:50:32,So that's a three-on-one situation.
00:50:32,00:50:34,"Okay, I'm going to Google it."
00:50:34,00:50:39,"Okay, so it was a wolf."
00:50:39,00:50:39,You're right.
00:50:39,00:50:42,So you must be able to guess which football team it was.
00:50:42,00:50:46,"So it was Wolverhampton Wanderers mascot Wolfie,"
00:50:46,00:50:49,and Bristol City happened to have three mascots
00:50:49,00:50:50,called the three little pigs.
00:50:50,00:50:54,"But actually, no, the three little pigs were only there"
00:50:54,00:50:57,on that day to promote a local double glazing firm.
00:50:57,00:51:02,Just happened to be on the day that the wolf turned up.
00:51:02,00:51:04,"Oh, no. That's bad luck, isn't it?"
00:51:04,00:51:06,That is such bad luck.
00:51:06,00:51:07,"Promoting glass houses, horrible."
00:51:07,00:51:13,And all four mascots were sent off in disgrace.
00:51:13,00:51:14,"Oh, my goodness."
00:51:14,00:51:15,That is hilarious.
00:51:15,00:51:16,That's incredible.
00:51:16,00:51:17,So funny.
00:51:17,00:51:22,What was the second house built out of?
00:51:22,00:51:23,There was one... I know there was one out of bricks.
00:51:23,00:51:24,It was sticks.
00:51:24,00:51:27,"One of sticks, one of bricks, and one of ostrich feathers."
00:51:27,00:51:30,Dust free.
00:51:31,00:51:35,"The first mascot ever was, by some accounts,"
00:51:35,00:51:38,a Virgin woman called Bettina.
00:51:38,00:51:39,This is where the word mascot came from.
00:51:39,00:51:44,"So it was popularized by this play called ""Mascot"" in 1880."
00:51:44,00:51:48,"And at the time, it was a French word for bewitchment or a spell."
00:51:48,00:51:51,"And ""Mascot"" was about this Virgin called Bettina,"
00:51:51,00:51:54,"who turned up to a farm and sort of said to this farmer,"
00:51:54,00:51:55,"""Look, I'm blessed."
00:51:55,00:51:58,"As long as no one shags me and I remain a Virgin,"
00:51:58,00:51:59,"then your farm will be really lucrative."""
00:51:59,00:52:02,And it was basically this play about this woman having to remain a Virgin
00:52:02,00:52:04,so that the crops would all grow.
00:52:04,00:52:07,"And it actually ends with her losing her virginity, guys."
00:52:07,00:52:08,Oh.
00:52:08,00:52:10,"And as a result, no women have ever been allowed"
00:52:10,00:52:12,to be a serial mascot again.
00:52:12,00:52:13,That's true.
00:52:13,00:52:20,"Okay, that's it."
00:52:20,00:52:21,That is all of our facts.
00:52:21,00:52:23,Thank you so much for listening.
