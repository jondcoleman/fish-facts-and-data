 Hello and welcome to another Working from Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,240
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,240
 and Anatojinsky and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,360
 four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,840
 Starting with fact number one, that's my fact. My fact this week is before hermit crabs,

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,360
 we're called hermit crabs, there was a hermit called Crab. This is a man called Roger Crab,

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,840
 who his dates were 1621 to 1680 and he was an English soldier, he was a habidasher,

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,080
 he was a herbal doctor, an author and a hermit and he predates the naming of hermit crabs.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,280
 So did he live in a kind of shell, which he would periodically exchange for a very slightly

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,040
 larger shell? Are hermit crabs named after him? Well, hermit crabs I believe are named after

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,680
 hermits generally but I don't think he was such a famous hermit that he sort of defined the whole

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,760
 species. He was semi-famous, right? Isn't there a thought that he was a hatter and there's a

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,760
 thought that Lewis Carroll's mad hatter was maybe based on him because he was also, it seems,

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,080
 quite mad. Yeah, I couldn't find anything that sort of truly links that other than people saying

17
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,760
 it was thought. Did you get anywhere with that? No, like people were writing about him a lot in

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,640
 the 19th century when Lewis Carroll was also writing, you know, people would reflect back on

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,760
 his life, there were quite a lot of sources, so maybe he was your famous mad hatter. But he wasn't,

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,040
 was he, when was he alive? He was 1600s. Oh, okay, cool. They just talked about him a lot.

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,720
 Hermit crabs were named in the 1700s, so he predates them only just, but he gets there.

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,520
 It's sad, isn't it, in a way, that, you know, he never knew that those animals,

23
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,600
 but if he was a really famous hermit, like you guys are saying, then hermit crabs might

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,560
 have been based on him, you know? Yeah. It's possible. Yeah. And he had sort of a sad life,

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,640
 even though I guess he claimed to like it. Didn't he, by the end of his life, he was all about

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,880
 denying himself sort of all pleasures. Yes. And he didn't, he limit himself to potatoes and carrots,

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,960
 and then he sort of quit that and just lived off bran and turnip leaves, and then he quit that.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,160
 And by the end of his life, apparently he was living off dock leaves and grass. Yeah,

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,320
 he was just eating grass at the end. I don't know if directly mouth to ground, or if he turned it

30
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,440
 into a sort of picked it and put it in a bowl. Anna, you wrote something last week, which I read,

31
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,680
 which says that you can't eat grass. Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? So I'm not quite sure how

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,040
 he was surviving, maybe he had a cow's stomach implanted into his own body. Because what you need

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,200
 is like cows have the right bacteria in their stomachs, which means that they can break down

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,000
 the cellulose and get to the good stuff inside the grass, but we don't have it in our stomach. So,

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,600
 unless he's licked a few cows to get the bacteria, I don't know how he's, I mean,

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,040
 maybe he died almost immediately after deciding to eat only grass. It is the last thing on his menu

37
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,600
 of diet changes. So I think we can assume it might have played a part in that. No, he was,

38
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,960
 yeah, and he was accused of witchcraft in his lifetime as well, because he used to make prophecies.

39
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,800
 I couldn't actually find any of his prophecies, but... I bet I'll die really soon after adopting

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:32,160
 this brand new diet. But yeah, so good to know he existed. I'd never heard of Roger Crab before.

41
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,120
 He seems like a proper hermit too. He seems like an in it for life hermit, because we briefly

42
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,080
 mentioned before that you used to be able to kind of hire a hermit for your garden if you're a land

43
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,880
 owner. Yes. Which is more, they're more in it for the money. There's a guy who's written,

44
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,480
 Gordon Campbell is his name, he's written a book, which has got one of the best book titles ever.

45
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,360
 It's called The Hermit in the Garden from Imperial Rome to Ornamental Gnome. And he tracked down a

46
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,160
 load of newspaper adverts, which were kind of hiring hermits or advertising for hermits.

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,320
 So some said you get £50 a year for life as long as you live underground for the rest of your life

48
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,480
 and no one sees you. That's one offer. And I think you could ring a bell and a servant would bring

49
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,680
 you stuff, but you weren't allowed to chat to anyone and you had to grow your hair and your

50
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,120
 fingernails. So it's really unclear what the land owner gets out of this, but someone took

51
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,200
 that for four years and stuck it out for that long. But there are so few shops underground,

52
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,080
 it's hard to work out what you'd spend your £50 on. I think Amazon would deliver to your underground

53
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,920
 place. That's a good point. There was one guy called Charles Hamilton who offered a job on his

54
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,880
 Surrey estate, which was £700 in exchange for seven years of hermiting. So it's like a fixed-term

55
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,240
 contract. And the successful applicant took the job and then was founded a local pub three weeks

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:55,280
 into the hermit shop. Wow. Yeah. He lasted longer than I would. I think he was also in that book.

57
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,800
 He talked about Peter the Great's hermitage, which was very much more on the side of not a proper

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,040
 hermitage. I've been to the hermitage in St. Petersburg and if a hermit lived there, he was

59
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,840
 living at large. Yeah. So actually, that was an even bigger upgrade compared to Peter the Great's

60
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,760
 original one. But he originally decided to build a hermitage in his garden, which was sort of a

61
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,800
 retreat from matters of state. And this was in the 1700s when it was quite popular,

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,320
 the hermit lifestyle. And this was described as being a hermitage and that it had no servant.

63
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:36,240
 So you were really living like a feral human. And it was two floors and the dining room was on

64
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,960
 the upper floor and the kitchen was on the lower floor. And there were no stairs going from the

65
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,320
 lower floor to the upper floor. So the guests, when they arrived, had to be hoisted on chair lift.

66
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,880
 So on their individual chairs, hoisted up onto the upper floor to eat. And then when the table was

67
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,400
 loaded with food, it would be descended through the floor onto the ground floor, loaded up with food,

68
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,560
 and then hoisted up onto the upper floor again. Sounds so cool.

69
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,720
 Who's doing the hoisting if there are no servants? Because I thought I'd read that there were just

70
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,920
 no servants on the first floor. Like, obviously, there'll be loads of servants doing all the

71
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:17,120
 pulling and cooking. Yeah. That's not really living an ascetic life, is it? If, you know,

72
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,640
 you only have servants on one of your floors. Come on, he's making an effort. Fair enough.

73
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,880
 There are more modern hermits, aren't there? There was a guy in America called Billy Barr who

74
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,040
 lived in the Rocky Mountains. And he's really cool because he got bored quite soon into being a hermit

75
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,040
 or living on his own, let's say. And so he decided to kind of make a diary. And he started measuring

76
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,560
 the snow levels and all the animal tracks and when the first birdsong would be every year.

77
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,400
 And he did it for 44 years. And now his notes can be used to measure climate change,

78
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,040
 which I think is really cool. They're actually using his diary to say, "Ah, wait a minute. In

79
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,880
 1970 something, the birds sang on this date and now they're singing on this date."

80
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,960
 Are there any awkward entries in the diary which they have to just skip over where he--

81
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,200
 Wow. In 1976, he started masturbating in June, but in 1970-80, he started masturbating in May.

82
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,880
 What does this tell us about the temperature in the Rocky Mountains?

83
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:28,080
 I found a pro hermit in the UK who seems to be operating in the UK, or definitely he's done

84
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,320
 stints here. So he's an Indian artist called Ansuman Biswas. And he was recruited in 2002

85
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,400
 by Staffordshire Council to live for a weekend, a weekend of being a hermit in place.

86
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,400
 That's so ridiculous. Well, we've all been in our house for three months.

87
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,000
 So that was 2002. He was paid 600 quid to live in a grotto for a weekend, not bad.

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,560
 Then in 2009, there's a news report of Manchester Museum hiring a hermit, guess who it is? It's

89
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,840
 Indian artist Ansuman Biswas again. And then he's done another one. Recently, this year,

90
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,000
 he was going to do the Horniman Museum in South London and live there. He was going to be locked

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,800
 in their clock tower. But unfortunately, due to everyone staying at home, he was not allowed

92
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,880
 to become a hermit. That's so amazing. So when lockdown finishes, he gets to go and lock down

93
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,560
 again. Really? Yeah, I wonder if hermits have generally been furloughed across the board.

94
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:36,320
 Apparently, I was reading a Victorian source reflecting back on hermits throughout time,

95
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,160
 and it was such a religious thing. And all religions seem to have this tradition about

96
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,200
 self-denying. And this source was saying that basically the women did it properly and the men

97
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,040
 didn't really do it. So it said that basically there's a division between hermits proper and

98
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,120
 recluses. And hermits proper tend to see quite a lot of people have guests go out into the world,

99
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,600
 and then recluses are the ones that don't see anyone. And it said it was basically done down

100
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,560
 gender lines. So the recluses would be women and they would see nobody. But then actually,

101
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,520
 I think because anchoresses were the recluses, essentially, and they were meant to be hermits.

102
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,880
 Again, Julian of Norwich, a very, very famous example, and they essentially were Agneons,

103
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,360
 I think, which so they would deliberately have their hermitages built in the middle of quite a

104
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,560
 busy thoroughfare. Like in the Trafford Centre or something. Yeah. And then you would just go

105
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,880
 and sit next to her and say, "Oh, I'm feeling a bit sad today. I've been doing some sins."

106
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,680
 And then she'd help you. She'd say, "Well, at least you don't live in a box in the Trafford

107
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,480
 Centre with anyone allowed to come up to you anytime." My friend Jenny lived in a box in

108
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,560
 the Trafford Centre for a little while. Did she? Yeah, Jenny Ryan actually from the chase.

109
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,240
 No way. Yeah, she did. I don't know if that's on record. I suppose it must be.

110
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,520
 What do you mean she... I don't fully know what this box is. Is it just a cardboard box?

111
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,120
 Do you remember David Blaine? Yeah.

112
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,560
 He lived in a box for a while. Well, I think this was pre-Blaine. She was in a competition

113
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,160
 where she had to go and sit in a box for as long as possible in the Trafford Centre.

114
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,840
 Wow, cool. I think this is right. It might be the Arndale Centre. But the basics are...

115
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,880
 The basics of the story are true.

116
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,960
 Wow. So did you visit her in the box and tell her your problems?

117
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,480
 It was a long time ago. I don't think so. I think I was at university.

118
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,400
 You can't remember if you visited your friend in a box in a mall.

119
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:31,840
 The fact that I can't remember it suggests I didn't. But it also suggests that I'm a terrible

120
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,840
 friend. So I don't know which way to go. There was also... So the more sort of social hermits

121
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,720
 we mentioned a long time ago on the podcast, the stylites, which I find so interesting.

122
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,680
 The idea this was during the Byzantine Empire, you would have... So we're talking sort of the year

123
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:59,040
 432. It would be just... Byzantine Empire. So around 432.

124
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,880
 Oh, a magnificent but very short-lived empire. It's like a weekend hermitage, that empire.

125
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:15,120
 So the idea of this was it was gigantic poles in the city centres and people would climb up them

126
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,800
 and they would become hermits up there and just stay there for their lifetime. And

127
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,560
 they would like the pulley systems. It would send up food to them and they would stand and preach.

128
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,520
 So they were hermits, but they were also giving out sort of religious advice the whole time.

129
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,240
 It would be their soapboxes, it were.

130
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,720
 It feels a bit unfair. Have you heard of Mary of Egypt?

131
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,920
 No. She was a very early hermit and she isolated herself to atone for her insatiable carnal appetites.

132
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,400
 Which just seemed to be she liked having sex with people.

133
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,120
 Oh wait, did she also step on top of a massive pole?

134
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:53,360
 But all the stories about her say she wasn't even charging money to have sex with people,

135
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,680
 as if that was the worst element of the story.

136
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,800
 But she ended up still naked, didn't she? At the end, didn't someone stumble upon her in the desert?

137
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,640
 And she was unclothed. So I'm not saying she wasn't sticking to her vows, but...

138
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,840
 It's very hot in the desert.

139
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,760
 It was hot.

140
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,120
 Couple of things on hermit crabs. So hermit crabs are really great.

141
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,960
 There we go. That's all we got. No. Do you know how old the oldest pet hermit crab known

142
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,160
 is? God. I'd say about 35.

143
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,480
 That's good. Dan?

144
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,280
 15 days.

145
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,440
 15 days. Okay. I'm underegging it this time.

146
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,680
 I'm in an Argo middle. So 13 years old.

147
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,400
 James is closest. It's 42. It was 42 last year. And it's... He lives at a retirement home,

148
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,280
 which is very nice.

149
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,840
 Oh yeah.

150
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,720
 Because his owner also lives at a retirement home and it's called the Shell Point Retirement

151
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,800
 Community. He's hoping to move into a bigger retirement home next year, isn't he?

152
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,840
 But they do. They upgrade their homes, don't they? It's the most incredible thing about them.

153
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,240
 And the way that they do it is... It makes our property ladder look very simple.

154
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,360
 So a hermit crab will have its shell on its back, its house on its arse.

155
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,840
 And then its arse starts getting bigger and its house becomes too small for it.

156
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,000
 And so it'll find another shell that's a bit bigger, but often this shell will be too big.

157
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,560
 It's like a mansion. And so then they'll have to wait for another hermit crab to come along,

158
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,880
 that's sort of a different size. And then enough hermit crabs have to come along

159
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,440
 in all different sizes that they can line up from smallest to largest.

160
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,000
 And then the largest one can move into the vacant,

161
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,320
 hugest shell. And everyone else can move up one shell.

162
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,120
 That's amazing.

163
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,200
 It's insane. How are they organizing it? It doesn't make any sense.

164
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
 It's brilliant. It's so cool. And there are videos of it, right, online.

165
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,520
 People have to Google "hermit crabs moving house" and look at the videos because they're

166
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,200
 absolutely amazing. It's incredible.

167
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,680
 But sometimes two chains kind of get to the same shell at the same time.

168
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,080
 And then the two biggest hermit crabs have to have a fight with each other to see who's

169
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,520
 going to get the big shell. And everyone in your queue is going to get a new house

170
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,440
 if you win the fight. Do you know what I mean?

171
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,840
 Yeah, yeah.

172
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,680
 And so all the little guys are watching these two big guys fighting thinking,

173
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,960
 "I hope my guy wins." But then sometimes they swap queues and go to it and see that one of

174
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,880
 the other guys is doing a bit better in the fight and kind of sneak over and join his team.

175
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,600
 That is amazing.

176
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
 Incredible. That is amazing.

177
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:36,000
 They also, there's cases of gangs of hermit crabs coming to steal a single hermit crab's shell.

178
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,440
 So they nick it for their mate. And I read that that's the reason that they have extremely

179
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,400
 long penises because if you're having sex as a hermit crab and you leave your shell to go have

180
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,480
 sex because of your smaller penis, then you're leaving your home open for burglary.

181
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,040
 So by having a very long penis, you can stay indoors at home, but send your penis out for sex.

182
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,240
 I'll get through the letterbox.

183
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,920
 Exactly.

184
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,400
 So if you're a shy hermit crab, you have more sperm than if you're a brave hermit crab.

185
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,680
 Really? This was found out by scientists who startled hermit crabs.

186
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,840
 So they would take a crab from its tank, kind of scare it and then put it back.

187
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,280
 And then the crab would go into its shell because it was scared.

188
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,040
 And then they would measure how long it would take before he came back out again to see if

189
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,960
 everything was okay. And they compared that with the amount of sperm in their sperm metaphors,

190
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,240
 which is what they used to make. They have little bundles of sperm.

191
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,920
 And they found that the ones who were shy have more sperm than the ones who are brave.

192
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:48,400
 Do they know why? Well, is it that what they said is that there are two different approaches.

193
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,960
 You can either have a live fast, die young approach where you just go out and do it or

194
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,800
 like the more successful ones have a stay safe and protect your giant sperm package approach.

195
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,200
 Right. So it was the idea that they sort of know they've got this valuable package.

196
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,960
 And they're really trying to preserve it.

197
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,880
 Yeah. But the ones who have got less good package of sperm,

198
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,640
 they have to go out and find the females. It has to be more outgoing.

199
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,840
 So actually me staying in my room and reading throughout my university years was just because

200
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,240
 I'm an exceptionally high quality male. Is that what we're saying?

201
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,960
 Or that you were storing up a lot of sperm in the tank that other people were utilizing.

202
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,640
 Okay. It is time for fact number two. And that is James.

203
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:46,720
 Okay. My fact this week is that Magna Carta smells of newly pressed sheets with traces of old socks.

204
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,640
 So this is the Institute of Digital Archaeology.

205
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,840
 And they're planning an exhibition called Sensational Books,

206
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,080
 which will be at the Bodleian in Oxford and at the New York Public Library.

207
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,200
 And what they've done is they've taken a load of old books and they've taken the essence of

208
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,160
 the smell from all of these books. And you're going to be able to go and smell what these old

209
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,360
 books smell like basically. And what they do is they take the book and they put it in a sealed

210
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,760
 chamber and they fire a load of air over it for 24 hours. And then they capture the particulates or

211
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,480
 the little kind of molecules from the book. And then they can take those filters,

212
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,400
 they spin them around, spin them around, spin them around until they turn into like some kind of

213
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,160
 paste. And then that paste they can use to synthesize the odor. So they can work out

214
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,000
 exactly what's in it and they can make new versions of it. But if you're one of the first

215
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,440
 people to go to the exhibition, you'll be able to get the actual smell that they found from the box.

216
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,120
 So it's one of those things that if you're in the first couple of people who go,

217
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,960
 you're going to get the really good stuff. And if you go a few weeks after it's open,

218
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,040
 then you're going to get something that smells exactly the same, but isn't the true Magna Carta

219
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,640
 smell. Okay. Well, because they would have really created it based on those chemicals.

220
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,560
 So basically, we've invented the smell printing press 600 years after the actual printing press.

221
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,160
 Yeah, you could say that kind of. These face makes it look like you can't say that.

222
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,680
 Are they going to release a Magna Carta scratch and sniff? Because that'd be awesome.

223
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,080
 I think they might do that. I think I might have said this before that I went to a smell

224
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,640
 museum in Sunderland once and I got a book, which you could get all the smells of different

225
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,480
 things. And it was a scratch and sniff thing. And you could smell the sun and you could smell

226
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,120
 like the death mask of Toots and Car Moon and stuff like that. Wow. That's what I'm suggesting.

227
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,800
 Okay. Yeah. Some of the better smells that are going to be in this exhibition,

228
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,080
 CS Lewis's private collection smell is going to be, you can smell his cigars very slightly

229
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,160
 in the background. That's incredible. Isn't that cool? And there's going to be books from Boston,

230
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,160
 which smell a bit like molasses. Because do you remember there was a big flood of molasses in

231
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,480
 Boston where there's like sugar went down the street and I think killed a few people. But

232
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,160
 is it someone's diary writing about the molasses flood saying, oh no, it's coming in the door?

233
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,440
 I think it would probably be someone's library from the time which got covered in molasses.

234
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,720
 But yeah. Wow. I hope that that hermit who recorded all the snow isn't going to have his diary

235
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:23,600
 done because it's going to be a heavy center semen. Okay. Can we talk about Magda Carter, please?

236
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,640
 Yeah. We should say what it was, sort of like, what is this thing?

237
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,200
 Basically, King John, we had a king who was spending loads of money on stupid things,

238
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,760
 like going battling in France and stuff like that. And then we had all the barons in Britain

239
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,440
 who owned all the land, but the king was basically really pissing them off quite a lot.

240
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,240
 And he was making them give him money and he was doing nasty things to their families and stuff

241
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,520
 like that. And so they'd had enough and they were like, fuck this, we're going to get rid of the king.

242
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,840
 One time they tried to assassinate him. And then a few years later, they went down and they said,

243
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,760
 look, we have had enough. And he said, okay, okay, okay, I'll make a load of new laws that

244
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,440
 stop me from being an asshole. And they said, right, fine. And so they all agreed to all these

245
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,640
 laws. And then a few weeks later, he went, only joking. Pranked you. I was crossing my fingers.

246
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,320
 Yeah. He contacted the Pope saying, I've been forced to sign this dreadful document. Can you

247
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,480
 cancel it? And the Pope did so. He said, oh yeah, I'll issue a papal bull. And so that was 10 weeks

248
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,480
 after he signed it. I thought it was this huge founding document of English law and liberty.

249
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,280
 And it turns out it lasted 10 weeks. Well, it didn't because it became,

250
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,760
 it was reissued 10 years later and then it did stay on the statute books. But do you know what

251
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,560
 he had to give the Pope in exchange for the Pope admitting to that? He had to give him

252
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,520
 England. And that has never been reneged on. So the way he got the Pope on site, the Pope was

253
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,320
 actually really pissed off with John because there was this absurd situation where King John wanted

254
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,280
 one Archbishop of Canterbury, the Barons wanted another. They thought, so the Pope picked a third

255
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,600
 and then King John just hadn't let the third come into England. And the Pope would like,

256
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,560
 you know, got really pissed off and banned England from doing any kind of mass or anything.

257
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,360
 So the Pope hated John. So John got him back on site by saying, I'll give you the whole of England

258
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,160
 as a papal fiefdom. And we'll pay sort of rent to hire it off you every year if you say that I

259
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,280
 don't need to stick to this Magna Carta. And formally, the papacy has never resigned its claim.

260
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,160
 So technically, it could come up to England and say, can I claim sort of a few centuries of rent

261
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:40,240
 off you please? That sounds classic King John. He sounds like he just got a lot of stuff wrong

262
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,840
 because he was never meant to be king, was he? He was seen as the worst of the brothers or the

263
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,560
 sons of the previous King. Most famous of all, if you don't know King John, is he plays the lion

264
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,360
 in the Robin Hood Disney animation? Justin Hood in your head, who we're talking about.

265
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,560
 And he had many brothers, one of who was Richard the Lionheart, and his father,

266
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,960
 the King, gave them all bits of land. So Henry, his oldest son was given Normandy in England,

267
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,120
 and Jeffrey was given Brittany. They all got given stuff, except for King John,

268
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,400
 who was just given a nickname, which was Lackland, because he was given absolutely nothing.

269
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,920
 So he must have been such a prick as a young man for his father, the King, to be handing out

270
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,800
 all this lovely land to people, and he says, I'll give you this, and I'll give you this,

271
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,320
 and I'll give you this, and you're going to get the nickname Lackland. He must have been awful

272
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,160
 as a young person as well. Or he was meant to be a priest or something like this,

273
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,800
 but then the other three all died, didn't they? And slowly but surely, he got closer to the throne.

274
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,560
 It really is very hard to find a revisionist historian who's willing to back John up.

275
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,240
 Most people will say, well, there's another side to this story, but he was basically a dickhead.

276
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,280
 Not that the Barons were the greatest guys ever, right? They just wanted power for themselves,

277
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,800
 but I hadn't realized that the Barons, before Magna Carta was signed, and they were trying to

278
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:07,200
 negotiate with John or overthrow him, took control of London. So while John was off fighting his

279
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,080
 wars in France, the Barons marched into London, surrounded by walls, and just took over completely,

280
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,560
 and he came back to find it ruled by Barons. And the way they'd got in, he said,

281
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,800
 how on earth did you get in? Because it's surrounded by these walls. It's meant to be defended.

282
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,480
 And they said they just found a ladder lying up against the wall and all climbed over it.

283
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,640
 And I just find it so weird that to take control of a city, you could just leave a ladder,

284
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,120
 a surreptitiously lying against the wall, and the whole army of Barons climbs over it.

285
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,320
 That's so good. It's bizarre.

286
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,200
 But then after Magna Carta and after it was repealed, the French came along and took over

287
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,600
 London, which you don't often read about in like in schools and stuff. But basically,

288
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,080
 there was a civil war straight afterwards between the King and the Barons. And the Barons were

289
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,400
 known as the Northerners, which I like. And the French came along and King Louis just came along

290
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,720
 and went to London and was proclaimed King. Was proclaimed King. And then at the end of the war,

291
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,080
 when he went back in the end, he signed a treaty saying, oh no, I wasn't King. No, honestly, I wasn't.

292
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,280
 But he was given 10,000 marks to do so. So basically King John just bought him up.

293
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,680
 And said, is that a lot of money we're talking?

294
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,480
 10,000 marks? Well, I assume it must be.

295
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,280
 It seems unlikely he would have backed off for not a lot of money, doesn't it?

296
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,440
 I mean, he was in control of more than half of England. I'm sure it was more than a fiver.

297
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,680
 It seems like it was a lot done. Yeah.

298
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,960
 Yeah. Well, no, they were just giving away a lot of weird things at the time,

299
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,840
 like England to the Pope. Just curious what the equivalents were.

300
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,120
 But it didn't do King John any good, all this stuff, because he died in 1216,

301
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,040
 so the year after Magna Carta. And at the time, he was also not popular,

302
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:53,040
 because the medieval writer, Matthew Parris, wrote that hell itself is made fouler by the

303
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:59,680
 presence of John. Why did we book him to deliver the eulogy? What's going on?

304
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:06,080
 There were some weird clauses in Magna Carta, weren't there? Given that it's held up as this,

305
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,080
 like the start of, it's a British constitution, basically. It was the start of the rule of law

306
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,840
 in England, and then what became Britain. A lot of individual people mentioned.

307
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,240
 Like shoutouts. Were there birthday shoutouts in the Magna Carta?

308
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,640
 Shoutout to the Lionheart. It was basically that, but the opposite of a shoutout,

309
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,080
 saying you're banned from ever holding royal office. And so if any of these people are listening,

310
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:37,600
 Engelard de Segoigne, Peter Guy, Philip and Mark, and your brothers, and Jeffrey, your nephew,

311
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:45,120
 none of you can have. And your mum. And your mum. None of these people can hold royal office.

312
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,440
 Very specific. It's a profounding constitution to name Bill, Bob and Mary.

313
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,040
 They had one bit in Magna Carta, which basically had complete freedom of immigration.

314
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,920
 As long as you were a merchant, you're allowed to come to Britain and work as much as you wanted.

315
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,520
 James, this is you're throwing a cat amongst the pigeons here.

316
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,960
 It's quite interesting, isn't it? And they also, they said that no one shall be arrested or imprisoned

317
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,800
 on the appeal of a woman for the death of any person except her husband.

318
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,280
 Yeah. I'm constantly accusing people of murder, and if my word would take them seriously,

319
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,200
 there was this thought that women were constantly saying, oh, this bloke murdered someone,

320
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,440
 and weren't to be trusted. But I think one of the reasons it was thought to be happening is because

321
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,800
 women are exempt from trial by battle. So if as a man, you accuse someone else of having murdered

322
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,560
 someone, then you could do a trial by battle where you'd have to fight that person and you might die.

323
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,400
 And so often men ask their wives to accuse the person instead.

324
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,240
 If you were in a battle with that person who you accused of being a murderer and you lost

325
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,840
 that battle, your final words would be like, see, I told you it was a murder.

326
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,640
 It's like Minority Report. It's a predicted murder.

327
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,680
 So we thought there were only a few of the Magna Carta's around the place.

328
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:11,520
 We thought we knew how many there were. And the most recent discovery of one was in 2015.

329
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,760
 And this was a 1300 one, which is so recently to have found a new one of these.

330
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,640
 It was found in a scrapbook in a council archive in a sandwich in Kent.

331
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,680
 And the really nice thing was it was kind of sandwiched into the scrapbook.

332
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,240
 Yeah, it's just in there folded up and it's a bit tatty and it's a bit moldy and it's a

333
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,120
 bit wet, but it's still a Magna Carta from 1300. So it's worth up to 10 million pounds.

334
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,560
 They're all different shapes, aren't they? Because they're on parchment made of sheep's

335
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:50,720
 bodies, made of sheepskin. And so I didn't realise that basically the thing that you wrote on,

336
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,760
 it was dictated to by the shape of the sheep. So if you had a really fat sheep,

337
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
 then you had a particularly big parchment.

338
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,120
 That's why he was writing and his brothers and his mum. He was just trying to fill the space.

339
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,480
 I've seen Magna Carta. You've seen Magna Carta?

340
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,200
 Yeah, I went to, there was an exhibition at the British Library in 2015, I think it was.

341
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,680
 And they only, they didn't let many people in. I think there was 1217 people were allowed in

342
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:26,960
 to see it as a nod to the deck. Oh, because it was signed in 1215, but they let in 1217 people.

343
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,400
 Dan climbed in through the roof.

344
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:38,320
 Sorry, you're right. It was 1215 people. No, really. Amazing.

345
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,280
 Oh man, imagine if I was at the end of the queue and I'd counter them all and like,

346
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:49,280
 "We're fine, we're fine, we're getting in." You have ticket number 1217.

347
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:57,440
 Yes. It was amazing to see. It was, it felt like you were,

348
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,120
 you were witnessing the foundations of not only British law, but American as well.

349
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,160
 It was, it was, was it, how was it kept? Was it in a box?

350
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,600
 No, it was, no, cause, oh yeah, yeah, like a C3.

351
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:16,480
 Imagine if you went to see that and it's just in a box, you're like,

352
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,400
 "Can we look inside the box?" No, no, no, no, no, no.

353
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,880
 Jenny Ryan is inside the box and she's busy thinking.

354
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:31,120
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

355
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,440
 My fact is that Ford has a car wash made of giant ostrich feather dusters.

356
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,040
 The whole car wash. The whole thing, yeah.

357
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:47,600
 It's really good. It's this huge frame. So it's, it's at their factory in Valencia in Spain and

358
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,440
 it's, it's to clean the cars, but not exactly the way that a car wash does,

359
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,000
 but it looks exactly like a car wash. So once the frames are stamped and welded together,

360
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,160
 they need painting, but they've still got some dust on them probably at that point.

361
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,240
 And that car painters hate the dust because obviously you're just painting dust,

362
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,360
 you're not painting the car, it doesn't give you a nice smooth coat.

363
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,280
 So it goes through this huge machine, which is lined with massive sort of,

364
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,120
 it looks like a really upsetting Donna Kebab covered in feathers,

365
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,440
 like those elephant legs that you're getting in Kebab shops.

366
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,640
 It's that, but it's just covered and swirling round and round and round and it's covered in

367
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,000
 ostrich feathers. Like, so to get rid of the dust that they have these feathers,

368
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,480
 is there no better material that we've invented over the last 100 years?

369
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,680
 You would think there would be, but it turns out that ostrich feathers in particular

370
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,320
 are really good for dusters because they have these tiny little sort of barbules,

371
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,080
 these sort of micro hooks, which are really good at picking up the dust.

372
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,840
 And they also, they prevent static electricity from building up,

373
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,680
 which is also useful for the process. So yeah, so this is their process.

374
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,720
 So if you whack an ostrich, are they really dusty? Do they,

375
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,120
 do they just emit huge plumes? I guess.

376
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,720
 BMW says that it, in 2004 release, BMW said it exclusively uses ostrich feathers to dust

377
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,960
 all of its cars. And yeah, because they claim, because of this innate static charge,

378
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,280
 not found to the same degree in other feathers.

379
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,960
 I thought they used emu. That's interesting. I wonder if they've swapped.

380
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,640
 Or maybe they do emu in Australia, but they certainly in 2004.

381
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,840
 No, they don't. They've actually got, they've got an emu farm in Bavaria,

382
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,160
 which is where they get their emu feathers from.

383
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,240
 So maybe that's, oh wow, yeah, maybe they've gone to ostrich.

384
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,400
 Well, ostrich and emu are pretty similar, aren't they?

385
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,240
 Yeah. Sorry to be reductive about it.

386
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,720
 So ostrich feathers, they are now used for cars,

387
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,720
 but they've been really popular as fashion items for quite a long time, haven't they?

388
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,200
 And if you were an ostrich farmer, you could make millions from just getting the feathers

389
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,480
 off your ostriches and selling them on. So cool.

390
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,760
 They used to have feather palaces in South Africa,

391
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,800
 which aren't what they sound like, because that would be a terrible building material.

392
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,160
 It was just around about the 1880s.

393
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,040
 And South Africa provided about 85% of the world's ostrich feather supply, I think.

394
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,360
 And the feather palaces were palaces built by people who got rich off the back of ostrich feathers.

395
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,400
 That's still there.

396
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,720
 They went out of fashion because of, there was a, I think it was morning fashions changed.

397
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,920
 So it used to be, or big daft hats stopped being in fashion, basically.

398
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,520
 Well, it was partly because of cars.

399
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,480
 Yeah. I went to the Hat Museum and they said it was because of cars.

400
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,320
 Because when you get into a car, if you have a big hat with a feather on top,

401
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,880
 then it's going to get squashed by the top of the car.

402
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,880
 Yeah, or knocked off as you get in and you have to replace your hat at the end of every car journey.

403
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,200
 You go, "Oh, shit. It's on the road somewhere."

404
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,480
 And also there was actually quite a strong campaign.

405
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,680
 This is in America where they thought they were going to widen the market.

406
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,200
 There was a really strong protection of birds movement in America, which I didn't know about.

407
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,680
 This was around the turn of the 20th century.

408
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,200
 And these two women, Harriet Hemingway and Minna Hall, led this campaign against hat plumes,

409
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
 which were all the rage.

410
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,600
 And they used to hold these big swarries and invite loads of women to their parties

411
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,120
 and then persuade them not to have bird feathers on their hats.

412
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,160
 And it really worked.

413
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,280
 And it ended up being banned in Massachusetts to have feathers used in the bird trade on your hats.

414
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,840
 And so that kind of screwed the industry too.

415
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,600
 Yeah. Does anyone have stuff just more generally on ostriches?

416
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,320
 Yeah.

417
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:20,960
 Yeah.

418
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,120
 Oh, great. Dad, you sounded like you were really up for it.

419
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,320
 So let's hear it.

420
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,240
 Yep. So ostriches are so fast.

421
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,320
 They are ridiculously fast.

422
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,960
 So they've got a land speed that they can reach the top speed of 43 miles per hour,

423
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,600
 which is insane.

424
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,680
 And it's too fast even for them to be able to work out what to do.

425
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,560
 Like if it was us running, we would lose all control.

426
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,400
 And this is where the feathers and their wings come into huge use.

427
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,000
 They act as basically rudders for them as they're running.

428
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,480
 So when they reach these speeds, they can bring their wings up and they can zigzag

429
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,400
 using their wings to sort of push them in directions with the wind against them.

430
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,360
 Oh, that's clever.

431
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,400
 Yeah. It's extraordinary.

432
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,920
 And they can break suddenly by pushing their wings out and using their feathers to sort of break the

433
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,960
 wind on them.

434
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,000
 It's an incredible thing, but that is so fast.

435
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,280
 Have we talked about their penises?

436
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,240
 It's not yet, but I think everyone knew it was coming.

437
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,200
 Okay, great.

438
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,120
 So very few birds have penises, 3% of bird species, the males have a penis,

439
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,720
 but ostriches are among them.

440
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,280
 But when they have an erection, what do you think it's full of?

441
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,120
 Blood.

442
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,840
 Right. There we go. It's not blood.

443
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,600
 They've got blood, obviously.

444
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,200
 They're not saying ostriches don't have blood,

445
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,520
 but they don't fill their penises with it to get an erection.

446
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
 They fill it with lymphatic fluid.

447
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,320
 Sand.

448
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,800
 Sand.

449
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,160
 Just thinking what they have around.

450
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,760
 That's a very uncomfortable experience for the lady ostrich, I think.

451
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,200
 It's full of sand.

452
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,600
 No, they're full of lymphatic fluid, which is so weird.

453
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,120
 And there's a big problem because lymphatic fluid in an ostrich body is under much lower

454
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,640
 pressure than blood.

455
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,440
 Their lymph fluid pressure is much lower than their blood pressure.

456
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,280
 And what this means is that they can keep an erection for a few seconds maximum.

457
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,400
 Oh, wow.

458
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,440
 It's a real problem.

459
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,160
 And so it means all mating is incredibly short because it just,

460
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,800
 as soon as they've got an erection, they have to have sex or they're not going.

461
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,960
 And all the males are constantly apologizing,

462
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,480
 but all the females are constantly going,

463
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,000
 "No, it honestly is completely normal."

464
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,640
 But how quickly can they get an erection again after they've deflated?

465
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,560
 Unclear, not sure.

466
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
 You think it's like an up and down sort of...

467
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,160
 I think it's like when you're trying to blow up a balloon and you get that initial,

468
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,400
 and then it goes back down because you've lost breath,

469
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,640
 you can go right back into it, right?

470
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,840
 So...

471
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,600
 Dan, you've got to pinch your fingers over the seal when you bring it out the way.

472
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,160
 Sorry, are we talking about ostrich penises or balloons now?

473
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,080
 I'll go to your next children's party then.

474
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,000
 I think it's that ostriches do get turned on by humans.

475
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,280
 There was a study done quite recently which won an Ig Nobel Prize.

476
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,680
 And it was that both male and female ostriches do way more mating dances

477
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,600
 and movements when there are humans nearby.

478
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,840
 This is in farmed ostriches, I should say.

479
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,040
 So it seems that they find the farmers attractive

480
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,280
 and it makes them feel a bit more amorous.

481
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,480
 And the guy who worked this out was a scientist called Charles Paxton.

482
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,000
 But we have mentioned his work before because he was also the person who worked out

483
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,600
 that a lot of people who saw sea monsters actually saw the penis of a whale.

484
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:35,840
 Yes.

485
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,640
 Because whales mate in threesomes.

486
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,520
 And there's always one spare penis floating around.

487
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,920
 And that very could be the idea where sea monsters come from.

488
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,600
 What does this guy's CV look like?

489
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,160
 That's so cool.

490
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,560
 They've got really big eggs, ostriches, obviously.

491
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
 Big bird, big eggs, makes sense.

492
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,600
 Do you know how long it takes to cook an ostrich egg?

493
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,320
 Hard boiled.

494
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,480
 Hard boiled, an hour, one hour.

495
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,520
 Yeah, good guess.

496
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,960
 Yeah, it's about an hour and a half, roughly, to cook an ostrich egg.

497
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,720
 I like trying a little bit softer, actually.

498
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,400
 Oh, well, there you go, perfect.

499
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,280
 I found that out on a BBC website that gave recipes for boiling different kinds of eggs.

500
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,920
 So the next closest that they had on the list was a goose egg,

501
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,800
 which takes roughly 13 minutes to hard boil.

502
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,120
 So that's, in terms of size difference, that just gives you an idea of how big they are.

503
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:34,240
 But what's weird is they have incredibly tiny eggs in relation to their body size.

504
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,520
 So they should have much larger eggs than they do.

505
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,200
 Yeah, you could argue that they have the smallest eggs in the animal kingdom,

506
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,320
 in their bird kingdom, right, compared to their body size.

507
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,120
 Oh, wow.

508
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,040
 Because, yeah, actually, when they're born, they are surprisingly cute because they're so tiny,

509
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,400
 but also creepily fast.

510
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,920
 So when they're three weeks to a month old, they look microscopic,

511
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,000
 but they can already run at 50 kilometers an hour.

512
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,720
 And it's literally smaller than a chicken.

513
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,960
 It's a tiny, big, large snack.

514
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,240
 That's so good.

515
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,320
 I was reading the other day, this is off topic,

516
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,280
 but this was about a guy who saw an insect called a deer botfly,

517
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,080
 and it was in the early 20th century, I think.

518
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,080
 And he wrote, he was an entomologist,

519
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,280
 and he wrote that he'd seen this botfly flying at 300 yards per second.

520
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,080
 No.

521
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,040
 If that was true.

522
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,920
 And this was, they reported it in the New York Times,

523
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,280
 it was such a fast insect.

524
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,760
 They were like, this guy has found the fastest insect ever.

525
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,000
 And it turns out now that we found other deer botflies,

526
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 and they're not flying nearly as they find quite fast,

527
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,880
 but not that fast.

528
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,000
 Because that is so fast that if it was in a 100 meter race with Usain Bolt,

529
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,240
 it would have reached the end before Usain Bolt had been able to react to the gun.

530
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,440
 How nervous is this guy claiming to measure that?

531
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,960
 How fast was he running?

532
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,280
 But he claimed he was keeping up with it enough.

533
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,720
 Exactly.

534
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,440
 What he's seen is two botflies.

535
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,120
 That's what he's seen.

536
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,520
 That's impressive in its own way.

537
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,120
 What, you think he saw a botfly, then travelled 20 miles home,

538
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,920
 saw another one?

539
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,840
 Cute.

540
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,640
 It's you again.

541
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:23,680
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

542
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,200
 and that is Anna.

543
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,480
 My fact this week is that according to Kellogg's,

544
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,040
 Tony the Tiger is an adult cartoon.

545
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
 Oh boy.

546
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,240
 I think it's because he's naked, so it's obscene.

547
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,640
 I can't picture him, because I can't picture anything,

548
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,080
 but on the boxes, do you only see his top half, then, his that?

549
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,520
 No, you get his full body.

550
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,040
 Yeah, he's really buff as well.

551
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,840
 And he's naked.

552
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,040
 Do you see his, you don't see his, no.

553
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,840
 No.

554
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,200
 I thought you didn't see his top.

555
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,000
 I'm going to have to look it up.

556
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,800
 Has he got like a bowl of cornflakes over his genitals?

557
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,520
 Yeah.

558
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,960
 Actually, he has no genitals.

559
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,200
 Yeah, of course he doesn't.

560
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,400
 He's a cartoon character.

561
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,720
 He's...

562
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,520
 He's been spayed.

563
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,600
 He has been spayed.

564
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,000
 When you get spayed, they don't cut your penis up.

565
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,920
 So what did I pay for?

566
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,920
 But hang on, Anna, with your chocolate,

567
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,960
 name a single cartoon character for children

568
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,400
 whose penis is hanging out.

569
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,600
 Dan, I think we've established Tony the Tiger

570
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,720
 is not for children.

571
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,360
 But some of them wear trousers, right?

572
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,400
 Some of them wear trousers.

573
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,840
 So you would assume that they...

574
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,480
 They've got something underneath.

575
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,520
 Although Winnie the Pooh doesn't.

576
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,440
 Winnie the Pooh, T-shirt, only no trousers.

577
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:37,600
 Yeah.

578
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,080
 Strong look.

579
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,400
 Donald Duck.

580
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,800
 Donald Duck, you don't see that corkscrew duck penis

581
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,760
 coming out of him, do you?

582
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,040
 Okay.

583
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,720
 Okay, let's be clear actually about why he's an adult cartoon

584
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,520
 because it's not ready to do with the pornographic elements.

585
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,440
 This is about the government trying to reduce sugar

586
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,480
 in children's cereals.

587
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,920
 So in 2017, the government said that by 2020, this year,

588
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,880
 sugary products that targeted children

589
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,760
 should have voluntarily, but still should have,

590
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,320
 reduce their sugar content by 20%.

591
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,640
 And so Ketlogs tried it out with frosties,

592
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,120
 took 20% of the sugar out.

593
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,560
 I think there was sort of a tasting thing

594
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,800
 and everyone went, "Well, this is absolutely disgusting."

595
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,720
 And so rather than take the sugar out,

596
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,480
 they actually sort of rebranded frosties as an adult cereal.

597
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,080
 And so the argument was that

598
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,160
 they're not targeting children with frosties

599
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,640
 and they've removed all children's advertising,

600
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,200
 like anything on the pack that aims at children.

601
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,680
 And they've said that there was a spokesperson

602
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,480
 actually this year speaking on behalf of Ketlogs

603
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,000
 who said that with frosties,

604
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,840
 they're recruiting new shoppers into the brand

605
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,200
 and in particular adult shoppers under 28 years old

606
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,960
 in the pre-life family stage.

607
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,440
 And so that was their defense.

608
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
 And they said that they'd done some research

609
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,040
 and found out that most of the people

610
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,600
 who eat frosties are millennials, did they?

611
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,400
 They've, I don't know how rigorous the stats that they've got are,

612
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,040
 but they certainly say that, yeah,

613
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,880
 their research tells them that it's mostly millennials

614
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,760
 in the growing market.

615
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
 I read, I think it was in the article

616
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,200
 in the Telegraph about this,

617
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,040
 where they said that it was only one in five people

618
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,560
 who eat frosties as a child,

619
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,400
 but then the Telegraph did also point out

620
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,800
 that one in five people in the UK is a child.

621
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,840
 So it's basically the same proportion.

622
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,640
 So that makes sense that it's not targeting children

623
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,800
 if it's the same proportion as the population.

624
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,480
 That makes sense, but it also means

625
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,040
 that they're targeting children as well as adults, right?

626
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,360
 Yeah, right. They're sort of targeting everyone.

627
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,040
 Although apparently millennials have changed

628
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,960
 the way that cereals are advertised now

629
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,880
 because we are eating them more.

630
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,400
 I suppose there was that cereal cafe

631
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,200
 that made a big hoohah and shawditch or somewhere,

632
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,320
 but they've started advertising cereals

633
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,680
 to not be eaten at breakfast

634
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,120
 because the idea is that millennials

635
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,280
 don't have time in the morning to eat cereal.

636
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,560
 So if you watch adverts now,

637
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,760
 I think there's one with them sitting

638
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,960
 with Tony the Tiger on a sofa, these two blokes,

639
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,200
 and it's obviously a mid-afternoon,

640
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,240
 and they're watching some telly and eating some cereal.

641
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,640
 How can you tell it's mid-afternoon?

642
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,760
 They're watching pointless.

643
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,160
 So there were other rival figures for Tony the Tiger.

644
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,600
 It could have been Katie the Kangaroo

645
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,000
 or Elmo the Elephant or Newt the GNU.

646
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,160
 Those were all rejected.

647
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,520
 I just think Newt the GNU was rejected.

648
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,040
 So that's fair enough.

649
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
 But it's not alliterative

650
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,080
 unless you don't pronounce the G in GNU.

651
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,480
 What kind of maniac would not pronounce the G in GNU?

652
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,760
 It's the most fun letter to say.

653
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,000
 And also, he's named after another animal.

654
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,040
 That's a very good point.

655
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,240
 I'm not surprised they didn't go with it is all I'm saying.

656
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,560
 I think Newt will have known from the start he was doomed.

657
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,840
 I mean, because also young children,

658
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,560
 I'm not sure how familiar they are with the GNU

659
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,040
 as an animal as opposed to the Tiger.

660
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,720
 Yeah, but that's a failing in education.

661
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,240
 That's not the fault of the cereal firm.

662
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,280
 They also were going to go for Henry the Hermit Crabbe

663
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,640
 when he reached his penis out of his house.

664
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,800
 Have you heard of Big Mix?

665
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,760
 No.

666
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,360
 What do you mean?

667
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:03,840
 Sorry.

668
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,360
 Big Mix was what?

669
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,760
 Is that Mick apostrophe S or is it a mix of things?

670
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,840
 It's mixed with two Xs and big has two Gs just so you know.

671
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,480
 Oh, wait a minute.

672
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,160
 Is this the parents of Little Mix?

673
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,040
 Yeah, that's absolutely right.

674
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,360
 It was a cereal released in 1990 by Kellogg's

675
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,280
 and it sounds absolutely horrific.

676
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,560
 It was multiple different cereals all mixed together in the same box.

677
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,120
 So, I mean, pretty well.

678
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,040
 But they had their own mascot, which was called Big Mix,

679
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,680
 and it was a chicken wolf moose pig.

680
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,200
 And basically they've got this horrific cross-bred island

681
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,520
 of Dr. Moreau animal on the front of the box.

682
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,600
 It's a cryptid, basically, of cereals.

683
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,040
 That is terrifying.

684
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,320
 It is frightening.

685
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,440
 Also, not for children.

686
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,240
 You know, the cereal mascots.

687
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,480
 I challenge anyone to name a famous female cereal mascot.

688
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:58,960
 Oh, okay.

689
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,160
 One of the Rice Krispie Elts?

690
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:02,480
 Is there a female in there?

691
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,000
 Make, snap, crackle and pop.

692
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,480
 Come on.

693
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,920
 You think one of them's a gal?

694
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,480
 I think they're all male.

695
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,200
 Can't remember.

696
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:07,520
 No.

697
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,080
 Oh, wow.

698
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,720
 That's really...

699
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:08,960
 Right.

700
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,760
 There's a Wikipedia list of all the cereal mascots.

701
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,640
 There is not a single famous mascot.

702
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,120
 Wait, wait, wait.

703
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,960
 Let me try a few more guesses.

704
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,960
 Oh, yeah, you think you're going to be Wikipedia here?

705
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,200
 No.

706
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,640
 So, wow, that's amazing.

707
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,000
 This is not incredible.

708
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,760
 I mean, I know this probably isn't the hill

709
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,920
 that I should die on feminism-wise,

710
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,200
 but let's get a gal on the front of a cereal box.

711
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,040
 Women can eat cornflakes, too.

712
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,160
 Katie the kangaroo, I guess,

713
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,880
 would have been your closest then that we know of

714
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,920
 in this conversation.

715
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,720
 Oh, that's true.

716
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,520
 And she was the runner-up.

717
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,400
 Yeah.

718
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,280
 She was down to the...

719
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,160
 They was down to the last two.

720
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,520
 They got rid of Newt the canoe

721
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,960
 and Elmo the elephant pretty quickly.

722
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,280
 But Katie the kangaroo was the second last in the running.

723
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,360
 Things could have been so different, guys.

724
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,400
 Not very.

725
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,760
 We could have brought down the patriarchy

726
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,960
 with Katie the kangaroo.

727
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,000
 So, in Japan, they're obviously mad about mascots.

728
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,880
 And the term for it is "urochara."

729
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,720
 And you had three fundamental components

730
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,720
 to what made up a "urochara."

731
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,240
 So, the three things where it must convey

732
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,560
 a strong message of love for one's hometown.

733
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,560
 Its movement should be unique and unstable or awkward.

734
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,280
 And it should be unsophisticated or laid back and lovable.

735
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,720
 And it's such a big deal that they,

736
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,880
 since about 2010, created the "urochara" grand prix,

737
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,760
 which is all of the mascots come together

738
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,640
 to be named the ultimate Japanese mascot.

739
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,320
 Oh, I thought you were going to say it's a race,

740
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,960
 because they have that in soccer teams.

741
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,480
 Football teams in England have like...

742
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,160
 Every year, they have a Grand National of mascots,

743
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,720
 where they're all running against each other on like a race.

744
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,360
 Really cool.

745
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,240
 Do they?

746
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,320
 Yeah, and the thing is, some of them,

747
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,480
 some of the mascots is just a normal,

748
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,840
 quite fit human being with a big head on them.

749
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,840
 And then some of them are in a massive costume

750
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,960
 that you can hardly move in.

751
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,400
 So, it's just completely unfair.

752
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,840
 But yeah.

753
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,520
 You guys who like football will know about

754
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,120
 Wes Bromwich's Boiler Man.

755
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,840
 Won't you?

756
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,800
 Much better than I do.

757
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,680
 Which I hadn't seen before.

758
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,400
 Well, that's terrifying.

759
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,680
 It's a boiler with arms and legs,

760
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,280
 because they're sponsored by Boiler Company.

761
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,160
 It was so funny.

762
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,160
 I remember seeing that when it happened.

763
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,960
 It was on Twitter.

764
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,040
 And I thought this has to be a hoax.

765
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,120
 Because Wes Bromwich was quite a big football team.

766
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,080
 It was so weird.

767
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,320
 Boilers, I mean, boilers keep you warm.

768
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,600
 They're cuddly.

769
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,000
 They keep you warm and cosy in your home.

770
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,120
 They're awkward.

771
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,600
 Yeah.

772
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,040
 Like you said, they had to be.

773
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,360
 Yeah.

774
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,880
 You can make a lot of money by being a mascot.

775
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,920
 I didn't realize that if you were the mascot for, say,

776
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,880
 a football team or an America baseball team, basketball team,

777
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,040
 huge amounts of money,

778
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,000
 because it's usually one person who's got the gig.

779
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 It's not necessarily tens of...

780
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,840
 You know, I assumed it's a new person,

781
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,360
 whoever's free on the day, jumped in the suit.

782
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,600
 In America, for sure, they make a lot of money.

783
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,000
 Yeah.

784
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,240
 Because it's not just the actual games.

785
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,560
 And, you know, there's a lot of games,

786
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,120
 particularly for like basketball and...

787
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,200
 Well, like every sport, there's a lot of games per season.

788
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,120
 But it's also the private events

789
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,520
 that they get hired out for and public space events,

790
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,880
 like in malls.

791
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,760
 And they're actually...

792
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,680
 They were in a very privileged sporting position

793
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,800
 in America at the moment,

794
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,440
 because they are one of the only spectators

795
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,040
 that are allowed to watch sporting matches at the moment.

796
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,640
 So while all the stands are empty,

797
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,000
 the mascots inside, they're, you know, very COVID-proof.

798
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,800
 Yeah, that's got to qualify as PPE.

799
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,640
 We need to get more supplies of mascot outfit.

800
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,360
 I would be very unhappy in hospital if I saw, you know,

801
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,920
 Fred the GNU turn up.

802
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,720
 The boiler guy coming up to...

803
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,800
 Hi, Mr. Shriver, I'm here to deliver you wife's baby.

804
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,960
 Have you heard of Cyril the Swan?

805
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,200
 Is he from Swansea?

806
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,040
 Yes, mascot of Swansea City,

807
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,120
 and an absolute thug by all accounts.

808
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,520
 So in 2001, he got into a fight with Millwall's Zampa the Lion,

809
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,360
 tore off the lion's head and kicked it into the crowd

810
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,560
 before shouting, "Don't fuck with the swans" at the headless lion.

811
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,080
 Wow.

812
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,360
 Just find a thousand pounds for that.

813
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,640
 Was he the one?

814
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,680
 There was one who got into a fight with the three little pigs.

815
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,400
 Was that him?

816
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,440
 I don't actually know if it was him.

817
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,560
 He has got form though.

818
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,240
 So he has been accused of throwing pork pies at West Ham fans,

819
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,880
 pushing over a dog mascot.

820
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,080
 He's had a touchline ban, which is quite a big thing, isn't it?

821
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,240
 It's quite serious to be banned from the touchline.

822
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,240
 And he was represented at his...

823
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,320
 After attacking Zampa the Lion,

824
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,560
 he was represented at the Welsh FA hearing

825
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,440
 by the same lawyer who defended Eric Cantona

826
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,040
 after he kicked a fan in the head.

827
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:35,920
 Amazing.

828
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,240
 Is he actually raising awareness about how dangerous swans can be?

829
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,160
 He's not raising any awareness because his Wikipedia page says,

830
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,720
 "As a mute swan, he doesn't give interviews."

831
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,840
 Maybe he is in character and he just goes around breaking people's arms.

832
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,280
 With a single blow of his wing.

833
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,360
 Sorry, can we go back to...

834
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,080
 I can't let this sit, not talked about.

835
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,320
 Can we talk about these three little pigs

836
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,440
 that you mentioned very quickly?

837
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,000
 Yeah.

838
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,440
 Does anyone have information on that?

839
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,720
 Because I can't really remember it,

840
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,640
 but there was definitely a big fight between three pigs

841
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,040
 and one of the mascot.

842
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,160
 And I can't remember who the other...

843
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,280
 I don't think it was a swan.

844
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,280
 I think Bristol City were involved, but I just can't remember.

845
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,640
 Surely it would have been a wolf.

846
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,240
 If it wasn't a wolf mascot.

847
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,200
 Yeah, who blew down three stadiums.

848
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,400
 You're so right.

849
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,840
 You're so... It must have been.

850
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,200
 I'm sorry, I can't remember.

851
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,040
 Do you know who won?

852
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,560
 Because presumably that's three adult men in the pig costumes.

853
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,400
 So that's a three-on-one situation.

854
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,800
 Okay, I'm going to Google it.

855
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,120
 Okay, so it was a wolf.

856
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:39,680
 You're right.

857
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,080
 So you must be able to guess which football team it was.

858
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,640
 So it was Wolverhampton Wanderers mascot Wolfie,

859
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,040
 and Bristol City happened to have three mascots

860
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,400
 called the three little pigs.

861
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,480
 But actually, no, the three little pigs were only there

862
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,680
 on that day to promote a local double glazing firm.

863
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,800
 Just happened to be on the day that the wolf turned up.

864
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,720
 Oh, no. That's bad luck, isn't it?

865
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,000
 That is such bad luck.

866
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,680
 Promoting glass houses, horrible.

867
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:13,840
 And all four mascots were sent off in disgrace.

868
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,880
 Oh, my goodness.

869
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,920
 That is hilarious.

870
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,640
 That's incredible.

871
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,200
 So funny.

872
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,080
 What was the second house built out of?

873
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,920
 There was one... I know there was one out of bricks.

874
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,800
 It was sticks.

875
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,360
 One of sticks, one of bricks, and one of ostrich feathers.

876
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,400
 Dust free.

877
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,760
 The first mascot ever was, by some accounts,

878
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,000
 a Virgin woman called Bettina.

879
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,840
 This is where the word mascot came from.

880
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:44,480
 So it was popularized by this play called "Mascot" in 1880.

881
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,800
 And at the time, it was a French word for bewitchment or a spell.

882
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,840
 And "Mascot" was about this Virgin called Bettina,

883
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,960
 who turned up to a farm and sort of said to this farmer,

884
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,760
 "Look, I'm blessed.

885
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,080
 As long as no one shags me and I remain a Virgin,

886
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,760
 then your farm will be really lucrative."

887
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,880
 And it was basically this play about this woman having to remain a Virgin

888
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,880
 so that the crops would all grow.

889
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,760
 And it actually ends with her losing her virginity, guys.

890
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,480
 Oh.

891
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,560
 And as a result, no women have ever been allowed

892
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,000
 to be a serial mascot again.

893
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,120
 That's true.

894
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:20,720
 Okay, that's it.

895
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,840
 That is all of our facts.

896
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,200
