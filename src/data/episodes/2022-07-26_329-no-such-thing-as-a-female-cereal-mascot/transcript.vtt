 Hello and welcome to another Working from Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.240
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.240
 and Anatojinsky and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.360
 four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.840
 Starting with fact number one, that's my fact. My fact this week is before hermit crabs,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.360
 we're called hermit crabs, there was a hermit called Crab. This is a man called Roger Crab,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.840
 who his dates were 1621 to 1680 and he was an English soldier, he was a habidasher,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.080
 he was a herbal doctor, an author and a hermit and he predates the naming of hermit crabs.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.280
 So did he live in a kind of shell, which he would periodically exchange for a very slightly

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.040
 larger shell? Are hermit crabs named after him? Well, hermit crabs I believe are named after

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.680
 hermits generally but I don't think he was such a famous hermit that he sort of defined the whole

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.760
 species. He was semi-famous, right? Isn't there a thought that he was a hatter and there's a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.760
 thought that Lewis Carroll's mad hatter was maybe based on him because he was also, it seems,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.080
 quite mad. Yeah, I couldn't find anything that sort of truly links that other than people saying

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.760
 it was thought. Did you get anywhere with that? No, like people were writing about him a lot in

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.640
 the 19th century when Lewis Carroll was also writing, you know, people would reflect back on

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.760
 his life, there were quite a lot of sources, so maybe he was your famous mad hatter. But he wasn't,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.040
 was he, when was he alive? He was 1600s. Oh, okay, cool. They just talked about him a lot.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.720
 Hermit crabs were named in the 1700s, so he predates them only just, but he gets there.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.520
 It's sad, isn't it, in a way, that, you know, he never knew that those animals,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.600
 but if he was a really famous hermit, like you guys are saying, then hermit crabs might

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.560
 have been based on him, you know? Yeah. It's possible. Yeah. And he had sort of a sad life,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.640
 even though I guess he claimed to like it. Didn't he, by the end of his life, he was all about

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.880
 denying himself sort of all pleasures. Yes. And he didn't, he limit himself to potatoes and carrots,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.960
 and then he sort of quit that and just lived off bran and turnip leaves, and then he quit that.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.160
 And by the end of his life, apparently he was living off dock leaves and grass. Yeah,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.320
 he was just eating grass at the end. I don't know if directly mouth to ground, or if he turned it

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.440
 into a sort of picked it and put it in a bowl. Anna, you wrote something last week, which I read,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.680
 which says that you can't eat grass. Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? So I'm not quite sure how

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.040
 he was surviving, maybe he had a cow's stomach implanted into his own body. Because what you need

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.200
 is like cows have the right bacteria in their stomachs, which means that they can break down

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.000
 the cellulose and get to the good stuff inside the grass, but we don't have it in our stomach. So,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.600
 unless he's licked a few cows to get the bacteria, I don't know how he's, I mean,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.040
 maybe he died almost immediately after deciding to eat only grass. It is the last thing on his menu

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.600
 of diet changes. So I think we can assume it might have played a part in that. No, he was,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.960
 yeah, and he was accused of witchcraft in his lifetime as well, because he used to make prophecies.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.800
 I couldn't actually find any of his prophecies, but... I bet I'll die really soon after adopting

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.160
 this brand new diet. But yeah, so good to know he existed. I'd never heard of Roger Crab before.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.120
 He seems like a proper hermit too. He seems like an in it for life hermit, because we briefly

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.080
 mentioned before that you used to be able to kind of hire a hermit for your garden if you're a land

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.880
 owner. Yes. Which is more, they're more in it for the money. There's a guy who's written,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.480
 Gordon Campbell is his name, he's written a book, which has got one of the best book titles ever.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.360
 It's called The Hermit in the Garden from Imperial Rome to Ornamental Gnome. And he tracked down a

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.160
 load of newspaper adverts, which were kind of hiring hermits or advertising for hermits.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.320
 So some said you get £50 a year for life as long as you live underground for the rest of your life

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.480
 and no one sees you. That's one offer. And I think you could ring a bell and a servant would bring

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.680
 you stuff, but you weren't allowed to chat to anyone and you had to grow your hair and your

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.120
 fingernails. So it's really unclear what the land owner gets out of this, but someone took

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.200
 that for four years and stuck it out for that long. But there are so few shops underground,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.080
 it's hard to work out what you'd spend your £50 on. I think Amazon would deliver to your underground

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.920
 place. That's a good point. There was one guy called Charles Hamilton who offered a job on his

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.880
 Surrey estate, which was £700 in exchange for seven years of hermiting. So it's like a fixed-term

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.240
 contract. And the successful applicant took the job and then was founded a local pub three weeks

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:55.280
 into the hermit shop. Wow. Yeah. He lasted longer than I would. I think he was also in that book.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.800
 He talked about Peter the Great's hermitage, which was very much more on the side of not a proper

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.040
 hermitage. I've been to the hermitage in St. Petersburg and if a hermit lived there, he was

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.840
 living at large. Yeah. So actually, that was an even bigger upgrade compared to Peter the Great's

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.760
 original one. But he originally decided to build a hermitage in his garden, which was sort of a

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.800
 retreat from matters of state. And this was in the 1700s when it was quite popular,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.320
 the hermit lifestyle. And this was described as being a hermitage and that it had no servant.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:36.240
 So you were really living like a feral human. And it was two floors and the dining room was on

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.960
 the upper floor and the kitchen was on the lower floor. And there were no stairs going from the

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.320
 lower floor to the upper floor. So the guests, when they arrived, had to be hoisted on chair lift.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.880
 So on their individual chairs, hoisted up onto the upper floor to eat. And then when the table was

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.400
 loaded with food, it would be descended through the floor onto the ground floor, loaded up with food,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.560
 and then hoisted up onto the upper floor again. Sounds so cool.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.720
 Who's doing the hoisting if there are no servants? Because I thought I'd read that there were just

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.920
 no servants on the first floor. Like, obviously, there'll be loads of servants doing all the

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:17.120
 pulling and cooking. Yeah. That's not really living an ascetic life, is it? If, you know,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:24.640
 you only have servants on one of your floors. Come on, he's making an effort. Fair enough.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.880
 There are more modern hermits, aren't there? There was a guy in America called Billy Barr who

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.040
 lived in the Rocky Mountains. And he's really cool because he got bored quite soon into being a hermit

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.040
 or living on his own, let's say. And so he decided to kind of make a diary. And he started measuring

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.560
 the snow levels and all the animal tracks and when the first birdsong would be every year.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.400
 And he did it for 44 years. And now his notes can be used to measure climate change,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.040
 which I think is really cool. They're actually using his diary to say, "Ah, wait a minute. In

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.880
 1970 something, the birds sang on this date and now they're singing on this date."

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.960
 Are there any awkward entries in the diary which they have to just skip over where he--

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:15.200
 Wow. In 1976, he started masturbating in June, but in 1970-80, he started masturbating in May.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.880
 What does this tell us about the temperature in the Rocky Mountains?

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:28.080
 I found a pro hermit in the UK who seems to be operating in the UK, or definitely he's done

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.320
 stints here. So he's an Indian artist called Ansuman Biswas. And he was recruited in 2002

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.400
 by Staffordshire Council to live for a weekend, a weekend of being a hermit in place.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.400
 That's so ridiculous. Well, we've all been in our house for three months.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.000
 So that was 2002. He was paid 600 quid to live in a grotto for a weekend, not bad.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.560
 Then in 2009, there's a news report of Manchester Museum hiring a hermit, guess who it is? It's

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.840
 Indian artist Ansuman Biswas again. And then he's done another one. Recently, this year,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.000
 he was going to do the Horniman Museum in South London and live there. He was going to be locked

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.800
 in their clock tower. But unfortunately, due to everyone staying at home, he was not allowed

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:22.880
 to become a hermit. That's so amazing. So when lockdown finishes, he gets to go and lock down

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.560
 again. Really? Yeah, I wonder if hermits have generally been furloughed across the board.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:36.320
 Apparently, I was reading a Victorian source reflecting back on hermits throughout time,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.160
 and it was such a religious thing. And all religions seem to have this tradition about

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.200
 self-denying. And this source was saying that basically the women did it properly and the men

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.040
 didn't really do it. So it said that basically there's a division between hermits proper and

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.120
 recluses. And hermits proper tend to see quite a lot of people have guests go out into the world,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.600
 and then recluses are the ones that don't see anyone. And it said it was basically done down

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.560
 gender lines. So the recluses would be women and they would see nobody. But then actually,

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.520
 I think because anchoresses were the recluses, essentially, and they were meant to be hermits.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.880
 Again, Julian of Norwich, a very, very famous example, and they essentially were Agneons,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.360
 I think, which so they would deliberately have their hermitages built in the middle of quite a

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.560
 busy thoroughfare. Like in the Trafford Centre or something. Yeah. And then you would just go

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.880
 and sit next to her and say, "Oh, I'm feeling a bit sad today. I've been doing some sins."

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.680
 And then she'd help you. She'd say, "Well, at least you don't live in a box in the Trafford

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.480
 Centre with anyone allowed to come up to you anytime." My friend Jenny lived in a box in

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.560
 the Trafford Centre for a little while. Did she? Yeah, Jenny Ryan actually from the chase.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.240
 No way. Yeah, she did. I don't know if that's on record. I suppose it must be.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.520
 What do you mean she... I don't fully know what this box is. Is it just a cardboard box?

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.120
 Do you remember David Blaine? Yeah.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.560
 He lived in a box for a while. Well, I think this was pre-Blaine. She was in a competition

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.160
 where she had to go and sit in a box for as long as possible in the Trafford Centre.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.840
 Wow, cool. I think this is right. It might be the Arndale Centre. But the basics are...

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.880
 The basics of the story are true.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.960
 Wow. So did you visit her in the box and tell her your problems?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.480
 It was a long time ago. I don't think so. I think I was at university.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.400
 You can't remember if you visited your friend in a box in a mall.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:31.840
 The fact that I can't remember it suggests I didn't. But it also suggests that I'm a terrible

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.840
 friend. So I don't know which way to go. There was also... So the more sort of social hermits

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.720
 we mentioned a long time ago on the podcast, the stylites, which I find so interesting.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:49.680
 The idea this was during the Byzantine Empire, you would have... So we're talking sort of the year

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:59.040
 432. It would be just... Byzantine Empire. So around 432.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.880
 Oh, a magnificent but very short-lived empire. It's like a weekend hermitage, that empire.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:15.120
 So the idea of this was it was gigantic poles in the city centres and people would climb up them

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.800
 and they would become hermits up there and just stay there for their lifetime. And

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.560
 they would like the pulley systems. It would send up food to them and they would stand and preach.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.520
 So they were hermits, but they were also giving out sort of religious advice the whole time.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.240
 It would be their soapboxes, it were.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.720
 It feels a bit unfair. Have you heard of Mary of Egypt?

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:39.920
 No. She was a very early hermit and she isolated herself to atone for her insatiable carnal appetites.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.400
 Which just seemed to be she liked having sex with people.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.120
 Oh wait, did she also step on top of a massive pole?

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:53.360
 But all the stories about her say she wasn't even charging money to have sex with people,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.680
 as if that was the worst element of the story.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:02.800
 But she ended up still naked, didn't she? At the end, didn't someone stumble upon her in the desert?

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.640
 And she was unclothed. So I'm not saying she wasn't sticking to her vows, but...

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.840
 It's very hot in the desert.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.760
 It was hot.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.120
 Couple of things on hermit crabs. So hermit crabs are really great.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:22.960
 There we go. That's all we got. No. Do you know how old the oldest pet hermit crab known

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.160
 is? God. I'd say about 35.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.480
 That's good. Dan?

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.280
 15 days.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.440
 15 days. Okay. I'm underegging it this time.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.680
 I'm in an Argo middle. So 13 years old.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:44.400
 James is closest. It's 42. It was 42 last year. And it's... He lives at a retirement home,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.280
 which is very nice.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.840
 Oh yeah.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.720
 Because his owner also lives at a retirement home and it's called the Shell Point Retirement

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.800
 Community. He's hoping to move into a bigger retirement home next year, isn't he?

00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:01.840
 But they do. They upgrade their homes, don't they? It's the most incredible thing about them.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.240
 And the way that they do it is... It makes our property ladder look very simple.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.360
 So a hermit crab will have its shell on its back, its house on its arse.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.840
 And then its arse starts getting bigger and its house becomes too small for it.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.000
 And so it'll find another shell that's a bit bigger, but often this shell will be too big.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.560
 It's like a mansion. And so then they'll have to wait for another hermit crab to come along,

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.880
 that's sort of a different size. And then enough hermit crabs have to come along

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.440
 in all different sizes that they can line up from smallest to largest.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.000
 And then the largest one can move into the vacant,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.320
 hugest shell. And everyone else can move up one shell.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.120
 That's amazing.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.200
 It's insane. How are they organizing it? It doesn't make any sense.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.200
 It's brilliant. It's so cool. And there are videos of it, right, online.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.520
 People have to Google "hermit crabs moving house" and look at the videos because they're

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.200
 absolutely amazing. It's incredible.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.680
 But sometimes two chains kind of get to the same shell at the same time.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.080
 And then the two biggest hermit crabs have to have a fight with each other to see who's

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.520
 going to get the big shell. And everyone in your queue is going to get a new house

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.440
 if you win the fight. Do you know what I mean?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:11.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.680
 And so all the little guys are watching these two big guys fighting thinking,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.960
 "I hope my guy wins." But then sometimes they swap queues and go to it and see that one of

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.880
 the other guys is doing a bit better in the fight and kind of sneak over and join his team.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.600
 That is amazing.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.760
 Incredible. That is amazing.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:36.000
 They also, there's cases of gangs of hermit crabs coming to steal a single hermit crab's shell.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.440
 So they nick it for their mate. And I read that that's the reason that they have extremely

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.400
 long penises because if you're having sex as a hermit crab and you leave your shell to go have

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:52.480
 sex because of your smaller penis, then you're leaving your home open for burglary.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:59.040
 So by having a very long penis, you can stay indoors at home, but send your penis out for sex.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.240
 I'll get through the letterbox.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.920
 Exactly.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:08.400
 So if you're a shy hermit crab, you have more sperm than if you're a brave hermit crab.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.680
 Really? This was found out by scientists who startled hermit crabs.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:19.840
 So they would take a crab from its tank, kind of scare it and then put it back.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.280
 And then the crab would go into its shell because it was scared.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.040
 And then they would measure how long it would take before he came back out again to see if

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:32.960
 everything was okay. And they compared that with the amount of sperm in their sperm metaphors,

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.240
 which is what they used to make. They have little bundles of sperm.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.920
 And they found that the ones who were shy have more sperm than the ones who are brave.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:48.400
 Do they know why? Well, is it that what they said is that there are two different approaches.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.960
 You can either have a live fast, die young approach where you just go out and do it or

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.800
 like the more successful ones have a stay safe and protect your giant sperm package approach.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:05.200
 Right. So it was the idea that they sort of know they've got this valuable package.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.960
 And they're really trying to preserve it.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.880
 Yeah. But the ones who have got less good package of sperm,

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.640
 they have to go out and find the females. It has to be more outgoing.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.840
 So actually me staying in my room and reading throughout my university years was just because

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.240
 I'm an exceptionally high quality male. Is that what we're saying?

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.960
 Or that you were storing up a lot of sperm in the tank that other people were utilizing.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.640
 Okay. It is time for fact number two. And that is James.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:46.720
 Okay. My fact this week is that Magna Carta smells of newly pressed sheets with traces of old socks.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.640
 So this is the Institute of Digital Archaeology.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.840
 And they're planning an exhibition called Sensational Books,

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.080
 which will be at the Bodleian in Oxford and at the New York Public Library.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.200
 And what they've done is they've taken a load of old books and they've taken the essence of

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.160
 the smell from all of these books. And you're going to be able to go and smell what these old

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.360
 books smell like basically. And what they do is they take the book and they put it in a sealed

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.760
 chamber and they fire a load of air over it for 24 hours. And then they capture the particulates or

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.480
 the little kind of molecules from the book. And then they can take those filters,

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.400
 they spin them around, spin them around, spin them around until they turn into like some kind of

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.160
 paste. And then that paste they can use to synthesize the odor. So they can work out

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.000
 exactly what's in it and they can make new versions of it. But if you're one of the first

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.440
 people to go to the exhibition, you'll be able to get the actual smell that they found from the box.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.120
 So it's one of those things that if you're in the first couple of people who go,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.960
 you're going to get the really good stuff. And if you go a few weeks after it's open,

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.040
 then you're going to get something that smells exactly the same, but isn't the true Magna Carta

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.640
 smell. Okay. Well, because they would have really created it based on those chemicals.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:06.560
 So basically, we've invented the smell printing press 600 years after the actual printing press.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:12.160
 Yeah, you could say that kind of. These face makes it look like you can't say that.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.680
 Are they going to release a Magna Carta scratch and sniff? Because that'd be awesome.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.080
 I think they might do that. I think I might have said this before that I went to a smell

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.640
 museum in Sunderland once and I got a book, which you could get all the smells of different

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.480
 things. And it was a scratch and sniff thing. And you could smell the sun and you could smell

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.120
 like the death mask of Toots and Car Moon and stuff like that. Wow. That's what I'm suggesting.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.800
 Okay. Yeah. Some of the better smells that are going to be in this exhibition,

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:44.080
 CS Lewis's private collection smell is going to be, you can smell his cigars very slightly

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:50.160
 in the background. That's incredible. Isn't that cool? And there's going to be books from Boston,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.160
 which smell a bit like molasses. Because do you remember there was a big flood of molasses in

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.480
 Boston where there's like sugar went down the street and I think killed a few people. But

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:04.160
 is it someone's diary writing about the molasses flood saying, oh no, it's coming in the door?

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.440
 I think it would probably be someone's library from the time which got covered in molasses.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.720
 But yeah. Wow. I hope that that hermit who recorded all the snow isn't going to have his diary

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:23.600
 done because it's going to be a heavy center semen. Okay. Can we talk about Magda Carter, please?

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.640
 Yeah. We should say what it was, sort of like, what is this thing?

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:35.200
 Basically, King John, we had a king who was spending loads of money on stupid things,

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.760
 like going battling in France and stuff like that. And then we had all the barons in Britain

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:45.440
 who owned all the land, but the king was basically really pissing them off quite a lot.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.240
 And he was making them give him money and he was doing nasty things to their families and stuff

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.520
 like that. And so they'd had enough and they were like, fuck this, we're going to get rid of the king.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.840
 One time they tried to assassinate him. And then a few years later, they went down and they said,

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.760
 look, we have had enough. And he said, okay, okay, okay, I'll make a load of new laws that

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.440
 stop me from being an asshole. And they said, right, fine. And so they all agreed to all these

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:16.640
 laws. And then a few weeks later, he went, only joking. Pranked you. I was crossing my fingers.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.320
 Yeah. He contacted the Pope saying, I've been forced to sign this dreadful document. Can you

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:28.480
 cancel it? And the Pope did so. He said, oh yeah, I'll issue a papal bull. And so that was 10 weeks

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.480
 after he signed it. I thought it was this huge founding document of English law and liberty.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.280
 And it turns out it lasted 10 weeks. Well, it didn't because it became,

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.760
 it was reissued 10 years later and then it did stay on the statute books. But do you know what

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.560
 he had to give the Pope in exchange for the Pope admitting to that? He had to give him

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.520
 England. And that has never been reneged on. So the way he got the Pope on site, the Pope was

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.320
 actually really pissed off with John because there was this absurd situation where King John wanted

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.280
 one Archbishop of Canterbury, the Barons wanted another. They thought, so the Pope picked a third

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.600
 and then King John just hadn't let the third come into England. And the Pope would like,

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.560
 you know, got really pissed off and banned England from doing any kind of mass or anything.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.360
 So the Pope hated John. So John got him back on site by saying, I'll give you the whole of England

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:20.160
 as a papal fiefdom. And we'll pay sort of rent to hire it off you every year if you say that I

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.280
 don't need to stick to this Magna Carta. And formally, the papacy has never resigned its claim.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:32.160
 So technically, it could come up to England and say, can I claim sort of a few centuries of rent

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:40.240
 off you please? That sounds classic King John. He sounds like he just got a lot of stuff wrong

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.840
 because he was never meant to be king, was he? He was seen as the worst of the brothers or the

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:52.560
 sons of the previous King. Most famous of all, if you don't know King John, is he plays the lion

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.360
 in the Robin Hood Disney animation? Justin Hood in your head, who we're talking about.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.560
 And he had many brothers, one of who was Richard the Lionheart, and his father,

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:08.960
 the King, gave them all bits of land. So Henry, his oldest son was given Normandy in England,

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.120
 and Jeffrey was given Brittany. They all got given stuff, except for King John,

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.400
 who was just given a nickname, which was Lackland, because he was given absolutely nothing.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.920
 So he must have been such a prick as a young man for his father, the King, to be handing out

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.800
 all this lovely land to people, and he says, I'll give you this, and I'll give you this,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:32.320
 and I'll give you this, and you're going to get the nickname Lackland. He must have been awful

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:38.160
 as a young person as well. Or he was meant to be a priest or something like this,

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.800
 but then the other three all died, didn't they? And slowly but surely, he got closer to the throne.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.560
 It really is very hard to find a revisionist historian who's willing to back John up.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:52.240
 Most people will say, well, there's another side to this story, but he was basically a dickhead.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.280
 Not that the Barons were the greatest guys ever, right? They just wanted power for themselves,

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.800
 but I hadn't realized that the Barons, before Magna Carta was signed, and they were trying to

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:07.200
 negotiate with John or overthrow him, took control of London. So while John was off fighting his

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.080
 wars in France, the Barons marched into London, surrounded by walls, and just took over completely,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.560
 and he came back to find it ruled by Barons. And the way they'd got in, he said,

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.800
 how on earth did you get in? Because it's surrounded by these walls. It's meant to be defended.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.480
 And they said they just found a ladder lying up against the wall and all climbed over it.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.640
 And I just find it so weird that to take control of a city, you could just leave a ladder,

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.120
 a surreptitiously lying against the wall, and the whole army of Barons climbs over it.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.320
 That's so good. It's bizarre.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.200
 But then after Magna Carta and after it was repealed, the French came along and took over

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.600
 London, which you don't often read about in like in schools and stuff. But basically,

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:50.080
 there was a civil war straight afterwards between the King and the Barons. And the Barons were

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:56.400
 known as the Northerners, which I like. And the French came along and King Louis just came along

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:02.720
 and went to London and was proclaimed King. Was proclaimed King. And then at the end of the war,

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:08.080
 when he went back in the end, he signed a treaty saying, oh no, I wasn't King. No, honestly, I wasn't.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:15.280
 But he was given 10,000 marks to do so. So basically King John just bought him up.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.680
 And said, is that a lot of money we're talking?

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.480
 10,000 marks? Well, I assume it must be.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.280
 It seems unlikely he would have backed off for not a lot of money, doesn't it?

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.440
 I mean, he was in control of more than half of England. I'm sure it was more than a fiver.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.680
 It seems like it was a lot done. Yeah.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.960
 Yeah. Well, no, they were just giving away a lot of weird things at the time,

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.840
 like England to the Pope. Just curious what the equivalents were.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.120
 But it didn't do King John any good, all this stuff, because he died in 1216,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.040
 so the year after Magna Carta. And at the time, he was also not popular,

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:53.040
 because the medieval writer, Matthew Parris, wrote that hell itself is made fouler by the

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:59.680
 presence of John. Why did we book him to deliver the eulogy? What's going on?

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:06.080
 There were some weird clauses in Magna Carta, weren't there? Given that it's held up as this,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.080
 like the start of, it's a British constitution, basically. It was the start of the rule of law

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.840
 in England, and then what became Britain. A lot of individual people mentioned.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.240
 Like shoutouts. Were there birthday shoutouts in the Magna Carta?

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.640
 Shoutout to the Lionheart. It was basically that, but the opposite of a shoutout,

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:30.080
 saying you're banned from ever holding royal office. And so if any of these people are listening,

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:37.600
 Engelard de Segoigne, Peter Guy, Philip and Mark, and your brothers, and Jeffrey, your nephew,

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:45.120
 none of you can have. And your mum. And your mum. None of these people can hold royal office.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.440
 Very specific. It's a profounding constitution to name Bill, Bob and Mary.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:55.040
 They had one bit in Magna Carta, which basically had complete freedom of immigration.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.920
 As long as you were a merchant, you're allowed to come to Britain and work as much as you wanted.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.520
 James, this is you're throwing a cat amongst the pigeons here.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:10.960
 It's quite interesting, isn't it? And they also, they said that no one shall be arrested or imprisoned

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.800
 on the appeal of a woman for the death of any person except her husband.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:19.280
 Yeah. I'm constantly accusing people of murder, and if my word would take them seriously,

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:25.200
 there was this thought that women were constantly saying, oh, this bloke murdered someone,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:31.440
 and weren't to be trusted. But I think one of the reasons it was thought to be happening is because

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.800
 women are exempt from trial by battle. So if as a man, you accuse someone else of having murdered

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:42.560
 someone, then you could do a trial by battle where you'd have to fight that person and you might die.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.400
 And so often men ask their wives to accuse the person instead.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.240
 If you were in a battle with that person who you accused of being a murderer and you lost

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.840
 that battle, your final words would be like, see, I told you it was a murder.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.640
 It's like Minority Report. It's a predicted murder.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.680
 So we thought there were only a few of the Magna Carta's around the place.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:11.520
 We thought we knew how many there were. And the most recent discovery of one was in 2015.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:17.760
 And this was a 1300 one, which is so recently to have found a new one of these.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:24.640
 It was found in a scrapbook in a council archive in a sandwich in Kent.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.680
 And the really nice thing was it was kind of sandwiched into the scrapbook.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.240
 Yeah, it's just in there folded up and it's a bit tatty and it's a bit moldy and it's a

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.120
 bit wet, but it's still a Magna Carta from 1300. So it's worth up to 10 million pounds.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.560
 They're all different shapes, aren't they? Because they're on parchment made of sheep's

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:50.720
 bodies, made of sheepskin. And so I didn't realise that basically the thing that you wrote on,

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.760
 it was dictated to by the shape of the sheep. So if you had a really fat sheep,

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.760
 then you had a particularly big parchment.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:01.120
 That's why he was writing and his brothers and his mum. He was just trying to fill the space.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.480
 I've seen Magna Carta. You've seen Magna Carta?

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:13.200
 Yeah, I went to, there was an exhibition at the British Library in 2015, I think it was.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:19.680
 And they only, they didn't let many people in. I think there was 1217 people were allowed in

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:26.960
 to see it as a nod to the deck. Oh, because it was signed in 1215, but they let in 1217 people.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.400
 Dan climbed in through the roof.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:38.320
 Sorry, you're right. It was 1215 people. No, really. Amazing.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:43.280
 Oh man, imagine if I was at the end of the queue and I'd counter them all and like,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:49.280
 "We're fine, we're fine, we're getting in." You have ticket number 1217.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:57.440
 Yes. It was amazing to see. It was, it felt like you were,

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:03.120
 you were witnessing the foundations of not only British law, but American as well.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.160
 It was, it was, was it, how was it kept? Was it in a box?

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.600
 No, it was, no, cause, oh yeah, yeah, like a C3.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:16.480
 Imagine if you went to see that and it's just in a box, you're like,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.400
 "Can we look inside the box?" No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.880
 Jenny Ryan is inside the box and she's busy thinking.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:31.120
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.440
 My fact is that Ford has a car wash made of giant ostrich feather dusters.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.040
 The whole car wash. The whole thing, yeah.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:47.600
 It's really good. It's this huge frame. So it's, it's at their factory in Valencia in Spain and

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.440
 it's, it's to clean the cars, but not exactly the way that a car wash does,

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:56.000
 but it looks exactly like a car wash. So once the frames are stamped and welded together,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.160
 they need painting, but they've still got some dust on them probably at that point.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.240
 And that car painters hate the dust because obviously you're just painting dust,

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.360
 you're not painting the car, it doesn't give you a nice smooth coat.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:13.280
 So it goes through this huge machine, which is lined with massive sort of,

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.120
 it looks like a really upsetting Donna Kebab covered in feathers,

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.440
 like those elephant legs that you're getting in Kebab shops.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.640
 It's that, but it's just covered and swirling round and round and round and it's covered in

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.000
 ostrich feathers. Like, so to get rid of the dust that they have these feathers,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.480
 is there no better material that we've invented over the last 100 years?

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.680
 You would think there would be, but it turns out that ostrich feathers in particular

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.320
 are really good for dusters because they have these tiny little sort of barbules,

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.080
 these sort of micro hooks, which are really good at picking up the dust.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.840
 And they also, they prevent static electricity from building up,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.680
 which is also useful for the process. So yeah, so this is their process.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.720
 So if you whack an ostrich, are they really dusty? Do they,

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.120
 do they just emit huge plumes? I guess.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:06.720
 BMW says that it, in 2004 release, BMW said it exclusively uses ostrich feathers to dust

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.960
 all of its cars. And yeah, because they claim, because of this innate static charge,

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.280
 not found to the same degree in other feathers.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.960
 I thought they used emu. That's interesting. I wonder if they've swapped.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.640
 Or maybe they do emu in Australia, but they certainly in 2004.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.840
 No, they don't. They've actually got, they've got an emu farm in Bavaria,

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.160
 which is where they get their emu feathers from.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.240
 So maybe that's, oh wow, yeah, maybe they've gone to ostrich.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.400
 Well, ostrich and emu are pretty similar, aren't they?

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.240
 Yeah. Sorry to be reductive about it.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.720
 So ostrich feathers, they are now used for cars,

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.720
 but they've been really popular as fashion items for quite a long time, haven't they?

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.200
 And if you were an ostrich farmer, you could make millions from just getting the feathers

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.480
 off your ostriches and selling them on. So cool.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.760
 They used to have feather palaces in South Africa,

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.800
 which aren't what they sound like, because that would be a terrible building material.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.160
 It was just around about the 1880s.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.040
 And South Africa provided about 85% of the world's ostrich feather supply, I think.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.360
 And the feather palaces were palaces built by people who got rich off the back of ostrich feathers.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.400
 That's still there.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:16.720
 They went out of fashion because of, there was a, I think it was morning fashions changed.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.920
 So it used to be, or big daft hats stopped being in fashion, basically.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.520
 Well, it was partly because of cars.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.480
 Yeah. I went to the Hat Museum and they said it was because of cars.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.320
 Because when you get into a car, if you have a big hat with a feather on top,

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.880
 then it's going to get squashed by the top of the car.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.880
 Yeah, or knocked off as you get in and you have to replace your hat at the end of every car journey.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.200
 You go, "Oh, shit. It's on the road somewhere."

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.480
 And also there was actually quite a strong campaign.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.680
 This is in America where they thought they were going to widen the market.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.200
 There was a really strong protection of birds movement in America, which I didn't know about.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.680
 This was around the turn of the 20th century.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:57.200
 And these two women, Harriet Hemingway and Minna Hall, led this campaign against hat plumes,

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.200
 which were all the rage.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.600
 And they used to hold these big swarries and invite loads of women to their parties

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.120
 and then persuade them not to have bird feathers on their hats.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.160
 And it really worked.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:13.280
 And it ended up being banned in Massachusetts to have feathers used in the bird trade on your hats.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.840
 And so that kind of screwed the industry too.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.600
 Yeah. Does anyone have stuff just more generally on ostriches?

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.320
 Yeah.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:20.960
 Yeah.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.120
 Oh, great. Dad, you sounded like you were really up for it.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.320
 So let's hear it.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.240
 Yep. So ostriches are so fast.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.320
 They are ridiculously fast.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.960
 So they've got a land speed that they can reach the top speed of 43 miles per hour,

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.600
 which is insane.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.680
 And it's too fast even for them to be able to work out what to do.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.560
 Like if it was us running, we would lose all control.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.400
 And this is where the feathers and their wings come into huge use.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.000
 They act as basically rudders for them as they're running.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.480
 So when they reach these speeds, they can bring their wings up and they can zigzag

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.400
 using their wings to sort of push them in directions with the wind against them.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.360
 Oh, that's clever.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.400
 Yeah. It's extraordinary.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.920
 And they can break suddenly by pushing their wings out and using their feathers to sort of break the

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.960
 wind on them.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.000
 It's an incredible thing, but that is so fast.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.280
 Have we talked about their penises?

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.240
 It's not yet, but I think everyone knew it was coming.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.200
 Okay, great.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:23.120
 So very few birds have penises, 3% of bird species, the males have a penis,

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.720
 but ostriches are among them.

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.280
 But when they have an erection, what do you think it's full of?

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.120
 Blood.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.840
 Right. There we go. It's not blood.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.600
 They've got blood, obviously.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.200
 They're not saying ostriches don't have blood,

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.520
 but they don't fill their penises with it to get an erection.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.280
 They fill it with lymphatic fluid.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.320
 Sand.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:42.800
 Sand.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.160
 Just thinking what they have around.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.760
 That's a very uncomfortable experience for the lady ostrich, I think.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.200
 It's full of sand.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.600
 No, they're full of lymphatic fluid, which is so weird.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:01.120
 And there's a big problem because lymphatic fluid in an ostrich body is under much lower

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.640
 pressure than blood.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.440
 Their lymph fluid pressure is much lower than their blood pressure.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.280
 And what this means is that they can keep an erection for a few seconds maximum.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.400
 Oh, wow.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.440
 It's a real problem.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.160
 And so it means all mating is incredibly short because it just,

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.800
 as soon as they've got an erection, they have to have sex or they're not going.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.960
 And all the males are constantly apologizing,

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.480
 but all the females are constantly going,

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.000
 "No, it honestly is completely normal."

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.640
 But how quickly can they get an erection again after they've deflated?

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.560
 Unclear, not sure.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.560
 You think it's like an up and down sort of...

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.160
 I think it's like when you're trying to blow up a balloon and you get that initial,

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.400
 and then it goes back down because you've lost breath,

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.640
 you can go right back into it, right?

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.840
 So...

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.600
 Dan, you've got to pinch your fingers over the seal when you bring it out the way.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.160
 Sorry, are we talking about ostrich penises or balloons now?

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:56.080
 I'll go to your next children's party then.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:00.000
 I think it's that ostriches do get turned on by humans.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.280
 There was a study done quite recently which won an Ig Nobel Prize.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:09.680
 And it was that both male and female ostriches do way more mating dances

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.600
 and movements when there are humans nearby.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.840
 This is in farmed ostriches, I should say.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.040
 So it seems that they find the farmers attractive

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.280
 and it makes them feel a bit more amorous.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.480
 And the guy who worked this out was a scientist called Charles Paxton.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:30.000
 But we have mentioned his work before because he was also the person who worked out

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.600
 that a lot of people who saw sea monsters actually saw the penis of a whale.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:35.840
 Yes.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.640
 Because whales mate in threesomes.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.520
 And there's always one spare penis floating around.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.920
 And that very could be the idea where sea monsters come from.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.600
 What does this guy's CV look like?

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.160
 That's so cool.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.560
 They've got really big eggs, ostriches, obviously.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.560
 Big bird, big eggs, makes sense.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.600
 Do you know how long it takes to cook an ostrich egg?

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.320
 Hard boiled.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.480
 Hard boiled, an hour, one hour.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.520
 Yeah, good guess.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.960
 Yeah, it's about an hour and a half, roughly, to cook an ostrich egg.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.720
 I like trying a little bit softer, actually.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.400
 Oh, well, there you go, perfect.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:19.280
 I found that out on a BBC website that gave recipes for boiling different kinds of eggs.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.920
 So the next closest that they had on the list was a goose egg,

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.800
 which takes roughly 13 minutes to hard boil.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.120
 So that's, in terms of size difference, that just gives you an idea of how big they are.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:34.240
 But what's weird is they have incredibly tiny eggs in relation to their body size.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.520
 So they should have much larger eggs than they do.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.200
 Yeah, you could argue that they have the smallest eggs in the animal kingdom,

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.320
 in their bird kingdom, right, compared to their body size.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.120
 Oh, wow.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:53.040
 Because, yeah, actually, when they're born, they are surprisingly cute because they're so tiny,

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.400
 but also creepily fast.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.920
 So when they're three weeks to a month old, they look microscopic,

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.000
 but they can already run at 50 kilometers an hour.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.720
 And it's literally smaller than a chicken.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.960
 It's a tiny, big, large snack.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.240
 That's so good.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.320
 I was reading the other day, this is off topic,

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:13.280
 but this was about a guy who saw an insect called a deer botfly,

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.080
 and it was in the early 20th century, I think.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.080
 And he wrote, he was an entomologist,

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:23.280
 and he wrote that he'd seen this botfly flying at 300 yards per second.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.080
 No.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.040
 If that was true.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.920
 And this was, they reported it in the New York Times,

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.280
 it was such a fast insect.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.760
 They were like, this guy has found the fastest insect ever.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:38.000
 And it turns out now that we found other deer botflies,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 and they're not flying nearly as they find quite fast,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.880
 but not that fast.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:46.000
 Because that is so fast that if it was in a 100 meter race with Usain Bolt,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.240
 it would have reached the end before Usain Bolt had been able to react to the gun.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:55.440
 How nervous is this guy claiming to measure that?

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.960
 How fast was he running?

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.280
 But he claimed he was keeping up with it enough.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.720
 Exactly.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.440
 What he's seen is two botflies.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.120
 That's what he's seen.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.520
 That's impressive in its own way.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.120
 What, you think he saw a botfly, then travelled 20 miles home,

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:11.920
 saw another one?

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.840
 Cute.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.640
 It's you again.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:23.680
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.200
 and that is Anna.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.480
 My fact this week is that according to Kellogg's,

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.040
 Tony the Tiger is an adult cartoon.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.040
 Oh boy.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.240
 I think it's because he's naked, so it's obscene.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.640
 I can't picture him, because I can't picture anything,

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.080
 but on the boxes, do you only see his top half, then, his that?

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.520
 No, you get his full body.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.040
 Yeah, he's really buff as well.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.840
 And he's naked.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.040
 Do you see his, you don't see his, no.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:51.840
 No.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.200
 I thought you didn't see his top.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.000
 I'm going to have to look it up.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.800
 Has he got like a bowl of cornflakes over his genitals?

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.520
 Yeah.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.960
 Actually, he has no genitals.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.200
 Yeah, of course he doesn't.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.400
 He's a cartoon character.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:04.720
 He's...

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.520
 He's been spayed.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.600
 He has been spayed.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.000
 When you get spayed, they don't cut your penis up.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.920
 So what did I pay for?

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:17.920
 But hang on, Anna, with your chocolate,

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.960
 name a single cartoon character for children

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.400
 whose penis is hanging out.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.600
 Dan, I think we've established Tony the Tiger

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.720
 is not for children.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.360
 But some of them wear trousers, right?

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.400
 Some of them wear trousers.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.840
 So you would assume that they...

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.480
 They've got something underneath.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.520
 Although Winnie the Pooh doesn't.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.440
 Winnie the Pooh, T-shirt, only no trousers.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:37.600
 Yeah.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.080
 Strong look.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:38.400
 Donald Duck.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.800
 Donald Duck, you don't see that corkscrew duck penis

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.760
 coming out of him, do you?

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.040
 Okay.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.720
 Okay, let's be clear actually about why he's an adult cartoon

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.520
 because it's not ready to do with the pornographic elements.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.440
 This is about the government trying to reduce sugar

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.480
 in children's cereals.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.920
 So in 2017, the government said that by 2020, this year,

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.880
 sugary products that targeted children

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.760
 should have voluntarily, but still should have,

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.320
 reduce their sugar content by 20%.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.640
 And so Ketlogs tried it out with frosties,

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.120
 took 20% of the sugar out.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.560
 I think there was sort of a tasting thing

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.800
 and everyone went, "Well, this is absolutely disgusting."

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.720
 And so rather than take the sugar out,

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.480
 they actually sort of rebranded frosties as an adult cereal.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.080
 And so the argument was that

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.160
 they're not targeting children with frosties

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.640
 and they've removed all children's advertising,

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.200
 like anything on the pack that aims at children.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.680
 And they've said that there was a spokesperson

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.480
 actually this year speaking on behalf of Ketlogs

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.000
 who said that with frosties,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.840
 they're recruiting new shoppers into the brand

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.200
 and in particular adult shoppers under 28 years old

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.960
 in the pre-life family stage.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.440
 And so that was their defense.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.440
 And they said that they'd done some research

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.040
 and found out that most of the people

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.600
 who eat frosties are millennials, did they?

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.400
 They've, I don't know how rigorous the stats that they've got are,

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.040
 but they certainly say that, yeah,

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.880
 their research tells them that it's mostly millennials

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.760
 in the growing market.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.760
 I read, I think it was in the article

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.200
 in the Telegraph about this,

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.040
 where they said that it was only one in five people

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.560
 who eat frosties as a child,

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.400
 but then the Telegraph did also point out

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.800
 that one in five people in the UK is a child.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.840
 So it's basically the same proportion.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.640
 So that makes sense that it's not targeting children

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.800
 if it's the same proportion as the population.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.480
 That makes sense, but it also means

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.040
 that they're targeting children as well as adults, right?

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.360
 Yeah, right. They're sort of targeting everyone.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.040
 Although apparently millennials have changed

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.960
 the way that cereals are advertised now

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.880
 because we are eating them more.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.400
 I suppose there was that cereal cafe

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.200
 that made a big hoohah and shawditch or somewhere,

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.320
 but they've started advertising cereals

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.680
 to not be eaten at breakfast

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.120
 because the idea is that millennials

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.280
 don't have time in the morning to eat cereal.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.560
 So if you watch adverts now,

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.760
 I think there's one with them sitting

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.960
 with Tony the Tiger on a sofa, these two blokes,

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.200
 and it's obviously a mid-afternoon,

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.240
 and they're watching some telly and eating some cereal.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.640
 How can you tell it's mid-afternoon?

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.760
 They're watching pointless.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:08.160
 So there were other rival figures for Tony the Tiger.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.600
 It could have been Katie the Kangaroo

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.000
 or Elmo the Elephant or Newt the GNU.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.160
 Those were all rejected.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:19.520
 I just think Newt the GNU was rejected.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.040
 So that's fair enough.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.040
 But it's not alliterative

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.080
 unless you don't pronounce the G in GNU.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.480
 What kind of maniac would not pronounce the G in GNU?

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.760
 It's the most fun letter to say.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:34.000
 And also, he's named after another animal.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.040
 That's a very good point.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.240
 I'm not surprised they didn't go with it is all I'm saying.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.560
 I think Newt will have known from the start he was doomed.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.840
 I mean, because also young children,

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.560
 I'm not sure how familiar they are with the GNU

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.040
 as an animal as opposed to the Tiger.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.720
 Yeah, but that's a failing in education.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.240
 That's not the fault of the cereal firm.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.280
 They also were going to go for Henry the Hermit Crabbe

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.640
 when he reached his penis out of his house.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:00.800
 Have you heard of Big Mix?

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.760
 No.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.360
 What do you mean?

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:03.840
 Sorry.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.360
 Big Mix was what?

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.760
 Is that Mick apostrophe S or is it a mix of things?

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.840
 It's mixed with two Xs and big has two Gs just so you know.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.480
 Oh, wait a minute.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.160
 Is this the parents of Little Mix?

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.040
 Yeah, that's absolutely right.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.360
 It was a cereal released in 1990 by Kellogg's

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.280
 and it sounds absolutely horrific.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.560
 It was multiple different cereals all mixed together in the same box.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.120
 So, I mean, pretty well.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:35.040
 But they had their own mascot, which was called Big Mix,

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.680
 and it was a chicken wolf moose pig.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.200
 And basically they've got this horrific cross-bred island

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.520
 of Dr. Moreau animal on the front of the box.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.600
 It's a cryptid, basically, of cereals.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.040
 That is terrifying.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.320
 It is frightening.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.440
 Also, not for children.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.240
 You know, the cereal mascots.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:58.480
 I challenge anyone to name a famous female cereal mascot.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:58.960
 Oh, okay.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.160
 One of the Rice Krispie Elts?

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:02.480
 Is there a female in there?

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.000
 Make, snap, crackle and pop.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.480
 Come on.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.920
 You think one of them's a gal?

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:06.480
 I think they're all male.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.200
 Can't remember.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:07.520
 No.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.080
 Oh, wow.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:08.720
 That's really...

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:08.960
 Right.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.760
 There's a Wikipedia list of all the cereal mascots.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.640
 There is not a single famous mascot.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.120
 Wait, wait, wait.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.960
 Let me try a few more guesses.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.960
 Oh, yeah, you think you're going to be Wikipedia here?

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.200
 No.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.640
 So, wow, that's amazing.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.000
 This is not incredible.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.760
 I mean, I know this probably isn't the hill

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.920
 that I should die on feminism-wise,

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.200
 but let's get a gal on the front of a cereal box.

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.040
 Women can eat cornflakes, too.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.160
 Katie the kangaroo, I guess,

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.880
 would have been your closest then that we know of

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.920
 in this conversation.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:38.720
 Oh, that's true.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.520
 And she was the runner-up.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.400
 Yeah.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.280
 She was down to the...

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.160
 They was down to the last two.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.520
 They got rid of Newt the canoe

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.960
 and Elmo the elephant pretty quickly.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.280
 But Katie the kangaroo was the second last in the running.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.360
 Things could have been so different, guys.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.400
 Not very.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.760
 We could have brought down the patriarchy

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.960
 with Katie the kangaroo.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:58.000
 So, in Japan, they're obviously mad about mascots.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.880
 And the term for it is "urochara."

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.720
 And you had three fundamental components

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.720
 to what made up a "urochara."

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.240
 So, the three things where it must convey

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.560
 a strong message of love for one's hometown.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.560
 Its movement should be unique and unstable or awkward.

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.280
 And it should be unsophisticated or laid back and lovable.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.720
 And it's such a big deal that they,

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.880
 since about 2010, created the "urochara" grand prix,

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.760
 which is all of the mascots come together

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.640
 to be named the ultimate Japanese mascot.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.320
 Oh, I thought you were going to say it's a race,

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.960
 because they have that in soccer teams.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.480
 Football teams in England have like...

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.160
 Every year, they have a Grand National of mascots,

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.720
 where they're all running against each other on like a race.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.360
 Really cool.

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.240
 Do they?

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.320
 Yeah, and the thing is, some of them,

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.480
 some of the mascots is just a normal,

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.840
 quite fit human being with a big head on them.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.840
 And then some of them are in a massive costume

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.960
 that you can hardly move in.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.400
 So, it's just completely unfair.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.840
 But yeah.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.520
 You guys who like football will know about

00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.120
 Wes Bromwich's Boiler Man.

00:46:59.120 --> 00:46:59.840
 Won't you?

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:00.800
 Much better than I do.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.680
 Which I hadn't seen before.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.400
 Well, that's terrifying.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.680
 It's a boiler with arms and legs,

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.280
 because they're sponsored by Boiler Company.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.160
 It was so funny.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.160
 I remember seeing that when it happened.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:08.960
 It was on Twitter.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.040
 And I thought this has to be a hoax.

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.120
 Because Wes Bromwich was quite a big football team.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.080
 It was so weird.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.320
 Boilers, I mean, boilers keep you warm.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.600
 They're cuddly.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.000
 They keep you warm and cosy in your home.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.120
 They're awkward.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:23.600
 Yeah.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.040
 Like you said, they had to be.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:25.360
 Yeah.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.880
 You can make a lot of money by being a mascot.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.920
 I didn't realize that if you were the mascot for, say,

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.880
 a football team or an America baseball team, basketball team,

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.040
 huge amounts of money,

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.000
 because it's usually one person who's got the gig.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 It's not necessarily tens of...

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.840
 You know, I assumed it's a new person,

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.360
 whoever's free on the day, jumped in the suit.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.600
 In America, for sure, they make a lot of money.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.000
 Yeah.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.240
 Because it's not just the actual games.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.560
 And, you know, there's a lot of games,

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.120
 particularly for like basketball and...

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.200
 Well, like every sport, there's a lot of games per season.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.120
 But it's also the private events

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.520
 that they get hired out for and public space events,

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.880
 like in malls.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.760
 And they're actually...

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.680
 They were in a very privileged sporting position

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:06.800
 in America at the moment,

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.440
 because they are one of the only spectators

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.040
 that are allowed to watch sporting matches at the moment.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.640
 So while all the stands are empty,

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.000
 the mascots inside, they're, you know, very COVID-proof.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.800
 Yeah, that's got to qualify as PPE.

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.640
 We need to get more supplies of mascot outfit.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:27.360
 I would be very unhappy in hospital if I saw, you know,

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.920
 Fred the GNU turn up.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.720
 The boiler guy coming up to...

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.800
 Hi, Mr. Shriver, I'm here to deliver you wife's baby.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.960
 Have you heard of Cyril the Swan?

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.200
 Is he from Swansea?

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.040
 Yes, mascot of Swansea City,

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.120
 and an absolute thug by all accounts.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:51.520
 So in 2001, he got into a fight with Millwall's Zampa the Lion,

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.360
 tore off the lion's head and kicked it into the crowd

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.560
 before shouting, "Don't fuck with the swans" at the headless lion.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.080
 Wow.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.360
 Just find a thousand pounds for that.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.640
 Was he the one?

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.680
 There was one who got into a fight with the three little pigs.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.400
 Was that him?

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.440
 I don't actually know if it was him.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.560
 He has got form though.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:14.240
 So he has been accused of throwing pork pies at West Ham fans,

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.880
 pushing over a dog mascot.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.080
 He's had a touchline ban, which is quite a big thing, isn't it?

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.240
 It's quite serious to be banned from the touchline.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.240
 And he was represented at his...

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.320
 After attacking Zampa the Lion,

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.560
 he was represented at the Welsh FA hearing

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.440
 by the same lawyer who defended Eric Cantona

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.040
 after he kicked a fan in the head.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:35.920
 Amazing.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:40.240
 Is he actually raising awareness about how dangerous swans can be?

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.160
 He's not raising any awareness because his Wikipedia page says,

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.720
 "As a mute swan, he doesn't give interviews."

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.840
 Maybe he is in character and he just goes around breaking people's arms.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.280
 With a single blow of his wing.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.360
 Sorry, can we go back to...

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.080
 I can't let this sit, not talked about.

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.320
 Can we talk about these three little pigs

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.440
 that you mentioned very quickly?

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.000
 Yeah.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.440
 Does anyone have information on that?

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.720
 Because I can't really remember it,

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:08.640
 but there was definitely a big fight between three pigs

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.040
 and one of the mascot.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.160
 And I can't remember who the other...

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.280
 I don't think it was a swan.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.280
 I think Bristol City were involved, but I just can't remember.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.640
 Surely it would have been a wolf.

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.240
 If it wasn't a wolf mascot.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.200
 Yeah, who blew down three stadiums.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.400
 You're so right.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.840
 You're so... It must have been.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.200
 I'm sorry, I can't remember.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.040
 Do you know who won?

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.560
 Because presumably that's three adult men in the pig costumes.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.400
 So that's a three-on-one situation.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.800
 Okay, I'm going to Google it.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:39.120
 Okay, so it was a wolf.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:39.680
 You're right.

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.080
 So you must be able to guess which football team it was.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.640
 So it was Wolverhampton Wanderers mascot Wolfie,

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.040
 and Bristol City happened to have three mascots

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.400
 called the three little pigs.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.480
 But actually, no, the three little pigs were only there

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.680
 on that day to promote a local double glazing firm.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.800
 Just happened to be on the day that the wolf turned up.

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.720
 Oh, no. That's bad luck, isn't it?

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.000
 That is such bad luck.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.680
 Promoting glass houses, horrible.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:13.840
 And all four mascots were sent off in disgrace.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:14.880
 Oh, my goodness.

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.920
 That is hilarious.

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:16.640
 That's incredible.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.200
 So funny.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:22.080
 What was the second house built out of?

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.920
 There was one... I know there was one out of bricks.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.800
 It was sticks.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.360
 One of sticks, one of bricks, and one of ostrich feathers.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.400
 Dust free.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.760
 The first mascot ever was, by some accounts,

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.000
 a Virgin woman called Bettina.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.840
 This is where the word mascot came from.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:44.480
 So it was popularized by this play called "Mascot" in 1880.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.800
 And at the time, it was a French word for bewitchment or a spell.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.840
 And "Mascot" was about this Virgin called Bettina,

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.960
 who turned up to a farm and sort of said to this farmer,

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:55.760
 "Look, I'm blessed.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.080
 As long as no one shags me and I remain a Virgin,

00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.760
 then your farm will be really lucrative."

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.880
 And it was basically this play about this woman having to remain a Virgin

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.880
 so that the crops would all grow.

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.760
 And it actually ends with her losing her virginity, guys.

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.480
 Oh.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.560
 And as a result, no women have ever been allowed

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.000
 to be a serial mascot again.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.120
 That's true.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:20.720
 Okay, that's it.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.840
 That is all of our facts.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.200
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.960
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.360

 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.680
 I'm on @Shrieberland, Andy.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.880
 @AndrewHunterM.
