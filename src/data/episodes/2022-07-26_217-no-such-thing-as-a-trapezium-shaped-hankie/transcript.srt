00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 [APPLAUSE]

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 >> Welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Liverpool!

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber, and I'm sitting here when Anna Shazinski

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Andrew Hunter-Marie and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 >> My fact is that the ancient Greeks wiped their bottoms with pebbles.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 [LAUGHTER]

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 >> Well, I heard of the Flintstones.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 [LAUGHTER]

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 >> How would that even work?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 [LAUGHTER]

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 >> This is true. They had pebbles which they used, they're things called "passoi," and we keep discovering them in archaeological digs.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And we know that these were used because--

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 >> The competition.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 [LAUGHTER]

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 >> Yeah, kind of.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 So there was Fishborne, Roman Palace, which is a Roman site in England, had bits of pottery which had partly mineralised excrement on them.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Until they discovered the excrement, they thought they were board game counters, but they weren't.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 >> But I think the word "passoi" means both these pebbles and also board game counters.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 >> Yes.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 >> So it's the same word for both.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 It's like if we have the same word for toilet paper and monopoly piece.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 >> Yeah.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 >> I like the idea, though, that presumably on the dig, they pick it up and they go, "I think this is one of those board game counters, and they get a bit closer."

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And they're suddenly like, "Oh, no, it's not. It's another Pessoi."

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 [LAUGHTER]

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 >> So you said that was a Fishborne, Roman Palace.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 >> Yes, so Dr. Rob Simmons, who's the curator of the Fishborne, Roman Palace, he found out about this.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And he said he thought it was hilarious, and it really appealed to him that for 50 years they've been saying these things were board game tokens in the museum, and now they have to relabel them.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 >> Yeah, it's great.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 >> And there was guidance for the ancient Greeks about how you should use them.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 So there was a bit of advice which said you should use no more than three pebbles.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And anything more than that is actually a bit extravagant, and you don't need it.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 >> How big are the pebbles? They must be like quite big, I reckon.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 >> They're not huge. They're smaller than my hand, I'd say, but they're bigger than a penny.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 >> Okay. Okay.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 >> Do we know if they were in any way effective as in, "Are we doing it wrong now?"

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 >> Would they laugh about it's going, "Paper, is it a pebble, mate? Is it a better option?"

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 >> I don't think it's a better option. I think that can be abrasive.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Obviously, you'll pick smooth pebbles if you can.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 >> So do you think it was like, you know, when you go skimming stones on a beach?

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 And you spend ages selecting the right ones, up and down the beach?

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 >> It must have been like that, where you find one and you go, "I found a really good one."

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 >> It feels to me like the kind of pebble that would be good for skimming

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 would also be good for scraping.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 >> Agreed?

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 >> Yeah.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 >> Actually, they could be a bit dangerous.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Some people who found out about this have written that long-term use could have resulted in local irritation,

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 skin or mucosal damage or complications of external hemorrhoids.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So really, it's not something you want to be doing.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 We're not suggesting it.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 >> No, how is it?

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 >> But the really interesting thing was, some of these pesto, there is a theory that some academics have

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 that not only did they wipe the bottoms with pebbles, they wiped the bottoms with pebbles

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 that had their enemies' names written on them.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 >> So that's the ostracos or the ostracos?

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 >> Right. So was this a thing in ancient Greece where you would write the name of a politician

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 that you didn't like basically on a pebble and then kind of throw it out?

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 >> Yeah, every year there was a meeting.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And if there were enough votes cast, I think it was if there were more than 6,000 votes cast

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 with the names written on them, then whoever got the most votes out of those 6,000 would be cast out from society.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 >> Yeah.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 >> And it was to guard against tyrants.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 So it was a very good way of saying, "Oh, there's an up and coming politician, Jacob Riesmog."

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 He's looking a bit, you know, likely, everyone writes his name on a bit of Postery, wipes it on their butt, problem solved.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 >> But they also, they did this really cool thing in battle in ancient Greece where they had bullets,

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 which they would sort of catapult at the enemy, but they would write insults on the bullets that they threw at people,

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 literally adding insult to injury.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And they, so we found lots of examples of these bullets, which are kind of like big rocks,

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 and they'll say things like kind of "ouch" or the equivalent in ancient Greek, or one of them says, "For pompies backside."

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 >> That could be a toilet paper thing, though, could they?

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 >> Sure.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 >> So that no one else uses it.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 >> Yeah.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 >> You're absolutely right.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 One of them said, "This is a hard nut to crack," and one of them said, "Fruit for dessert."

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I don't know what, they're probably really funny at the time.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 >> Yeah.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 >> This is, I'm sure the person shot with, oh, that's hilarious.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 >> And this is just an aside, but you know the little stone that you were throwing a slingshot.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 They did a study on that, I think last year or the year before,

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 and they found that being hit by one of those was like being hit by a bullet from a magnum.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 >> Whoa.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 >> Like if you could get the prop of throw, like you could kill people.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 >> That's all for David and Goliath, actually, David was the favorite in that fight.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 >> Yeah, I read that in a Malcolm Gladwell book.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 It was the idea that you would have thought David was a useless person to send out,

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 but actually the best people in battle back then who had precision shots

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 would mean that you could take an army down from a distance with one single blow.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 >> So you take an army down from a distance with one single, just listen to yourself then.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 >> Okay, a single person, like a giant.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 >> Yeah, yeah.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 >> I mean, more importantly, Dennis the Menace was much more of a Menace than we've been lent to believe.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 >> I really like that in ancient China.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 So actually around the 1300s, there were emperors who started using toilet paper.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 It's one of the first examples of toilet paper being used.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And the sheets that they used to order, each sheet would measure two feet by three feet.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 >> That would be there.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 >> Yeah.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 >> And we think they had enormous asses or what?

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 >> I just know, just a lot of fun, maybe.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 I don't know.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 >> You've got to assume they ripped that up.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 >> Yeah, they went through a lot, didn't they?

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 In the 3090s, they went through like 720,000 sheets of toilet paper every year.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 That was just in the Royal Palace and the Imperial Court.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 So, well, we didn't pick up on toilet paper until really recently in sort of Western Europe.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 >> Yeah, not as far.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 >> I'll tell you what, two weeks ago, the game changed completely for the four of us.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 >> A lot less time picking up those pebbles from the beach.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 >> So, this is true.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 It was in the 1800s.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 It was a guy called Gettomers Gayeti, who was an American guy who, I think the 1860s or 1857,

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 he came up with a manila hemp kind of thing that was infused with scents and stuff

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 and it was able to wipe bottoms.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And he called it therapeutic paper.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And actually, the idea was this, stop piles and hemorrhoids and stuff.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And it did not catch on for years.

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 So, it didn't catch on until 1890.

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And at that point, because wiping your bottom in Victorian times was quite an embarrassing thing to talk about

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 or even admit that you'd ever done, the people who finally popularized toilet roll

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 were these guys, Clarence and Irvin Scott, who turned it into an actual roll.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 There were other people who invented the sort of cylindrical roll.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And they were so ashamed of inventing that in 1890 that they never admitted it until 1902.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 >> What, even though it took years?

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 >> Yeah, 12 years.

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 >> But surely the money would be piling up somewhere.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Are you sure you didn't invent this?

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 So we have a lot of money to give to whoever invented that nothing to do with me, man.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 I don't know.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 >> Shame is a powerful loss.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 >> I read about a chess grandmaster in 2015.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 This is a slightly off topic who was caught cheating due to using toilet paper.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 >> Okay.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 >> You cheated with toilet paper.

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 What do you think?

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 >> Oh, so how did they do it?

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 >> Yeah.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 >> Well, they took the toilet paper, which is white.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And put it on the black squares.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And so no one knew how to move their bishops.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 >> Wow.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 >> This is going to be such a letdown.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 That is much better than what I have been.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 >> That's so good.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 >> That is really good.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 >> Is it, no.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 >> It's more using a toilet than using toilet paper.

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 But the officials got suspicious because he was playing the match.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And there's a opponent noticed he kept going to the Lou pretty much every turn.

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And he was staying in there for a very long time.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 For ten minutes or more and they thought what's going on here.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 So when he was out, they went into the cubicle and they discovered a smartphone

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 wrapped up in toilet paper and buried in a bin.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 >> Oh.

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 >> And he denied it was his.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 >> But.

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 >> That's more using the smartphone than the toilet paper isn't it?

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 >> It's a joint effort.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And it's a team back.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 >> But yeah, that he denied it was his.

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 But the phone was logged into his Facebook page and there was a chess program on it

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 showing exactly his position in the match.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 >> A team from Kazakhstan has invented reusable toilet paper.

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 >> Oh.

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 >> Yeah.

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 >> I was about to say it's divided the room.

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 It is not divided the room.

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 We all agree on what we think about reusable toilet paper.

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 >> It's divided the room between me and everyone else.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 >> How do you?

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 >> So yeah, you just use it and you put it in the washing machine.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And it comes out and you can use it again.

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 >> You wouldn't want to put it in with a load of other stuff though, would you?

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 >> Not with your whites.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 >> No.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 >> Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 >> My fact this week is that in 1860 there was a woman in Paris

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 who made a living by blowing the noses of war veterans who had lost their arms in battle.

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 >> Wow.

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 >> Someone employed to blow the noses of the people with us in France.

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Napoleon III had just come to power and there were a lot of envelopes in Paris.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And so it was a really useful thing for this lady today.

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 >> How would she know that someone would have a runny nose?

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Would you know that you kind of had a cold coming on?

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 >> She used to hang key.

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 >> She used to hang key.

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 >> Yeah, she used to hang key.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 >> So it only struck me reading about this yesterday.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 We just accept the hang cheves of the square.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And they have not always been square.

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And they used to come in all shapes and sizes.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 It was a very exciting time.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Apparently, I can't really...

199
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 God, if I could go back in time, it would be...

200
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 The year when handkerchiefs were different shapes.

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 >> What kind of shapes?

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 >> The year.

203
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 So like oval or circular or, you know, trapezium, parallelograms.

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 But apparently the reason that they are now square

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 is that Marie Antoinette told her husband, Louis XVI,

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 that she was tied to this endless variety in handkerchiefs.

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And so immediately Louis issued a decree saying that

208
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 all handkerchiefs had to be equal in width and height

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 throughout the kingdom.

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And that's hence sort of the squareness generally

211
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 in handkerchiefs today.

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 >> You can see why they had a revolution in the end.

213
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 >> What bullshit is this?

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 >> Do you know that you used to be able to get

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 satirical handkerchiefs?

216
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 >> No, I don't know.

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 >> Lots of people had handkeys which commemorated current events.

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 So if there had been a battle recently or a royal death

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 or something or a military victory or an unusual happening,

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 immediately printers and handkimakers would rush out

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 a load of commemorative handkeys and you'd be able to say,

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 "Oh, have you seen my cool new handkey about that weird cow

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 that was found?"

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Or whatever.

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 >> The news was very slow, wasn't it?

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 >> Yeah.

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 >> The reason that they were popular then is because

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 you would carry around your handkeys supposedly.

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And it only migrated to the top pocket

230
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 when that went out of fashion and people started having just plain handkerchiefs.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 There was no need to show it off anymore.

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 >> Because you see like George and men kind of walking around

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 with the handkeys like Bob Rommel and stuff, don't you?

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 >> Yeah.

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Well, I think so handkerchiefs did used to be sort of 15th,

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 16th, 17th centuries sort of beige or white or cream.

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And they'd have lots of embroidery around the edge.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And then Snuff came in because we discovered the Americas

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 and we brought back some tobacco.

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 And Snuff, I don't know if you guys ever taken Snuff,

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 take it, your snott is brown.

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And so it became kind of unseemly to blow your nose

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 and have these weird brown stains all over your handkerchief.

244
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And at that point, they started being in dark colors.

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And that's when we first got, you know,

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 handkerchiefs being dyed with lots of patterns on to cover up

247
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 the weird brown kind of poo stain that was a Snuff blow.

248
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 >> I just found out that there are these massive mucous balls

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 floating around to the ocean, which we didn't know about until now.

250
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 >> Wow.

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 >> They're called sinkers.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And there are these tadpole-like animals called giant lavations.

253
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 They make them, they blow them up to catch prey.

254
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And then after a while, they throw them away,

255
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 like a spider getting rid of its web.

256
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And they just float through the ocean down.

257
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And that means that there's enough food on the sea floor

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 to support life because of these things.

259
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 They double the amount of food available.

260
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 >> It doubled it.

261
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 >> They double it, but it's all snott.

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 >> No, it's not, but as it moves down,

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 it catches other bits of prey.

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 So it's this huge food net floating down through the ocean.

265
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 >> Wow.

266
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 >> It lands, bang, you can support life.

267
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 But they're very hard to spot in the wild because they're quite delicate.

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 >> Wow.

269
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 >> I was reading about those.

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Also, there's a clam in the ocean that when it's being attacked by predators,

271
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 shoots toxic snot out of it in order to get it away.

272
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 It's really cool.

273
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 You should check out photos and videos of it.

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 It's called the disco clam.

275
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And if you see it, it looks like a massive rave.

276
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 This clam, it's just like that.

277
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Just moving and all these amazing fluorescent lights are coming off.

278
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Like you got glow sticks on it.

279
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Were you going to move on in a sec?

280
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Anything before we do?

281
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 >> You were saying about Louis XVI.

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I read one website and I can't really work out if this is true.

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Apparently, he prohibited anyone from carrying a handkerchief that was larger than his.

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 >> Wow.

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 >> So he had to have the biggest handkerchief of all.

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And if he had a small one, everyone had to have a small one.

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 There's a good thing no one told him about the massive Chinese toilet paper.

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Otherwise, we're obsessed with it on having a six foot by nine foot squares of lural.

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 >> Okay.

290
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 It is time for fact number three.

291
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And that is Anna.

292
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 >> My fact this week is that when avocados were first sold in the UK,

293
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 they came with a leaflet explaining what they were and how to eat them.

294
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 This is, it was the 1960s.

295
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And they were just getting a bit popular.

296
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And this was an M&S.

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And M&S, I read this sort of big report about how M&S sells policy of works over the years.

298
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And they said in 1968, they first of all got avocados.

299
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 They were very excited.

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 And they put them up as the avocado pair, which is what they were called at the time.

301
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And they got complaints from people immediately who had stued them and served them as custard as you would appear.

302
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And said, well, this is disgusting.

303
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Why are you selling this to me?

304
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And so the store was given, each M&S store was issued with lots of leaflets to give free with avocados,

305
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 explaining that they were a salad item and they were not a dessert and how to prepare them and how to eat them.

306
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And that's why we don't call them avocado pairs anymore.

307
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 >> They were called avocados until 1915.

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 This is so weird.

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 They were called aahuacate.

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And in 1915, a group of farmers in California, they just met up.

311
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And they agreed what they would call it from now on, because it wasn't selling very well.

312
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So they just, they had, they all found it and they said it's too hard for Americans to pronounce.

313
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 And also there's a testicle connotation because in the original language, the word meant testicle.

314
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 So they just decided.

315
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 >> The Aztecs, wasn't it?

316
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 It came from the Aztecs and that's like an aquatel.

317
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 >> An aquatel was the language.

318
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And so the farmer's just renamed it avocado.

319
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 They decided the plural avocados.

320
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Pretty easy job, I imagine.

321
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 >> But they specifically said it wasn't with an E.

322
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 >> Yes, they did. They said avocados instead of avocados.

323
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And then, and they just wrote a dictionary published as saying,

324
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 we have changed the name of one of your words.

325
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 This is what it's going to be like from now on.

326
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 >> That's really so good.

327
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 >> Do you know who we have to thank for avocados?

328
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 The fact that we have them?

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 >> Um, waitrose.

330
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 >> Close.

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Ancient giant slots.

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 >> Yeah, it's true.

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Basically, what it is is that ancient giant slots, now extinct,

334
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 they were the only animals big enough that were able to swallow an avocado

335
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 because of the size of the nut inside.

336
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 And what they used to do was they would swallow it whole.

337
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And the brilliant bit about that is because they traveled a lot,

338
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 what they were doing is when they put it out and the nut came out on the other side,

339
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 they were planting avocados trees out in places that they'd never existed before.

340
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And this, according to the American Museum of Natural History, was a very big deal

341
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 if an avocado just fell and rotted underneath a tree,

342
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 it would be competing for light and growth of the existing tree

343
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 and may never have dispersed itself.

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 So because of the pooing ancient giant slots, we now have them in abundance.

345
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 >> According to this thing I was reading,

346
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 the avocados don't know that giant slots have gone extinct.

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 >> What?

348
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 >> I don't think they even know their avocados.

349
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 >> Well, that's a fair argument.

350
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 >> What do you mean?

351
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 >> This is exciting.

352
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 >> An author Connie Barley was writing about these.

353
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 >> She says that as far as avocados are concerned,

354
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 it's all going very well according to plan.

355
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 >> Do they think the avocado farmers are giant slots?

356
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 >> Basically, yeah, because I think the range must have shrunk quite a lot,

357
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 because the slots went extinct 13,000 years ago.

358
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And avocados, humans only invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago.

359
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 >> Yeah.

360
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 >> So there was a spell where it was looking pretty dodgy for the avocado.

361
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 >> Yeah.

362
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 >> And then thanks to human farmers picking up the slack and pretending to--

363
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 >> They must know they're not being eaten and pooed out.

364
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 >> As you say, I don't think they know their avocados.

365
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 >> Maybe do the farmers dress up as giant slots?

366
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 >> You don't have like pandemic closures?

367
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 >> Yeah.

368
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 >> Human stresses pandas to trick them?

369
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Do you know the last name is these giant slots?

370
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 >> No, Megatherium, which literally means big animal.

371
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 >> There's the worst lips of name you'll ever read.

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 >> So, of course, avocado toast is a thing among millennials.

373
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And it's the reason that they can't afford houses according to some people.

374
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But the BBC looks into this and they found that in order to afford a deposit on a house in London,

375
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 you would have to give up and not eat 24,499 avocado toasts,

376
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 which means to get a deposit for a flat in London,

377
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 you only have to give up avocado toast for 67 years.

378
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 >> Wait, eating how many years A?

379
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 >> I think it's one week.

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 >> Oh, well, I think I could make that money in a much shorter than 67 years.

381
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I mean, a lot of avocado.

382
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 >> Okay.

383
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 >> Let's have a surprise that.

384
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 >> But yeah, it has become so popular over the last few years.

385
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And then there was a shortage of avocado.

386
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 So the way you farm them is quite difficult.

387
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 They sort of have on years and off years alternating.

388
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And so it's become a crime wave in Australia and New Zealand.

389
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 They've had a spate of avocado thefts.

390
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And this is now a serious problem in New Zealand.

391
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 And they get stolen in the middle of the night.

392
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Lots of these have been reported.

393
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 There's been a real spike.

394
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 People come in the middle of the night to avocado farms.

395
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And they either rake them from a tree using big, big long devices.

396
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Or they collect them in blankets or sleeping bags on the ground.

397
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And then they drag them away.

398
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And they were starting to set up kind of little avocado stalls

399
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 on road sites in New Zealand.

400
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And then the police cracked down in 2017.

401
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And so now they've gone to Facebook.

402
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 So as if Facebook hadn't done enough wrong over the last year.

403
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 So now selling black market avocados.

404
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 We should say that Mark Zuckerberg is not personally selling black market avocados.

405
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 I'll put it past him.

406
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 There was a guy, there were three guys in California

407
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 who were charged with grand theft avocado for...

408
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 That was the chair of county.

409
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 What they said, the county office.

410
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 They were still $300,000 worth.

411
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 It is hard though, I would think, to smuggle an avocado.

412
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 I can see why drugs are so popular.

413
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 That's not the only reason they're popular.

414
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 But it's very small. It's an easy thing to...

415
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 If you have a roadside avocado stall, it's quite hard to imagine to pack that up

416
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 if you see a police car approaching.

417
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Well, there is easier if someone comes by and inspects your words

418
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 to say yes, this is perfectly legal.

419
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 That's why my drugstone went out of business.

420
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 The largest avocado ever found was by Pamela Wang from Hawaii.

421
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 This Pamela is not a funny name.

422
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 It was the size of a chihuahua.

423
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Wow, the size of a small dog.

424
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Yeah, that's pretty nice.

425
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 That's not the state in Mexico.

426
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 But it's weird, because some...

427
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 We've covered giant pumpkins before,

428
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 and giant pumpkins get to the size of bigger than a big dog.

429
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 If I could...

430
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Sorry, I don't want to blind anyone with science.

431
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Although it's not a contest between avocados and pumpkins over sides,

432
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 I think everyone understands that pumpkins are bigger than avocados.

433
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Yeah, right.

434
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Do you guys know about avocado proposals?

435
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 No.

436
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 It's a thing that the media journalists have decided as a thing,

437
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 and they've found some people who've done them.

438
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And what they are is, instead of proposing to the person you want to marry

439
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 and opening a box of the ring in it,

440
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 you open an avocado that you've eaten half,

441
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 and it has a ring prodded into it,

442
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 and Cosmopolitan magazine...

443
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 ...and Cosmopolitan magazine actually found a few people who'd proposed to women

444
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 with avocados, with rings shoved in them.

445
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And I really like the juxtaposition.

446
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 So there was one guy called Randy Gonzalez, who was from...

447
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Yeah.

448
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Gonzalez is not a funny name, guys.

449
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 He was from Connecticut.

450
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 He was an American.

451
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 He did it on a beachway, first met his girlfriend,

452
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 and he opened this avocado.

453
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 There's a ring inside.

454
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And he said it just happened that a professional photographer was nearby,

455
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 who happened to be shooting something else, and we got in the way.

456
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 So we've got this beautiful photo of it,

457
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 and it is a really beautiful photo of him doing it.

458
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And he said he put the ring in clean film,

459
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 because no one wants a ring that's covered in avocado.

460
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I mean, maybe no one wants a ring that's presented within an avocado,

461
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 but they interviewed him, and then they interviewed a guy from Stanford

462
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 in Lincolnshire called Ben Stevenson,

463
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 and he wanted to do the same thing.

464
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 He had to postpone it at first, because his girlfriend got really ill in Bali.

465
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 And then when she wasn't really recovered fully,

466
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 he proposed her on a beach.

467
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 He'd locked around the avocado for two days in the heat by that point.

468
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 So I've seen the photo that she put up later,

469
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 and it's kind of a black and rotting avocado.

470
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 With the ring shoved in it, he did not cover the ring in clean film.

471
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 So he did say there was some avocado on the ring.

472
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 They cut an avocado at the wedding instead of a cake.

473
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 But yeah, it was a good juxtaposition.

474
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And there was no professional photographer around for them,

475
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 so she just had to get him to recreate the act later,

476
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 so she could photograph it and post it on Instagram.

477
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Wow. And did they like monkey up that,

478
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 the one for the second photo to make it look realistic.

479
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 I think they did it quite soon afterwards,

480
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 so it was just still the same monkey avocado.

481
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 All right, let's move on to our final fact of the show.

482
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And that is my fact. My fact this week is that in the late '90s,

483
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Microsoft successfully acquired the extremely valuable domain name

484
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Windows2000.com from a man called Bob Kirsten.

485
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 In exchange, they gave him Bob.com.

486
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 How cool is that?

487
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 That's awesome.

488
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And they just happened to have Bob.com?

489
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Yes, they did, so they didn't buy it for the sake of the trade,

490
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 because Windows2000 was worth a lot of money,

491
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 and they would have paid millions and millions to get that,

492
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 and companies often do for all these people

493
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 who in the early days of the internet bought up all these domain names.

494
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 So they went to him with an offer,

495
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 and he said that's not high enough,

496
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 but he noticed that Microsoft had a failed product years ago

497
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 called Microsoft Bob.

498
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And it was run and set up by Bill Gates' wife, Melinda,

499
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and when she set it up, the idea,

500
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 I don't know if anyone remembers Microsoft Bob,

501
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 but the idea was that, you know the little clippy guy

502
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 who comes up to help?

503
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Yeah.

504
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 It was a whole program like that, so you're yourself.

505
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 So the absolute worst bit of any program that exists?

506
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Yes.

507
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 There was a whole program with that stuff in it.

508
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Yeah, exactly.

509
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 That's genuinely what it was.

510
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 It was a picture of a lounge room,

511
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 and you clicked on things like I want to send an email,

512
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 so you clicked on a thing and it represents the email.

513
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 It was like a calendar there, and you click on the calendar,

514
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 and it would show your calendar, or there was like a letter,

515
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 and you click on the letter, and it would let you send,

516
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 it let you send up to 15 emails per month.

517
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Imagine that.

518
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 That's awesome.

519
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And it was a total failure.

520
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 They released it in '95, I believe,

521
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 and within '96, they immediately had to get rid of it,

522
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 but they owned Bob.com, and it wasn't a complete waste

523
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 because there was a new invention that was brought

524
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 to Bob.com, Microsoft Bob,

525
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 and that was the font that was invented for it,

526
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 was Comic Sans.

527
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Oh, that's where we got Comic Sans.

528
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 We got Comic Sans.

529
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 It really is a Pandora's box of evil, as well.

530
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 There's some pop things in there.

531
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Well, PC World Magazine called it the seventh worst tech product

532
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 of all time.

533
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Wow.

534
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Yeah.

535
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 So I really liked it,

536
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 but I think that just shows how behind the times I am,

537
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 but if you look at Bob.com,

538
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 it was a cozy living room, wasn't it?

539
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Yeah.

540
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 It made you feel like you're in a sitting room,

541
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 and the idea was that you would feel like your computer was all around you,

542
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 but it didn't feel like a computer.

543
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 It felt like a sitting room with an open fire and a cat.

544
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 It was just, it was really nice.

545
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 I can't believe it didn't take up.

546
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Wait till you see Facebook.

547
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 And Twitter.

548
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 I'm not ready.

549
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 I know I'm not ready.

550
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 So Bob.com exists now.

551
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Yeah.

552
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 If you go in there, you can see the story of Bob

553
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 and all of the things that he did.

554
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 At one time or other, he also owned Broadband.com,

555
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 dividend.com, and Englishman.com.

556
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And when he had this Windows 2000,

557
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 what he thought it would be would be a window to the world.

558
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 So it'd be a load of kind of webcam feeds from all over the world,

559
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 and you go on there.

560
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 And so that's why it's called Windows 2000.

561
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 So there would have been 2000 windows?

562
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 No.

563
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 No.

564
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Oh.

565
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 2000 in the 90s.

566
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 If you remember in the 90s,

567
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 the year 2000 was going to be when everything went amazing.

568
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I remember it being the time when the world was going to end.

569
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Oh, yes.

570
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Does the Millennium Bug?

571
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Yeah, that's true.

572
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 I still own one of the leaflets.

573
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 The government safety leaflets of what to do when the Millennium Bug comes.

574
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Oh, and what will you do when it comes?

575
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 It turns out you'll be fine, according to the leaflet.

576
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Don't worry about me.

577
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 But they dressed it up as a scary microchip with eight legs.

578
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 So it wasn't convincing that it was going to be fine.

579
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And Microsoft, in fact, they employed a person in 1999

580
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 who was a director of Millennium Bug Problems, didn't they?

581
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 He was specifically there to deal with.

582
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Basically, everyone's paranoid that anything was going to happen.

583
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Because it definitely wasn't.

584
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Can I just say as well?

585
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Because I know we'll have some programmers listening.

586
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 The Millennium Bug didn't happen because so many people work so hard on it.

587
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Oh, really?

588
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Because I know the letters we're going to get.

589
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I think it was a hoax.

590
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 I just like getting posed.

591
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Well, actually, only just last year did the American government

592
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 stop working on preventing the Millennium Bug?

593
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 They didn't realise they were still working on it.

594
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 There was paper work that was constantly coming in.

595
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 And when the Trump administration went in,

596
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 they had someone go through all the papers.

597
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 And they realised there was a monthly report going,

598
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 "We don't think it's going to happen in 2017."

599
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 So we've officially, as of 2017, stopped working on stopping it.

600
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 So the first person to buy a domain that probably should have been owned

601
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 by a bigger corporation was a guy called Joshua Quitner.

602
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And he just decided to register McDonalds.com himself.

603
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 He didn't really know what the deal was.

604
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 He just thought, "Well, they haven't got it. I might as well."

605
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And he got in touch with them and he said, "Do you think maybe you'd like to buy this off me?"

606
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 And the official reply he got is, "Are you finding that the Internet is a big thing?"

607
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Have you heard of a guy called Uzi Nisan?

608
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Nope.

609
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 He's so cool.

610
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 So he is just a regular guy.

611
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 He has a firm called Nissan Computer.

612
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 He was a computing firm.

613
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 He set it up in the '80s way before Nissan was even called Nissan.

614
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 It's called Datsun back then.

615
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 And when Nissan made its name Nissan, they started writing to him

616
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 and saying, "Look, we want Nissan.com."

617
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 And he said, "Sorry, I've got Nissan.com because my name is Nissan. I have a company."

618
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And they sued him for a decade.

619
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 That's what he spent 10 years.

620
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 They sued him for time.

621
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 No.

622
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 So he's now 70, whereas he should be 60.

623
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Rough.

624
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 But he held out.

625
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 He resisted this massive company.

626
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 He had to spend about $3 million of his own money defending this case.

627
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And he won.

628
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 And he now has Nissan.com.

629
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And if you go there, it's a website which tells you Nissan are a load of bastards.

630
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Wow.

631
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 That's so nice.

632
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 That's amazing.

633
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 That's amazing.

634
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 So it is a thing where these companies and Bob, I think, had this as well

635
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 when he had Windows2000.com,

636
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 is that they do bring the lawyers in to get involved.

637
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And I think Bob actually was the first person to do it in reverse,

638
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 because they started trying to sneakily put Windows2000 out there.

639
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 And he was like, "I've got the trademark on that."

640
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And I should add that in the settlement.

641
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 It wasn't just the trade of the domain names.

642
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 He did get some money, but nowhere near what he could have got.

643
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 He just said throwinbob.com and that will do it.

644
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 But companies now have to preemptively just buy domain names that they hope one day they might use.

645
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 So Coca-Cola, for example, owns the domain name.

646
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Ah.

647
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 .com.

648
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 How many A's are in that?

649
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Ah.

650
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Ah.

651
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 .com.

652
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 They also own.

653
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Ah.

654
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 .com.

655
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Ah.

656
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 .com.

657
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 They own.

658
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Ah.

659
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 .com.

660
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Up to 62 A's.

661
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I think at that point, then, it's pronounced.

662
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Ah.

663
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 .com.

664
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Do they own Ah.

665
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Ah.

666
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 No.

667
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Ah.

668
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 I'm getting that.

669
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 What guy I really like was, did you know Peter, the people who don't want anyone to do anything bad against animals?

670
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 But they're really kind of extremely militant about it.

671
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 There's a guy called Michael Doney, who he bought Peter.com in 1995.

672
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And he put up his own site, which was actually for people eating tasty animals.

673
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 That's -- I am against animal cruelty, but that is hilarious.

674
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 There is -- we should mention the domain name dispute that happened to Microsoft itself.

675
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 I don't think we've ever mentioned it before, but Microsoft against microseoft.com, which was --

676
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 it was quite famous at the time, but it was the early 20th century and a guy called Mike Row, who was in 12th grade in Canada.

677
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 So what, he was 16 or 17.

678
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 And he registered a domain name, Mike Row, soft, as a bit of fun wordplay.

679
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 And Microsoft demanded that he give it up.

680
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 We're like, "You're not allowed this."

681
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And they're not -- you know, they're obviously big at the time.

682
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 But they said, "We'll give you $10 for that."

683
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Because that's probably how much you spent registering that.

684
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And he was so insulted by that offer that he demanded $10,000.

685
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 And Microsoft took that as a really aggressive move.

686
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 It was such bad publicity, because Microsoft then clamped down really hard on him and kind of said that

687
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 he was deliberately trying to screw them over and trying to get loads of money out of them.

688
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And then the media all got on poor old microse side.

689
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 And so eventually, after all this negative publicity, Microsoft ended up having to give Mike Row

690
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 and all expenses paid trip to the Microsoft research tech fest, lucky guy.

691
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 And they also gave him an Xbox with a full selection of games.

692
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And he gave it up for that, and a small fee.

693
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 But he was a good guy.

694
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 He was a good guy.

695
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 But I always wonder, like, would you have Andrew Hunter Murray soft?

696
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 I wouldn't actually think.

697
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 There's no usual kind of suffix to put after your name, isn't it?

698
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 It is, but he just thought the pun was good enough, I think, to sacrifice that.

699
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And actually, I went on.

700
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 So what Microsoft did do was they paid for him to set up microforums.com instead.

701
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 And I thought, "I wonder what microforums is doing these days."

702
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And I wasted about half an hour.

703
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 It's just, suddenly, you have a questionnaire in front of you with no context,

704
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 asking you loads of personal details about who you are on your life and stuff.

705
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 So ask you, like, where you live, how old you are, who you live with.

706
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 This is Facebook.

707
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Well, I see.

708
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Maybe because I'm not on Facebook.

709
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 So maybe this is what it is.

710
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 I just, I checked all these boxes giving away lots of personal information about myself.

711
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Is that Facebook?

712
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Yes.

713
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Oh, no, I'm the last one to fall.

714
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 I found out a couple of things about Microsoft, not about Mike Rosesoft.

715
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 So when they invented AutoCorrect, there's one guy who is basically the father of AutoCorrect.

716
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 No, he was the father of AutoCorrect.

717
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 So he's called Dean Hachamovich and he's listed as the inventor.

718
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And he basically came up with a thing where you put in something and he realized

719
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 the space bar acts as a command to translate 10, for example, into the.

720
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 And when he invented it, he immediately went on to his boss's computer and switched Dean.

721
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 So it automatically became Mike.

722
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 And he switched Mike, so it automatically became Dean.

723
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Of course, his name was Dean.

724
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 And after that, his boss started locking his office door.

725
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 We're going to have to wrap up shortly.

726
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Oh, okay.

727
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Just quickly, the guy who invented Solitaire related to that was also a really cool guy,

728
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 but he was an intern at Microsoft in 1989.

729
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 And he was just trying to get to grips with Microsoft software.

730
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 So he was really young. He was about 17. He was at school.

731
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 And he invented this game.

732
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And Microsoft sort of found it on their system.

733
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 And they picked it up and they put it on all their computers.

734
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 They obviously made lots of money out of it.

735
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 This guy didn't make any money out of it, but he doesn't mind at all.

736
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 He says he's very happy.

737
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 But he originally, on the original version of Solitaire, there was what he called a boss button,

738
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 which is a button that you press when your boss is coming towards you.

739
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 And it immediately switches to a screen that makes it look like you're doing well.

740
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 And Microsoft told him he had to remove it.

741
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Oh, really?

742
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Oh, really?

743
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And I now looked him up.

744
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 And it's like he's betrayed Microsoft because he works for Apple in an orchard.

745
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 He runs an orchard.

746
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 [LAUGHTER]

747
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Making sider.

748
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 It's so good.

749
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 Okay, we need to wrap up, guys.

750
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Okay, that is all of our facts.

768
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Yeah, I like this.

769
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 I've never heard it before, and I think it's really fascinating.

770
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 It's by Mel Burton.

771
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And it is that astronauts have to relearn to play the guitar on the space station

772
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 because they overshoot the frets due to their weightless arms.

773
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Oh, that's awesome.

774
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Where are you?

775
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 There you are.

776

 Yes, come and find us at the end and we'll give you a take.

777
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000

778
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

779
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
