 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 >> Welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Liverpool!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber, and I'm sitting here when Anna Shazinski

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Andrew Hunter-Marie and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 >> My fact is that the ancient Greeks wiped their bottoms with pebbles.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 >> Well, I heard of the Flintstones.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 >> How would that even work?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 >> This is true. They had pebbles which they used, they're things called "passoi," and we keep discovering them in archaeological digs.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 And we know that these were used because--

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 >> The competition.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 >> Yeah, kind of.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 So there was Fishborne, Roman Palace, which is a Roman site in England, had bits of pottery which had partly mineralised excrement on them.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Until they discovered the excrement, they thought they were board game counters, but they weren't.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 >> But I think the word "passoi" means both these pebbles and also board game counters.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 >> Yes.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 >> So it's the same word for both.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 It's like if we have the same word for toilet paper and monopoly piece.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 >> Yeah.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 >> I like the idea, though, that presumably on the dig, they pick it up and they go, "I think this is one of those board game counters, and they get a bit closer."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And they're suddenly like, "Oh, no, it's not. It's another Pessoi."

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 >> So you said that was a Fishborne, Roman Palace.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 >> Yes, so Dr. Rob Simmons, who's the curator of the Fishborne, Roman Palace, he found out about this.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 And he said he thought it was hilarious, and it really appealed to him that for 50 years they've been saying these things were board game tokens in the museum, and now they have to relabel them.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 >> Yeah, it's great.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 >> And there was guidance for the ancient Greeks about how you should use them.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 So there was a bit of advice which said you should use no more than three pebbles.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 And anything more than that is actually a bit extravagant, and you don't need it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 >> How big are the pebbles? They must be like quite big, I reckon.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 >> They're not huge. They're smaller than my hand, I'd say, but they're bigger than a penny.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 >> Okay. Okay.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 >> Do we know if they were in any way effective as in, "Are we doing it wrong now?"

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 >> Would they laugh about it's going, "Paper, is it a pebble, mate? Is it a better option?"

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 >> I don't think it's a better option. I think that can be abrasive.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Obviously, you'll pick smooth pebbles if you can.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 >> So do you think it was like, you know, when you go skimming stones on a beach?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 And you spend ages selecting the right ones, up and down the beach?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 >> It must have been like that, where you find one and you go, "I found a really good one."

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 >> It feels to me like the kind of pebble that would be good for skimming

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 would also be good for scraping.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 >> Agreed?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 >> Yeah.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 >> Actually, they could be a bit dangerous.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Some people who found out about this have written that long-term use could have resulted in local irritation,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 skin or mucosal damage or complications of external hemorrhoids.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 So really, it's not something you want to be doing.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 We're not suggesting it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 >> No, how is it?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 >> But the really interesting thing was, some of these pesto, there is a theory that some academics have

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 that not only did they wipe the bottoms with pebbles, they wiped the bottoms with pebbles

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 that had their enemies' names written on them.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 >> So that's the ostracos or the ostracos?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 >> Right. So was this a thing in ancient Greece where you would write the name of a politician

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 that you didn't like basically on a pebble and then kind of throw it out?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 >> Yeah, every year there was a meeting.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 And if there were enough votes cast, I think it was if there were more than 6,000 votes cast

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 with the names written on them, then whoever got the most votes out of those 6,000 would be cast out from society.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 >> Yeah.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 >> And it was to guard against tyrants.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 So it was a very good way of saying, "Oh, there's an up and coming politician, Jacob Riesmog."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 He's looking a bit, you know, likely, everyone writes his name on a bit of Postery, wipes it on their butt, problem solved.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 >> But they also, they did this really cool thing in battle in ancient Greece where they had bullets,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 which they would sort of catapult at the enemy, but they would write insults on the bullets that they threw at people,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 literally adding insult to injury.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 And they, so we found lots of examples of these bullets, which are kind of like big rocks,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 and they'll say things like kind of "ouch" or the equivalent in ancient Greek, or one of them says, "For pompies backside."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 >> That could be a toilet paper thing, though, could they?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 >> Sure.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 >> So that no one else uses it.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 >> Yeah.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 >> You're absolutely right.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 One of them said, "This is a hard nut to crack," and one of them said, "Fruit for dessert."

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 I don't know what, they're probably really funny at the time.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 >> Yeah.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 >> This is, I'm sure the person shot with, oh, that's hilarious.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 >> And this is just an aside, but you know the little stone that you were throwing a slingshot.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 They did a study on that, I think last year or the year before,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 and they found that being hit by one of those was like being hit by a bullet from a magnum.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 >> Whoa.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 >> Like if you could get the prop of throw, like you could kill people.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 >> That's all for David and Goliath, actually, David was the favorite in that fight.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 >> Yeah, I read that in a Malcolm Gladwell book.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 It was the idea that you would have thought David was a useless person to send out,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 but actually the best people in battle back then who had precision shots

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 would mean that you could take an army down from a distance with one single blow.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 >> So you take an army down from a distance with one single, just listen to yourself then.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 >> Okay, a single person, like a giant.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 >> I mean, more importantly, Dennis the Menace was much more of a Menace than we've been lent to believe.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 >> I really like that in ancient China.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 So actually around the 1300s, there were emperors who started using toilet paper.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 It's one of the first examples of toilet paper being used.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 And the sheets that they used to order, each sheet would measure two feet by three feet.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 >> That would be there.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 >> Yeah.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 >> And we think they had enormous asses or what?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 >> I just know, just a lot of fun, maybe.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 I don't know.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 >> You've got to assume they ripped that up.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 >> Yeah, they went through a lot, didn't they?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 In the 3090s, they went through like 720,000 sheets of toilet paper every year.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 That was just in the Royal Palace and the Imperial Court.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 So, well, we didn't pick up on toilet paper until really recently in sort of Western Europe.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 >> Yeah, not as far.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 >> I'll tell you what, two weeks ago, the game changed completely for the four of us.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 >> A lot less time picking up those pebbles from the beach.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 >> So, this is true.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 It was in the 1800s.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 It was a guy called Gettomers Gayeti, who was an American guy who, I think the 1860s or 1857,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 he came up with a manila hemp kind of thing that was infused with scents and stuff

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 and it was able to wipe bottoms.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 And he called it therapeutic paper.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 And actually, the idea was this, stop piles and hemorrhoids and stuff.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 And it did not catch on for years.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 So, it didn't catch on until 1890.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And at that point, because wiping your bottom in Victorian times was quite an embarrassing thing to talk about

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 or even admit that you'd ever done, the people who finally popularized toilet roll

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 were these guys, Clarence and Irvin Scott, who turned it into an actual roll.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 There were other people who invented the sort of cylindrical roll.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 And they were so ashamed of inventing that in 1890 that they never admitted it until 1902.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 >> What, even though it took years?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 >> Yeah, 12 years.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 >> But surely the money would be piling up somewhere.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Are you sure you didn't invent this?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 So we have a lot of money to give to whoever invented that nothing to do with me, man.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 I don't know.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 >> Shame is a powerful loss.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 >> I read about a chess grandmaster in 2015.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 This is a slightly off topic who was caught cheating due to using toilet paper.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 >> Okay.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 >> You cheated with toilet paper.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 What do you think?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 >> Oh, so how did they do it?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 >> Yeah.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 >> Well, they took the toilet paper, which is white.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 And put it on the black squares.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 And so no one knew how to move their bishops.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 >> Wow.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 >> This is going to be such a letdown.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 That is much better than what I have been.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 >> That's so good.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 >> That is really good.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 >> Is it, no.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 >> It's more using a toilet than using toilet paper.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 But the officials got suspicious because he was playing the match.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 And there's a opponent noticed he kept going to the Lou pretty much every turn.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 And he was staying in there for a very long time.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 For ten minutes or more and they thought what's going on here.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 So when he was out, they went into the cubicle and they discovered a smartphone

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 wrapped up in toilet paper and buried in a bin.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 >> Oh.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 >> And he denied it was his.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 >> But.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 >> That's more using the smartphone than the toilet paper isn't it?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 >> It's a joint effort.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 And it's a team back.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 >> But yeah, that he denied it was his.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 But the phone was logged into his Facebook page and there was a chess program on it

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 showing exactly his position in the match.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 >> A team from Kazakhstan has invented reusable toilet paper.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 >> Oh.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 >> Yeah.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 >> I was about to say it's divided the room.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 It is not divided the room.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 We all agree on what we think about reusable toilet paper.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 >> It's divided the room between me and everyone else.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 >> How do you?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 >> So yeah, you just use it and you put it in the washing machine.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 And it comes out and you can use it again.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 >> You wouldn't want to put it in with a load of other stuff though, would you?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 >> Not with your whites.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 >> No.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 >> Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 >> My fact this week is that in 1860 there was a woman in Paris

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 who made a living by blowing the noses of war veterans who had lost their arms in battle.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 >> Wow.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 >> Someone employed to blow the noses of the people with us in France.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Napoleon III had just come to power and there were a lot of envelopes in Paris.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 And so it was a really useful thing for this lady today.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 >> How would she know that someone would have a runny nose?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Would you know that you kind of had a cold coming on?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 >> She used to hang key.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 >> She used to hang key.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 >> Yeah, she used to hang key.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 >> So it only struck me reading about this yesterday.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 We just accept the hang cheves of the square.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 And they have not always been square.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And they used to come in all shapes and sizes.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 It was a very exciting time.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Apparently, I can't really...

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 God, if I could go back in time, it would be...

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 The year when handkerchiefs were different shapes.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 >> What kind of shapes?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 >> The year.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 So like oval or circular or, you know, trapezium, parallelograms.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 But apparently the reason that they are now square

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 is that Marie Antoinette told her husband, Louis XVI,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 that she was tied to this endless variety in handkerchiefs.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 And so immediately Louis issued a decree saying that

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 all handkerchiefs had to be equal in width and height

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 throughout the kingdom.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 And that's hence sort of the squareness generally

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 in handkerchiefs today.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 >> You can see why they had a revolution in the end.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 >> What bullshit is this?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 >> Do you know that you used to be able to get

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 satirical handkerchiefs?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 >> No, I don't know.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 >> Lots of people had handkeys which commemorated current events.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 So if there had been a battle recently or a royal death

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 or something or a military victory or an unusual happening,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 immediately printers and handkimakers would rush out

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 a load of commemorative handkeys and you'd be able to say,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 "Oh, have you seen my cool new handkey about that weird cow

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 that was found?"

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Or whatever.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 >> The news was very slow, wasn't it?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 >> Yeah.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 >> The reason that they were popular then is because

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 you would carry around your handkeys supposedly.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 And it only migrated to the top pocket

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 when that went out of fashion and people started having just plain handkerchiefs.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 There was no need to show it off anymore.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 >> Because you see like George and men kind of walking around

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 with the handkeys like Bob Rommel and stuff, don't you?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 >> Yeah.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Well, I think so handkerchiefs did used to be sort of 15th,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 16th, 17th centuries sort of beige or white or cream.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 And they'd have lots of embroidery around the edge.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 And then Snuff came in because we discovered the Americas

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 and we brought back some tobacco.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 And Snuff, I don't know if you guys ever taken Snuff,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 take it, your snott is brown.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 And so it became kind of unseemly to blow your nose

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 and have these weird brown stains all over your handkerchief.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 And at that point, they started being in dark colors.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 And that's when we first got, you know,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 handkerchiefs being dyed with lots of patterns on to cover up

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 the weird brown kind of poo stain that was a Snuff blow.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 >> I just found out that there are these massive mucous balls

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 floating around to the ocean, which we didn't know about until now.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 >> Wow.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 >> They're called sinkers.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 And there are these tadpole-like animals called giant lavations.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 They make them, they blow them up to catch prey.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 And then after a while, they throw them away,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 like a spider getting rid of its web.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 And they just float through the ocean down.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 And that means that there's enough food on the sea floor

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 to support life because of these things.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 They double the amount of food available.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 >> It doubled it.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 >> They double it, but it's all snott.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 >> No, it's not, but as it moves down,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 it catches other bits of prey.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 So it's this huge food net floating down through the ocean.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 >> Wow.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 >> It lands, bang, you can support life.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 But they're very hard to spot in the wild because they're quite delicate.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 >> Wow.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 >> I was reading about those.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Also, there's a clam in the ocean that when it's being attacked by predators,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 shoots toxic snot out of it in order to get it away.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 It's really cool.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 You should check out photos and videos of it.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 It's called the disco clam.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 And if you see it, it looks like a massive rave.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 This clam, it's just like that.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 Just moving and all these amazing fluorescent lights are coming off.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Like you got glow sticks on it.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Were you going to move on in a sec?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Anything before we do?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 >> You were saying about Louis XVI.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 I read one website and I can't really work out if this is true.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Apparently, he prohibited anyone from carrying a handkerchief that was larger than his.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 >> Wow.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 >> So he had to have the biggest handkerchief of all.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 And if he had a small one, everyone had to have a small one.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 There's a good thing no one told him about the massive Chinese toilet paper.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Otherwise, we're obsessed with it on having a six foot by nine foot squares of lural.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 >> Okay.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 It is time for fact number three.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 And that is Anna.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 >> My fact this week is that when avocados were first sold in the UK,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 they came with a leaflet explaining what they were and how to eat them.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 This is, it was the 1960s.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 And they were just getting a bit popular.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And this was an M&S.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 And M&S, I read this sort of big report about how M&S sells policy of works over the years.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And they said in 1968, they first of all got avocados.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 They were very excited.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 And they put them up as the avocado pair, which is what they were called at the time.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 And they got complaints from people immediately who had stued them and served them as custard as you would appear.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 And said, well, this is disgusting.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Why are you selling this to me?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 And so the store was given, each M&S store was issued with lots of leaflets to give free with avocados,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 explaining that they were a salad item and they were not a dessert and how to prepare them and how to eat them.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And that's why we don't call them avocado pairs anymore.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 >> They were called avocados until 1915.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 This is so weird.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 They were called aahuacate.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 And in 1915, a group of farmers in California, they just met up.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 And they agreed what they would call it from now on, because it wasn't selling very well.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 So they just, they had, they all found it and they said it's too hard for Americans to pronounce.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 And also there's a testicle connotation because in the original language, the word meant testicle.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 So they just decided.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 >> The Aztecs, wasn't it?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 It came from the Aztecs and that's like an aquatel.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 >> An aquatel was the language.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 And so the farmer's just renamed it avocado.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 They decided the plural avocados.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Pretty easy job, I imagine.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 >> But they specifically said it wasn't with an E.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 >> Yes, they did. They said avocados instead of avocados.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 And then, and they just wrote a dictionary published as saying,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 we have changed the name of one of your words.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 This is what it's going to be like from now on.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 >> That's really so good.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 >> Do you know who we have to thank for avocados?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 The fact that we have them?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 >> Um, waitrose.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 >> Close.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Ancient giant slots.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 >> Yeah, it's true.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Basically, what it is is that ancient giant slots, now extinct,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 they were the only animals big enough that were able to swallow an avocado

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 because of the size of the nut inside.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 And what they used to do was they would swallow it whole.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And the brilliant bit about that is because they traveled a lot,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 what they were doing is when they put it out and the nut came out on the other side,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 they were planting avocados trees out in places that they'd never existed before.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 And this, according to the American Museum of Natural History, was a very big deal

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 if an avocado just fell and rotted underneath a tree,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 it would be competing for light and growth of the existing tree

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 and may never have dispersed itself.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 So because of the pooing ancient giant slots, we now have them in abundance.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 >> According to this thing I was reading,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 the avocados don't know that giant slots have gone extinct.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 >> What?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 >> I don't think they even know their avocados.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 >> Well, that's a fair argument.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 >> What do you mean?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 >> This is exciting.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 >> An author Connie Barley was writing about these.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 >> She says that as far as avocados are concerned,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 it's all going very well according to plan.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 >> Do they think the avocado farmers are giant slots?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 >> Basically, yeah, because I think the range must have shrunk quite a lot,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 because the slots went extinct 13,000 years ago.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 And avocados, humans only invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 >> Yeah.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 >> So there was a spell where it was looking pretty dodgy for the avocado.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 >> Yeah.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 >> And then thanks to human farmers picking up the slack and pretending to--

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 >> They must know they're not being eaten and pooed out.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 >> As you say, I don't think they know their avocados.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 >> Maybe do the farmers dress up as giant slots?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 >> You don't have like pandemic closures?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 >> Yeah.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 >> Human stresses pandas to trick them?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Do you know the last name is these giant slots?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 >> No, Megatherium, which literally means big animal.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 >> There's the worst lips of name you'll ever read.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 >> So, of course, avocado toast is a thing among millennials.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 And it's the reason that they can't afford houses according to some people.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 But the BBC looks into this and they found that in order to afford a deposit on a house in London,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 you would have to give up and not eat 24,499 avocado toasts,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 which means to get a deposit for a flat in London,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 you only have to give up avocado toast for 67 years.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 >> Wait, eating how many years A?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 >> I think it's one week.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 >> Oh, well, I think I could make that money in a much shorter than 67 years.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 I mean, a lot of avocado.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 >> Okay.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 >> Let's have a surprise that.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 >> But yeah, it has become so popular over the last few years.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 And then there was a shortage of avocado.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 So the way you farm them is quite difficult.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 They sort of have on years and off years alternating.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 And so it's become a crime wave in Australia and New Zealand.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 They've had a spate of avocado thefts.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 And this is now a serious problem in New Zealand.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 And they get stolen in the middle of the night.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Lots of these have been reported.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 There's been a real spike.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 People come in the middle of the night to avocado farms.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 And they either rake them from a tree using big, big long devices.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Or they collect them in blankets or sleeping bags on the ground.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 And then they drag them away.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 And they were starting to set up kind of little avocado stalls

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 on road sites in New Zealand.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 And then the police cracked down in 2017.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 And so now they've gone to Facebook.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 So as if Facebook hadn't done enough wrong over the last year.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 So now selling black market avocados.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 We should say that Mark Zuckerberg is not personally selling black market avocados.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 I'll put it past him.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 There was a guy, there were three guys in California

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 who were charged with grand theft avocado for...

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 That was the chair of county.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 What they said, the county office.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 They were still $300,000 worth.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 It is hard though, I would think, to smuggle an avocado.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 I can see why drugs are so popular.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 That's not the only reason they're popular.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 But it's very small. It's an easy thing to...

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 If you have a roadside avocado stall, it's quite hard to imagine to pack that up

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 if you see a police car approaching.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Well, there is easier if someone comes by and inspects your words

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 to say yes, this is perfectly legal.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 That's why my drugstone went out of business.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 The largest avocado ever found was by Pamela Wang from Hawaii.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 This Pamela is not a funny name.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 It was the size of a chihuahua.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Wow, the size of a small dog.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Yeah, that's pretty nice.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 That's not the state in Mexico.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 But it's weird, because some...

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 We've covered giant pumpkins before,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 and giant pumpkins get to the size of bigger than a big dog.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 If I could...

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Sorry, I don't want to blind anyone with science.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 Although it's not a contest between avocados and pumpkins over sides,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 I think everyone understands that pumpkins are bigger than avocados.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Yeah, right.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 Do you guys know about avocado proposals?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 No.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 It's a thing that the media journalists have decided as a thing,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 and they've found some people who've done them.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 And what they are is, instead of proposing to the person you want to marry

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 and opening a box of the ring in it,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 you open an avocado that you've eaten half,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 and it has a ring prodded into it,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 and Cosmopolitan magazine...

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 ...and Cosmopolitan magazine actually found a few people who'd proposed to women

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 with avocados, with rings shoved in them.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 And I really like the juxtaposition.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 So there was one guy called Randy Gonzalez, who was from...

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 Yeah.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 Gonzalez is not a funny name, guys.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 He was from Connecticut.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 He was an American.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 He did it on a beachway, first met his girlfriend,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 and he opened this avocado.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 There's a ring inside.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 And he said it just happened that a professional photographer was nearby,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 who happened to be shooting something else, and we got in the way.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 So we've got this beautiful photo of it,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 and it is a really beautiful photo of him doing it.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 And he said he put the ring in clean film,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 because no one wants a ring that's covered in avocado.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 I mean, maybe no one wants a ring that's presented within an avocado,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 but they interviewed him, and then they interviewed a guy from Stanford

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 in Lincolnshire called Ben Stevenson,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 and he wanted to do the same thing.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 He had to postpone it at first, because his girlfriend got really ill in Bali.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 And then when she wasn't really recovered fully,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 he proposed her on a beach.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 He'd locked around the avocado for two days in the heat by that point.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 So I've seen the photo that she put up later,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 and it's kind of a black and rotting avocado.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 With the ring shoved in it, he did not cover the ring in clean film.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 So he did say there was some avocado on the ring.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 They cut an avocado at the wedding instead of a cake.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 But yeah, it was a good juxtaposition.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 And there was no professional photographer around for them,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 so she just had to get him to recreate the act later,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 so she could photograph it and post it on Instagram.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 Wow. And did they like monkey up that,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 the one for the second photo to make it look realistic.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 I think they did it quite soon afterwards,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 so it was just still the same monkey avocado.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 All right, let's move on to our final fact of the show.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 And that is my fact. My fact this week is that in the late '90s,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 Microsoft successfully acquired the extremely valuable domain name

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Windows2000.com from a man called Bob Kirsten.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 In exchange, they gave him Bob.com.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 How cool is that?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 That's awesome.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And they just happened to have Bob.com?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 Yes, they did, so they didn't buy it for the sake of the trade,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 because Windows2000 was worth a lot of money,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 and they would have paid millions and millions to get that,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 and companies often do for all these people

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 who in the early days of the internet bought up all these domain names.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 So they went to him with an offer,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 and he said that's not high enough,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 but he noticed that Microsoft had a failed product years ago

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 called Microsoft Bob.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 And it was run and set up by Bill Gates' wife, Melinda,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 and when she set it up, the idea,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 I don't know if anyone remembers Microsoft Bob,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 but the idea was that, you know the little clippy guy

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 who comes up to help?

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Yeah.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 It was a whole program like that, so you're yourself.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 So the absolute worst bit of any program that exists?

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 Yes.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 There was a whole program with that stuff in it.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 That's genuinely what it was.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 It was a picture of a lounge room,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 and you clicked on things like I want to send an email,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 so you clicked on a thing and it represents the email.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 It was like a calendar there, and you click on the calendar,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 and it would show your calendar, or there was like a letter,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 and you click on the letter, and it would let you send,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 it let you send up to 15 emails per month.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Imagine that.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 That's awesome.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 And it was a total failure.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 They released it in '95, I believe,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 and within '96, they immediately had to get rid of it,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 but they owned Bob.com, and it wasn't a complete waste

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 because there was a new invention that was brought

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 to Bob.com, Microsoft Bob,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 and that was the font that was invented for it,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 was Comic Sans.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 Oh, that's where we got Comic Sans.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 We got Comic Sans.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 It really is a Pandora's box of evil, as well.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 There's some pop things in there.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Well, PC World Magazine called it the seventh worst tech product

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 of all time.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Wow.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 Yeah.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 So I really liked it,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 but I think that just shows how behind the times I am,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 but if you look at Bob.com,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 it was a cozy living room, wasn't it?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 Yeah.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 It made you feel like you're in a sitting room,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 and the idea was that you would feel like your computer was all around you,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 but it didn't feel like a computer.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 It felt like a sitting room with an open fire and a cat.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 It was just, it was really nice.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 I can't believe it didn't take up.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Wait till you see Facebook.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 And Twitter.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 I'm not ready.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 I know I'm not ready.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 So Bob.com exists now.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Yeah.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 If you go in there, you can see the story of Bob

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 and all of the things that he did.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 At one time or other, he also owned Broadband.com,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 dividend.com, and Englishman.com.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 And when he had this Windows 2000,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 what he thought it would be would be a window to the world.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 So it'd be a load of kind of webcam feeds from all over the world,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 and you go on there.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 And so that's why it's called Windows 2000.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 So there would have been 2000 windows?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 No.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 No.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 Oh.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 2000 in the 90s.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 If you remember in the 90s,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 the year 2000 was going to be when everything went amazing.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 I remember it being the time when the world was going to end.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 Oh, yes.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 Does the Millennium Bug?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 I still own one of the leaflets.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 The government safety leaflets of what to do when the Millennium Bug comes.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Oh, and what will you do when it comes?

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 It turns out you'll be fine, according to the leaflet.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Don't worry about me.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 But they dressed it up as a scary microchip with eight legs.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 So it wasn't convincing that it was going to be fine.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 And Microsoft, in fact, they employed a person in 1999

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 who was a director of Millennium Bug Problems, didn't they?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 He was specifically there to deal with.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Basically, everyone's paranoid that anything was going to happen.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Because it definitely wasn't.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 Can I just say as well?

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Because I know we'll have some programmers listening.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 The Millennium Bug didn't happen because so many people work so hard on it.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 Oh, really?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 Because I know the letters we're going to get.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 I think it was a hoax.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 I just like getting posed.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Well, actually, only just last year did the American government

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 stop working on preventing the Millennium Bug?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 They didn't realise they were still working on it.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 There was paper work that was constantly coming in.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 And when the Trump administration went in,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 they had someone go through all the papers.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 And they realised there was a monthly report going,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 "We don't think it's going to happen in 2017."

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 So we've officially, as of 2017, stopped working on stopping it.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 So the first person to buy a domain that probably should have been owned

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 by a bigger corporation was a guy called Joshua Quitner.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 And he just decided to register McDonalds.com himself.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 He didn't really know what the deal was.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 He just thought, "Well, they haven't got it. I might as well."

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 And he got in touch with them and he said, "Do you think maybe you'd like to buy this off me?"

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 And the official reply he got is, "Are you finding that the Internet is a big thing?"

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Have you heard of a guy called Uzi Nisan?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 Nope.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 He's so cool.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 So he is just a regular guy.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 He has a firm called Nissan Computer.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 He was a computing firm.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 He set it up in the '80s way before Nissan was even called Nissan.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 It's called Datsun back then.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 And when Nissan made its name Nissan, they started writing to him

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 and saying, "Look, we want Nissan.com."

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 And he said, "Sorry, I've got Nissan.com because my name is Nissan. I have a company."

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 And they sued him for a decade.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 That's what he spent 10 years.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 They sued him for time.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 No.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 So he's now 70, whereas he should be 60.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Rough.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 But he held out.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 He resisted this massive company.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 He had to spend about $3 million of his own money defending this case.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And he won.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 And he now has Nissan.com.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 And if you go there, it's a website which tells you Nissan are a load of bastards.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Wow.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 That's so nice.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 That's amazing.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 That's amazing.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 So it is a thing where these companies and Bob, I think, had this as well

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 when he had Windows2000.com,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 is that they do bring the lawyers in to get involved.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 And I think Bob actually was the first person to do it in reverse,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 because they started trying to sneakily put Windows2000 out there.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 And he was like, "I've got the trademark on that."

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 And I should add that in the settlement.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 It wasn't just the trade of the domain names.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 He did get some money, but nowhere near what he could have got.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 He just said throwinbob.com and that will do it.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 But companies now have to preemptively just buy domain names that they hope one day they might use.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 So Coca-Cola, for example, owns the domain name.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Ah.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 .com.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 How many A's are in that?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 Ah.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Ah.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 .com.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 They also own.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Ah.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 .com.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 Ah.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 .com.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 They own.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 Ah.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 .com.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Up to 62 A's.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 I think at that point, then, it's pronounced.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Ah.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 .com.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 Do they own Ah.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Ah.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 No.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Ah.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 I'm getting that.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 What guy I really like was, did you know Peter, the people who don't want anyone to do anything bad against animals?

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 But they're really kind of extremely militant about it.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 There's a guy called Michael Doney, who he bought Peter.com in 1995.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 And he put up his own site, which was actually for people eating tasty animals.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 That's -- I am against animal cruelty, but that is hilarious.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 There is -- we should mention the domain name dispute that happened to Microsoft itself.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 I don't think we've ever mentioned it before, but Microsoft against microseoft.com, which was --

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 it was quite famous at the time, but it was the early 20th century and a guy called Mike Row, who was in 12th grade in Canada.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 So what, he was 16 or 17.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 And he registered a domain name, Mike Row, soft, as a bit of fun wordplay.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 And Microsoft demanded that he give it up.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 We're like, "You're not allowed this."

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 And they're not -- you know, they're obviously big at the time.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 But they said, "We'll give you $10 for that."

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Because that's probably how much you spent registering that.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 And he was so insulted by that offer that he demanded $10,000.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 And Microsoft took that as a really aggressive move.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 It was such bad publicity, because Microsoft then clamped down really hard on him and kind of said that

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 he was deliberately trying to screw them over and trying to get loads of money out of them.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 And then the media all got on poor old microse side.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 And so eventually, after all this negative publicity, Microsoft ended up having to give Mike Row

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 and all expenses paid trip to the Microsoft research tech fest, lucky guy.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 And they also gave him an Xbox with a full selection of games.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 And he gave it up for that, and a small fee.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 But he was a good guy.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 He was a good guy.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 But I always wonder, like, would you have Andrew Hunter Murray soft?

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 I wouldn't actually think.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 There's no usual kind of suffix to put after your name, isn't it?

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 It is, but he just thought the pun was good enough, I think, to sacrifice that.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 And actually, I went on.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 So what Microsoft did do was they paid for him to set up microforums.com instead.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 And I thought, "I wonder what microforums is doing these days."

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 And I wasted about half an hour.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 It's just, suddenly, you have a questionnaire in front of you with no context,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 asking you loads of personal details about who you are on your life and stuff.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 So ask you, like, where you live, how old you are, who you live with.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 This is Facebook.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 Well, I see.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 Maybe because I'm not on Facebook.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 So maybe this is what it is.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 I just, I checked all these boxes giving away lots of personal information about myself.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Is that Facebook?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 Yes.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Oh, no, I'm the last one to fall.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 I found out a couple of things about Microsoft, not about Mike Rosesoft.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 So when they invented AutoCorrect, there's one guy who is basically the father of AutoCorrect.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 No, he was the father of AutoCorrect.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 So he's called Dean Hachamovich and he's listed as the inventor.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 And he basically came up with a thing where you put in something and he realized

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 the space bar acts as a command to translate 10, for example, into the.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 And when he invented it, he immediately went on to his boss's computer and switched Dean.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 So it automatically became Mike.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 And he switched Mike, so it automatically became Dean.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 Of course, his name was Dean.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 And after that, his boss started locking his office door.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 We're going to have to wrap up shortly.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 Oh, okay.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Just quickly, the guy who invented Solitaire related to that was also a really cool guy,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 but he was an intern at Microsoft in 1989.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 And he was just trying to get to grips with Microsoft software.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 So he was really young. He was about 17. He was at school.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 And he invented this game.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 And Microsoft sort of found it on their system.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 And they picked it up and they put it on all their computers.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 They obviously made lots of money out of it.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 This guy didn't make any money out of it, but he doesn't mind at all.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 He says he's very happy.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 But he originally, on the original version of Solitaire, there was what he called a boss button,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 which is a button that you press when your boss is coming towards you.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 And it immediately switches to a screen that makes it look like you're doing well.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 And Microsoft told him he had to remove it.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Oh, really?

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Oh, really?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 And I now looked him up.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 And it's like he's betrayed Microsoft because he works for Apple in an orchard.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 He runs an orchard.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Making sider.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 It's so good.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 Okay, we need to wrap up, guys.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Okay, that is all of our facts.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 So, James.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Yeah, I like this.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 I've never heard it before, and I think it's really fascinating.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 It's by Mel Burton.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 And it is that astronauts have to relearn to play the guitar on the space station

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 because they overshoot the frets due to their weightless arms.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Oh, that's awesome.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 Where are you?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 There you are.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 Yes, come and find us at the end and we'll give you a take.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 Thank you so much.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 Goodbye!

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 [Applause]

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 [Applause]

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 [Applause]

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.580
 (upbeat music)

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.980
 (upbeat music)
