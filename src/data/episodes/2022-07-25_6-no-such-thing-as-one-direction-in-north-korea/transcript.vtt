00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.760
 It's kind of a nice such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.920
 No, seriously, it's kind of the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.640
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:27.200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.240
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.000
 Once again, we've gathered around a microphone to discuss our favourite facts

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.520
 from the last seven days.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.280
 My name's Andy Murray and I'm joined by three other QI elves.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.600
 Their names are James Harkin, Molly Oldfield and on fact checking duty today,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.800
 Anarchersinsky.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.040
 We also have a special guest with us today, whose name is Mark Abrahams.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.960
 And for those of you who don't know him,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.520
 Mark is the founder of the Ignobel Prizes,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.560
 which is a series of awards given out every year

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.480
 for pieces of research that first make you laugh and then make you think.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.200
 So as an example, this year's Probability Prize went to a team of scientists

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.360
 for making two related discoveries.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.240
 First, that the longer a cow has been lying down,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.320
 the more likely that cow will soon stand up.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.760
 And second, that once a cow stands up,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.360
 you cannot easily predict how soon that cow will lie down again.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.520
 Hello, Mark.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.160
 Hello, thank you for inviting me to your elf cast.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.560
 Thank you.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.280
 Thank you for coming along.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.960
 I'm delighted to be visiting your country from my native home of America.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.480
 The Ignobel show is touring the UK at the moment, doesn't it?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.960
 That's right.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.560
 And Denmark and Sweden.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.440
 Oh my goodness, okay.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.840
 So listen, as in Denmark and Sweden, look out for that.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.960
 So let's kick off with fact number one, which is from you, Mark.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.720
 Fact number one is that a number of years ago,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.040
 some plastic surgeons in Belgium,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.080
 they had a young Belgian man who came to them,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.560
 wanting to have surgery performed to make him look more like his idol,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.240
 the singer Michael Jackson.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.440
 This is a technique first used on Michael Jackson himself.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.320
 Exactly.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.080
 There are lots of interesting questions.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.440
 It's very interesting, it's a difficult piece of surgery.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.640
 And in this medical report, the surgeons

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.040
 probably describe exactly how they did it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.480
 and say that they succeeded.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.680
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.800
 When was this?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.520
 This was about 1997.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.880
 Do they have to do special thing where the skin got whiter and whiter and whiter?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.080
 Well, they're Michael Jackson.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.240
 Well, these were plastic surgeons and

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.720
 when they write a report in a medical journal,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.080
 they talk about just one specific thing they were doing.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.720
 Wouldn't it be terrible to get the surgery done

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.920
 and then discover that you can't dance or sing

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.760
 anywhere near as well as Michael Jackson could?

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.440
 Because nobody could, for a start.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.080
 That's where robotics could enter the picture.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.480
 Right.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.280
 And moonwalking.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 I mean, you must be able to perfect moonwalking

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.040
 if you practice it for long enough, do you think?

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.320
 Yeah, but moonwalking was not the only dance move that Jackson did.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.480
 But one of the main ones, come on.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.520
 It wasn't amazing.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.560
 He was an amazing dancer.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.120
 We did on QI that it wasn't invented by Michael Jackson.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.200
 It was invented by Bill Bailey, right?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.840
 Yeah, it was an old guy called Bill Bailey,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.440
 not our Bill Bailey, the other one.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.120
 And also by the mannequin,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.160
 do you remember that video?

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.520
 You know, Red Cat mannequin.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.640
 Yeah, it's brilliant.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.640
 This brilliant bird that has a mating ritual

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.800
 that kind of climbs up a branch

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.600
 and then it slides back down like Michael Jackson.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.160
 We always see on QI when we're doing our research,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.800
 Dolly Parton or Charlie Chaplin came third,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.000
 you know, Charlie Chaplin or a Dolly Parton look like competition.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.680
 I don't know if any of those is true.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.760
 Have you ever found any evidence that it's true?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.000
 Well, Chaplin was so famous in his time

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.240
 that if you were going to have a look like competition for anyone,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.120
 it probably would be him.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.480
 Yeah, but him coming third.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.480
 Like, "don't make us happen to Hitler, Luzo,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.600
 look like competition."

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.960
 You're thinking of Charlie Chaplin then?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.360
 Hitler came third in a Charlie Chaplin look like competition.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.640
 I do have a true example.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.400
 Graham Greene, the author, once entered a competition

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.200
 of writing like Graham Greene and came second.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.840
 Oh.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.640
 Which is fantastic.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.000
 I think it was in the New States, man.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.720
 Well, speaking of him like Hitler and whoever,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.880
 is it true all the stuff about dictators

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.560
 getting look-alikes for themselves?

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.080
 Um, dictators look-alikes.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.120
 I don't know much about them.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.120
 Well, I know one thing is that there was a guy

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.880
 who looked just like Saddam Hussein

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.480
 and he got a kidnapped or attempted a kidnapped

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.000
 from some guys in Egypt

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.800
 because they wanted to make a porn movie of him.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.440
 No.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.000
 Yeah.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.760
 He got away for that was his claim.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.400
 Because he didn't want to be in a porn movie or...

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.840
 Some people have no ambition, do they?

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.480
 His name, Kim Jong Un.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.520
 Oh, is it?

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.200
 Kim Jong Un.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.080
 He has made everyone in Korea have the same hair cut as him.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.840
 And there's a story about how,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.000
 if one direction wanted to perform in Korea,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.840
 they were going to have to have the hair cut like him.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.200
 Did you see that in the news?

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.000
 I don't know any of you.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.720
 The other day.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.440
 One direction wanted to perform in North Korea.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.600
 Now, I don't know much about the touring circuits

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.720
 in the stadiums of North Korea,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.760
 but I think that story.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.120
 But they're not like people to go.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.120
 Well, I can tell you that I'm pretty sure about this.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.680
 I think North Korea has a world's largest spot stadium.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.320
 I'm sure it has.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.960
 It's got the world's largest everything and nothing else.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.360
 The one direction thing wasn't April fools.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.560
 Louis reports all coming out saying that he's forcing

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.920
 all men at university in North Korea to have his hair cut, Kim Jong Un.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.960
 But I think it seems they're all coming from South Korean media number.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.640
 I would suspect it's not true.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.360
 But apparently, so it used to be that men were allowed to choose

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.600
 from 10 different prescribed haircuts.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.440
 No, men have to pick his apparently.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.320
 So, let's go back to something about surgery.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.280
 It's a surgery, yeah.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.600
 I remember I found this thing last year

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.800
 and I passed it on to you, Mark,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.640
 which was a Gainekamastia in the German Ministry of Defence.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.200
 German soldiers have been marching,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.360
 hitting themselves on the chest with their guns.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.760
 So such an extent that the breasts have been growing

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.600
 and they've had to have reduction surgery.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.640
 That's amazing.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.360
 It's a paper by Björn Durg Kruppel

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.880
 and within six years a total of 211 patients

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.520
 underwent surgery in Germany.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.000
 Wow.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.120
 It's quite a lot of that.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.640
 Yeah, massively.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.400
 Just banging their gun against the chest.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.960
 Yeah, it forces the tissue to grow.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.160
 Oh, wow.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.800
 Yeah, it didn't happen to everybody, but it happened quite a few times.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.240
 Talking of big jobs.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.320
 There's a real lifeer, Barbie and Ken.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.800
 Oh, really?

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.720
 And Ken has had over a hundred surgeries to look more like Ken,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.800
 whereas Barbie's only had a boob job

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.280
 and she does the rest of the lighting and really get makeup.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.440
 And apparently when they met they had a big fight.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.000
 Ken got angry with baked Barbie because he said,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.320
 "I've spent a fortune and I had a hundred surgeries

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.320
 and all you've done is one blame boob job."

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.560
 Totally plastic plastic surgery.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.920
 I did try to get in touch a few years ago with these surgeons.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.280
 Dr. Momeritz, Dr. Abelus, and Dr. Grapp.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.960
 I thought that they would be happy to talk with somebody.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.600
 Even the kind of journalist I am who was interested

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.200
 but not necessarily adoring.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.280
 They were no longer eager to discuss this.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.080
 Oh.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.000
 They must have been made fun of a little bit, I guess,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.960
 by some other people.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.880
 Fortunately, even if they're not popular anymore,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.280
 they have a surefire way of disguising themselves in public.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:58.000
 Okay, let's move on to fact number two,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.560
 which comes from Molly.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.800
 So last week a few of us went on an ELF expedition to the British Museum

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.280
 and we went to the Viking exhibition.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.960
 So I thought I'd talk a little bit about Viking.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.680
 The largest Viking ship ever found was discovered

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.840
 when they renovated the Viking ship museum.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.640
 Brilliant.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.880
 Actually, underneath it, all.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.800
 They were basically extending the museum

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.920
 and they dug down into the fjord literally outside the museum

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.960
 and there they found the longest Viking ship ever found

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.720
 and a whole bunch of other ships do.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.160
 That's so convenient, isn't it?

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.800
 Yeah.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.960
 And underneath that, they found another ship.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.760
 They found another museum which was upside down

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.200
 and it was a mirror with nevermind.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.880
 Do you remember that guy who got buried upside down atop his horse?

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.080
 He buried him upside down.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.400
 He was sat on his horse upside down and the reason he did it

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.240
 is because he believed when the world ended,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.560
 everyone would get sucked up to heaven.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.640
 So if he was upside down, he'd be the right way round.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.280
 Brilliant.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.320
 Have you found it, other?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.640
 Yes, it was in Surrey, I think.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.520
 A few miles away, a horse is buried upside down too.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.640
 And the National Trust says,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.520
 "You might think this is major Peter Labilly's horse."

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.200
 This isn't the guy who was buried up to now.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.040
 But it's actually just a big coincidence.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.120
 Oh, that is a staggering coincidence.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.920
 Oh, isn't it?

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.760
 Yes, but if you want to see, you can go to Box Hill

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.640
 and check out the grave.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.920
 Or grade in 1800.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.520
 His grave stones is major Peter Labilly age 75,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.760
 eccentric resident of Dawking.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.760
 Sort of implies he knew what he was doing.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.200
 It's a good epitaph to have.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200
 Yeah.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.640
 Vikings, we should get back to Vikings.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.680
 Yeah, they had these things called

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.400
 "Hobback Stones" in the exhibition,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.400
 which were huge stones that they're curved

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.760
 and they are covered with Viking inscriptions.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.240
 And they think what happened was

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.320
 the Vikings saw people here, like Christians,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.560
 burying their dead and putting grave stones.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.560
 And so they copied them with their "Hobback Stones"

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.760
 and kind of made them Scandi Stull

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.840
 with Viking things all over them,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.880
 decorations all over them.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.720
 What was that thing about Viking coins

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.080
 and what inscriptions they had on them?

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.560
 Yeah, the most common written inscription

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.080
 appearing anywhere in Vikings, Scandinavia was,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.920
 what do you think?

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.560
 Well, something about Hrothger, angry face

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.680
 and his sword or something like that.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.520
 What do you think?

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.280
 It was actually, there is no God,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.520
 but Aller alone, he has no partner.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.760
 No way.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.640
 No, how?

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.120
 Pretty weird, because at the beginning of the Viking Age,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.800
 the Islamic world stretched far and wide

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.280
 from Spain to Central Asia

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.200
 and they used a single coinage throughout the empire.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.320
 And the Vikings obviously bought these coins back with them

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.920
 when they went off on their travels.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.400
 They found some of these coins

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.480
 because they've sort of scrubbed out the inscription

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.200
 and put thaws hammer across the top.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.160
 Wow, they were probably protesting

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.000
 outside the Viking Embassy all over the Middle East.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 And it also had some really good Viking graffiti,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.280
 which was like pretty basic.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.280
 They tended to graffiti ships

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.400
 all over the stuff.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.320
 Wow.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.160
 Viking graffiti sounds like it would almost all be good.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.880
 They look like the teenagers of European history, aren't they?

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.960
 They are, yeah.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.200
 And also these skulls, which had, they, they filed down their teeth.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.040
 Oh yeah.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.880
 They're more fearsome.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.480
 These particular Vikings just maybe were the equivalent

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.600
 of this young Belgian man who wanted to have surgery

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.040
 to make him look like Michael Jackson.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.880
 I just want to look like Odin, guys.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.400
 Lots of people having one eye removed

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400
 so they look like Odin.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.240
 I really like the thing though, about finding something

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.440
 in a really convenient place.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.080
 That's such a great story about the ship underneath the ship museum.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.280
 And I like this thing about how they found the new species

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.240
 of book in the Natural History Museum's garden.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.240
 Oh yeah, that was brilliant.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.280
 Yeah, it was amazing.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.960
 And they, they found this book in the garden.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.800
 They picked it up.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.240
 They thought, oh, I've never seen that before.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.760
 They checked against the 28 million specimens

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.560
 they have in the Natural History Museum.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.240
 And it didn't fit any of them.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.400
 That's fantastic.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.360
 How long does it take to check against 20 million

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.200
 of these specimens?

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.000
 God, that poor work experience, boy.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.320
 He thought I'm going to have a nice easy week

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.960
 at the Natural History Museum to Frank.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.080
 Could you just, yeah, there was a woman who did the same thing

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.720
 in Britain somewhere, checking her garden,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.320
 and she found some like 27 species of wasp.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.280
 It's newmon.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.600
 Yeah, Ickneymon wasp. Yeah, yeah. They're the ones who parasitized eggs, don't they?

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.640
 Yeah, I have a fun fact about them, which is that when Alfred Kinsey

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.960
 had the great sex researcher, no, it wasn't Ickneymon.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.760
 It was a, it was gall wasp, he was an expert on,

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.760
 but he traveled the length and breadth of the USA,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.080
 finding these, categorizing them, because he was a maniac collector.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.280
 He wanted to have the biggest collection of everything in the world,

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.360
 parcel them up, label them, and then send them back to the university,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.400
 and a lot of them hatched on the way.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.720
 And so the people were constantly opening packages of live crawling wasp.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.200
 You know, love Alfred. I love that, the Alfred Kinsey,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.200
 that he got into sexology a bit later on in his career, and his wife said,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.720
 "I don't see much of Alfred since he got interested in sex."

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.520
 What about the other thing that they found in York,

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.960
 which was the coprolite, the Viking Poe?

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.800
 Do you remember that one? Oh, we could talk, you know?

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.280
 Did they find that under a Viking museum?

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.600
 A Viking Poe museum.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.640
 No, it was in the Lloyd's Bank when they were excavating, to sell us that.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.400
 Maybe that had been deposited with the bank for safekeeping.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.680
 Quite, yeah. I don't think they let you deposit things like that in the bank.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.120
 The discoverer of the Poe, Andrew Bohm's Jones, commented,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.960
 "This is the most exciting piece of experiment I've ever seen.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.000
 In its own way, it's as valuable as a crown jewels."

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.800
 Andrew Bohm's turned to that man with no sense of priority whatsoever.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.240
 I was looking up Viking names, and I found...

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.200
 Because they have the by names, you know, that Harold Bluetooth.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.240
 Well, Bluetooth is where we get the Bluetooth from mobile phones from, isn't it?

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.320
 We get, it's named after him, I think.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.240
 Harold Bluetooth, yeah. Seriously?

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.240
 No. Why are we going completely off memory here?

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.720
 It might have been that it was Nokia who did it, and they...

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.880
 I'll say it's a leading company. Yeah.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.640
 Nokia used to make guest masks.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.080
 In fact, they supplied them to the Finnish army until about 1995.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.840
 I was at a comedy show the other night, and the host was asking,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.920
 "So, where do you work?" And the guy said, "Oh, I work at Nestle."

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.680
 And then he said, "Okay, but which video are you working?"

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.000
 He said, "I work in the cat food division of Nestle."

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.600
 Nobody in the audience knew that Nestle had a cat food division.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.520
 He obviously didn't say the cat food bit of the sag,

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.000
 because he wants them to think he works in a chocolate company.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.480
 He says that, so they all think he's Willy Wonka.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.080
 And then when they've done a bit further, it's like,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.320
 "Oh, cat food, Willy Wonka, not so good."

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.520
 There's a kind of thing about pet food.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.760
 Most of the work over the years for the companies that sell a lot of dog food,

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.520
 most of the research work was to come up with a dog food that would produce reliable

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.080
 output from the dog, because that's what matters.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.040
 A libel output?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.440
 People, believe solids, are nicer than liquids.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.440
 There was a dog poo lottery in Taiwan,

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.120
 where to get a ticket for the lottery,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.200
 you had to turn up with a bag of dog poo.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.160
 About 2,000 people turned up. It was a runaway success.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.040
 And so she was cleaning her day, and then someone won...

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.120
 I don't know what the price was, maybe about £1,000.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.880
 But 1,000 bags of dog poo.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.840
 Lovely!

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.280
 I'm your dog.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.160
 I really like that Taiwanese city officials eventually have to say,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.520
 like, release a statement, saying,

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.120
 "The city simply cannot afford to keep exchanging dog poo for gold."

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.520
 She was like strong economic reasoning, then.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.400
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.240
 Well, Andrew Boan's drones would disagree, of course.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.720
 He'd exchange the Lloyd to bank copper life for the crown jewels, but...

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:08.880
 So the next fact is for me, and it is this one.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.560
 The tobacco hornworm uses extremely bad halitosis

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.560
 to prevent heredifices from eating it.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.800
 Oh, I love the tobacco hornworm.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.960
 So I found this in the Smithsonian magazine,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.000
 because I was trying to...

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.400
 I was doing a lungs research for the L.C.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.800
 It was my sort of got distracted and started reading about breath,

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.000
 and bad breath.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.640
 And this is an animal which has such bad breath

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.440
 that other predators think it's actively poisonous.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.480
 They have actually filmed tobacco hornworm

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.640
 and one of these spiders coming towards it.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.280
 I somehow researched this disabled this gene,

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.360
 so that it couldn't give off the tobaccoy smell,

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.320
 and this spider just came towards it and went to eat it.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.000
 I like the thing about animals using different ways for defence.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.080
 Like, the hagfish, you remember that guy that we did?

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.320
 They created an inordinate amount of slime,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.040
 and that's supposed to be a way of getting rid of predators.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.240
 If you pick up a hagfish, it will slide all over you,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.720
 and then it basically falls out of your hands, and it's disgusting.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.640
 The worst thing about it is that there is a danger

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.920
 that the hagfish will suffocate in its own slide, so that'd be...

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.800
 Oh wow!

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.040
 The Texas horned lizard shoots blood out of its eyes to get rid of predators,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.800
 and there's a crazy video which we can post out.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.040
 It can squirt blood five feet,

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.520
 and the blood has got a final tasting chemical in it as well,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.080
 so...

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.760
 Yeah, another thing Texans are proud of.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.360
 And it can release a third of its blood supply doing this,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.280
 so it's kind of a quite exhausting thing for it to do,

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.400
 so it only does it in history.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.600
 So it actually is blood?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.520
 Yeah, out of its eyes.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.200
 Blood for one animal is almost always food for some other animals,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.320
 so maybe it's food source and it's distracting everything.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.440
 Oh, it can't well be.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.440
 The predators just go straight for the blood, yeah.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.880
 Turkey Vultures do the same thing,

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.760
 which is where they, if they're very full after a meal,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.120
 and they're approached by a predator,

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.800
 they throw up on the ground,

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.720
 saying, "Okay, well, rather than eating meat,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.400
 you can just have everything have just eaten."

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.840
 And the bird flies away.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.760
 There's a bird called the Eurasian Roller,

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.720
 and the chicks vomit over themselves to scare people away.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.920
 I do that.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.800
 If you're on the train,

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.120
 and you need the seats next to you to be clear,

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.320
 vomit over yourself,

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.160
 or you could do what a potato beetle does

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.000
 and cubby yourself in your own experiment.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.880
 Wow, it's amazing.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.840
 Wow, yeah.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.280
 Mark, do you know this paper

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.120
 called "Farting as a Defense Against Unspeakable Dread?"

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.000
 I do.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.760
 It's like the author was given an ignovel price.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.720
 Oh, for that.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.200
 Her name is Mara Siddoli.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.200
 I never met her, but we corresponded.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.080
 She was Italian.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.600
 She lived in Washington, D.C.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.760
 She was really pleased

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.920
 to be getting recognition for this paper.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.960
 This was a case report about a very small boy,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.560
 maybe four years old.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.960
 Whenever this boy became very distressed,

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.400
 he would begin farting.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.160
 She was a good writer at Mara Siddoli.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.120
 It was Dr. Siddoli.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.640
 And she describes exactly what this little kid was doing

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.480
 and the effect on the room

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.520
 and how she spent weeks and months talking with him

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.320
 and trying to calm him down so he no longer did this.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.080
 And she was successful.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.000
 Is it to drive people away?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.960
 That's what she felt.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.320
 It says that he enveloped himself in a protective cloud

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.240
 of familiarity against the drug.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.040
 Familiarity.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.040
 Yeah, I've never had a call that before.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.840
 Sorry, darling, there's a bit of familiarity in the room.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.360
 The details of it read in passages

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.760
 like a battle, a very personal battle

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.120
 between she, the older woman psychiatrist

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.920
 and he, the child, where she would say something

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.160
 and then he would respond with a cloud of fart.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.120
 But eventually, eventually, they came to an understanding.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.920
 She was like, I'll leave and you can just come home.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.880
 I was lazy.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.240
 Mark, do you find that those are the most interesting papers

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.280
 to you personally?

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.320
 I have many favourites.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.400
 What makes something pleasing to me is something

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.000
 that I never expected.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.680
 That's really the quality.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.440
 One of the ones which really sticks in my head

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.400
 is exiting a building and then formal look.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.760
 Which we drink as yeah.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.840
 Which is about whether people given the choice

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.600
 of an open door and a closed one,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.480
 how many of them gravitate towards the open door,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.280
 how many stubbornly stay on their path

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.800
 and open the closed door instead?

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.760
 I just thought it was a must.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.560
 He went to the doorway of a large building in New York City

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.600
 and he stayed there for hours, simply taking notes.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.280
 I believe it was a couple years later,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.000
 he repeated the experiment to see what had changed.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.840
 He tended to do this.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.280
 He got obsessions.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.120
 He would write reports to amuse himself.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.440
 He wasn't trying to convince anybody

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.400
 that these things were important.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.920
 He did this really to remove his frustrations.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.920
 If something annoyed him,

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.160
 he saw something in his daily life

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.760
 that annoyed him, that kept happening.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.360
 At some point, he would decide to be amused by it

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.080
 and he would go with a piece of paper and a pen

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.880
 and sit there for several hours and count.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.520
 Simply count.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.160
 How many people do this annoying thing and how many don't?

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.720
 I had a few hours free in Ueno station in Tokyo at the end of last year

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.960
 and I decided to count how many people were wearing

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.280
 medical masks because in Japan,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.880
 if you have cold or a cough,

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.120
 it's considered polite to wear one of the masks.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.800
 Especially if you're a hangfish.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.320
 And the answer was really annoying

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.080
 because it was a perfectly neat number.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.360
 So it was 110 people out of 1,100 people.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.960
 Are you counting 1,000 people?

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.000
 I was very close.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.080
 I had about an hour and a half and I just decided

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.680
 everyone who passes a particular point.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.680
 Professor Trinkus is now in his 80s.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.640
 He's slowing down.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.440
 He's publishing at a far slower rate.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.880
 Well, if he wants to success,

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.000
 I will go and count things.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.800
 That's the way.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.520
 Just could become the new Trinkus.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.320
 I think it's two.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.640
 OK, let's go back to bad breath.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.440
 I have found this.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.400
 It's quite weird.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.160
 Welsh law in medieval law was quite unusual

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.120
 in that it was not too difficult for wives

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.400
 to divorce their husbands.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.560
 Usually that's quite a difficult thing in most laws.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.360
 Usually if you got divorced as a woman,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.160
 you would struggle to get your fair share of

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.000
 whatever was in the marriage, the money,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.520
 and the property, and whatever.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.520
 But there are a few different reasons that you could get

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.760
 the money that you were owed.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.400
 Neglect, leprosy, or bad breath.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.920
 If it's a family where the wife prepares the food,

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.360
 she just puts garlic in and has been food.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.120
 They have garlic in those days and miles

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.040
 because you found out that thing, didn't you understand?

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.840
 Yes.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.600
 I mean, the process of trying to find out

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.840
 exactly when garlic and leeks got to oils.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.080
 This has caused a little bit of controversy

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.360
 in the QI offices.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.640
 OK, I'll get it.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.960
 We've covered bad breath on the show.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.560
 We did about how it was mostly invented by history.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.640
 Because history was originally sold

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.640
 as a surgical antiseptic.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.400
 And then it was just changed to be marketed as a mouthwash.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.400
 I think it might have been used to clean floors,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.720
 but in the risk of a lawsuit, I'm going to say,

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.000
 maybe, that one.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.720
 Oh, Anna, do you have something for us?

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.360
 History was definitely sold as floor cleaner

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.440
 before the 1920s when it realized it was a mouthwash.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.520
 I think you can say that universities

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.720
 have released publications that say that.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.800
 It was also sold as a cure for gonorrhea.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.480
 Or chapped lips.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.120
 Neither of these things was known since we're very successful.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.760
 A floor cleaner thing would maybe tie in with the five-second rule.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.800
 The idea that if you drop food on the floor,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.680
 and it's there for less than five seconds, it's safe to eat.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.440
 There was a paper that just came out.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.800
 And it confirmed what an American high school girl had done

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.600
 a decade earlier that we gave an ignoble promise to.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.600
 It depends on the floor and the food.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.560
 If the floor is clean and it's not sticky,

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.680
 probably no problem.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.400
 If it's sticky food and the floor hasn't been cleaned for a while,

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.160
 if there's been coprolized on it.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.440
 So that kind of thing.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.960
 No listerine around.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.840
 Yeah.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.800
 And it's custard.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.440
 Yeah.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.120
 You're not going to want to think you're not going to think you're not.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.600
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.560
 Let's move to fact number four now, which this week comes from James.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.360
 OK.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.880
 My fact is, you could have fallen asleep up to five times

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.440
 during this podcast and not known about it.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.480
 Um, that's it.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.520
 What could that be?

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.400
 OK, I've been reading a book this week by Richard Liesman.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.200
 It's just come out.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.560
 It's called Night School.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.560
 I'm currently 30% of the way through, according to my kindle app.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.240
 And he was talking about these things called micro-sleeps.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.320
 And these are temporary episodes of sleep,

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.600
 which may last from fraction of a second or up to 30 seconds,

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.120
 where you would fail to respond to some arbitrary sensory input.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.520
 And it's like being asleep for a very short amount of time.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.520
 And he talks about this experiment.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.400
 It was a reporter called Ron Claibon from ABC,

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.520
 who stayed awake for 32 hours.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.240
 They connected him to a device that measured his brain activity

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.240
 and set him driving on a track for two hours.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.040
 Oh, god.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.640
 And when they looked at his brain activity,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.040
 according to their study, they found that he'd

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.840
 taken more than 20 micro-sleeps during his drive.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.560
 Oh, wow.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.040
 Yeah.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.560
 Does this go on all day long?

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.280
 Even normal times, or is it, only during times

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.080
 of great sleep deprivation?

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.320
 Yeah, it happens mostly with sleep deprivation.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.080
 There was a programme on Channel 4 called--

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.320
 I think it was called Shattered several years ago.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.400
 And it was a reality show where the premise was,

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.240
 you have to stay awake for 10 days.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.520
 Oh, I know.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.400
 And you could be evicted for having a micro-sleep.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.240
 But I think the limit they put on there was 10 seconds

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.120
 of being asleep.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.480
 What do they monitor their brains?

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.960
 But the science of this is really, like,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.640
 it's difficult to work out, isn't it, Mark?

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.760
 There's lots of science.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.360
 There are lots of branches of science.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.600
 There are lots of fields, and some of them are much ifier than others,

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.680
 simply because it's really difficult

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.360
 to measure this stuff reliably.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.280
 Try to figure out your own sleep, anything

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.240
 about your own patterns of sleep.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.200
 It's very, very difficult.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.680
 If you're going to measure something,

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.640
 what exactly do you measure?

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.280
 You can talk about it, and it sounds great.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.720
 But when you actually have to sit down and do it,

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.960
 what exactly are you measuring?

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.240
 Even with these micro things, everything about sleep

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:37.880
 is like that.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.760
 So there are a bunch of sleep researchers

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.400
 around the world, and they work very hard.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.400
 But it's hard for them to be sure that almost anything

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.840
 that they're telling people really is reliably

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.600
 the story of sleep.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.120
 At this point, it's all good stories

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.320
 with a little bit of data.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.040
 But when you get down to something like claiming

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.160
 that, well, people dream 30% of the night.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.160
 How do you really know?

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.880
 I think people can dream outside REM sleep,

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.440
 which was thought previously to be the benchmark

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.680
 for when you were dreaming.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.640
 And so we don't know that either.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.800
 So all this stuff is real.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.840
 This is very, very-- the people who do it are trying to measure

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.320
 things that are really difficult to measure.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.720
 So they're trying to do something really commendable.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.200
 Yeah, just going back to your thing about Shattered.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.760
 And there was a guy in America called--

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.280
 he was a DJ called Trip.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.800
 I can't remember his first name.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.480
 And in 1959, he tried to stay awake for eight days,

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.600
 I think it was, and do his radio show,

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.560
 and see how it would affect him.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.800
 And after about four or five days,

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.280
 he started seeing mice running around the studio,

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.400
 which weren't there.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.080
 He would see spiders coming out of his shoes,

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.680
 and he thought his desk was on fire.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.760
 And when a doctor came to look after him,

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.760
 he thought he was an undertaker coming

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.520
 to take him away and bury him on the side down on the horse.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.440
 But there was another guy.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.400
 There was a student called Randy Gardner.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.760
 And this was a few years later in 1964.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.720
 He tried to set a new world record for staying awake.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.560
 And he did it for a few days, a few days, a few days.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.640
 And by the end, he was also hallucinating.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.160
 He thought he was a black American football player.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.240
 He was white, but he thought he was a black American football player.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.720
 And when his friends started saying,

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.560
 "No, you're not a black American football player."

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.800
 He started calling them racists.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.560
 That's amazing.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.400
 The British Department of Transport

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.000
 says that 20% of accidents on motorways

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.080
 are sleep-related.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.400
 It's on browser's, three-mile island, Chernobyl.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.080
 All of them had people who were quite sleep deprived

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:32.880
 at the controls.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.080
 I think it's a suspect that it's not a coincidence.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.080
 Yeah.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.880
 I have a fact to drag it completely down market.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.280
 Inputants can be measured by--

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.080
 it's quite tricky, because sometimes it's psychological

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.920
 and sometimes it's physical.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.280
 So one method of testing is to test whether people

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.920
 get directions as they sleep.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.840
 And in the 20th century, one method of testing this

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.000
 was to seal a perforated strip of postage stamps

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.320
 around the penis at the base and see if the stamp

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.200
 tore during the night.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.080
 That's a good idea.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.480
 It's a brilliant idea.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.640
 It's low-cost science.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.920
 If you're turned on by the queen's face, that's gone.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.520
 This is a weird thing.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.840
 This is a paper called "Dreaming and Sexuality."

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.840
 It's quite an old one, 1966 by a guy called Fisher,

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.320
 or a woman called Fisher, I'm not sure.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.360
 They found that erections happen when you're dreaming,

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.080
 even in the most mundane of dreams.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.800
 It doesn't have to be a sexual dream for you

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.960
 to get an erection.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.320
 Just do me about your mum doing the washing habit.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.840
 Or the queen, I don't know.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.080
 But yeah, I mean, I'm not sure what their methodology was,

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.600
 but that was their findings.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.840
 Amazing.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.440
 Mark, you really like-- I know you like her patents, don't you?

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.200
 I do.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:42.800
 I found this--

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.720
 Not but you should everyone.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.960
 No, no, but they're the amazing ones.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.480
 I found them a patent for inducing sleep from 1885.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.040
 This was by Fanny Paul.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.200
 It was pretty simple.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.160
 It basically, it was a piece of water or leather.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.040
 What did it around your neck?

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.600
 It would stop the blood flow to the brain,

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.880
 and it would make you sleep.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.200
 And it said, "It thereby reduces the activity of the brain

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.200
 in order that sleep may ensue."

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.040
 Oh god.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.200
 And you were just ticin' it, ticin' it until you fell asleep.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.880
 Oh, I'd love to see details in there, James.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.880
 Yeah, I'll send it on.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.320
 Anna, do you have anything on sleep for us?

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.880
 Not a whole lot from that section.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.440
 I'd like to let you guys come to the door.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.720
 And I can tell you that in that programme,

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.920
 I've shattered that I also remember.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.240
 And it seems like it wouldn't be allowed to be put on now.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.440
 They all had various amusing hallucinations.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.200
 One of the runners-up believed to be a prime minister

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.400
 of Australia.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.520
 The winner thought she was in a tube station the whole time,

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.560
 but two of them became convinced that their clothes

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.240
 have been stolen, which I think is kind of interesting.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.280
 But two people have the same delusion and all hallucinations.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:44.280
 OK, that's our podcast done for another week.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.440
 Thanks very much for listening.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.680
 We hope you've enjoyed it.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.360
 If you want to get in touch with any of us,

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.080
 you can do so on Twitter.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.800
 James is at egg-shaped.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.800
 Mark is at Mark Abrahams.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.960
 Molly is at Molly Oldfield.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.240
 Anna is on the very brink of joining Twitter,

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.120
 but in the meantime, you can get through to her

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.640
 on @quikipedia, which is the official QI account.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.960
 And I'm @andruhunterm.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.840
 Also, if you go to our website, which is qi.com/podcast,

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.040
 we're going to be putting up a whole lot of extra stuff,

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.280
 extra links, articles, videos, all kinds of things.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.880
 And you'll also be able to see the details of Mark's book,

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.880
 which has just been published.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.560
 And it's called This Is Improbable 2.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.640
 We'll be back next week with another podcast.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.520
 And until then, bye.
