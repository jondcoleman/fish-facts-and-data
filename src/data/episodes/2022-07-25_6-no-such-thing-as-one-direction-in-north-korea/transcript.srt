1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,760
 It's kind of a nice such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,920
 No, seriously, it's kind of the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,640
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:27,200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,240
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,000
 Once again, we've gathered around a microphone to discuss our favourite facts

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,520
 from the last seven days.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,280
 My name's Andy Murray and I'm joined by three other QI elves.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,600
 Their names are James Harkin, Molly Oldfield and on fact checking duty today,

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,800
 Anarchersinsky.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,040
 We also have a special guest with us today, whose name is Mark Abrahams.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,960
 And for those of you who don't know him,

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,520
 Mark is the founder of the Ignobel Prizes,

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,560
 which is a series of awards given out every year

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,480
 for pieces of research that first make you laugh and then make you think.

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,200
 So as an example, this year's Probability Prize went to a team of scientists

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,360
 for making two related discoveries.

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,240
 First, that the longer a cow has been lying down,

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,320
 the more likely that cow will soon stand up.

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,760
 And second, that once a cow stands up,

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,360
 you cannot easily predict how soon that cow will lie down again.

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,520
 Hello, Mark.

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,160
 Hello, thank you for inviting me to your elf cast.

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,560
 Thank you.

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
 Thank you for coming along.

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
 I'm delighted to be visiting your country from my native home of America.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,480
 The Ignobel show is touring the UK at the moment, doesn't it?

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:34,960
 That's right.

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
 And Denmark and Sweden.

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,440
 Oh my goodness, okay.

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,840
 So listen, as in Denmark and Sweden, look out for that.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,960
 So let's kick off with fact number one, which is from you, Mark.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,720
 Fact number one is that a number of years ago,

36
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,040
 some plastic surgeons in Belgium,

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,080
 they had a young Belgian man who came to them,

38
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,560
 wanting to have surgery performed to make him look more like his idol,

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,240
 the singer Michael Jackson.

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,440
 This is a technique first used on Michael Jackson himself.

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,320
 Exactly.

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,080
 There are lots of interesting questions.

43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,440
 It's very interesting, it's a difficult piece of surgery.

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,640
 And in this medical report, the surgeons

45
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,040
 probably describe exactly how they did it

46
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,480
 and say that they succeeded.

47
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,680
 Wow, that's amazing.

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,800
 When was this?

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,520
 This was about 1997.

50
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,880
 Do they have to do special thing where the skin got whiter and whiter and whiter?

51
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,080
 Well, they're Michael Jackson.

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,240
 Well, these were plastic surgeons and

53
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,720
 when they write a report in a medical journal,

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,080
 they talk about just one specific thing they were doing.

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,720
 Wouldn't it be terrible to get the surgery done

56
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,920
 and then discover that you can't dance or sing

57
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,760
 anywhere near as well as Michael Jackson could?

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
 Because nobody could, for a start.

59
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,080
 That's where robotics could enter the picture.

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,480
 Right.

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,280
 And moonwalking.

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
 I mean, you must be able to perfect moonwalking

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
 if you practice it for long enough, do you think?

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,320
 Yeah, but moonwalking was not the only dance move that Jackson did.

65
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,480
 But one of the main ones, come on.

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,520
 It wasn't amazing.

67
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,560
 He was an amazing dancer.

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,120
 We did on QI that it wasn't invented by Michael Jackson.

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,600
 Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,200
 It was invented by Bill Bailey, right?

71
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,840
 Yeah, it was an old guy called Bill Bailey,

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,440
 not our Bill Bailey, the other one.

73
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,120
 And also by the mannequin,

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,160
 do you remember that video?

75
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,520
 You know, Red Cat mannequin.

76
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,640
 Yeah, it's brilliant.

77
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
 This brilliant bird that has a mating ritual

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,800
 that kind of climbs up a branch

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,600
 and then it slides back down like Michael Jackson.

80
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,160
 We always see on QI when we're doing our research,

81
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,800
 Dolly Parton or Charlie Chaplin came third,

82
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,000
 you know, Charlie Chaplin or a Dolly Parton look like competition.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,680
 I don't know if any of those is true.

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,760
 Have you ever found any evidence that it's true?

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
 Well, Chaplin was so famous in his time

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,240
 that if you were going to have a look like competition for anyone,

87
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,120
 it probably would be him.

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
 Yeah, but him coming third.

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
 Like, "don't make us happen to Hitler, Luzo,

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,600
 look like competition."

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,960
 You're thinking of Charlie Chaplin then?

92
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,360
 Hitler came third in a Charlie Chaplin look like competition.

93
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,640
 I do have a true example.

94
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,400
 Graham Greene, the author, once entered a competition

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,200
 of writing like Graham Greene and came second.

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,840
 Oh.

97
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,640
 Which is fantastic.

98
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
 I think it was in the New States, man.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,720
 Well, speaking of him like Hitler and whoever,

100
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,880
 is it true all the stuff about dictators

101
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,560
 getting look-alikes for themselves?

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,080
 Um, dictators look-alikes.

103
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,120
 I don't know much about them.

104
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
 Well, I know one thing is that there was a guy

105
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,880
 who looked just like Saddam Hussein

106
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,480
 and he got a kidnapped or attempted a kidnapped

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
 from some guys in Egypt

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,800
 because they wanted to make a porn movie of him.

109
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,440
 No.

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,000
 Yeah.

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,760
 He got away for that was his claim.

112
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,400
 Because he didn't want to be in a porn movie or...

113
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,840
 Some people have no ambition, do they?

114
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,480
 His name, Kim Jong Un.

115
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,520
 Oh, is it?

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,200
 Kim Jong Un.

117
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,080
 He has made everyone in Korea have the same hair cut as him.

118
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,840
 And there's a story about how,

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,000
 if one direction wanted to perform in Korea,

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,840
 they were going to have to have the hair cut like him.

121
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,200
 Did you see that in the news?

122
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,000
 I don't know any of you.

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,720
 The other day.

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,440
 One direction wanted to perform in North Korea.

125
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,600
 Now, I don't know much about the touring circuits

126
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,720
 in the stadiums of North Korea,

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,760
 but I think that story.

128
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,120
 But they're not like people to go.

129
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
 Well, I can tell you that I'm pretty sure about this.

130
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,680
 I think North Korea has a world's largest spot stadium.

131
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,320
 I'm sure it has.

132
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,960
 It's got the world's largest everything and nothing else.

133
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,360
 The one direction thing wasn't April fools.

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,560
 Louis reports all coming out saying that he's forcing

135
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,920
 all men at university in North Korea to have his hair cut, Kim Jong Un.

136
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,960
 But I think it seems they're all coming from South Korean media number.

137
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,640
 I would suspect it's not true.

138
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,360
 But apparently, so it used to be that men were allowed to choose

139
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,600
 from 10 different prescribed haircuts.

140
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
 No, men have to pick his apparently.

141
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,320
 So, let's go back to something about surgery.

142
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,280
 It's a surgery, yeah.

143
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,600
 I remember I found this thing last year

144
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,800
 and I passed it on to you, Mark,

145
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,640
 which was a Gainekamastia in the German Ministry of Defence.

146
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,200
 German soldiers have been marching,

147
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,360
 hitting themselves on the chest with their guns.

148
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,760
 So such an extent that the breasts have been growing

149
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,600
 and they've had to have reduction surgery.

150
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,640
 That's amazing.

151
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,360
 It's a paper by Björn Durg Kruppel

152
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,880
 and within six years a total of 211 patients

153
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,520
 underwent surgery in Germany.

154
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,000
 Wow.

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,120
 It's quite a lot of that.

156
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,640
 Yeah, massively.

157
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,400
 Just banging their gun against the chest.

158
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
 Yeah, it forces the tissue to grow.

159
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
 Oh, wow.

160
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,800
 Yeah, it didn't happen to everybody, but it happened quite a few times.

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
 Talking of big jobs.

162
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,320
 There's a real lifeer, Barbie and Ken.

163
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,800
 Oh, really?

164
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,720
 And Ken has had over a hundred surgeries to look more like Ken,

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,800
 whereas Barbie's only had a boob job

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,280
 and she does the rest of the lighting and really get makeup.

167
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,440
 And apparently when they met they had a big fight.

168
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
 Ken got angry with baked Barbie because he said,

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,320
 "I've spent a fortune and I had a hundred surgeries

170
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
 and all you've done is one blame boob job."

171
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,560
 Totally plastic plastic surgery.

172
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,920
 I did try to get in touch a few years ago with these surgeons.

173
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,280
 Dr. Momeritz, Dr. Abelus, and Dr. Grapp.

174
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,960
 I thought that they would be happy to talk with somebody.

175
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,600
 Even the kind of journalist I am who was interested

176
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,200
 but not necessarily adoring.

177
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,280
 They were no longer eager to discuss this.

178
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,080
 Oh.

179
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,000
 They must have been made fun of a little bit, I guess,

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,960
 by some other people.

181
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
 Fortunately, even if they're not popular anymore,

182
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
 they have a surefire way of disguising themselves in public.

183
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:58,000
 Okay, let's move on to fact number two,

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,560
 which comes from Molly.

185
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,800
 So last week a few of us went on an ELF expedition to the British Museum

186
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,280
 and we went to the Viking exhibition.

187
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
 So I thought I'd talk a little bit about Viking.

188
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,680
 The largest Viking ship ever found was discovered

189
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,840
 when they renovated the Viking ship museum.

190
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,640
 Brilliant.

191
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,880
 Actually, underneath it, all.

192
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
 They were basically extending the museum

193
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,920
 and they dug down into the fjord literally outside the museum

194
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,960
 and there they found the longest Viking ship ever found

195
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,720
 and a whole bunch of other ships do.

196
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,160
 That's so convenient, isn't it?

197
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,800
 Yeah.

198
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
 And underneath that, they found another ship.

199
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,760
 They found another museum which was upside down

200
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,200
 and it was a mirror with nevermind.

201
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,880
 Do you remember that guy who got buried upside down atop his horse?

202
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,080
 He buried him upside down.

203
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,400
 He was sat on his horse upside down and the reason he did it

204
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
 is because he believed when the world ended,

205
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,560
 everyone would get sucked up to heaven.

206
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,640
 So if he was upside down, he'd be the right way round.

207
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,280
 Brilliant.

208
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,320
 Have you found it, other?

209
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,640
 Yes, it was in Surrey, I think.

210
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,520
 A few miles away, a horse is buried upside down too.

211
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,640
 And the National Trust says,

212
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,520
 "You might think this is major Peter Labilly's horse."

213
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,200
 This isn't the guy who was buried up to now.

214
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,040
 But it's actually just a big coincidence.

215
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,120
 Oh, that is a staggering coincidence.

216
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,920
 Oh, isn't it?

217
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,760
 Yes, but if you want to see, you can go to Box Hill

218
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,640
 and check out the grave.

219
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,920
 Or grade in 1800.

220
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,520
 His grave stones is major Peter Labilly age 75,

221
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,760
 eccentric resident of Dawking.

222
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,760
 Sort of implies he knew what he was doing.

223
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,200
 It's a good epitaph to have.

224
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
 Yeah.

225
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,640
 Vikings, we should get back to Vikings.

226
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,680
 Yeah, they had these things called

227
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,400
 "Hobback Stones" in the exhibition,

228
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,400
 which were huge stones that they're curved

229
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,760
 and they are covered with Viking inscriptions.

230
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,240
 And they think what happened was

231
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,320
 the Vikings saw people here, like Christians,

232
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,560
 burying their dead and putting grave stones.

233
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
 And so they copied them with their "Hobback Stones"

234
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,760
 and kind of made them Scandi Stull

235
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,840
 with Viking things all over them,

236
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,880
 decorations all over them.

237
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
 What was that thing about Viking coins

238
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
 and what inscriptions they had on them?

239
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,560
 Yeah, the most common written inscription

240
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,080
 appearing anywhere in Vikings, Scandinavia was,

241
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,920
 what do you think?

242
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,560
 Well, something about Hrothger, angry face

243
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,680
 and his sword or something like that.

244
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,520
 What do you think?

245
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,280
 It was actually, there is no God,

246
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,520
 but Aller alone, he has no partner.

247
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,760
 No way.

248
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,640
 No, how?

249
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,120
 Pretty weird, because at the beginning of the Viking Age,

250
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,800
 the Islamic world stretched far and wide

251
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,280
 from Spain to Central Asia

252
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,200
 and they used a single coinage throughout the empire.

253
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,320
 And the Vikings obviously bought these coins back with them

254
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,920
 when they went off on their travels.

255
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,400
 They found some of these coins

256
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,480
 because they've sort of scrubbed out the inscription

257
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,200
 and put thaws hammer across the top.

258
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,160
 Wow, they were probably protesting

259
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,000
 outside the Viking Embassy all over the Middle East.

260
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And it also had some really good Viking graffiti,

261
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,280
 which was like pretty basic.

262
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
 They tended to graffiti ships

263
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,400
 all over the stuff.

264
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,320
 Wow.

265
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,160
 Viking graffiti sounds like it would almost all be good.

266
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,880
 They look like the teenagers of European history, aren't they?

267
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,960
 They are, yeah.

268
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,200
 And also these skulls, which had, they, they filed down their teeth.

269
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,040
 Oh yeah.

270
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,880
 They're more fearsome.

271
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,480
 These particular Vikings just maybe were the equivalent

272
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,600
 of this young Belgian man who wanted to have surgery

273
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,040
 to make him look like Michael Jackson.

274
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,880
 I just want to look like Odin, guys.

275
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,400
 Lots of people having one eye removed

276
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
 so they look like Odin.

277
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,240
 I really like the thing though, about finding something

278
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,440
 in a really convenient place.

279
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,080
 That's such a great story about the ship underneath the ship museum.

280
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,280
 And I like this thing about how they found the new species

281
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,240
 of book in the Natural History Museum's garden.

282
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
 Oh yeah, that was brilliant.

283
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,280
 Yeah, it was amazing.

284
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,960
 And they, they found this book in the garden.

285
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,800
 They picked it up.

286
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,240
 They thought, oh, I've never seen that before.

287
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,760
 They checked against the 28 million specimens

288
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,560
 they have in the Natural History Museum.

289
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,240
 And it didn't fit any of them.

290
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,400
 That's fantastic.

291
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,360
 How long does it take to check against 20 million

292
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,200
 of these specimens?

293
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
 God, that poor work experience, boy.

294
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,320
 He thought I'm going to have a nice easy week

295
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,960
 at the Natural History Museum to Frank.

296
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,080
 Could you just, yeah, there was a woman who did the same thing

297
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,720
 in Britain somewhere, checking her garden,

298
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,320
 and she found some like 27 species of wasp.

299
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,280
 It's newmon.

300
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,600
 Yeah, Ickneymon wasp. Yeah, yeah. They're the ones who parasitized eggs, don't they?

301
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,640
 Yeah, I have a fun fact about them, which is that when Alfred Kinsey

302
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,960
 had the great sex researcher, no, it wasn't Ickneymon.

303
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,760
 It was a, it was gall wasp, he was an expert on,

304
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,760
 but he traveled the length and breadth of the USA,

305
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,080
 finding these, categorizing them, because he was a maniac collector.

306
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,280
 He wanted to have the biggest collection of everything in the world,

307
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,360
 parcel them up, label them, and then send them back to the university,

308
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,400
 and a lot of them hatched on the way.

309
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,720
 And so the people were constantly opening packages of live crawling wasp.

310
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,200
 You know, love Alfred. I love that, the Alfred Kinsey,

311
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 that he got into sexology a bit later on in his career, and his wife said,

312
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,720
 "I don't see much of Alfred since he got interested in sex."

313
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,520
 What about the other thing that they found in York,

314
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,960
 which was the coprolite, the Viking Poe?

315
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,800
 Do you remember that one? Oh, we could talk, you know?

316
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,280
 Did they find that under a Viking museum?

317
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,600
 A Viking Poe museum.

318
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,640
 No, it was in the Lloyd's Bank when they were excavating, to sell us that.

319
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,400
 Maybe that had been deposited with the bank for safekeeping.

320
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,680
 Quite, yeah. I don't think they let you deposit things like that in the bank.

321
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,120
 The discoverer of the Poe, Andrew Bohm's Jones, commented,

322
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,960
 "This is the most exciting piece of experiment I've ever seen.

323
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,000
 In its own way, it's as valuable as a crown jewels."

324
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,800
 Andrew Bohm's turned to that man with no sense of priority whatsoever.

325
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,240
 I was looking up Viking names, and I found...

326
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,200
 Because they have the by names, you know, that Harold Bluetooth.

327
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,240
 Well, Bluetooth is where we get the Bluetooth from mobile phones from, isn't it?

328
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,320
 We get, it's named after him, I think.

329
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,240
 Harold Bluetooth, yeah. Seriously?

330
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
 No. Why are we going completely off memory here?

331
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,720
 It might have been that it was Nokia who did it, and they...

332
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,880
 I'll say it's a leading company. Yeah.

333
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,640
 Nokia used to make guest masks.

334
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,080
 In fact, they supplied them to the Finnish army until about 1995.

335
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,840
 I was at a comedy show the other night, and the host was asking,

336
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,920
 "So, where do you work?" And the guy said, "Oh, I work at Nestle."

337
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,680
 And then he said, "Okay, but which video are you working?"

338
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
 He said, "I work in the cat food division of Nestle."

339
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,600
 Nobody in the audience knew that Nestle had a cat food division.

340
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,520
 He obviously didn't say the cat food bit of the sag,

341
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,000
 because he wants them to think he works in a chocolate company.

342
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,480
 He says that, so they all think he's Willy Wonka.

343
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,080
 And then when they've done a bit further, it's like,

344
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,320
 "Oh, cat food, Willy Wonka, not so good."

345
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,520
 There's a kind of thing about pet food.

346
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,760
 Most of the work over the years for the companies that sell a lot of dog food,

347
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,520
 most of the research work was to come up with a dog food that would produce reliable

348
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,080
 output from the dog, because that's what matters.

349
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,040
 A libel output?

350
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,440
 People, believe solids, are nicer than liquids.

351
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,160
 Oh, yeah.

352
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
 There was a dog poo lottery in Taiwan,

353
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
 where to get a ticket for the lottery,

354
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,200
 you had to turn up with a bag of dog poo.

355
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,160
 About 2,000 people turned up. It was a runaway success.

356
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,040
 And so she was cleaning her day, and then someone won...

357
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,120
 I don't know what the price was, maybe about £1,000.

358
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
 But 1,000 bags of dog poo.

359
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,840
 Lovely!

360
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,280
 I'm your dog.

361
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,160
 I really like that Taiwanese city officials eventually have to say,

362
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,520
 like, release a statement, saying,

363
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,120
 "The city simply cannot afford to keep exchanging dog poo for gold."

364
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,520
 She was like strong economic reasoning, then.

365
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,400
 Yeah, absolutely.

366
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,240
 Well, Andrew Boan's drones would disagree, of course.

367
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,720
 He'd exchange the Lloyd to bank copper life for the crown jewels, but...

368
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:08,880
 So the next fact is for me, and it is this one.

369
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,560
 The tobacco hornworm uses extremely bad halitosis

370
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
 to prevent heredifices from eating it.

371
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,800
 Oh, I love the tobacco hornworm.

372
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,960
 So I found this in the Smithsonian magazine,

373
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,000
 because I was trying to...

374
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,400
 I was doing a lungs research for the L.C.

375
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,800
 It was my sort of got distracted and started reading about breath,

376
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,000
 and bad breath.

377
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,640
 And this is an animal which has such bad breath

378
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,440
 that other predators think it's actively poisonous.

379
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,480
 They have actually filmed tobacco hornworm

380
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,640
 and one of these spiders coming towards it.

381
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,280
 I somehow researched this disabled this gene,

382
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,360
 so that it couldn't give off the tobaccoy smell,

383
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,320
 and this spider just came towards it and went to eat it.

384
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,000
 I like the thing about animals using different ways for defence.

385
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,080
 Like, the hagfish, you remember that guy that we did?

386
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,320
 They created an inordinate amount of slime,

387
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,040
 and that's supposed to be a way of getting rid of predators.

388
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,240
 If you pick up a hagfish, it will slide all over you,

389
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,720
 and then it basically falls out of your hands, and it's disgusting.

390
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,640
 The worst thing about it is that there is a danger

391
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,920
 that the hagfish will suffocate in its own slide, so that'd be...

392
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,800
 Oh wow!

393
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,040
 The Texas horned lizard shoots blood out of its eyes to get rid of predators,

394
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,800
 and there's a crazy video which we can post out.

395
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,040
 It can squirt blood five feet,

396
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,520
 and the blood has got a final tasting chemical in it as well,

397
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,080
 so...

398
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,760
 Yeah, another thing Texans are proud of.

399
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,360
 And it can release a third of its blood supply doing this,

400
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,280
 so it's kind of a quite exhausting thing for it to do,

401
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,400
 so it only does it in history.

402
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,600
 So it actually is blood?

403
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,520
 Yeah, out of its eyes.

404
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,200
 Blood for one animal is almost always food for some other animals,

405
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,320
 so maybe it's food source and it's distracting everything.

406
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
 Oh, it can't well be.

407
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
 The predators just go straight for the blood, yeah.

408
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,880
 Turkey Vultures do the same thing,

409
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,760
 which is where they, if they're very full after a meal,

410
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,120
 and they're approached by a predator,

411
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,800
 they throw up on the ground,

412
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,720
 saying, "Okay, well, rather than eating meat,

413
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,400
 you can just have everything have just eaten."

414
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,840
 And the bird flies away.

415
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,760
 There's a bird called the Eurasian Roller,

416
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,720
 and the chicks vomit over themselves to scare people away.

417
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,920
 I do that.

418
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,800
 If you're on the train,

419
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,120
 and you need the seats next to you to be clear,

420
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,320
 vomit over yourself,

421
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,160
 or you could do what a potato beetle does

422
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
 and cubby yourself in your own experiment.

423
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,880
 Wow, it's amazing.

424
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,840
 Wow, yeah.

425
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,280
 Mark, do you know this paper

426
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,120
 called "Farting as a Defense Against Unspeakable Dread?"

427
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,000
 I do.

428
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,760
 It's like the author was given an ignovel price.

429
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,720
 Oh, for that.

430
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,200
 Her name is Mara Siddoli.

431
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
 I never met her, but we corresponded.

432
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,080
 She was Italian.

433
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,600
 She lived in Washington, D.C.

434
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,760
 She was really pleased

435
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,920
 to be getting recognition for this paper.

436
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,960
 This was a case report about a very small boy,

437
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,560
 maybe four years old.

438
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,960
 Whenever this boy became very distressed,

439
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,400
 he would begin farting.

440
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,160
 She was a good writer at Mara Siddoli.

441
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,120
 It was Dr. Siddoli.

442
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,640
 And she describes exactly what this little kid was doing

443
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,480
 and the effect on the room

444
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,520
 and how she spent weeks and months talking with him

445
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,320
 and trying to calm him down so he no longer did this.

446
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,080
 And she was successful.

447
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,000
 Is it to drive people away?

448
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,960
 That's what she felt.

449
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,320
 It says that he enveloped himself in a protective cloud

450
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,240
 of familiarity against the drug.

451
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,040
 Familiarity.

452
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
 Yeah, I've never had a call that before.

453
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,840
 Sorry, darling, there's a bit of familiarity in the room.

454
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,360
 The details of it read in passages

455
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,760
 like a battle, a very personal battle

456
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,120
 between she, the older woman psychiatrist

457
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,920
 and he, the child, where she would say something

458
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,160
 and then he would respond with a cloud of fart.

459
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,120
 But eventually, eventually, they came to an understanding.

460
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,920
 She was like, I'll leave and you can just come home.

461
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,880
 I was lazy.

462
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,240
 Mark, do you find that those are the most interesting papers

463
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,280
 to you personally?

464
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,320
 I have many favourites.

465
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,400
 What makes something pleasing to me is something

466
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,000
 that I never expected.

467
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,680
 That's really the quality.

468
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,440
 One of the ones which really sticks in my head

469
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,400
 is exiting a building and then formal look.

470
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,760
 Which we drink as yeah.

471
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,840
 Which is about whether people given the choice

472
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,600
 of an open door and a closed one,

473
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,480
 how many of them gravitate towards the open door,

474
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,280
 how many stubbornly stay on their path

475
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,800
 and open the closed door instead?

476
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,760
 I just thought it was a must.

477
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,560
 He went to the doorway of a large building in New York City

478
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,600
 and he stayed there for hours, simply taking notes.

479
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,280
 I believe it was a couple years later,

480
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,000
 he repeated the experiment to see what had changed.

481
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,840
 He tended to do this.

482
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,280
 He got obsessions.

483
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,120
 He would write reports to amuse himself.

484
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,440
 He wasn't trying to convince anybody

485
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,400
 that these things were important.

486
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,920
 He did this really to remove his frustrations.

487
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
 If something annoyed him,

488
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,160
 he saw something in his daily life

489
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,760
 that annoyed him, that kept happening.

490
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,360
 At some point, he would decide to be amused by it

491
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,080
 and he would go with a piece of paper and a pen

492
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,880
 and sit there for several hours and count.

493
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,520
 Simply count.

494
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,160
 How many people do this annoying thing and how many don't?

495
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,720
 I had a few hours free in Ueno station in Tokyo at the end of last year

496
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,960
 and I decided to count how many people were wearing

497
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,280
 medical masks because in Japan,

498
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,880
 if you have cold or a cough,

499
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,120
 it's considered polite to wear one of the masks.

500
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,800
 Especially if you're a hangfish.

501
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,320
 And the answer was really annoying

502
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,080
 because it was a perfectly neat number.

503
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,360
 So it was 110 people out of 1,100 people.

504
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,960
 Are you counting 1,000 people?

505
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,000
 I was very close.

506
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,080
 I had about an hour and a half and I just decided

507
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,680
 everyone who passes a particular point.

508
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
 Professor Trinkus is now in his 80s.

509
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,640
 He's slowing down.

510
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,440
 He's publishing at a far slower rate.

511
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,880
 Well, if he wants to success,

512
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,000
 I will go and count things.

513
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,800
 That's the way.

514
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
 [LAUGHTER]

515
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,520
 Just could become the new Trinkus.

516
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,320
 I think it's two.

517
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,640
 OK, let's go back to bad breath.

518
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,440
 I have found this.

519
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,400
 It's quite weird.

520
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,160
 Welsh law in medieval law was quite unusual

521
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,120
 in that it was not too difficult for wives

522
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,400
 to divorce their husbands.

523
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,560
 Usually that's quite a difficult thing in most laws.

524
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,360
 Usually if you got divorced as a woman,

525
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,160
 you would struggle to get your fair share of

526
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,000
 whatever was in the marriage, the money,

527
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
 and the property, and whatever.

528
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
 But there are a few different reasons that you could get

529
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
 the money that you were owed.

530
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,400
 Neglect, leprosy, or bad breath.

531
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,360
 [LAUGHTER]

532
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,920
 If it's a family where the wife prepares the food,

533
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,360
 she just puts garlic in and has been food.

534
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,120
 They have garlic in those days and miles

535
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,040
 because you found out that thing, didn't you understand?

536
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,840
 Yes.

537
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,600
 I mean, the process of trying to find out

538
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,840
 exactly when garlic and leeks got to oils.

539
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,080
 This has caused a little bit of controversy

540
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,360
 in the QI offices.

541
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,640
 OK, I'll get it.

542
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,960
 We've covered bad breath on the show.

543
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,560
 We did about how it was mostly invented by history.

544
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,640
 Because history was originally sold

545
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
 as a surgical antiseptic.

546
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,400
 And then it was just changed to be marketed as a mouthwash.

547
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
 I think it might have been used to clean floors,

548
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,720
 but in the risk of a lawsuit, I'm going to say,

549
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,000
 maybe, that one.

550
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
 [LAUGHTER]

551
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,720
 Oh, Anna, do you have something for us?

552
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,360
 History was definitely sold as floor cleaner

553
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,440
 before the 1920s when it realized it was a mouthwash.

554
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,520
 I think you can say that universities

555
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,720
 have released publications that say that.

556
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,800
 It was also sold as a cure for gonorrhea.

557
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,480
 Or chapped lips.

558
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,120
 Neither of these things was known since we're very successful.

559
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,760
 A floor cleaner thing would maybe tie in with the five-second rule.

560
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,800
 The idea that if you drop food on the floor,

561
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,680
 and it's there for less than five seconds, it's safe to eat.

562
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,440
 There was a paper that just came out.

563
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,800
 And it confirmed what an American high school girl had done

564
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,600
 a decade earlier that we gave an ignoble promise to.

565
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
 It depends on the floor and the food.

566
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,560
 If the floor is clean and it's not sticky,

567
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,680
 probably no problem.

568
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,400
 If it's sticky food and the floor hasn't been cleaned for a while,

569
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,160
 if there's been coprolized on it.

570
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,440
 So that kind of thing.

571
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,960
 No listerine around.

572
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,840
 Yeah.

573
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,800
 And it's custard.

574
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,440
 Yeah.

575
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,120
 You're not going to want to think you're not going to think you're not.

576
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
 [LAUGHTER]

577
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,600
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

578
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,560
 Let's move to fact number four now, which this week comes from James.

579
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,360
 OK.

580
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,880
 My fact is, you could have fallen asleep up to five times

581
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
 during this podcast and not known about it.

582
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,480
 Um, that's it.

583
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,520
 What could that be?

584
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,400
 OK, I've been reading a book this week by Richard Liesman.

585
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,200
 It's just come out.

586
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,560
 It's called Night School.

587
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,560
 I'm currently 30% of the way through, according to my kindle app.

588
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,240
 And he was talking about these things called micro-sleeps.

589
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,320
 And these are temporary episodes of sleep,

590
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,600
 which may last from fraction of a second or up to 30 seconds,

591
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,120
 where you would fail to respond to some arbitrary sensory input.

592
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
 And it's like being asleep for a very short amount of time.

593
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
 And he talks about this experiment.

594
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,400
 It was a reporter called Ron Claibon from ABC,

595
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,520
 who stayed awake for 32 hours.

596
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,240
 They connected him to a device that measured his brain activity

597
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
 and set him driving on a track for two hours.

598
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,040
 Oh, god.

599
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,640
 And when they looked at his brain activity,

600
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,040
 according to their study, they found that he'd

601
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,840
 taken more than 20 micro-sleeps during his drive.

602
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,560
 Oh, wow.

603
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,040
 Yeah.

604
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,560
 Does this go on all day long?

605
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,280
 Even normal times, or is it, only during times

606
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,080
 of great sleep deprivation?

607
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,320
 Yeah, it happens mostly with sleep deprivation.

608
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,080
 There was a programme on Channel 4 called--

609
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,320
 I think it was called Shattered several years ago.

610
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,400
 And it was a reality show where the premise was,

611
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,240
 you have to stay awake for 10 days.

612
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,520
 Oh, I know.

613
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,400
 And you could be evicted for having a micro-sleep.

614
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,240
 But I think the limit they put on there was 10 seconds

615
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,120
 of being asleep.

616
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,480
 What do they monitor their brains?

617
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,960
 But the science of this is really, like,

618
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,640
 it's difficult to work out, isn't it, Mark?

619
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,760
 There's lots of science.

620
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,360
 There are lots of branches of science.

621
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,600
 There are lots of fields, and some of them are much ifier than others,

622
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,680
 simply because it's really difficult

623
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,360
 to measure this stuff reliably.

624
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,280
 Try to figure out your own sleep, anything

625
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,240
 about your own patterns of sleep.

626
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,200
 It's very, very difficult.

627
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,680
 If you're going to measure something,

628
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,640
 what exactly do you measure?

629
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,280
 You can talk about it, and it sounds great.

630
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,720
 But when you actually have to sit down and do it,

631
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,960
 what exactly are you measuring?

632
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,240
 Even with these micro things, everything about sleep

633
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,880
 is like that.

634
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,760
 So there are a bunch of sleep researchers

635
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,400
 around the world, and they work very hard.

636
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,400
 But it's hard for them to be sure that almost anything

637
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,840
 that they're telling people really is reliably

638
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,600
 the story of sleep.

639
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,120
 At this point, it's all good stories

640
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,320
 with a little bit of data.

641
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,040
 But when you get down to something like claiming

642
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,160
 that, well, people dream 30% of the night.

643
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
 How do you really know?

644
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,880
 I think people can dream outside REM sleep,

645
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,440
 which was thought previously to be the benchmark

646
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,680
 for when you were dreaming.

647
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,640
 And so we don't know that either.

648
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,800
 So all this stuff is real.

649
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,840
 This is very, very-- the people who do it are trying to measure

650
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,320
 things that are really difficult to measure.

651
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,720
 So they're trying to do something really commendable.

652
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,200
 Yeah, just going back to your thing about Shattered.

653
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,760
 And there was a guy in America called--

654
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,280
 he was a DJ called Trip.

655
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,800
 I can't remember his first name.

656
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,480
 And in 1959, he tried to stay awake for eight days,

657
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,600
 I think it was, and do his radio show,

658
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,560
 and see how it would affect him.

659
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,800
 And after about four or five days,

660
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,280
 he started seeing mice running around the studio,

661
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,400
 which weren't there.

662
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,080
 He would see spiders coming out of his shoes,

663
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,680
 and he thought his desk was on fire.

664
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,760
 And when a doctor came to look after him,

665
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
 he thought he was an undertaker coming

666
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,520
 to take him away and bury him on the side down on the horse.

667
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,440
 But there was another guy.

668
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,400
 There was a student called Randy Gardner.

669
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,760
 And this was a few years later in 1964.

670
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,720
 He tried to set a new world record for staying awake.

671
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,560
 And he did it for a few days, a few days, a few days.

672
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,640
 And by the end, he was also hallucinating.

673
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,160
 He thought he was a black American football player.

674
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,240
 He was white, but he thought he was a black American football player.

675
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,720
 And when his friends started saying,

676
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,560
 "No, you're not a black American football player."

677
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,800
 He started calling them racists.

678
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,400
 [LAUGHTER]

679
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,560
 That's amazing.

680
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,400
 The British Department of Transport

681
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,000
 says that 20% of accidents on motorways

682
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,080
 are sleep-related.

683
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,400
 It's on browser's, three-mile island, Chernobyl.

684
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,080
 All of them had people who were quite sleep deprived

685
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,880
 at the controls.

686
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,080
 I think it's a suspect that it's not a coincidence.

687
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
 Yeah.

688
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,880
 I have a fact to drag it completely down market.

689
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,280
 Inputants can be measured by--

690
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,080
 it's quite tricky, because sometimes it's psychological

691
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,920
 and sometimes it's physical.

692
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,280
 So one method of testing is to test whether people

693
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,920
 get directions as they sleep.

694
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,840
 And in the 20th century, one method of testing this

695
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,000
 was to seal a perforated strip of postage stamps

696
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,320
 around the penis at the base and see if the stamp

697
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,200
 tore during the night.

698
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,080
 That's a good idea.

699
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,480
 It's a brilliant idea.

700
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,640
 It's low-cost science.

701
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,920
 If you're turned on by the queen's face, that's gone.

702
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,920
 [LAUGHTER]

703
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,520
 This is a weird thing.

704
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,840
 This is a paper called "Dreaming and Sexuality."

705
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,840
 It's quite an old one, 1966 by a guy called Fisher,

706
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
 or a woman called Fisher, I'm not sure.

707
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,360
 They found that erections happen when you're dreaming,

708
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,080
 even in the most mundane of dreams.

709
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,800
 It doesn't have to be a sexual dream for you

710
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,960
 to get an erection.

711
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,320
 Just do me about your mum doing the washing habit.

712
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,840
 Or the queen, I don't know.

713
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,080
 But yeah, I mean, I'm not sure what their methodology was,

714
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,600
 but that was their findings.

715
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,840
 Amazing.

716
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,440
 Mark, you really like-- I know you like her patents, don't you?

717
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,200
 I do.

718
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,800
 I found this--

719
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,720
 Not but you should everyone.

720
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,960
 No, no, but they're the amazing ones.

721
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,480
 I found them a patent for inducing sleep from 1885.

722
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,040
 This was by Fanny Paul.

723
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,200
 It was pretty simple.

724
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,160
 It basically, it was a piece of water or leather.

725
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,040
 What did it around your neck?

726
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,600
 It would stop the blood flow to the brain,

727
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,880
 and it would make you sleep.

728
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,200
 And it said, "It thereby reduces the activity of the brain

729
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
 in order that sleep may ensue."

730
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,040
 Oh god.

731
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,200
 And you were just ticin' it, ticin' it until you fell asleep.

732
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,880
 Oh, I'd love to see details in there, James.

733
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
 Yeah, I'll send it on.

734
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,320
 Anna, do you have anything on sleep for us?

735
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,880
 Not a whole lot from that section.

736
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,440
 I'd like to let you guys come to the door.

737
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,720
 And I can tell you that in that programme,

738
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,920
 I've shattered that I also remember.

739
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,240
 And it seems like it wouldn't be allowed to be put on now.

740
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,440
 They all had various amusing hallucinations.

741
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,200
 One of the runners-up believed to be a prime minister

742
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,400
 of Australia.

743
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,520
 The winner thought she was in a tube station the whole time,

744
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,560
 but two of them became convinced that their clothes

745
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,240
 have been stolen, which I think is kind of interesting.

746
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,280
 But two people have the same delusion and all hallucinations.

747
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:44,280
 OK, that's our podcast done for another week.

748
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,440
 Thanks very much for listening.

749
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,680
 We hope you've enjoyed it.

750
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,360
 If you want to get in touch with any of us,

751
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,080
 you can do so on Twitter.

752
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,800
 James is at egg-shaped.

753
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
 Mark is at Mark Abrahams.

754
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,960
 Molly is at Molly Oldfield.

755
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,240
 Anna is on the very brink of joining Twitter,

756
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,120
 but in the meantime, you can get through to her

757
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,640
 on @quikipedia, which is the official QI account.

758
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,960
 And I'm @andruhunterm.

759
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,840
 Also, if you go to our website, which is qi.com/podcast,

760
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,040
 we're going to be putting up a whole lot of extra stuff,

761
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,280
 extra links, articles, videos, all kinds of things.

762
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,880
 And you'll also be able to see the details of Mark's book,

763
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
 which has just been published.

764
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,560
 And it's called This Is Improbable 2.

765
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,640
 We'll be back next week with another podcast.

766
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,520
 And until then, bye.
