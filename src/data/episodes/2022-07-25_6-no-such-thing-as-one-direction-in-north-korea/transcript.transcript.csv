00:00:00,00:00:02,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,It's kind of a nice such thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's kind of the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."
00:00:12,00:00:27,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:27,00:00:30,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:30,00:00:34,"Once again, we've gathered around a microphone to discuss our favourite facts"
00:00:34,00:00:35,from the last seven days.
00:00:35,00:00:39,My name's Andy Murray and I'm joined by three other QI elves.
00:00:39,00:00:43,"Their names are James Harkin, Molly Oldfield and on fact checking duty today,"
00:00:43,00:00:44,Anarchersinsky.
00:00:44,00:00:49,"We also have a special guest with us today, whose name is Mark Abrahams."
00:00:49,00:00:50,"And for those of you who don't know him,"
00:00:50,00:00:53,"Mark is the founder of the Ignobel Prizes,"
00:00:53,00:00:56,which is a series of awards given out every year
00:00:56,00:01:00,for pieces of research that first make you laugh and then make you think.
00:01:00,00:01:05,"So as an example, this year's Probability Prize went to a team of scientists"
00:01:05,00:01:07,for making two related discoveries.
00:01:07,00:01:10,"First, that the longer a cow has been lying down,"
00:01:10,00:01:12,the more likely that cow will soon stand up.
00:01:12,00:01:15,"And second, that once a cow stands up,"
00:01:15,00:01:19,you cannot easily predict how soon that cow will lie down again.
00:01:19,00:01:21,"Hello, Mark."
00:01:21,00:01:24,"Hello, thank you for inviting me to your elf cast."
00:01:24,00:01:24,Thank you.
00:01:25,00:01:27,Thank you for coming along.
00:01:27,00:01:30,I'm delighted to be visiting your country from my native home of America.
00:01:30,00:01:34,"The Ignobel show is touring the UK at the moment, doesn't it?"
00:01:34,00:01:34,That's right.
00:01:34,00:01:36,And Denmark and Sweden.
00:01:36,00:01:37,"Oh my goodness, okay."
00:01:37,00:01:39,"So listen, as in Denmark and Sweden, look out for that."
00:01:39,00:01:44,"So let's kick off with fact number one, which is from you, Mark."
00:01:44,00:01:48,"Fact number one is that a number of years ago,"
00:01:48,00:01:51,"some plastic surgeons in Belgium,"
00:01:51,00:01:54,"they had a young Belgian man who came to them,"
00:01:54,00:01:58,"wanting to have surgery performed to make him look more like his idol,"
00:01:58,00:02:00,the singer Michael Jackson.
00:02:00,00:02:03,This is a technique first used on Michael Jackson himself.
00:02:03,00:02:04,Exactly.
00:02:04,00:02:06,There are lots of interesting questions.
00:02:06,00:02:09,"It's very interesting, it's a difficult piece of surgery."
00:02:09,00:02:12,"And in this medical report, the surgeons"
00:02:12,00:02:15,probably describe exactly how they did it
00:02:15,00:02:16,and say that they succeeded.
00:02:16,00:02:17,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:02:17,00:02:18,When was this?
00:02:18,00:02:21,This was about 1997.
00:02:21,00:02:24,Do they have to do special thing where the skin got whiter and whiter and whiter?
00:02:24,00:02:26,"Well, they're Michael Jackson."
00:02:26,00:02:28,"Well, these were plastic surgeons and"
00:02:28,00:02:30,"when they write a report in a medical journal,"
00:02:30,00:02:34,they talk about just one specific thing they were doing.
00:02:34,00:02:36,Wouldn't it be terrible to get the surgery done
00:02:36,00:02:39,and then discover that you can't dance or sing
00:02:39,00:02:41,anywhere near as well as Michael Jackson could?
00:02:41,00:02:43,"Because nobody could, for a start."
00:02:43,00:02:46,That's where robotics could enter the picture.
00:02:46,00:02:46,Right.
00:02:46,00:02:47,And moonwalking.
00:02:47,00:02:49,"I mean, you must be able to perfect moonwalking"
00:02:49,00:02:51,"if you practice it for long enough, do you think?"
00:02:51,00:02:54,"Yeah, but moonwalking was not the only dance move that Jackson did."
00:02:54,00:02:56,"But one of the main ones, come on."
00:02:56,00:02:57,It wasn't amazing.
00:02:57,00:02:58,He was an amazing dancer.
00:02:58,00:03:01,We did on QI that it wasn't invented by Michael Jackson.
00:03:01,00:03:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:01,00:03:03,"It was invented by Bill Bailey, right?"
00:03:03,00:03:05,"Yeah, it was an old guy called Bill Bailey,"
00:03:05,00:03:07,"not our Bill Bailey, the other one."
00:03:07,00:03:09,"And also by the mannequin,"
00:03:09,00:03:10,do you remember that video?
00:03:10,00:03:11,"You know, Red Cat mannequin."
00:03:11,00:03:12,"Yeah, it's brilliant."
00:03:12,00:03:14,This brilliant bird that has a mating ritual
00:03:14,00:03:16,that kind of climbs up a branch
00:03:16,00:03:19,and then it slides back down like Michael Jackson.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"We always see on QI when we're doing our research,"
00:03:22,00:03:24,"Dolly Parton or Charlie Chaplin came third,"
00:03:24,00:03:28,"you know, Charlie Chaplin or a Dolly Parton look like competition."
00:03:28,00:03:29,I don't know if any of those is true.
00:03:29,00:03:31,Have you ever found any evidence that it's true?
00:03:31,00:03:34,"Well, Chaplin was so famous in his time"
00:03:34,00:03:36,"that if you were going to have a look like competition for anyone,"
00:03:36,00:03:37,it probably would be him.
00:03:37,00:03:38,"Yeah, but him coming third."
00:03:38,00:03:40,"Like, ""don't make us happen to Hitler, Luzo,"
00:03:40,00:03:41,"look like competition."""
00:03:41,00:03:42,You're thinking of Charlie Chaplin then?
00:03:42,00:03:47,Hitler came third in a Charlie Chaplin look like competition.
00:03:47,00:03:48,I do have a true example.
00:03:48,00:03:52,"Graham Greene, the author, once entered a competition"
00:03:52,00:03:55,of writing like Graham Greene and came second.
00:03:55,00:03:55,Oh.
00:03:55,00:03:56,Which is fantastic.
00:03:56,00:03:58,"I think it was in the New States, man."
00:03:58,00:04:00,"Well, speaking of him like Hitler and whoever,"
00:04:00,00:04:02,is it true all the stuff about dictators
00:04:02,00:04:04,getting look-alikes for themselves?
00:04:04,00:04:06,"Um, dictators look-alikes."
00:04:06,00:04:07,I don't know much about them.
00:04:07,00:04:09,"Well, I know one thing is that there was a guy"
00:04:09,00:04:10,who looked just like Saddam Hussein
00:04:10,00:04:14,and he got a kidnapped or attempted a kidnapped
00:04:14,00:04:16,from some guys in Egypt
00:04:16,00:04:18,because they wanted to make a porn movie of him.
00:04:18,00:04:19,No.
00:04:19,00:04:20,Yeah.
00:04:20,00:04:21,He got away for that was his claim.
00:04:21,00:04:24,Because he didn't want to be in a porn movie or...
00:04:24,00:04:25,"Some people have no ambition, do they?"
00:04:25,00:04:28,"His name, Kim Jong Un."
00:04:28,00:04:29,"Oh, is it?"
00:04:29,00:04:31,Kim Jong Un.
00:04:31,00:04:34,He has made everyone in Korea have the same hair cut as him.
00:04:34,00:04:35,"And there's a story about how,"
00:04:35,00:04:38,"if one direction wanted to perform in Korea,"
00:04:38,00:04:39,they were going to have to have the hair cut like him.
00:04:39,00:04:41,Did you see that in the news?
00:04:41,00:04:42,I don't know any of you.
00:04:42,00:04:42,The other day.
00:04:42,00:04:45,One direction wanted to perform in North Korea.
00:04:45,00:04:47,"Now, I don't know much about the touring circuits"
00:04:47,00:04:48,"in the stadiums of North Korea,"
00:04:48,00:04:49,but I think that story.
00:04:49,00:04:51,But they're not like people to go.
00:04:51,00:04:53,"Well, I can tell you that I'm pretty sure about this."
00:04:53,00:04:55,I think North Korea has a world's largest spot stadium.
00:04:55,00:04:56,I'm sure it has.
00:04:56,00:04:58,It's got the world's largest everything and nothing else.
00:04:58,00:05:01,The one direction thing wasn't April fools.
00:05:01,00:05:04,Louis reports all coming out saying that he's forcing
00:05:04,00:05:07,"all men at university in North Korea to have his hair cut, Kim Jong Un."
00:05:07,00:05:10,But I think it seems they're all coming from South Korean media number.
00:05:10,00:05:12,I would suspect it's not true.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"But apparently, so it used to be that men were allowed to choose"
00:05:15,00:05:17,from 10 different prescribed haircuts.
00:05:17,00:05:19,"No, men have to pick his apparently."
00:05:19,00:05:22,"So, let's go back to something about surgery."
00:05:22,00:05:23,"It's a surgery, yeah."
00:05:23,00:05:25,I remember I found this thing last year
00:05:25,00:05:26,"and I passed it on to you, Mark,"
00:05:26,00:05:30,which was a Gainekamastia in the German Ministry of Defence.
00:05:30,00:05:33,"German soldiers have been marching,"
00:05:33,00:05:35,hitting themselves on the chest with their guns.
00:05:35,00:05:37,So such an extent that the breasts have been growing
00:05:37,00:05:39,and they've had to have reduction surgery.
00:05:39,00:05:40,That's amazing.
00:05:40,00:05:43,It's a paper by Bj√∂rn Durg Kruppel
00:05:43,00:05:46,and within six years a total of 211 patients
00:05:46,00:05:49,underwent surgery in Germany.
00:05:49,00:05:50,Wow.
00:05:50,00:05:51,It's quite a lot of that.
00:05:51,00:05:52,"Yeah, massively."
00:05:52,00:05:54,Just banging their gun against the chest.
00:05:54,00:05:56,"Yeah, it forces the tissue to grow."
00:05:56,00:05:58,"Oh, wow."
00:05:58,00:06:00,"Yeah, it didn't happen to everybody, but it happened quite a few times."
00:06:00,00:06:02,Talking of big jobs.
00:06:02,00:06:04,"There's a real lifeer, Barbie and Ken."
00:06:04,00:06:04,"Oh, really?"
00:06:04,00:06:08,"And Ken has had over a hundred surgeries to look more like Ken,"
00:06:08,00:06:10,whereas Barbie's only had a boob job
00:06:10,00:06:13,and she does the rest of the lighting and really get makeup.
00:06:13,00:06:15,And apparently when they met they had a big fight.
00:06:15,00:06:18,"Ken got angry with baked Barbie because he said,"
00:06:18,00:06:20,"""I've spent a fortune and I had a hundred surgeries"
00:06:20,00:06:22,"and all you've done is one blame boob job."""
00:06:22,00:06:24,Totally plastic plastic surgery.
00:06:24,00:06:27,I did try to get in touch a few years ago with these surgeons.
00:06:27,00:06:31,"Dr. Momeritz, Dr. Abelus, and Dr. Grapp."
00:06:31,00:06:34,I thought that they would be happy to talk with somebody.
00:06:34,00:06:37,Even the kind of journalist I am who was interested
00:06:37,00:06:39,but not necessarily adoring.
00:06:39,00:06:41,They were no longer eager to discuss this.
00:06:41,00:06:42,Oh.
00:06:42,00:06:44,"They must have been made fun of a little bit, I guess,"
00:06:44,00:06:44,by some other people.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"Fortunately, even if they're not popular anymore,"
00:06:46,00:06:49,they have a surefire way of disguising themselves in public.
00:06:49,00:06:58,"Okay, let's move on to fact number two,"
00:06:58,00:07:00,which comes from Molly.
00:07:00,00:07:04,So last week a few of us went on an ELF expedition to the British Museum
00:07:04,00:07:07,and we went to the Viking exhibition.
00:07:07,00:07:08,So I thought I'd talk a little bit about Viking.
00:07:08,00:07:11,The largest Viking ship ever found was discovered
00:07:11,00:07:13,when they renovated the Viking ship museum.
00:07:13,00:07:14,Brilliant.
00:07:14,00:07:16,"Actually, underneath it, all."
00:07:16,00:07:18,They were basically extending the museum
00:07:18,00:07:21,and they dug down into the fjord literally outside the museum
00:07:21,00:07:24,and there they found the longest Viking ship ever found
00:07:24,00:07:26,and a whole bunch of other ships do.
00:07:26,00:07:28,"That's so convenient, isn't it?"
00:07:28,00:07:28,Yeah.
00:07:28,00:07:30,"And underneath that, they found another ship."
00:07:30,00:07:33,They found another museum which was upside down
00:07:33,00:07:35,and it was a mirror with nevermind.
00:07:35,00:07:38,Do you remember that guy who got buried upside down atop his horse?
00:07:38,00:07:40,He buried him upside down.
00:07:40,00:07:42,He was sat on his horse upside down and the reason he did it
00:07:42,00:07:44,"is because he believed when the world ended,"
00:07:44,00:07:46,everyone would get sucked up to heaven.
00:07:46,00:07:48,"So if he was upside down, he'd be the right way round."
00:07:48,00:07:49,Brilliant.
00:07:49,00:07:50,"Have you found it, other?"
00:07:50,00:07:52,"Yes, it was in Surrey, I think."
00:07:52,00:07:55,"A few miles away, a horse is buried upside down too."
00:07:55,00:07:56,"And the National Trust says,"
00:07:56,00:07:59,"""You might think this is major Peter Labilly's horse."""
00:07:59,00:08:01,This isn't the guy who was buried up to now.
00:08:01,00:08:03,But it's actually just a big coincidence.
00:08:03,00:08:05,"Oh, that is a staggering coincidence."
00:08:05,00:08:05,"Oh, isn't it?"
00:08:05,00:08:07,"Yes, but if you want to see, you can go to Box Hill"
00:08:07,00:08:08,and check out the grave.
00:08:08,00:08:09,Or grade in 1800.
00:08:09,00:08:13,"His grave stones is major Peter Labilly age 75,"
00:08:13,00:08:15,eccentric resident of Dawking.
00:08:15,00:08:17,Sort of implies he knew what he was doing.
00:08:17,00:08:19,It's a good epitaph to have.
00:08:19,00:08:20,Yeah.
00:08:20,00:08:22,"Vikings, we should get back to Vikings."
00:08:22,00:08:23,"Yeah, they had these things called"
00:08:23,00:08:25,"""Hobback Stones"" in the exhibition,"
00:08:25,00:08:28,which were huge stones that they're curved
00:08:28,00:08:30,and they are covered with Viking inscriptions.
00:08:30,00:08:32,And they think what happened was
00:08:32,00:08:34,"the Vikings saw people here, like Christians,"
00:08:34,00:08:36,burying their dead and putting grave stones.
00:08:36,00:08:38,"And so they copied them with their ""Hobback Stones"""
00:08:38,00:08:39,and kind of made them Scandi Stull
00:08:39,00:08:41,"with Viking things all over them,"
00:08:41,00:08:42,decorations all over them.
00:08:42,00:08:44,What was that thing about Viking coins
00:08:44,00:08:46,and what inscriptions they had on them?
00:08:46,00:08:47,"Yeah, the most common written inscription"
00:08:47,00:08:50,"appearing anywhere in Vikings, Scandinavia was,"
00:08:50,00:08:50,what do you think?
00:08:50,00:08:53,"Well, something about Hrothger, angry face"
00:08:53,00:08:55,and his sword or something like that.
00:08:55,00:08:57,What do you think?
00:08:57,00:08:59,"It was actually, there is no God,"
00:08:59,00:09:01,"but Aller alone, he has no partner."
00:09:01,00:09:02,No way.
00:09:02,00:09:03,"No, how?"
00:09:03,00:09:06,"Pretty weird, because at the beginning of the Viking Age,"
00:09:06,00:09:07,the Islamic world stretched far and wide
00:09:07,00:09:09,from Spain to Central Asia
00:09:09,00:09:12,and they used a single coinage throughout the empire.
00:09:12,00:09:14,And the Vikings obviously bought these coins back with them
00:09:14,00:09:15,when they went off on their travels.
00:09:15,00:09:17,They found some of these coins
00:09:17,00:09:19,because they've sort of scrubbed out the inscription
00:09:19,00:09:22,and put thaws hammer across the top.
00:09:22,00:09:24,"Wow, they were probably protesting"
00:09:24,00:09:27,outside the Viking Embassy all over the Middle East.
00:09:27,00:09:30,"And it also had some really good Viking graffiti,"
00:09:30,00:09:31,which was like pretty basic.
00:09:31,00:09:33,They tended to graffiti ships
00:09:33,00:09:34,all over the stuff.
00:09:34,00:09:35,Wow.
00:09:35,00:09:38,Viking graffiti sounds like it would almost all be good.
00:09:38,00:09:40,"They look like the teenagers of European history, aren't they?"
00:09:40,00:09:41,"They are, yeah."
00:09:41,00:09:46,"And also these skulls, which had, they, they filed down their teeth."
00:09:46,00:09:47,Oh yeah.
00:09:47,00:09:47,They're more fearsome.
00:09:47,00:09:51,These particular Vikings just maybe were the equivalent
00:09:51,00:09:54,of this young Belgian man who wanted to have surgery
00:09:54,00:09:56,to make him look like Michael Jackson.
00:09:56,00:09:58,"I just want to look like Odin, guys."
00:09:58,00:10:00,Lots of people having one eye removed
00:10:00,00:10:01,so they look like Odin.
00:10:01,00:10:06,"I really like the thing though, about finding something"
00:10:06,00:10:08,in a really convenient place.
00:10:08,00:10:12,That's such a great story about the ship underneath the ship museum.
00:10:12,00:10:15,And I like this thing about how they found the new species
00:10:15,00:10:18,of book in the Natural History Museum's garden.
00:10:18,00:10:19,"Oh yeah, that was brilliant."
00:10:19,00:10:20,"Yeah, it was amazing."
00:10:20,00:10:22,"And they, they found this book in the garden."
00:10:22,00:10:23,They picked it up.
00:10:23,00:10:25,"They thought, oh, I've never seen that before."
00:10:25,00:10:28,They checked against the 28 million specimens
00:10:28,00:10:30,they have in the Natural History Museum.
00:10:30,00:10:32,And it didn't fit any of them.
00:10:32,00:10:33,That's fantastic.
00:10:33,00:10:35,How long does it take to check against 20 million
00:10:35,00:10:36,of these specimens?
00:10:36,00:10:38,"God, that poor work experience, boy."
00:10:38,00:10:39,He thought I'm going to have a nice easy week
00:10:39,00:10:40,at the Natural History Museum to Frank.
00:10:40,00:10:45,"Could you just, yeah, there was a woman who did the same thing"
00:10:45,00:10:46,"in Britain somewhere, checking her garden,"
00:10:46,00:10:49,and she found some like 27 species of wasp.
00:10:49,00:10:50,It's newmon.
00:10:50,00:10:54,"Yeah, Ickneymon wasp. Yeah, yeah. They're the ones who parasitized eggs, don't they?"
00:10:54,00:10:58,"Yeah, I have a fun fact about them, which is that when Alfred Kinsey"
00:10:58,00:11:00,"had the great sex researcher, no, it wasn't Ickneymon."
00:11:00,00:11:02,"It was a, it was gall wasp, he was an expert on,"
00:11:02,00:11:05,"but he traveled the length and breadth of the USA,"
00:11:05,00:11:09,"finding these, categorizing them, because he was a maniac collector."
00:11:09,00:11:11,"He wanted to have the biggest collection of everything in the world,"
00:11:11,00:11:15,"parcel them up, label them, and then send them back to the university,"
00:11:15,00:11:17,and a lot of them hatched on the way.
00:11:17,00:11:21,And so the people were constantly opening packages of live crawling wasp.
00:11:21,00:11:24,"You know, love Alfred. I love that, the Alfred Kinsey,"
00:11:24,00:11:28,"that he got into sexology a bit later on in his career, and his wife said,"
00:11:28,00:11:30,"""I don't see much of Alfred since he got interested in sex."""
00:11:30,00:11:35,"What about the other thing that they found in York,"
00:11:35,00:11:37,"which was the coprolite, the Viking Poe?"
00:11:37,00:11:39,"Do you remember that one? Oh, we could talk, you know?"
00:11:39,00:11:42,Did they find that under a Viking museum?
00:11:42,00:11:43,A Viking Poe museum.
00:11:44,00:11:48,"No, it was in the Lloyd's Bank when they were excavating, to sell us that."
00:11:48,00:11:52,Maybe that had been deposited with the bank for safekeeping.
00:11:52,00:11:57,"Quite, yeah. I don't think they let you deposit things like that in the bank."
00:11:57,00:12:01,"The discoverer of the Poe, Andrew Bohm's Jones, commented,"
00:12:01,00:12:04,"""This is the most exciting piece of experiment I've ever seen."
00:12:04,00:12:08,"In its own way, it's as valuable as a crown jewels."""
00:12:08,00:12:10,Andrew Bohm's turned to that man with no sense of priority whatsoever.
00:12:12,00:12:16,"I was looking up Viking names, and I found..."
00:12:16,00:12:19,"Because they have the by names, you know, that Harold Bluetooth."
00:12:19,00:12:22,"Well, Bluetooth is where we get the Bluetooth from mobile phones from, isn't it?"
00:12:22,00:12:24,"We get, it's named after him, I think."
00:12:24,00:12:26,"Harold Bluetooth, yeah. Seriously?"
00:12:26,00:12:28,No. Why are we going completely off memory here?
00:12:28,00:12:30,"It might have been that it was Nokia who did it, and they..."
00:12:30,00:12:32,I'll say it's a leading company. Yeah.
00:12:32,00:12:34,Nokia used to make guest masks.
00:12:34,00:12:38,"In fact, they supplied them to the Finnish army until about 1995."
00:12:38,00:12:41,"I was at a comedy show the other night, and the host was asking,"
00:12:41,00:12:45,"""So, where do you work?"" And the guy said, ""Oh, I work at Nestle."""
00:12:45,00:12:47,"And then he said, ""Okay, but which video are you working?"""
00:12:47,00:12:50,"He said, ""I work in the cat food division of Nestle."""
00:12:50,00:12:53,Nobody in the audience knew that Nestle had a cat food division.
00:12:53,00:12:55,"He obviously didn't say the cat food bit of the sag,"
00:12:55,00:12:58,because he wants them to think he works in a chocolate company.
00:12:58,00:13:00,"He says that, so they all think he's Willy Wonka."
00:13:00,00:13:02,"And then when they've done a bit further, it's like,"
00:13:02,00:13:04,"""Oh, cat food, Willy Wonka, not so good."""
00:13:04,00:13:09,There's a kind of thing about pet food.
00:13:09,00:13:13,"Most of the work over the years for the companies that sell a lot of dog food,"
00:13:13,00:13:17,most of the research work was to come up with a dog food that would produce reliable
00:13:17,00:13:20,"output from the dog, because that's what matters."
00:13:20,00:13:21,A libel output?
00:13:21,00:13:23,"People, believe solids, are nicer than liquids."
00:13:23,00:13:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:24,00:13:27,"There was a dog poo lottery in Taiwan,"
00:13:27,00:13:29,"where to get a ticket for the lottery,"
00:13:29,00:13:31,you had to turn up with a bag of dog poo.
00:13:31,00:13:34,"About 2,000 people turned up. It was a runaway success."
00:13:34,00:13:37,"And so she was cleaning her day, and then someone won..."
00:13:37,00:13:39,"I don't know what the price was, maybe about ¬£1,000."
00:13:39,00:13:40,"But 1,000 bags of dog poo."
00:13:40,00:13:41,Lovely!
00:13:41,00:13:43,I'm your dog.
00:13:43,00:13:46,"I really like that Taiwanese city officials eventually have to say,"
00:13:46,00:13:47,"like, release a statement, saying,"
00:13:47,00:13:51,"""The city simply cannot afford to keep exchanging dog poo for gold."""
00:13:51,00:13:55,"She was like strong economic reasoning, then."
00:13:55,00:13:56,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:13:56,00:13:58,"Well, Andrew Boan's drones would disagree, of course."
00:13:58,00:14:00,"He'd exchange the Lloyd to bank copper life for the crown jewels, but..."
00:14:00,00:14:08,"So the next fact is for me, and it is this one."
00:14:09,00:14:12,The tobacco hornworm uses extremely bad halitosis
00:14:12,00:14:14,to prevent heredifices from eating it.
00:14:14,00:14:16,"Oh, I love the tobacco hornworm."
00:14:16,00:14:20,"So I found this in the Smithsonian magazine,"
00:14:20,00:14:22,because I was trying to...
00:14:22,00:14:24,I was doing a lungs research for the L.C.
00:14:24,00:14:26,"It was my sort of got distracted and started reading about breath,"
00:14:26,00:14:28,and bad breath.
00:14:28,00:14:30,And this is an animal which has such bad breath
00:14:30,00:14:33,that other predators think it's actively poisonous.
00:14:33,00:14:36,They have actually filmed tobacco hornworm
00:14:36,00:14:38,and one of these spiders coming towards it.
00:14:38,00:14:41,"I somehow researched this disabled this gene,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,"so that it couldn't give off the tobaccoy smell,"
00:14:43,00:14:46,and this spider just came towards it and went to eat it.
00:14:46,00:14:50,I like the thing about animals using different ways for defence.
00:14:50,00:14:52,"Like, the hagfish, you remember that guy that we did?"
00:14:52,00:14:54,"They created an inordinate amount of slime,"
00:14:54,00:14:57,and that's supposed to be a way of getting rid of predators.
00:14:57,00:15:00,"If you pick up a hagfish, it will slide all over you,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,"and then it basically falls out of your hands, and it's disgusting."
00:15:02,00:15:04,The worst thing about it is that there is a danger
00:15:04,00:15:07,"that the hagfish will suffocate in its own slide, so that'd be..."
00:15:07,00:15:08,Oh wow!
00:15:08,00:15:13,"The Texas horned lizard shoots blood out of its eyes to get rid of predators,"
00:15:13,00:15:14,and there's a crazy video which we can post out.
00:15:14,00:15:17,"It can squirt blood five feet,"
00:15:17,00:15:19,"and the blood has got a final tasting chemical in it as well,"
00:15:19,00:15:20,so...
00:15:20,00:15:21,"Yeah, another thing Texans are proud of."
00:15:21,00:15:25,"And it can release a third of its blood supply doing this,"
00:15:25,00:15:27,"so it's kind of a quite exhausting thing for it to do,"
00:15:27,00:15:28,so it only does it in history.
00:15:28,00:15:29,So it actually is blood?
00:15:29,00:15:31,"Yeah, out of its eyes."
00:15:31,00:15:35,"Blood for one animal is almost always food for some other animals,"
00:15:35,00:15:38,so maybe it's food source and it's distracting everything.
00:15:38,00:15:39,"Oh, it can't well be."
00:15:39,00:15:41,"The predators just go straight for the blood, yeah."
00:15:41,00:15:42,"Turkey Vultures do the same thing,"
00:15:42,00:15:45,"which is where they, if they're very full after a meal,"
00:15:45,00:15:47,"and they're approached by a predator,"
00:15:47,00:15:48,"they throw up on the ground,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,"saying, ""Okay, well, rather than eating meat,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"you can just have everything have just eaten."""
00:15:52,00:15:53,And the bird flies away.
00:15:53,00:15:55,"There's a bird called the Eurasian Roller,"
00:15:55,00:15:58,and the chicks vomit over themselves to scare people away.
00:15:58,00:15:59,I do that.
00:15:59,00:16:00,"If you're on the train,"
00:16:00,00:16:03,"and you need the seats next to you to be clear,"
00:16:03,00:16:04,"vomit over yourself,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,or you could do what a potato beetle does
00:16:06,00:16:08,and cubby yourself in your own experiment.
00:16:08,00:16:08,"Wow, it's amazing."
00:16:08,00:16:09,"Wow, yeah."
00:16:09,00:16:13,"Mark, do you know this paper"
00:16:13,00:16:17,"called ""Farting as a Defense Against Unspeakable Dread?"""
00:16:17,00:16:18,I do.
00:16:18,00:16:21,It's like the author was given an ignovel price.
00:16:21,00:16:22,"Oh, for that."
00:16:22,00:16:25,Her name is Mara Siddoli.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"I never met her, but we corresponded."
00:16:27,00:16:28,She was Italian.
00:16:28,00:16:29,"She lived in Washington, D.C."
00:16:29,00:16:31,She was really pleased
00:16:31,00:16:33,to be getting recognition for this paper.
00:16:33,00:16:36,"This was a case report about a very small boy,"
00:16:36,00:16:38,maybe four years old.
00:16:38,00:16:40,"Whenever this boy became very distressed,"
00:16:40,00:16:42,he would begin farting.
00:16:42,00:16:44,She was a good writer at Mara Siddoli.
00:16:44,00:16:45,It was Dr. Siddoli.
00:16:45,00:16:48,And she describes exactly what this little kid was doing
00:16:48,00:16:50,and the effect on the room
00:16:50,00:16:53,and how she spent weeks and months talking with him
00:16:53,00:16:56,and trying to calm him down so he no longer did this.
00:16:56,00:16:58,And she was successful.
00:16:58,00:17:00,Is it to drive people away?
00:17:00,00:17:00,That's what she felt.
00:17:00,00:17:04,It says that he enveloped himself in a protective cloud
00:17:04,00:17:06,of familiarity against the drug.
00:17:06,00:17:07,Familiarity.
00:17:07,00:17:09,"Yeah, I've never had a call that before."
00:17:09,00:17:11,"Sorry, darling, there's a bit of familiarity in the room."
00:17:11,00:17:15,The details of it read in passages
00:17:15,00:17:17,"like a battle, a very personal battle"
00:17:17,00:17:21,"between she, the older woman psychiatrist"
00:17:21,00:17:23,"and he, the child, where she would say something"
00:17:23,00:17:26,and then he would respond with a cloud of fart.
00:17:26,00:17:29,"But eventually, eventually, they came to an understanding."
00:17:29,00:17:31,"She was like, I'll leave and you can just come home."
00:17:31,00:17:32,I was lazy.
00:17:32,00:17:36,"Mark, do you find that those are the most interesting papers"
00:17:36,00:17:37,to you personally?
00:17:37,00:17:38,I have many favourites.
00:17:38,00:17:42,What makes something pleasing to me is something
00:17:42,00:17:44,that I never expected.
00:17:44,00:17:45,That's really the quality.
00:17:45,00:17:47,One of the ones which really sticks in my head
00:17:47,00:17:50,is exiting a building and then formal look.
00:17:50,00:17:51,Which we drink as yeah.
00:17:51,00:17:53,Which is about whether people given the choice
00:17:53,00:17:55,"of an open door and a closed one,"
00:17:55,00:17:58,"how many of them gravitate towards the open door,"
00:17:58,00:18:01,how many stubbornly stay on their path
00:18:01,00:18:02,and open the closed door instead?
00:18:02,00:18:03,I just thought it was a must.
00:18:03,00:18:06,He went to the doorway of a large building in New York City
00:18:06,00:18:09,"and he stayed there for hours, simply taking notes."
00:18:09,00:18:11,"I believe it was a couple years later,"
00:18:11,00:18:14,he repeated the experiment to see what had changed.
00:18:14,00:18:15,He tended to do this.
00:18:15,00:18:17,He got obsessions.
00:18:17,00:18:19,He would write reports to amuse himself.
00:18:19,00:18:21,He wasn't trying to convince anybody
00:18:21,00:18:22,that these things were important.
00:18:22,00:18:25,He did this really to remove his frustrations.
00:18:25,00:18:27,"If something annoyed him,"
00:18:27,00:18:30,he saw something in his daily life
00:18:30,00:18:31,"that annoyed him, that kept happening."
00:18:31,00:18:35,"At some point, he would decide to be amused by it"
00:18:35,00:18:38,and he would go with a piece of paper and a pen
00:18:38,00:18:40,and sit there for several hours and count.
00:18:40,00:18:41,Simply count.
00:18:41,00:18:44,How many people do this annoying thing and how many don't?
00:18:44,00:18:48,I had a few hours free in Ueno station in Tokyo at the end of last year
00:18:48,00:18:50,and I decided to count how many people were wearing
00:18:50,00:18:53,"medical masks because in Japan,"
00:18:53,00:18:54,"if you have cold or a cough,"
00:18:54,00:18:57,it's considered polite to wear one of the masks.
00:18:57,00:18:58,Especially if you're a hangfish.
00:18:58,00:19:02,And the answer was really annoying
00:19:02,00:19:04,because it was a perfectly neat number.
00:19:04,00:19:07,"So it was 110 people out of 1,100 people."
00:19:07,00:19:08,"Are you counting 1,000 people?"
00:19:08,00:19:12,I was very close.
00:19:12,00:19:14,I had about an hour and a half and I just decided
00:19:14,00:19:15,everyone who passes a particular point.
00:19:15,00:19:17,Professor Trinkus is now in his 80s.
00:19:17,00:19:18,He's slowing down.
00:19:18,00:19:21,He's publishing at a far slower rate.
00:19:21,00:19:22,"Well, if he wants to success,"
00:19:22,00:19:24,I will go and count things.
00:19:24,00:19:24,That's the way.
00:19:25,00:19:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:27,00:19:29,Just could become the new Trinkus.
00:19:29,00:19:30,I think it's two.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"OK, let's go back to bad breath."
00:19:32,00:19:33,I have found this.
00:19:33,00:19:34,It's quite weird.
00:19:34,00:19:38,Welsh law in medieval law was quite unusual
00:19:38,00:19:41,in that it was not too difficult for wives
00:19:41,00:19:42,to divorce their husbands.
00:19:42,00:19:44,Usually that's quite a difficult thing in most laws.
00:19:44,00:19:47,"Usually if you got divorced as a woman,"
00:19:47,00:19:50,you would struggle to get your fair share of
00:19:50,00:19:52,"whatever was in the marriage, the money,"
00:19:52,00:19:53,"and the property, and whatever."
00:19:53,00:19:55,But there are a few different reasons that you could get
00:19:55,00:19:57,the money that you were owed.
00:19:57,00:20:00,"Neglect, leprosy, or bad breath."
00:20:00,00:20:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:01,00:20:03,"If it's a family where the wife prepares the food,"
00:20:03,00:20:07,she just puts garlic in and has been food.
00:20:07,00:20:09,They have garlic in those days and miles
00:20:09,00:20:11,"because you found out that thing, didn't you understand?"
00:20:11,00:20:11,Yes.
00:20:11,00:20:13,"I mean, the process of trying to find out"
00:20:13,00:20:15,exactly when garlic and leeks got to oils.
00:20:15,00:20:18,This has caused a little bit of controversy
00:20:18,00:20:19,in the QI offices.
00:20:19,00:20:20,"OK, I'll get it."
00:20:20,00:20:22,We've covered bad breath on the show.
00:20:22,00:20:26,We did about how it was mostly invented by history.
00:20:26,00:20:28,Because history was originally sold
00:20:28,00:20:30,as a surgical antiseptic.
00:20:30,00:20:34,And then it was just changed to be marketed as a mouthwash.
00:20:34,00:20:36,"I think it might have been used to clean floors,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,"but in the risk of a lawsuit, I'm going to say,"
00:20:38,00:20:40,"maybe, that one."
00:20:40,00:20:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:41,00:20:42,"Oh, Anna, do you have something for us?"
00:20:42,00:20:45,History was definitely sold as floor cleaner
00:20:45,00:20:47,before the 1920s when it realized it was a mouthwash.
00:20:47,00:20:49,I think you can say that universities
00:20:49,00:20:50,have released publications that say that.
00:20:50,00:20:52,It was also sold as a cure for gonorrhea.
00:20:52,00:20:54,Or chapped lips.
00:20:54,00:20:57,Neither of these things was known since we're very successful.
00:20:57,00:21:01,A floor cleaner thing would maybe tie in with the five-second rule.
00:21:01,00:21:04,"The idea that if you drop food on the floor,"
00:21:04,00:21:07,"and it's there for less than five seconds, it's safe to eat."
00:21:07,00:21:09,There was a paper that just came out.
00:21:09,00:21:12,And it confirmed what an American high school girl had done
00:21:12,00:21:15,a decade earlier that we gave an ignoble promise to.
00:21:15,00:21:17,It depends on the floor and the food.
00:21:17,00:21:20,"If the floor is clean and it's not sticky,"
00:21:20,00:21:21,probably no problem.
00:21:21,00:21:24,"If it's sticky food and the floor hasn't been cleaned for a while,"
00:21:24,00:21:26,if there's been coprolized on it.
00:21:26,00:21:27,So that kind of thing.
00:21:27,00:21:28,No listerine around.
00:21:28,00:21:29,Yeah.
00:21:29,00:21:30,And it's custard.
00:21:30,00:21:31,Yeah.
00:21:31,00:21:33,You're not going to want to think you're not going to think you're not.
00:21:33,00:21:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:34,00:21:37,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:21:37,00:21:42,"Let's move to fact number four now, which this week comes from James."
00:21:42,00:21:43,OK.
00:21:43,00:21:46,"My fact is, you could have fallen asleep up to five times"
00:21:46,00:21:49,during this podcast and not known about it.
00:21:49,00:21:50,"Um, that's it."
00:21:50,00:21:51,What could that be?
00:21:51,00:21:54,"OK, I've been reading a book this week by Richard Liesman."
00:21:54,00:21:55,It's just come out.
00:21:55,00:21:56,It's called Night School.
00:21:56,00:22:00,"I'm currently 30% of the way through, according to my kindle app."
00:22:00,00:22:04,And he was talking about these things called micro-sleeps.
00:22:04,00:22:06,"And these are temporary episodes of sleep,"
00:22:06,00:22:09,"which may last from fraction of a second or up to 30 seconds,"
00:22:09,00:22:13,where you would fail to respond to some arbitrary sensory input.
00:22:13,00:22:15,And it's like being asleep for a very short amount of time.
00:22:15,00:22:17,And he talks about this experiment.
00:22:17,00:22:20,"It was a reporter called Ron Claibon from ABC,"
00:22:20,00:22:23,who stayed awake for 32 hours.
00:22:23,00:22:26,They connected him to a device that measured his brain activity
00:22:26,00:22:28,and set him driving on a track for two hours.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"Oh, god."
00:22:29,00:22:30,"And when they looked at his brain activity,"
00:22:30,00:22:33,"according to their study, they found that he'd"
00:22:33,00:22:35,taken more than 20 micro-sleeps during his drive.
00:22:35,00:22:36,"Oh, wow."
00:22:36,00:22:37,Yeah.
00:22:37,00:22:38,Does this go on all day long?
00:22:38,00:22:41,"Even normal times, or is it, only during times"
00:22:41,00:22:44,of great sleep deprivation?
00:22:44,00:22:46,"Yeah, it happens mostly with sleep deprivation."
00:22:46,00:22:48,There was a programme on Channel 4 called--
00:22:48,00:22:50,I think it was called Shattered several years ago.
00:22:50,00:22:52,"And it was a reality show where the premise was,"
00:22:52,00:22:54,you have to stay awake for 10 days.
00:22:54,00:22:55,"Oh, I know."
00:22:55,00:23:00,And you could be evicted for having a micro-sleep.
00:23:00,00:23:04,But I think the limit they put on there was 10 seconds
00:23:04,00:23:05,of being asleep.
00:23:05,00:23:06,What do they monitor their brains?
00:23:06,00:23:08,"But the science of this is really, like,"
00:23:08,00:23:10,"it's difficult to work out, isn't it, Mark?"
00:23:10,00:23:11,There's lots of science.
00:23:11,00:23:13,There are lots of branches of science.
00:23:13,00:23:17,"There are lots of fields, and some of them are much ifier than others,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,simply because it's really difficult
00:23:19,00:23:22,to measure this stuff reliably.
00:23:22,00:23:24,"Try to figure out your own sleep, anything"
00:23:24,00:23:26,about your own patterns of sleep.
00:23:26,00:23:27,"It's very, very difficult."
00:23:27,00:23:28,"If you're going to measure something,"
00:23:28,00:23:30,what exactly do you measure?
00:23:30,00:23:32,"You can talk about it, and it sounds great."
00:23:32,00:23:33,"But when you actually have to sit down and do it,"
00:23:33,00:23:34,what exactly are you measuring?
00:23:34,00:23:37,"Even with these micro things, everything about sleep"
00:23:37,00:23:37,is like that.
00:23:37,00:23:39,So there are a bunch of sleep researchers
00:23:39,00:23:41,"around the world, and they work very hard."
00:23:41,00:23:45,But it's hard for them to be sure that almost anything
00:23:45,00:23:47,that they're telling people really is reliably
00:23:47,00:23:49,the story of sleep.
00:23:49,00:23:51,"At this point, it's all good stories"
00:23:51,00:23:52,with a little bit of data.
00:23:52,00:23:55,But when you get down to something like claiming
00:23:55,00:23:58,"that, well, people dream 30% of the night."
00:23:58,00:23:59,How do you really know?
00:23:59,00:24:01,"I think people can dream outside REM sleep,"
00:24:01,00:24:04,which was thought previously to be the benchmark
00:24:04,00:24:05,for when you were dreaming.
00:24:05,00:24:07,And so we don't know that either.
00:24:07,00:24:08,So all this stuff is real.
00:24:08,00:24:11,"This is very, very-- the people who do it are trying to measure"
00:24:11,00:24:13,things that are really difficult to measure.
00:24:13,00:24:15,So they're trying to do something really commendable.
00:24:15,00:24:18,"Yeah, just going back to your thing about Shattered."
00:24:18,00:24:20,And there was a guy in America called--
00:24:20,00:24:22,he was a DJ called Trip.
00:24:22,00:24:23,I can't remember his first name.
00:24:23,00:24:28,"And in 1959, he tried to stay awake for eight days,"
00:24:28,00:24:30,"I think it was, and do his radio show,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,and see how it would affect him.
00:24:32,00:24:34,"And after about four or five days,"
00:24:34,00:24:37,"he started seeing mice running around the studio,"
00:24:37,00:24:38,which weren't there.
00:24:38,00:24:41,"He would see spiders coming out of his shoes,"
00:24:41,00:24:43,and he thought his desk was on fire.
00:24:43,00:24:45,"And when a doctor came to look after him,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,he thought he was an undertaker coming
00:24:47,00:24:52,to take him away and bury him on the side down on the horse.
00:24:52,00:24:53,But there was another guy.
00:24:53,00:24:55,There was a student called Randy Gardner.
00:24:55,00:24:57,And this was a few years later in 1964.
00:24:57,00:25:01,He tried to set a new world record for staying awake.
00:25:01,00:25:04,"And he did it for a few days, a few days, a few days."
00:25:04,00:25:06,"And by the end, he was also hallucinating."
00:25:06,00:25:09,He thought he was a black American football player.
00:25:09,00:25:12,"He was white, but he thought he was a black American football player."
00:25:12,00:25:13,"And when his friends started saying,"
00:25:13,00:25:15,"""No, you're not a black American football player."""
00:25:15,00:25:16,He started calling them racists.
00:25:16,00:25:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:19,00:25:20,That's amazing.
00:25:20,00:25:22,The British Department of Transport
00:25:22,00:25:25,says that 20% of accidents on motorways
00:25:25,00:25:26,are sleep-related.
00:25:26,00:25:29,"It's on browser's, three-mile island, Chernobyl."
00:25:29,00:25:32,All of them had people who were quite sleep deprived
00:25:32,00:25:32,at the controls.
00:25:32,00:25:35,I think it's a suspect that it's not a coincidence.
00:25:35,00:25:36,Yeah.
00:25:36,00:25:39,I have a fact to drag it completely down market.
00:25:39,00:25:42,Inputants can be measured by--
00:25:42,00:25:44,"it's quite tricky, because sometimes it's psychological"
00:25:44,00:25:45,and sometimes it's physical.
00:25:45,00:25:48,So one method of testing is to test whether people
00:25:48,00:25:49,get directions as they sleep.
00:25:49,00:25:52,"And in the 20th century, one method of testing this"
00:25:52,00:25:56,was to seal a perforated strip of postage stamps
00:25:56,00:25:59,around the penis at the base and see if the stamp
00:25:59,00:26:01,tore during the night.
00:26:01,00:26:02,That's a good idea.
00:26:02,00:26:03,It's a brilliant idea.
00:26:03,00:26:05,It's low-cost science.
00:26:05,00:26:07,"If you're turned on by the queen's face, that's gone."
00:26:07,00:26:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:10,00:26:12,This is a weird thing.
00:26:12,00:26:14,"This is a paper called ""Dreaming and Sexuality."""
00:26:14,00:26:17,"It's quite an old one, 1966 by a guy called Fisher,"
00:26:17,00:26:20,"or a woman called Fisher, I'm not sure."
00:26:20,00:26:23,"They found that erections happen when you're dreaming,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,even in the most mundane of dreams.
00:26:25,00:26:26,It doesn't have to be a sexual dream for you
00:26:26,00:26:27,to get an erection.
00:26:27,00:26:30,Just do me about your mum doing the washing habit.
00:26:30,00:26:31,"Or the queen, I don't know."
00:26:31,00:26:35,"But yeah, I mean, I'm not sure what their methodology was,"
00:26:35,00:26:36,but that was their findings.
00:26:36,00:26:37,Amazing.
00:26:37,00:26:41,"Mark, you really like-- I know you like her patents, don't you?"
00:26:41,00:26:42,I do.
00:26:42,00:26:42,I found this--
00:26:42,00:26:43,Not but you should everyone.
00:26:43,00:26:45,"No, no, but they're the amazing ones."
00:26:45,00:26:49,I found them a patent for inducing sleep from 1885.
00:26:49,00:26:51,This was by Fanny Paul.
00:26:51,00:26:52,It was pretty simple.
00:26:52,00:26:55,"It basically, it was a piece of water or leather."
00:26:55,00:26:56,What did it around your neck?
00:26:56,00:26:57,"It would stop the blood flow to the brain,"
00:26:57,00:26:58,and it would make you sleep.
00:26:58,00:27:02,"And it said, ""It thereby reduces the activity of the brain"
00:27:02,00:27:04,"in order that sleep may ensue."""
00:27:04,00:27:05,Oh god.
00:27:05,00:27:07,"And you were just ticin' it, ticin' it until you fell asleep."
00:27:07,00:27:08,"Oh, I'd love to see details in there, James."
00:27:08,00:27:09,"Yeah, I'll send it on."
00:27:09,00:27:12,"Anna, do you have anything on sleep for us?"
00:27:12,00:27:13,Not a whole lot from that section.
00:27:13,00:27:15,I'd like to let you guys come to the door.
00:27:15,00:27:17,"And I can tell you that in that programme,"
00:27:17,00:27:18,I've shattered that I also remember.
00:27:18,00:27:21,And it seems like it wouldn't be allowed to be put on now.
00:27:21,00:27:23,They all had various amusing hallucinations.
00:27:23,00:27:25,One of the runners-up believed to be a prime minister
00:27:25,00:27:26,of Australia.
00:27:26,00:27:28,"The winner thought she was in a tube station the whole time,"
00:27:28,00:27:30,but two of them became convinced that their clothes
00:27:30,00:27:32,"have been stolen, which I think is kind of interesting."
00:27:32,00:27:35,But two people have the same delusion and all hallucinations.
00:27:35,00:27:44,"OK, that's our podcast done for another week."
00:27:44,00:27:45,Thanks very much for listening.
00:27:45,00:27:46,We hope you've enjoyed it.
00:27:46,00:27:48,"If you want to get in touch with any of us,"
00:27:48,00:27:50,you can do so on Twitter.
00:27:50,00:27:51,James is at egg-shaped.
00:27:51,00:27:53,Mark is at Mark Abrahams.
00:27:53,00:27:55,Molly is at Molly Oldfield.
00:27:55,00:27:58,"Anna is on the very brink of joining Twitter,"
00:27:58,00:28:00,"but in the meantime, you can get through to her"
00:28:00,00:28:03,"on @quikipedia, which is the official QI account."
00:28:03,00:28:05,And I'm @andruhunterm.
00:28:05,00:28:09,"Also, if you go to our website, which is qi.com/podcast,"
00:28:09,00:28:12,"we're going to be putting up a whole lot of extra stuff,"
00:28:12,00:28:15,"extra links, articles, videos, all kinds of things."
00:28:15,00:28:18,"And you'll also be able to see the details of Mark's book,"
00:28:18,00:28:19,which has just been published.
00:28:19,00:28:22,And it's called This Is Improbable 2.
00:28:22,00:28:24,We'll be back next week with another podcast.
00:28:24,00:28:26,"And until then, bye."
