 Hello, and welcome to another edition of "No Such Thing as a Fish Presents International

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.680
 Fat Ball".

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.560
 The only football podcast out there that makes absolutely no mention of football whatsoever

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.200
 brought to you by VisitEngland.com.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.640
 We are the QI Elbs, my name is Dan, I'm sitting here with James, Andy, and Anna.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.640
 The match today is Columbia versus Côte d'Evoire, and we're about to find out who the most

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.640
 interesting of those two are.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.280
 So let's begin.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.280
 Columbia.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.320
 Okay, a fact about Columbia.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.320
 Yeah.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.120
 Okay, Columbians traditionally drank Armadillo blood to treat asthma.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.120
 Wow.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.120
 Does it work?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.120
 I believe not.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120
 Yeah.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.920
 And also, you get asthma quite a lot.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 It's not like you just take a course of it and it's gone for the rest of you.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.040
 You need basically a live armadillo with a flesh wound.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.600
 Yeah, and treat it like an inhaler.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.760
 So people carry them around because you would be like, "In a handbag, you have an asthma

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.600
 sufferant and she starts asking you, like, did you remember your armadillo?"

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 Yeah, sorry, can I borrow your armadillo?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.800
 I'm just feeling a bit...

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.120
 One traditional snack in the Santander region of Columbia, which I did not know was a region,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.600
 is Hormigas culonas, which translates to ants with a big bum, because they are a kind

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.920
 of ants that people like eating as a snack, and they're very rare and very valuable, because

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.440
 they only come out of their nesting ground one or two days a year.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.880
 Sorry, do you mean rare as in undercooked, or...?

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 It has some great festivals, Columbia.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.080
 It's home to some of the various biggest festivals in the world, it's home to the biggest

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.680
 theatre festival, as in, like, the highest number of people are ten, the biggest salsa festival,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.160
 biggest flower parade, and the biggest outdoor horse parade.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.680
 Oh, that's very good.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.320
 What's the biggest indoor horse parade?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.200
 I know of only one famous Colombian.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.400
 Okay, who's that?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.200
 Gabrielle Garcia Marquez, the fantastic, incredible author who passed away, sadly, this year.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.760
 And there's an interesting fact here, which I did not know is not on the blurb of his book.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.720
 His grandmother was a secret witch doctor, and his grandfather once killed a man in a duel.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.720
 Wow.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.720
 Yeah.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.720
 Pistols at dawn.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 That's amazing.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 Bring your armadillos.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.000
 He was really and wasn't he, Marquez.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 He was married to his wife Mercedes for 55 years, and every day throughout those years,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.600
 she put a yellow rose on his desk in the morning.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.600
 For a reason?

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 To say hi.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.360
 Do you need a reason to present your wife with a flower?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.360
 Yeah.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.360
 Just for romantic, though.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.360
 I need a wife.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.360
 I need a wife first.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.240
 Well, Mercedes meant mercies, the plural of mercy.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240
 Oh, really?

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.240
 Yeah.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.240
 No, I didn't know that either.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.080
 You must have heard of another Colombian, Dan, Pablo Escobar?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.080
 Yeah.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080
 The famous drug bar, and he was Colombian.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080
 Okay.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.480
 He had a great big house where he kept loads of animals and stuff like that, and apparently

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.320
 a lot of his hippos keep escaping from the house and terrorizing local towns.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.680
 Wasn't that, didn't that help the police find him?

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.120
 Because hippos are not native to Colombia.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120
 You will ask questions, wouldn't you?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.120
 Yeah, that's true.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.440
 In the 1990s, Escobar owned one of the best football teams in Colombia at Letico Nacional.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.440
 And their rivals, Millionarios, belong to a rival drug trafficker.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.440
 Wow.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440
 Which is amazing.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.440
 He apparently used to have big parties.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.440
 Hey.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.440
 Escobar.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.920
 And at those parties, he would drown his enemies in the pool.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.280
 Is it kind of like two boroughs, one stone kind of thing?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280
 Wow.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.480
 I don't want to just like do the dull stuff.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.480
 What?

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.680
 That's a party and then we can have this happen back.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.840
 As one of his enemies, if you receive, with their people going, "I'm so surprised I'm

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.520
 invited to Escobar's party.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.520
 He's never liked me, but I mean, I guess we should go, right?"

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.040
 When he's going to say no to a pool party, he said it's a pool party, but he said I don't

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040
 need to bring trunks.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040
 I don't understand.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040
 Well, yeah.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.720
 Madeline's an interesting town.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.640
 They have a no-pants day as a protest against the government.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.240
 I have a no-pants day several times a week, not as a protest, just as a way of life.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.120
 Well, the many reasons we've changed the locks on this office, Andy, how did you get in today?

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.120
 You mean no pants, you mean trousers?

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120
 Yes, I am.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.120
 American style pants.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.120
 Okay.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.320
 Well, I'm still having a no-pants day today.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.920
 Yeah, it's against freedom of expression, and so they walk around the town with no trousers

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.920
 on.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.960
 I mean, sort of on the subject of this, there's a remote outpost in Colombia called it's

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.320
 pronounced "loss penis", although it's not quite.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.320
 Nothing funny about that?

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.320
 No, you're right.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.000
 Absolutely, no, it's just a way of expressing yourself.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.360
 And the guys who live there, it's separated from the nearest town by a ravine, and the Colombian

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.080
 government's decided that it's too expensive, and there aren't enough people living there

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.680
 to build a bridge over the ravine.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.280
 And so the nearest school, for instance, is in the nearest town, and all the kids have to

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.800
 get there by ziplying across the ravine.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 Oh, wow.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.080
 And as you can imagine, they're not the safety conscious zipliers at tourist, try when they pop

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.080
 over to New Zealand.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.800
 You don't want to get your lost penis stuck in that ziplier.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:51.200
 Bogota also has a laziness museum, it's a museum in Bogota, which aims to make people think

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.680
 about the social issues implied in taking a nap, in being jobless or in feeling that maybe

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.160
 we are wasting our time.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.840
 Do you want to go to the laziness museum?

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.840
 Yeah.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.000
 Imagine the staff behind the desk, yeah, just go in.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Yeah.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.120
 Why the no cards here, telling us what all these exhibits are, and actually, why the

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.520
 no exhibits.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.840
 OK, now it's time for the halftime show, which is three QI questions brought to you by VisitingLin.com

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.480
 and the three questions, with the answers being revealed at the end of this podcast are

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.480
 James.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.480
 OK, my question is, how many lakes are there in the lake district?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.960
 Question number two, Andy.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.560
 Where is the southernmost point of the mainland in England?

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560
 OK.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.840
 Question number three from Anna, which world first was built outside the houses of commons

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.480
 in 1868?

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.480
 OK.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.960
 It's time for match to resume play and making their way onto the pitch.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.960
 It's Cote d'Ivoire.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.040
 So Cote d'Ivoire, who wants to go first?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.040
 OK.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.040
 Are we going to keep calling it Cote d'Ivoire or Ivory Coast?

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.400
 Why, let's go for both.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.360
 Cote d'Ivoire is what most places in the world call it, but usually places in the UK call

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.120
 it Ivory Coast, both are acceptable.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.600
 I prefer to call it Ivory Cote because it reminds me of my favourite item of clothing.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.320
 You've really got to hand that to a museum.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.600
 They've had a lot of problems in Ivory Coast over the last several years.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.640
 They've had a civil war and they've had a lot of domestic unrest.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.440
 So partly as a result of that, everyone's very young.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.680
 The average age is about 19 across the whole country and also wages are very low.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.960
 So someone earning as little as $100 per month is pacified as being middle class, officially.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.960
 Wow.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.960
 Yeah.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.120
 It is a troubled place we were saying that's quite hard to come up with more fun facts in the

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.480
 Ivory Coast because there are a lot less fun facts.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.800
 As you say, Andy, it has been embroiled in civil war, basically since 1999 with a couple

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.040
 of respites.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.480
 One of the major respites in the civil war was in 2006 during the World Cup and I know

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.000
 we're not supposed to mention football, but the Ivory Coast football team was credited

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.960
 with causing a truce because as soon as the Ivory Coast qualified for the World Cup,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.680
 the football team brought the boring parties together and made them sign a truce.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.400
 Because both sides were supporting the Ivory Coast and the World Cup, it brought them together

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400
 for a time.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.800
 I know an interesting fact about their independence day.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.800
 Go on.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.800
 Go on.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.320
 Their independence day is the seventh of August.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.320
 Good one, Dan.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.320
 Doesn't really sound like much of a fact.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.320
 Yeah.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.320
 They celebrate it on December 7th.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320
 Oh, that is good.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320
 What really?

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.320
 Why?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.680
 I think it's because by the time the harvests have been collected and sold, that's when they

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.680
 get paid.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.760
 And so their independence day was set up on that, but they didn't actually have enough

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.520
 money to have a proper celebration.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.800
 So it's just a better time of year.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.800
 A better time of year.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.400
 So they celebrate August the 7th Independence Day on December 7th.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.000
 We should celebrate Christmas in the summer when it's nice and sunny and not cold and

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 horrible.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.080
 One thing you were like, Dan, is that there is a group of people in the Ivory Coast

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.480
 who are called the Dan.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.480
 Really?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.040
 And they specialize in doing stilt dances, dancing while on stilts.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.800
 And their main town is called Man.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.240
 So you could be Dan of Man.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.240
 Yeah.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.240
 I like it.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.240
 That's very cool.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.240
 Yeah.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.240
 There's another group of people, and I really like this.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.640
 They're called the Bowel people.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.440
 And they believe in another parallel world called Blolo.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.080
 And that means elsewhere.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:18.320
 So a man can have a Blolo Blah, which is another wife from the beyond.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.680
 And the female version of that is a Blolo Bianne, which is obviously a man for the wife.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.880
 But they tend to have a negative effect on this life, the other, the normal life, not

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.880
 Blolo life marriage.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.520
 I've got a dance in Ivory Coast called the Fouca Fouca.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.520
 Do you know of that?

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.520
 No.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.040
 It's the dance that Didier Dropout used to do when he scored a goal.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.120
 I know we're going back to football again, sorry about that.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.120
 Yeah.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.120
 Oh, OK.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.120
 But it's called the Fouca Fouca.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.120
 What was it like?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.120
 Like a hip swivel.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.120
 Yeah, I see.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.360
 Well, the original twerking comes from the Ivory Coast as well.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.360
 Really?

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.360
 There's a dance called them a Fouca dance, which is a traditional dance from the Ivory

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360
 Coast.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360
 It's performed by women.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.400
 And another name for it is La Donce du Fessier, which means the dance of the behind.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.400
 In 1998, the government of the Ivory Coast prohibited its performance in public.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.400
 Wow.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.800
 And here's one more dance craze from the Ivory Coast.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.520
 Flap your arms and cluck like a dying chicken.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.320
 This was a bird flu dance that they did.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.240
 It was invented by a 21-year-old disc jockey, DJ Lewis, who invented a dance making light

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.640
 of bird flu by imitating a chicken in its death rolls during a call.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.640
 Wow.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.640
 If they would bring that into British clubs, then I would definitely start going out on

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.640
 the town again.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.640
 That's true.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.480
 Well, maybe we should go out tonight and try it.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.120
 Let's start the trend.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.640
 There is an absolutely amazing building in Cote d'Ivoire, which is, it's a basilica at,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.200
 and I'm going to say this wrong, Yamusukro.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.800
 And it's the tallest basilica in the world as in, it's taller than some Peters in Rome.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.320
 They built it slightly smaller than some Peters in Rome at the request of the Pope.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.920
 And then they put a massive gold cross on it to make it taller at the top, so it's sort

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.920
 of cheated.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.960
 But a classic cheat for tall buildings around the world, always a large spike at the top.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.800
 Like the Empire State Building, the radio mask.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.800
 They didn't need that.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.800
 Yeah.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.840
 It's so big that a third of all the Catholics in Ivory Coast could worship there.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.840
 Wow.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.320
 And also, I read that it's got the largest air-conditioned space in the world.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.320
 That sounds nice.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.320
 That church does.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320
 Yeah.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.160
 Let's go there, because I am bloody hot in this office today.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160
 It is.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.160
 It is hot.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.160
 Okay, that's it.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.160
 That's full time.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.160
 That's the end of our match.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.640
 Before we find out who has won, we are going to quickly get the answers to our visitingland.com

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.240
 quiz that was our halftime show.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.280
 Starting with the questions, James, what was the first?

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.600
 Okay, the first question was, how many lakes are there in the lake district?

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.200
 It was a bit of a trick question.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.920
 Most of them are mirrors or waters.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.120
 The only one that's actually called a lake is Bass and Thwite Lake.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.600
 So the answer is one.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.600
 One lake?

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.600
 Yes.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.920
 I did not know that that was right.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.240
 Andrew Hunter Murray gets a point.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.240
 That's a nice Andy.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.000
 My question was, what's the southernmost point on the English mainland?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.240
 And if you were thinking it's landzend, it's not.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.200
 It's actually lizard point, which is not quite as far west, but it is a bit further south.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.200
 Okay.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.480
 And Anna, question number three?

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.480
 Yeah.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.080
 So my question, which world first was erected outside the House of Commons in 1868?

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.220
 The answer is the world's first traffic lights.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.220
 Traffic lights?

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.220
 British first?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.220
 Yeah.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.220
 That is correct.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.180
 It had to be taken down pretty soon after it was built because it exploded in the face of

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.380
 a policeman.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.740
 I thought you were going to say it was so successful they gave it the green light.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.740
 No.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.740
 Okay.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.740
 That's the end of the match.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.980
 And to decide who was the winner between Columbia and Côte d'Avoire, we are going to

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.100
 go to James for the decision.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.420
 Oh, it's a tough one.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.460
 Let's go for the Côte d'Avoire.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.460
 Yeah.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.460
 I really love all those dance moves.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.460
 So let's go for that.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.460
 Yeah.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.460
 Great number of dance moves.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.460
 Yeah.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.980
 This match, if you want to chat to us about any of the things that we've said, you can get

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.980
 us all on Twitter.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.980
 I'm on @Sriberland.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:53.980
 James.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.980
 At h-shaped.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.980
 Andy.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:56.980
 Right.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:57.980
 Andrew Hunter.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.980
 And Anna.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.980
 If you write to @cricapedia, the Côte d'Avoire might go back to you.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.820
 Yes, but we can't promise because Anna hates Twitter.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.820
 Okay.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.820
 That's it for the show.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.820
 Join us again tomorrow.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.180
 There's another match up in our World Cup of Facts.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.500
 And that is James.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.580
 That is the all-European counter between Switzerland and Italy.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.580
 Fighting.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.580
 Very cool.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.580
 Okay.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.100
 Well, we'll be back with that match tomorrow.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.100
 Until then.
