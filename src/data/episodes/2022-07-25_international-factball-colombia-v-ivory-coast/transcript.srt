00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
 Hello, and welcome to another edition of "No Such Thing as a Fish Presents International

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,680
 Fat Ball".

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,560
 The only football podcast out there that makes absolutely no mention of football whatsoever

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,200
 brought to you by VisitEngland.com.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,640
 We are the QI Elbs, my name is Dan, I'm sitting here with James, Andy, and Anna.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,640
 The match today is Columbia versus Côte d'Evoire, and we're about to find out who the most

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,640
 interesting of those two are.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,280
 So let's begin.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
 Columbia.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,320
 Okay, a fact about Columbia.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
 Yeah.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,120
 Okay, Columbians traditionally drank Armadillo blood to treat asthma.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
 Wow.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
 Does it work?

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
 I believe not.

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
 Yeah.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,920
 And also, you get asthma quite a lot.

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,920
 It's not like you just take a course of it and it's gone for the rest of you.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,040
 You need basically a live armadillo with a flesh wound.

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,600
 Yeah, and treat it like an inhaler.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
 Yeah, exactly.

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,760
 So people carry them around because you would be like, "In a handbag, you have an asthma

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,600
 sufferant and she starts asking you, like, did you remember your armadillo?"

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
 Yeah, sorry, can I borrow your armadillo?

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,800
 I'm just feeling a bit...

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,120
 One traditional snack in the Santander region of Columbia, which I did not know was a region,

27
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,600
 is Hormigas culonas, which translates to ants with a big bum, because they are a kind

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,920
 of ants that people like eating as a snack, and they're very rare and very valuable, because

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,440
 they only come out of their nesting ground one or two days a year.

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,880
 Sorry, do you mean rare as in undercooked, or...?

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,240
 It has some great festivals, Columbia.

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,080
 It's home to some of the various biggest festivals in the world, it's home to the biggest

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,680
 theatre festival, as in, like, the highest number of people are ten, the biggest salsa festival,

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,160
 biggest flower parade, and the biggest outdoor horse parade.

35
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,680
 Oh, that's very good.

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,320
 What's the biggest indoor horse parade?

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,200
 I know of only one famous Colombian.

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,400
 Okay, who's that?

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:49,200
 Gabrielle Garcia Marquez, the fantastic, incredible author who passed away, sadly, this year.

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,760
 And there's an interesting fact here, which I did not know is not on the blurb of his book.

41
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,720
 His grandmother was a secret witch doctor, and his grandfather once killed a man in a duel.

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
 Wow.

43
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
 Yeah.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
 Pistols at dawn.

45
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
 That's amazing.

46
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
 Bring your armadillos.

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,000
 He was really and wasn't he, Marquez.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 He was married to his wife Mercedes for 55 years, and every day throughout those years,

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,600
 she put a yellow rose on his desk in the morning.

50
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
 For a reason?

51
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 To say hi.

52
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,360
 Do you need a reason to present your wife with a flower?

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
 Yeah.

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
 Just for romantic, though.

55
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
 I need a wife.

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
 I need a wife first.

57
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,240
 Well, Mercedes meant mercies, the plural of mercy.

58
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
 Oh, really?

59
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
 Yeah.

60
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
 No, I didn't know that either.

61
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,080
 You must have heard of another Colombian, Dan, Pablo Escobar?

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
 Yeah.

63
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
 The famous drug bar, and he was Colombian.

64
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
 Okay.

66
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,480
 He had a great big house where he kept loads of animals and stuff like that, and apparently

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,320
 a lot of his hippos keep escaping from the house and terrorizing local towns.

68
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,680
 Wasn't that, didn't that help the police find him?

69
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,120
 Because hippos are not native to Colombia.

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
 You will ask questions, wouldn't you?

71
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,120
 Yeah, that's true.

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,440
 In the 1990s, Escobar owned one of the best football teams in Colombia at Letico Nacional.

73
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,440
 And their rivals, Millionarios, belong to a rival drug trafficker.

74
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
 Wow.

75
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
 Which is amazing.

76
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,440
 He apparently used to have big parties.

77
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
 Hey.

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
 Escobar.

79
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
 Yeah, yeah.

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,920
 And at those parties, he would drown his enemies in the pool.

81
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,280
 Is it kind of like two boroughs, one stone kind of thing?

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
 Wow.

83
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,480
 I don't want to just like do the dull stuff.

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
 What?

85
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,680
 That's a party and then we can have this happen back.

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,840
 As one of his enemies, if you receive, with their people going, "I'm so surprised I'm

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,520
 invited to Escobar's party.

88
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,520
 He's never liked me, but I mean, I guess we should go, right?"

89
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,040
 When he's going to say no to a pool party, he said it's a pool party, but he said I don't

90
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
 need to bring trunks.

91
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
 I don't understand.

92
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,040
 Well, yeah.

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
 Madeline's an interesting town.

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,640
 They have a no-pants day as a protest against the government.

95
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,240
 I have a no-pants day several times a week, not as a protest, just as a way of life.

96
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,120
 Well, the many reasons we've changed the locks on this office, Andy, how did you get in today?

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
 You mean no pants, you mean trousers?

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
 Yes, I am.

99
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
 American style pants.

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
 Okay.

101
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,320
 Well, I'm still having a no-pants day today.

102
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,920
 Yeah, it's against freedom of expression, and so they walk around the town with no trousers

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
 on.

104
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,960
 I mean, sort of on the subject of this, there's a remote outpost in Colombia called it's

105
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,320
 pronounced "loss penis", although it's not quite.

106
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
 Nothing funny about that?

107
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
 No, you're right.

108
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,000
 Absolutely, no, it's just a way of expressing yourself.

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,360
 And the guys who live there, it's separated from the nearest town by a ravine, and the Colombian

110
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
 government's decided that it's too expensive, and there aren't enough people living there

111
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,680
 to build a bridge over the ravine.

112
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,280
 And so the nearest school, for instance, is in the nearest town, and all the kids have to

113
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,800
 get there by ziplying across the ravine.

114
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
 Oh, wow.

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,080
 And as you can imagine, they're not the safety conscious zipliers at tourist, try when they pop

116
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
 over to New Zealand.

117
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,800
 You don't want to get your lost penis stuck in that ziplier.

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:51,200
 Bogota also has a laziness museum, it's a museum in Bogota, which aims to make people think

119
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,680
 about the social issues implied in taking a nap, in being jobless or in feeling that maybe

120
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,160
 we are wasting our time.

121
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,840
 Do you want to go to the laziness museum?

122
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
 Yeah.

123
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,000
 Imagine the staff behind the desk, yeah, just go in.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Yeah.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,120
 Why the no cards here, telling us what all these exhibits are, and actually, why the

126
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,520
 no exhibits.

127
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,840
 OK, now it's time for the halftime show, which is three QI questions brought to you by VisitingLin.com

128
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,480
 and the three questions, with the answers being revealed at the end of this podcast are

129
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
 James.

130
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,480
 OK, my question is, how many lakes are there in the lake district?

131
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,960
 Question number two, Andy.

132
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,560
 Where is the southernmost point of the mainland in England?

133
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
 OK.

134
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,840
 Question number three from Anna, which world first was built outside the houses of commons

135
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,480
 in 1868?

136
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
 OK.

137
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,960
 It's time for match to resume play and making their way onto the pitch.

138
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
 It's Cote d'Ivoire.

139
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,040
 So Cote d'Ivoire, who wants to go first?

140
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
 OK.

141
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
 Are we going to keep calling it Cote d'Ivoire or Ivory Coast?

142
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,400
 Why, let's go for both.

143
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,360
 Cote d'Ivoire is what most places in the world call it, but usually places in the UK call

144
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,120
 it Ivory Coast, both are acceptable.

145
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,600
 I prefer to call it Ivory Cote because it reminds me of my favourite item of clothing.

146
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,320
 You've really got to hand that to a museum.

147
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,600
 They've had a lot of problems in Ivory Coast over the last several years.

148
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,640
 They've had a civil war and they've had a lot of domestic unrest.

149
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,440
 So partly as a result of that, everyone's very young.

150
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,680
 The average age is about 19 across the whole country and also wages are very low.

151
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,960
 So someone earning as little as $100 per month is pacified as being middle class, officially.

152
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
 Wow.

153
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
 Yeah.

154
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,120
 It is a troubled place we were saying that's quite hard to come up with more fun facts in the

155
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,480
 Ivory Coast because there are a lot less fun facts.

156
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,800
 As you say, Andy, it has been embroiled in civil war, basically since 1999 with a couple

157
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,040
 of respites.

158
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,480
 One of the major respites in the civil war was in 2006 during the World Cup and I know

159
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,000
 we're not supposed to mention football, but the Ivory Coast football team was credited

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,960
 with causing a truce because as soon as the Ivory Coast qualified for the World Cup,

161
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,680
 the football team brought the boring parties together and made them sign a truce.

162
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,400
 Because both sides were supporting the Ivory Coast and the World Cup, it brought them together

163
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
 for a time.

164
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,800
 I know an interesting fact about their independence day.

165
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 Go on.

166
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
 Go on.

167
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,320
 Their independence day is the seventh of August.

168
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
 Good one, Dan.

169
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
 Doesn't really sound like much of a fact.

170
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
 Yeah.

171
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
 They celebrate it on December 7th.

172
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
 Oh, that is good.

173
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
 What really?

174
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
 Why?

175
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,680
 I think it's because by the time the harvests have been collected and sold, that's when they

176
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
 get paid.

177
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,760
 And so their independence day was set up on that, but they didn't actually have enough

178
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,520
 money to have a proper celebration.

179
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
 So it's just a better time of year.

180
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
 A better time of year.

181
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,400
 So they celebrate August the 7th Independence Day on December 7th.

182
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,000
 We should celebrate Christmas in the summer when it's nice and sunny and not cold and

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 horrible.

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,080
 One thing you were like, Dan, is that there is a group of people in the Ivory Coast

185
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,480
 who are called the Dan.

186
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
 Really?

187
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,040
 And they specialize in doing stilt dances, dancing while on stilts.

188
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,800
 And their main town is called Man.

189
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,240
 So you could be Dan of Man.

190
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
 Yeah.

191
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
 I like it.

192
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,240
 That's very cool.

193
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
 Yeah.

194
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
 There's another group of people, and I really like this.

195
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,640
 They're called the Bowel people.

196
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,440
 And they believe in another parallel world called Blolo.

197
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,080
 And that means elsewhere.

198
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,320
 So a man can have a Blolo Blah, which is another wife from the beyond.

199
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,680
 And the female version of that is a Blolo Bianne, which is obviously a man for the wife.

200
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,880
 But they tend to have a negative effect on this life, the other, the normal life, not

201
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,880
 Blolo life marriage.

202
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,520
 I've got a dance in Ivory Coast called the Fouca Fouca.

203
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
 Oh, yeah.

204
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
 Do you know of that?

205
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
 No.

206
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,040
 It's the dance that Didier Dropout used to do when he scored a goal.

207
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,120
 I know we're going back to football again, sorry about that.

208
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
 Yeah.

209
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
 Oh, OK.

210
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
 But it's called the Fouca Fouca.

211
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
 What was it like?

212
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
 Like a hip swivel.

213
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
 Yeah, I see.

214
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,360
 Well, the original twerking comes from the Ivory Coast as well.

215
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
 Really?

216
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,360
 There's a dance called them a Fouca dance, which is a traditional dance from the Ivory

217
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
 Coast.

218
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
 It's performed by women.

219
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,400
 And another name for it is La Donce du Fessier, which means the dance of the behind.

220
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400
 In 1998, the government of the Ivory Coast prohibited its performance in public.

221
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
 Wow.

222
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,800
 And here's one more dance craze from the Ivory Coast.

223
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,520
 Flap your arms and cluck like a dying chicken.

224
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,320
 This was a bird flu dance that they did.

225
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,240
 It was invented by a 21-year-old disc jockey, DJ Lewis, who invented a dance making light

226
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,640
 of bird flu by imitating a chicken in its death rolls during a call.

227
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
 Wow.

228
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,640
 If they would bring that into British clubs, then I would definitely start going out on

229
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
 the town again.

230
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
 That's true.

231
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,480
 Well, maybe we should go out tonight and try it.

232
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,120
 Let's start the trend.

233
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,640
 There is an absolutely amazing building in Cote d'Ivoire, which is, it's a basilica at,

234
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,200
 and I'm going to say this wrong, Yamusukro.

235
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,800
 And it's the tallest basilica in the world as in, it's taller than some Peters in Rome.

236
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,320
 They built it slightly smaller than some Peters in Rome at the request of the Pope.

237
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,920
 And then they put a massive gold cross on it to make it taller at the top, so it's sort

238
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
 of cheated.

239
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,960
 But a classic cheat for tall buildings around the world, always a large spike at the top.

240
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,800
 Like the Empire State Building, the radio mask.

241
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
 They didn't need that.

242
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
 Yeah.

243
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,840
 It's so big that a third of all the Catholics in Ivory Coast could worship there.

244
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
 Wow.

245
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,320
 And also, I read that it's got the largest air-conditioned space in the world.

246
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
 That sounds nice.

247
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
 That church does.

248
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
 Yeah.

249
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,160
 Let's go there, because I am bloody hot in this office today.

250
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
 It is.

251
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
 It is hot.

252
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
 Okay, that's it.

253
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
 That's full time.

254
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
 That's the end of our match.

255
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,640
 Before we find out who has won, we are going to quickly get the answers to our visitingland.com

256
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,240
 quiz that was our halftime show.

257
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,280
 Starting with the questions, James, what was the first?

258
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,600
 Okay, the first question was, how many lakes are there in the lake district?

259
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
 It was a bit of a trick question.

260
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,920
 Most of them are mirrors or waters.

261
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,120
 The only one that's actually called a lake is Bass and Thwite Lake.

262
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,600
 So the answer is one.

263
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
 One lake?

264
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
 Yes.

265
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,920
 I did not know that that was right.

266
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,240
 Andrew Hunter Murray gets a point.

267
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
 That's a nice Andy.

268
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,000
 My question was, what's the southernmost point on the English mainland?

269
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,240
 And if you were thinking it's landzend, it's not.

270
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,200
 It's actually lizard point, which is not quite as far west, but it is a bit further south.

271
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
 Okay.

272
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,480
 And Anna, question number three?

273
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
 Yeah.

274
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,080
 So my question, which world first was erected outside the House of Commons in 1868?

275
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,220
 The answer is the world's first traffic lights.

276
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,220
 Traffic lights?

277
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,220
 British first?

278
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
 Yeah.

279
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,220
 That is correct.

280
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,180
 It had to be taken down pretty soon after it was built because it exploded in the face of

281
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,380
 a policeman.

282
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,740
 I thought you were going to say it was so successful they gave it the green light.

283
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
 No.

284
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,740
 Okay.

285
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,740
 That's the end of the match.

286
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,980
 And to decide who was the winner between Columbia and Côte d'Avoire, we are going to

287
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,100
 go to James for the decision.

288
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,420
 Oh, it's a tough one.

289
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,460
 Let's go for the Côte d'Avoire.

290
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,460
 Yeah.

291
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,460
 I really love all those dance moves.

292
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,460
 So let's go for that.

293
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
 Yeah.

294
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
 Great number of dance moves.

295
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,460
 Yeah.

296
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,980
 This match, if you want to chat to us about any of the things that we've said, you can get

297
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
 us all on Twitter.

298
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
 I'm on @Sriberland.

299
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
 James.

300
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
 At h-shaped.

301
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,980
 Andy.

302
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,980
 Right.

303
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,980
 Andrew Hunter.

304
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,980
 And Anna.

305
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,980
 If you write to @cricapedia, the Côte d'Avoire might go back to you.

306
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,820
 Yes, but we can't promise because Anna hates Twitter.

307
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,820
 Okay.

308
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,820
 That's it for the show.

309
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
 Join us again tomorrow.

310
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,180
 There's another match up in our World Cup of Facts.

311
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,500
 And that is James.

312
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,580
 That is the all-European counter between Switzerland and Italy.

313
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,580
 Fighting.

314
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,580
 Very cool.

315
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,580
 Okay.

316
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,100
 Well, we'll be back with that match tomorrow.

317
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
 Until then.
