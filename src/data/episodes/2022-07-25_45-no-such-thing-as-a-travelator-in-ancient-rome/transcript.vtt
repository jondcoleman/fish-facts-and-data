 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast brought to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 My name's Anna, I'm joined today by fellow QI elves James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 and also special guest today, historian and horrible histories writer Greg Jenner, who has a book to plug, correct?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Yes, plug, plug, plug, it's called a million years in a day and it's out like now, and it's quite good.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 It is good, some of us have read at least bits of it, it's amazing.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 I wouldn't go that far, but it's alright.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 It's above average.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 I would say it's definitely sort of top 70 percentile, you know, like you know, it's a 2-1.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Okay, a high 2-1 book by it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Okay, let's get on with the show.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 And for fact number one, let's go to you, Greg.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Okay, so my fact is from my book because I am that unimaginative, and my fact is in the 1960s in America,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 there was one particular bus route that was only 35 miles long,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 but during that time passengers passed through seven different time zones.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 How does that work?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Right, so it's fairly complicated, so I'm going to have to give you probably a bit of context.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Okay.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 So this is all to do with day-like saving time, which is something we have here, of course, in Britain,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 and it's a familiar concept to all of us.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 But it was an idea first put forward about a hundred years ago by William Willett,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 who was a moustache old Englishman.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 He was also the ancestor of Chris Martin from Coldplay, you know, for your fans at the year.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Who wrote clocks?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Exactly, there we go, see.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 So he put that forward in about 1909, I think, and he was arguing for trying to get more daylight into the time.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 So everyone was like, "Well, this is a nice idea in principle, but it sounds very complicated, we're not going to do it."

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 And then in 1915 he died, and everyone was sort of mocking him, and the idea was going nowhere.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 And then Germany picked up with the idea and said, "This is a brilliant idea, we will do this."

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 They did it during the war, didn't they?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 They did it during the war.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 And it was like, "It saved them energy."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Yeah, because that extra hour of daylight meant you didn't have to burn loads and loads of gas and oil, and that could then go to the war effort.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 When he died, did everyone miss his funeral by an hour?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 So as soon as Germany adopted it, Britain very sheepishly went, "Yeah, maybe we should do that as well."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 And it became known as Willett Time, which is like Hammer Time, but looking with the stash, I think.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 And anyway, it then spread around the world, and America adopted it, and the problem with America is it's a much bigger nation than Britain.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 And so America has loads of time zones, and it's too big, and so the government says, "All right, come on, let's be sensible here.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 We're a federal nation, so each state can decide if they're going to opt in or opt out."

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Yeah.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 And then the problem is that each of the states then said to the towns and cities, "Okay, you guys can also decide if you're going to opt in or opt out."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 And so 28 of the states opted in to DST, and then the various cities were then decided, "Oh, we can do what we're not going to do it."

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 And so what happened is you ended up with this incredibly chaotic system. It's the point that, in Idaho, shops that were next door to each other might be on different times.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 So in the same building, like you could literally go that next door to the corner shops.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 This is amazing.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 This was in 1950s and 1960s.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Until 1966, this was happening.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 I just want to say, how did it work with the two shops that were next to each other?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 It reminds me of a place I went to called Bal Hurtog on the border of the Netherlands and Belgium.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Oh, yeah, the exclave place.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Yeah, so there's loads of exclaves and the border between the two countries is really, really complicated.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 And they have the lines you can see on the pavements you can see where the lines are.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 So you can like work from Belgium to Netherlands and back into Belgium and then back into Netherlands again.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And it's something like the Netherlands rules on selling pornography are supposed to be so much better than Belgium.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 So all the pornographic shops are in Netherlands and all the firework shops are in Belgium.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Even though they're in the same town, they're all put in different buildings.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 I mean, I think that's a mad idea, isn't it? But I think that certainly kids in Michigan go to Canada to go drinking.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Other than this, I think it's 18, it's legal age in America at 21.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 This is, in fact, there was a golf club set up on the border of the US in Canada during prohibition as a way for Americans to be able to drink.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 So the drinking club within the golf club was on the Canadian side of the border.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 So you could enter the golf club in America and then you kind of wander over to the side which had a pub.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Go drinking.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 That's a brilliant idea.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 But I think William Willetts, one of the reasons people thought he was crazy because his system was quite complicated.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 So he was suggesting going forward by 20 minutes of daylight a day, right?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Yeah, he suggested.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Which is very complicated.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 I think he suggested, I can't remember exact details, but he suggested changing the clock something like six or seven times a year.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Which is just a bit too much faffing.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And also people had only just got uniform time because until the sort of coming of the railways, every town in Britain had its own time.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 I think Barth and Bristol, I think about seven or eight minutes behind London.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And so when the trains arrived, that became chaotic because people missed their trains obviously.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 And then William Willetts, I know, when, hey guys, what if we all changed the clock?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Loads enough to times.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 You know, I've really annoying dates.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 And we'd all get an hour back.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 It was the railways which actually made the first time zone.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 It's called railway time.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Railway time.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 It's so cool.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 And all the really interesting legal implications over what could happen.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 So if babies were born at the same time, but in different places,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 that you know, a whole inheritance could be changed because technically, you know,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 the chart had been born earlier, therefore it's got the will of inheritance or whatever.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 So all of this happened only because of fast speed communication.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 So trains, telegraphs, that kind of thing.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 The amazing thing is, I mean, so I've going back to my original fact, this 35 mile route.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 You had to change your watch, I think, every eight minutes.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 I mean, did people actually do that?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 No, I don't think so.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 I mean, I think, you know, maybe if you were really into timekeeping.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Yeah, I bet there was a really nerdy school boy.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 But it's just sort of an amazing idea that you'd get on a bus.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 And it was only 35 miles.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 It's between a Moundsville, West Virginia and Stubmanville, Ohio.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 And during that time, you would pass in and out of time zones back and forth back and forth back and forth back and forth.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 That's cool.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 What you guys were saying about different towns having their own times.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 That was in America as well.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 And in the 1870s, North America had 144 official times in all the different towns and stuff.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 144.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Yeah, and if you went from Washington to San Francisco and you wanted to be this nerdy school boy who changes watch all the time,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 you'd have to change it over 200 times.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 No way.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 But in fairness, it's a long journey and you need to do something to take up the time.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Of course, to not be an advantage.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 No, to be less than two in traffic.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 No, to do so, yeah, it's just watches.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 But I mean, the problem of timekeeping is a really ancient one.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 And this is something I sort of tried to cover in the book of it.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Is that, you know, the ancient Egyptians, you know, trying to work out what time it was by the stars and by solar clocks.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 But back then, there was no standard 60 minute hours.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Is it true that in the middle ages, they used to, they would have, say, 12 hours in a day.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 And that would be from sunrise to sunset.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 And so if it was a longer day in the summer, then the hours would just be longer.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Yeah, so that'd be right.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Yeah, they basically, I mean, there were scholars who kind of went, hey, guys, I think we should have actual equal hours.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 But it didn't really work.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 It didn't really work. It doesn't point being smug if you're stumbling around the dark.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 That's so interesting.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 So when it seemed like in the summer term, the hours were going really slowly,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 because you're waiting for the holidays. It's because they were.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Yeah.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Because until the invention of gas lights and stuff, when people actually could have artificial lighting,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 people just went to bed when they got dark.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 How do people know how long it was? Like, how did they know in advance?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Sand timers and water timers.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 The ancient Chinese, although medieval Chinese, had clocks that you could smell.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 So each hour was a different incense.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 So it burned down and so you'd be like, oh, it must be lunchtime because I can smell ginger.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Oh, it's a fan of times.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 What's a lunch?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Ginger.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 So yeah, the history of timekeeping is really, really confusing.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 It wasn't until I think the 14th century that it was a Muslim scholar.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 I think it's Syria.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 It came up with the first equal hours clock.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Before that, it would have played out with things like women's hour.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Yes.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Welcome to women's 72 minutes.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 It still is really complicated time zones and timekeeping and everything, isn't it?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Like, some countries have the most eccentric systems.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 When I live in Australia, they have various bits of Australia that have it in half hour increments,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 rather than in our increments.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 And some places have it in quarter of an hour increments.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 I think there's a town of 200 people in Australia, which is decided to be GMT+8 and 3/4.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Brilliant.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 So the town of Bloody Awkwoodsville, Australia.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 I'm trying to work out.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 So how many times zones do we think there are in the world?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 So if you just count an hour, they divide it along 15 degrees across the world.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Since the 1880s, I think it is.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 So there should only be 24?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 I think so, yeah.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 Except there are 26, because there's a little group of islands, which decided to put themselves,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 because they did more trading with America.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 A really?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 decided to join America's time.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 So if you look down the international date line, it's got a really weird kink in it.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 It's not aligned at all, because it scoops these islands in.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Is that Samoa or American Samoa or Tonga?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 No, it was different.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Samoa is the one that went in 2011.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 It decided to go back a day, didn't it?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 So it missed out the 30th of December 2011.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Sorry, I went forward a day, but I did get an extra day on the 4th of July 1882.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Or 1892.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Use it wisely.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Yeah.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 So I reckon what would happen is everyone would celebrate the day before, because it's like a big event.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 Everyone would be hungover to hell on that day.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And no one would do anything on that day at all.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 And then the next day they go, "What do you do on your extra day?"

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 "Oh, I just stayed in bed."

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 I just love there to be like a doctor who episode that's set in the last days.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Some sort of weird quasi-universe wear.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 That's great.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 Yeah, I don't actually watch Doctor Who's, I don't know how it works, but it would be...

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 It's like that.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Like that, basically, yeah.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 If I had that made a lot more sense than a lot of the doctors.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 Anyone else?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Some things on buses?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Oh, yeah, buses.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 As soon as we were talking about the start.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 So there is a bus driver in Moscow called Alexey Volkov, who is known as the Punisher,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 because he deliberately rams people who cut him up.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Really?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 Oh, wow.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 When you say cut him up, do you mean people who slap him with a knife?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 I'm going to cut him up.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 I'm afraid not.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 If you're driven in Moscow, it's like that.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Yeah, it's everyone's cutting you up all the time.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 That is a weirdly visceral metaphor, isn't it?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 Yeah.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 For just someone driving in front of you a bit close.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 Yeah.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Going to cut you up.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 I wonder if there's ever been a confusion in a police station on that.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 If anyone's ever got a really long prison sentence unnecessarily,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 for just slipping in front of somebody.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 All I do is cut him up, gaff, gaff, gaff.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 All right, now it's time for fact number two.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 And that is Andy.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 My fact is that if a predator gets too close to a limpet,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 the limpet will lift up its shell and then stamp on the predator's foot.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 So cool is that.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 So how fast does it do that?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Because I think a limpet is being quite slow moving.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 They are slow.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 They generally get about a meter away from their home before going back.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 Brilliant.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 That's the gousing.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Yeah, it's a long weekend.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 And they have to get back before the tide comes in.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 So, you know, why do they leave their home then?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 If they're only going on meter, what are they looking for?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 They are looking for food.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 They are hungry for algae.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 They love an algae.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 The other thing is they'll stamp on your foot if you go to near them.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 But they only have one foot, don't they?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 They're just a foot.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 That's all a limpet.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 They are the foot.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 But they've got the shell all around them.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 So that's the painful bit.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 So the muscle, the foot muscle is in the middle.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 And then obviously the shell, you know,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 crunching down between the predator and the rock.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Things like starfish like to eat them.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Yeah, I don't think they can do it very fast.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 But it's called mushrooming.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Why is it called mushrooming?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Mushrooms don't stamp on you.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 I suppose when they go up on their foot and the shell is around them,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 they look like a mushroom if you're from the side.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 But that's just a theory.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 I don't know, that's true.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Yeah.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 And so, yeah, anyway, they move across.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 They go commuting basically for algae.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 And they move across very, very slowly.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 And they have this tongue called a radula.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Which they scrape over the rock.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 And it's got 1,920 teeth on it.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Yeah, with hardened with iron compounds.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 Basically, if these things ever decide to grow bigger, we are stuffed.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 The compound is called girthite, I think.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Is it?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Named after girthite, the author.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Right.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 Well, it's quite a long story.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 So it was named by a guy called George Lentz,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 who was a friend of girthite.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 And if you read any books, it says that it was named in his honour.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Yeah.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 But actually, these two guys fell out quite early.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 He introduced Lentz to his sister.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 And we don't know, his sister was married.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 And we don't know what happened.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 But then a little bit later, Lentz was kicked out of the court of Vimer.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 And then later on, Lentz then named this mineral after girthite.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 But it says it's in his honour, but these two didn't get on.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 And so I think that it was named against him because he didn't like him.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 And it's this thing which is found in the tongue of Olympia.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 But it's also found in mud.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 And I think he was like literally making his name mud.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Nice.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Good theory.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 It's a limpit then.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Limpits.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 They're commutes.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Sounds thrilling.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Yeah, it is.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 But doesn't algae come to them?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 No.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Right.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Well, in a way, yes.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 I think they filter water through their gills.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 But they do also definitely go across the rocks in search of food.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 Very, very slowly.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 They also migrate.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 Limpits.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 How far?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Not very far.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 A few metres.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 About a metre, yeah.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 But in the winter.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Do they go south?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 Do they go south for winter?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 Three metres.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 They move up the shore.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 So it depends which direction the shore is.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 If you ever see a flock of limpits in a V shape, that's my greatest.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 It's for better aerodynamics than it is.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 So when they go, they leave a trail of mucus behind them.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Right.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 And then they go across scraping the rock with their tongue and getting all the algae up off the rock.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 But then the mucus they leave behind them actually encourages more algae to grow on it.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 But that's basically farming.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 They are encouraging more food to grow in the path they have been in.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Yeah.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 So not only is it quite advanced farming.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 If they were to eat it, are they in close?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Well, it's just in close.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Come on, man.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 This does, is it?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 So they do get subsidies from the EU.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Do they have a butter mountain?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 An algae mountain.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Right.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 Here's a question.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 And you may know the answer to it.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 I'm going off topic here.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 But how many bacteria would you have to have?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Before you could see them in a lump.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 What would a mountain of bacteria look like?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 It would look like a lot of pus, basically.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Really?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 But how do you know that?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Just before we get onto that.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 How do you know that?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Do you have anything that would look like a mountain of pus?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 I think I might have read that in one of XKCD's things.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Everyone in the book or on their website.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 I would surely it would depend on the kind of bacteria.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Some of it.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Yeah, and some things.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 All of the same.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 No, it would look like a big shimmery silvery greenish bluish.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 So let the blob come from like classic fighting the movies in the 60s or whatever.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 But I mean James, I think I've actually done some research on this.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 I think I've said this before.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 The blob is based on a real police report.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 I might have said this before, actually.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 Really?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 Yeah.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 It was based on a police report in America in the 1950s about a mysterious blob.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Would you turn out to be a giant cluster of bacteria?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 If you haven't seen the blob, it's such a good film.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 It's got Steve McQueen in it.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 Yeah.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 A really, really young Steve McQueen.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 And the blob eats everyone.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Oh.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Spoiler alert.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Spoiler alert.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 So just swallowed things up and digested them.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Yeah.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 There's a great bit where a farmer gets hungry with it and fires a gun into it.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 I bet it doesn't work.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Doesn't work.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 Doesn't work.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 It just eats the bullets and gets a fraction bigger.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Again, guys, spoiler alert.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Sorry.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Come on.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 We were talking about bacteria.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 Yeah, there's a bacteria that you can see, I think.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 The biggest bacterium, I think, might be nicknamed Conan the bacterium by the most papers.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 And I think it's bigger.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Is it visible to the naked eye?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 I think it is.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Just one of them.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 I believe so.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 We've mentioned in one of our books that bacteria can get viruses.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Viruses can get viruses.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 And the viruses can get viruses.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Big viruses can get some more ones.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 They found a big virus.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 It was in a cooling tower somewhere in the UK, I think.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 And it was a massive, massive virus.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 And then they found another one.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 And it was orbiting the original virus.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 And it's called Sputnik.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 They called it.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 Really?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 Wow.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 They get it might be a newspaper nickname.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 I don't know.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 Especially like a satellite virus.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Yeah.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Just going round and round it.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 If you dropped a load of bacteria out of a plate.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Yeah.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 How much a blobsworth?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Yeah, a blobsworth, say.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Would they fall?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Or would the air currents be enough to just keep them up there forever?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Oh, interesting.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 That's what a cloud is, Andy.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Just a load of bacteria.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Yeah.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Well, a cloud needs something for the water droplets to nucleate around.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 And sometimes that would be bacteria, originally.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 Yeah.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 I imagine.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 It would usually be like dust or sand.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 But I bet it could work with bacteria.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 They've just done a trial of cloud seeding.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 Or they've done a study of studies of cloud seeding.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Which is where you drop a little divide in crystals from a plane.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And then those are the tiny, tiny crystals which the water droplets form around

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 and then you get rain.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 No.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 And they found that it does have a small positive effect.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 They don't think that it's currently good enough to deliberately do anything to weather.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Yeah.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Like you could probably make a difference, but it's not reliable enough.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Yeah, you can't just wake up.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 It's a sunny day.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 That was me.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 That was my cloud seeding.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 We did cloud seeding just before some of this year.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 And we were very proud to report it to be that barbecue summer.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Can you tell we haven't done any limpit research?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 I've got lots of limpit research.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 Let's hear this one.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 I'm keen to talk about limpits.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Limpits are all, there's basically no such thing as a limpit.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 It was just good.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Yeah.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 So limpits don't really exist.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 I think they do.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 I think they don't.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Because it's just a name for aquatic snails with basically conical shells.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 That's all it is.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 It's a very informal term.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 Lots of different things that we call limpits come from different filers.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 There was a thing called a common limpit, isn't it?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 I think.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Yes, there is.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 And that'll be a specific speech.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 And that's very informal.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 That's a way of jeans.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 Yeah.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 It doesn't take issues off when it comes in.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 The Wikipedia describes limpit.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 It's exactly how I've just described it.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 It's exactly how I've described it.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 Because this is where I got it.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 You missed off the bit that it adds.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 So a limpit is a commonly implied aquatic snails with shells broadly conical in shape,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 rather like the conical Asian hat.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Which I've never seen Wikipedia open with a similarly.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Nora slightly racist similarly.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 What's the conical Asian hat?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 You know if you took a slightly racist picture of someone from Asia from the 1950s.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Yeah.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 And they'd be like a rice farmer with their hat.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Oh, really?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 A conical.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 It brought lots of shade.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 Yeah.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Because if you're working outdoors as a rice farmer, then that keeps the sound of your head.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Yeah.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 So your so starfish eat limpits, didn't they?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Or try to.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 They do.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Sometimes eat things.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 They sort of make their stomach go to them, I think, rather than them going to their stomach.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 So I think starfish expel their stomachs out of themselves and then swallow them up into their stomach.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 So I guess like a limpit when it's trying to defend itself might stamp on a starfish stomach.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 Is that what it does?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 I think it might do.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Yeah.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 I assume there are starfish stopped by the stomach somewhere by a limpit.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Have you heard of starfish wasting disease?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 No.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Yeah, it's very sad.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 It's a disease which is kind of getting a bit bigger at the moment and it basically gets starfish to waste themselves by ripping their own arms off.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 What?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Yeah.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 They rip their own arms off.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Yeah.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 How do they rip off the last arm?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 The arms continue to crawl around for a while after they rip them off.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 It's pretty creepy.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Maybe they all gang up and rip the last one off as well.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Did I hear on my podcast?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Or maybe an episode of Kiwai about a plant that's so painful when you touch it, a guy shot himself.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 Oh yeah.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Oh, it's a metal.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 It's so painful, you just can't even tolerate living anymore.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Yeah.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Maybe that's how it works.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 But didn't he use it accidentally as a loop paper?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 He did.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 He's in Australia.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 This is a reporting Australian geographic.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 And yeah, it stings so much it's like being electrocuted.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 He electrocuted on the bump.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Yeah.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 It's horrible.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 He picked it up, wiped himself and in so much pain he shot himself.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Wow.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Well, speaking of people who've electrocuted their bombs, that's reminded me of one of my favourite ever stories in history.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 And it was a famous guy actually.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 So this is Alexander von Humboldt.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Oh yeah.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Oh yeah.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 He might have heard him.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 He was mega famous.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 He was like a proper famous.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 He was a polymurf and exactly.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 Yeah.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Enlightenment scholar.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Proper Prussian chap.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 He has, does he have more things named after species named after than anyone else?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 Really.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 I think he's got a lot.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 I think he's got a lot.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 I wouldn't sound like it would be more, but I'm not sure.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 He did loads of research in South America.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 And in his 20s, he got really obsessed with electricity because it was kind of galvanic.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 He had just been electrocuting stuff and everyone was going, "Electricity is the new thing."

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 And so one day, he and his assistant were sort of wondering, "I wonder what electricity does to dead things?"

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 And they found, I think, a dead bird and he reanimated it.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 And with electricity, it came back to life for 10 minutes and he went, "Oh, amazing, brilliant.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 That's electricity.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 He can revive the dead."

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 It probably died of heart disease or something and it restarted the heart and the heart was bleeding.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Oh, maybe it was a sleep.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 [laughter]

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Just woke it up.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 But having electrocuted the bird, he then thought, "Well, electricity is clearly amazing.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 I wonder what else I can electrocute.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 I know myself."

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 And so he put one electrode in his mouth and then he inserted the other one into his anus.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 And then electrocuted himself.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 And one of my favourite ever quotes in history is his description of the outcome.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 He put about four inches into his rectum and he described it as this.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 The introduction of a charge into the armatures produced nauseating cramps and discomforting stomach contractions.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Then abdominal pain, the severe magnitude, followed by involuntary evacuation of the bladder.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 What struck me more is that by inserting the silver more deeply into the rectum.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 [laughter]

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 Having evacuated my health, I thought, "I'd just do that further in."

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 More deeply into the rectum, a bright light appears behind both eyes.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 So he basically went, "Wow, this is really painful and I've pissed myself.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 But what if I keep going?"

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 And then he just basically had to sort of blind this behind his eyes.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 That is a scientist.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 And then what about when he went deeper?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 [laughter]

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 I see what you mean.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 It's like he saw a bright light.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Yeah.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 I was kind of picturing lasers coming out of his eyes.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 [laughter]

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 But I think what he's describing is basically just like a flash of electricity.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 You can find it like, you know, like a pure blinding.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 And the lovely thing is that that input him off electricity at all.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 He then went to South America and did various research where he came across, I think, an electric eel.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 And the first thing he did shove it up his ass.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 Thankfully he didn't do that, but he did pick it up and go, "Zah!"

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 All right, you try.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Gave it to his assistant, he went, "Zah!"

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 And gave it back to him, and they'd electrocute themselves all day long.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 We were just testing how paper and watch to be an electric eel.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 They used to put eels up horses, bumps, didn't they?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 So you would go to the market and you would want to sell your horse,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 but you want people to think it was better than it was.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 You put either some ginger or an eel up their buns and it would make them all lively.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 You should never look a gift horse in the mouth, but you should look in the anus.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Just in case.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 I think the Romans also used electric eels as a cure for headaches.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 I think the memory says, "I think..."

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 Was that why I work?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 I think because they definitely had eels, and they were really interested in eels.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 They used to have man-eating eels in their ponds and slaves used to be thrown into them.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 Man-eating eels, that really, really aggressive.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Well, really aggressive eels that would just eat any flesh.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 And if a Roman aristocrat didn't like a slave or a slave had broken a nice cup or something,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 they'd throw into the eels and eat them.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Did they have cups? I suppose they must have done that.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 I think of them as an empire.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 I think you're not bothered about the man-eating eels, but...

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Where do cups, you say?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 No.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Are they out of aqueducts?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Yeah.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 We've got all this water all the way here from the mountains.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 Right, everyone, get your hands together at the time of the tea.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 What I mean was...

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 Oh, God.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 I don't think of them having cups with handles.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 I think of them having little handle as goblets, things like that.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 But actually, I mean, there was one very famous Roman aristocrat who was so in love with his eels.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 His pet eels, actually, that he put earrings on them and painted their faces like a lady.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 So, apparently, when the eel died, he cried bitterly, you know, more so than when his own sort of slaves or family died.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 But when the eels snuffed it, he was really...

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 All the cute Roman buzzfeed pictures were not of dogs and jumpers.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 They were of eels with makeup on.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 Yeah, eels.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 That's creepy as hell.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Animal defense mechanisms.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 We ever talked about the pygmy sperm whale.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 No.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 I think I'd remember.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 We had talked about all those three things separately.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 But I don't think we've talked about the combo.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 This is okay.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 So, it's really quite sweet.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 It's tiny.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 And B is a defense mechanism.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 It's another animal that shoots, like, syrupy stuff out of its anus.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Which things are trying to chase it, kind of get stuck in and disoriented by.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 It's a deep-colored syrup into the water and spreads it around with its tail.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 So, it mixes it around with paint.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 It's a syrup species, though, isn't it, right?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 Simply.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Is it feces?

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Well, if it's dark and syrupy and coming out of its anus.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 I always say if it looks like feces, tastes like feces, it's probably feces.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 I prefer to call mine syrup.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 And, yes, wishes it around in the water, like a painter mixing his paints.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 That's a really weird painter.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 Like Paci M&E mixing their paints.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 So, time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 And my fact is that, after landing on the moon,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Buzz Aldrin worked in a car dealership way he failed to sell a single car.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 I'm not surprised if he's selling them on the moon.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 To be fair, they would have had a massive mileage on the clock as well.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 And the only so one type, which is a rover.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 He came home first, right?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 Sorry, after returning from the moon,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 Buzz Aldrin worked in a car dealership and failed to sell a car.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 Yeah, so this is, so it was in Beverly Hills.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 And he worked there for six months.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 I think it was a Cadillac dealership.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 But I was reading this is a really interesting article about how

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 after Buzz Aldrin and Armstrong landed on the moon,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 a year later, almost no Americans knew who they were.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 They completely slipped out of the public eye.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 The nationwide survey is done, New York Times ran a lot of them.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 And yeah, one in 12 or one in 10 people would be able to name Buzz Aldrin on Neil Armstrong.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 That's unbelievable.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 It's weird, isn't it?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Yeah.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 That's so weird.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Yeah. And they think it's at the time.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 So one series at the time, because it was like a race between the Soviets and America

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 to get to the moon.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Once they'd got there, it was like, well, we've done that now.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 We've won that race.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 Tickbox moving on.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 And another theory put forward is that neither Buzz Aldrin or Neil Armstrong

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 are particularly good orators.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And so this guy thinks that because they weren't able to like maximize their experiences

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 and they just kept on saying, yeah, it's really great.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 How could Norritor do you need to be to say, I've been to the moon?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 But it's not an arresting opening line.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Yeah.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Friends, Romans, countrymen, I've been to the moon.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 So he didn't sell a single car.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 Surely, like, even crap salesmen sell like one car a year.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 He must have been really bad.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Yeah, you're right.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 People presumably came in wanting to buy a car.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 Yeah.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 They go to a Cadillac dealership.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 That's what you're in the market for.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Yeah.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 Well, they just talked about the moon the whole time.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Yeah.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 And then they left forgotten what they got him for.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 Damn it.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 What did I mean to get from that Cadillac dealership?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 I think it was an anecdote about the moon.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 Yeah.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Yes, it was.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 But no, I think he was quite depressed after he landed on the moon for a while.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Wasn't him and Neil Armstrong were both very disappointed for a while at the fact that they'd been forgotten.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 If you Google Buzz Aldrin car, the first thing that comes up is Buzz Aldrin car board cut out.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 And there are some great reviews of it online.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 I want to tell you about a couple of them.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 Great product.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 I accidentally scared the wife as I set it up in the living room and was adjusting the support when she walked in.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 She actually thought it was a real person for a few seconds.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Is this why people didn't think he was good orator?

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 Yeah.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 Fusing them.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Yeah.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 Neil Armstrong.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 Did you know that his hairdresser sold a lock of his hair and Neil Armstrong sued him for $3,000?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Really?

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 He went back to his barber and found out his barber had just been selling locks.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 I would definitely sue him.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Yeah, I think I was a little bit weird.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 I think Harry Styles from One Direction vomited out the side of a car.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 And the vomit went on eBay for thousands of pounds.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 Oh my god.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 You're not allowed to sell biological stuff on eBay.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 Cost me a fortune and delivery.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 But we've long since venerated.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 You know, the saints bones, you know, the finger of some people or whatever.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 People have always wanted little bits of body from it.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 So it's a holy vomit.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 It's a secular relic.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 It really is true and gum has gone on eBay in the past.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 And Elvis's cup of water.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 Yeah.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 The guy sold the water but not the cup.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Genius.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 So he was keeping all these things.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 He was from ancient Rome.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 He said there's not many of these in the house.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 Who owns the hair when you go to the hairdresser and then they cast it off.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 And then you leave the shop.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Where does it...

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 I think if someone cuts your hair without your permission that is technically assault, I believe.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Really?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 Yeah, I think so.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 I think so.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 But if it's your hairdresser, then that's not so.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 Well, if your hairdresser is cutting your hair without your permission, then you need to have a good odd look at your life.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 How is it at the back of your life?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 I did not give you permission from that.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 They used to sell hair from hairdressers to wig makers.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 I still do.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 You can sell your own hair.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 There are nuns who sell their hair.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 So that implies that it belongs to the hairdresser?

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 Yeah.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 I mean, in ancient Rome, blond slaves were very fashionable. You get German and British blond slaves.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 They would be bought almost exclusively to have their hair, which you would then cut off and turn into a wig for fashionable Roman ladies who were maybe round head.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 Wow.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 That's so strange.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Yeah.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Okay, so some people who have gone on to do different things.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 Yeah.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 You know the TV show Gladiators.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 Yes.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 So I went on to...

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 I found a website of where are they now?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 Of the Gladiators.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 And there's a few people.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 One of them was Shadow and he had a bit of a bad time afterwards.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 His lowest point was he was arrested for attempting to use an elderly person's bus pass despite being 43 years old.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 That was his lowest moment.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 Yeah, he sadly had like a drug addiction, but he's got through it now and he's a rehabilitation counselor.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Good.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 There was three members of the Gladiators team in the 2000 movie Gladiator.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Really?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Really?

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 But isn't that just amazing?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Did they misunderstand the job up?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 They're getting the gang back together.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Turning out with a huge pewdial stick.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 So that pillows would either end.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 That's amazing.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Yeah.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 Guys, stop demanding.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 I'd travel later.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 There's nothing existing in ancient Rome.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 Yeah.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Rockets, Rio and Rebel.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 I don't even remember that thing.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Rockets.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 I remember Rebel.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 I don't remember Rocket.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 It was Rocket.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 Isn't he a salad?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 What?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 It's some stuff about salesmen because that's what Buzz became.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 There was a survey done in America.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 They took a load of unpleasant things and they asked people whether you preferred this unpleasant thing or Congress.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 And you mean American Congress, not sexual Congress?

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 Yes.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Okay, cool.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 I couldn't do the same thing in some cases, I suppose.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 No, I suppose so.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 But then you would probably be fired for impropriety at work.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Yeah, quite.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 And if you're Bill Clinton.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 So they were given use car salesmen or people in Congress.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 And 32% of people preferred Congress and 57% of people preferred use car salesmen.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 Wow.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 But that's a bit of a strange thing to ask because it's do you prefer them in the abstracts?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Yeah, it is.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Would you rather, you know, have one to supper?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 Exactly.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 I'll give you a list of some of the other things that they gave.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Will you prefer it?

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 People preferred all of these things to Congress.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Okay.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Root canal surgery, head lice, the rock band nickel back.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Wow.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 That was quite close.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 That is extreme.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 That is a real colonoscopies, traffic jams, cockroaches, Donald Trump, France, Genghis Khan,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 and Brussels sprouts.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Genghis Khan is my favourite.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 That's amazing.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 What do you prefer?

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Congress or a 13th century warlord from Hong Kong?

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 Yeah.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 People are really hating Genghis Khan these days, really.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Exactly.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 You know what?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 I think we should let it lie now with Genghis Khan.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 Do they do any combos?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 So do they say would you rather have Congress or a colonoscopy from Genghis Khan?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Use car salesmen.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Yeah, I don't know anything about them.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 No, except the generally unpopular.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 That's just the trope, isn't it?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 Because Matilda's dad is one, isn't he?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Yeah.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 Yeah.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 It was a use car salesman.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Or they knew cars.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 It was a Buzz Aldrin.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 I said Buzz Lightyear.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 You did.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 That's a fantastically weird.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 I actually kept on moving Buzz Lightyear.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 Yeah.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 Yeah.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 And he was a bit annoyed about that.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Was he?

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Yeah.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 Buzz Lightyear was furious.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Yeah.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 Not being associated with Buzz Aldrin.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Yeah.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Buzz Lightyear has been to infinity and beyond.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 And Buzz Aldrin's just gone as far as the moon.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 I can totally understand.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 All right, moving on to our final facts, which is from you, James.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Okay.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 My fact this week is also from Greg's book.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 Right.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 Excellent book.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 And it is about the Catholic sect called the Cathars.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 And the Cathars get their name from the fact that they are thought to be pure, like Catharsis.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 But during the Middle Ages, some people thought that they got their name Cathars from the fact that they like to kiss a cat's ass.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 If they did like to do that is understandable that people assumed that was where the name came from.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 I don't think they did like to do it.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 So just making that clear.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 It was said that they did, but of course.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 Was that just rumour mongering by a rival sex?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 It was rumour mongering amongst the whole of the Catholic church, really, because everyone hated them.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Why did everyone hate them?

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 They were very popular in the South of France at the time.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 But they had different views to the rest of the Catholic church.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 One of the main ones being that there were two gods, one good one and one evil one, like a satan and a normal god.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 Right.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 And that was something that was completely thought to be a terrible thing by the Vatican.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 And so they tried to put them down in any way they could.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 And it wasn't just by killing them, it was also by saying that they like to kiss Catharsis.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Would you rather be killed or would you rather I told you you like to kiss Catharsis?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Which would prefer Congress or Congress with a Catharsis?

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 They were.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 So it was also spread, I think, that they were sodomites, wasn't it?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Which was really unfair.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 That was like the most common accusation that was leveled at them.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 Because they didn't like, I think sex from the front was how I read and scribed somewhere.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Because they thought all sex to procreate was sinful.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 Because I think they thought that bringing anything into a world that was so full of sin was not a good thing.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 So people just went, well, if you're not having sex from the front, you must be doing it from the back.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 And we're against that.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 So.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 In fact, I was wondering, because I came across this researching your fact where the word "boga" comes from.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 To Bulgaria.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Yes, I think it was either Catharsis or there was another sex that was similar in Bulgaria.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 The Boga Mills was it?

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 Yeah.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 And they were the same.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 They were like, we're so pure, we don't believe in having sex to procreate.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 And so everyone went, well, that must mean that you're having anal sex.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 And that's where we get Boga.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Wow.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Yeah.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 I did not know this.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 It's an interesting time as well.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Because they're sort of around the 1200s, 1300s and so forth.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 And so they are kind of, they're this hot new sex that's gaining momentum.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 Hot sex.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 Hot sex.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 They seem to be quite an ancient sex as well.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 They suddenly they gain momentum.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Yeah.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 And I think they end up being a bit of a threat to the Catholic.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 Yeah.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 And so the Catholic church use both violence, horribly murdering all of them.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 And then also propaganda.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 Got the best way.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Yeah, the best way to, you know, destroy someone's credibility is to basically just...

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 And honestly, really did just read an advert that said hot new sex.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 And then it was next to an advertising hot new sex.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 And they got confused between the two.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 And one was an anal sex ad.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 One was a...

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 What kind of magazines do you read?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 I read and I...

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 So I don't know if this is true of the Cathars.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 There was one blog that said it was true of the Cathars.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 And it was definitely true of the Maniqueians, which were quite similar, also dualistic sex.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 They believe that there were good heavenly particles that were trapped in plants and trees.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 And they thought that the way we could get the good heavenly particles to go back up to heaven,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 it was our human juicy to eat plants and trees.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 And then expel their heavenly air by farting and burping.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 And by every time you farted or you burped, then that was sending the good particles back up to heaven where they belonged.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 So you were doing your godly duty.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Would you fart in the direction of heaven?

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Maybe you had to, yes, stick your bum in the air.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 Maybe that's where the other rumours came around.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 Our farter who art in heaven.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 It would be that name.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 Wow.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 It's like an interesting bunch. Yeah. They had quite good gender roles, didn't they?

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 They thought that you would be reincarnated all the time.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 But they thought the men could be reincarnated into women and women could be reincarnated into men.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 So they didn't really see any difference between the two sexes.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 Yeah, because this is a period in history where women get a bum deal.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 I think it was a cat that were getting a bum deal.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 Exactly.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 It's Eve who is responsible for the fall.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 Adam was just like a slightly clumsy human who will, you know, a bit taken in, but Eve is the one who gets punished.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 So she has a menstrual cycle given to her and pain and during childbirth.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 Yeah.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 It's a kind of a slightly misogynistic theology.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 We took all the flak.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 But the ultimate villain in the Bible story.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 So yeah, Adam was okay. He was kind of evil.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 But obviously the real bad guy in Genesis was a snake.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 According to most people, but there was a question set called the offites.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 They were snake worshipers and they actually believed that the snake was a good guy because God was trying to withhold from Adam and Eve the truth and wisdom about the world.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 And the snake was there and like offered the apple and said look and revealed wisdom and truth to them.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 The equivalent of the Eucharist was they'd arranged bread on a table and then they'd have to charm a snake and lure it to the table.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 And then they'd kiss the snake and then they'd eat the bread.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 So that could be what we were doing in church.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 The first thing the snake doesn't say, well, first of all, it sounds like a euphemism. It doesn't sound like a very good thing to be doing.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Maybe that's why the snake died out and did make it as well.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Just take to this lovely eel wearing mascara instead.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 But in America at the moment that there are sort of, I think there are kind of cults or maybe cults, but sort of like extreme Christian sex.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 What they do to snake charming and snake worship I think in the deep self.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 For the same reason.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 I think that's where that comes from.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 There's definitely a similar place in Greece.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 If I can find it.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 Yeah, it's just south of Macedonia.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 Hey!

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 Again, sounds like a euphemism.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 There's this thing they do on a Greek on the Greek island of Kefalonia.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 And it's to celebrate the falling asleep of the Virgin Mary which is the death of the Virgin Mary.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 And there's this village where every year a whole bunch of snakes enter the church and slither up to the Virgin Mary who statues at the front and then slither on to her hand and the snakes.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 And then slither away.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 And apparently it's bad luck if they don't do this every year.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 So before World War II broke out, the snakes didn't do it.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 And I've tried to find like a journalist who's been war.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 Because that is a massive turn up for the history books.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 Everyone thought it was the Poland thing, but no.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 It was snakes and things you learn on this podcast.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 In a Kefalonian church.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 But if anyone's been there and seen the snakes do this thing, every year of slithering into the church, then I want to know about it.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 When is it? I want to go.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 15th of August. I want to go too.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 It's not time. Cool.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Another sec that I like is the Carpo Creations.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 A second century religious sec, so I just like because they thought that you'd be reborn constantly.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 They believed that man had to experience everything that was possible to experience on earth.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 So had to pass through every condition of earthly life before we could go up to heaven and didn't have to reincarnate anymore.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 So they decided that they had to just do as much as they could.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 Commit as many sins as they could in their lives, sleep with many people as they could.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 They're always going to be good stuff, actually.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 So they just lived this incredibly hedonistic life, saying the only way I'm going to heaven.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 Sounds good to me that one.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 Is if I tick off, it's fun, isn't it?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 Well, there are a lot of things that can be done in a human life.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 And not all of them are fun.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 You know, taxes turn, that's quite boring.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 So I think they might just sort of sidestep that over the argument.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 I think it's just drinking insects, actually.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 Well, the other thing is you have a list of everything that there is possible to do.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 And of course you put the sex and the drinking of the talc and the tax return at the end.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 It's the people who lived till 120 years old who are going, oh shit.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 Well, tax returns now.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 That's an amazing bucket list, though, isn't it?

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 Everything they could ever happen ever.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 It's a more bucket list.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 Okay, kissing Katz Anises.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 Yeah.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 One group of things that do kiss Katz Anises are other cats.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Because when you have a newborn kitten, it must be stimulated to urinate and defecate.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 So it's mother will lick its anise to stimulate that.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 Really?

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 Yeah.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 That's good, isn't it?

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 I've forgotten that.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 That's really...

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 So they would know to urinate.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 If a mother forgot to lick its kitten's anise, the kitten would just explode with way of life.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 Like Tyko Brahi.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 That is a niche referendum.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 That's very good.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 There will be people listed to this who got that reference.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 You can talk about him.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 I'm not talking about him.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 He's a Danish astronomer.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 And with a silver nose.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 With a silver nose, he lost the tip of his nose in a duel.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 And Patelk, die falling downstairs drunk.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 Yeah.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 Which is amazing.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 And then one other thing about kissing the anus of a cat.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 Yeah.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 Kiss the anus of a black cat is the name of a band from Gent.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 From Gent.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 Yeah, they sound good, don't they?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 Wow.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 But that's a good name for a band kiss the anus of a black cat.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 Yeah.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 Yeah.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 I mean, it's not signing up to your label.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Maybe do you think that was a nod to the cathars.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 It's a nod to witches, I think.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 Yeah, I was going to say his demonology and heresy at the time.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 It was believed that Satan would take the form of a black cat.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 That's right.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Which is why it was believed that the kissing of the bum hole that the cathars were alleged to have done

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 was believed to be worshipping a Satan.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 I think you know that you're worshipping the wrong guy when he makes you kiss his anus.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 There's like this other sect at a drinker and having sex all the time.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Why am I kissing a black cat's anus?

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 I'm kissing your bum.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 Well, that is an obscene fact.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 Speaking of anuses, oh good, I don't have a link because I want to talk about like etymology

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 that we've got wrong and that we should start spelling things like sovereign differently.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 So we've added the G into sovereign wrongly because that comes from the Latin super anus,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 which means highest one and there's no G anywhere in that.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 And we've just assumed at some point that it's related to reigning and so we've called it sovereign.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 We should be calling the queen the super anus of the country.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 The super anus?

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 Yeah, she's the super anus.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 That we cannot broadcast.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 I am in favour of free speech.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 Can I just say as well that sounds like the best superhero ever.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 That's all this is the anus.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 I don't know what he does.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 He fires lasers out of his eyes.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 Okay, that's all our facts, thanks very much for listening.

 And Greg, what was your book again, which is out this week?

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 It's called a million years in a day.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 Curious history of everyday life from stone age to phone age.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 So it's like a history of all the stuff you do in a day and where it comes from.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 And it's great.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 That's all right.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 Thanks very much for listening.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 We'll be back here next week.
