 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast brought to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 My name's Anna, I'm joined today by fellow QI elves James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 and also special guest today, historian and horrible histories writer Greg Jenner, who has a book to plug, correct?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Yes, plug, plug, plug, it's called a million years in a day and it's out like now, and it's quite good.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 It is good, some of us have read at least bits of it, it's amazing.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I wouldn't go that far, but it's alright.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 It's above average.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I would say it's definitely sort of top 70 percentile, you know, like you know, it's a 2-1.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Okay, a high 2-1 book by it.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Okay, let's get on with the show.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And for fact number one, let's go to you, Greg.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Okay, so my fact is from my book because I am that unimaginative, and my fact is in the 1960s in America,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 there was one particular bus route that was only 35 miles long,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 but during that time passengers passed through seven different time zones.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Wow, that's amazing.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 How does that work?

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Right, so it's fairly complicated, so I'm going to have to give you probably a bit of context.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Okay.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 So this is all to do with day-like saving time, which is something we have here, of course, in Britain,

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 and it's a familiar concept to all of us.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 But it was an idea first put forward about a hundred years ago by William Willett,

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 who was a moustache old Englishman.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 He was also the ancestor of Chris Martin from Coldplay, you know, for your fans at the year.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Who wrote clocks?

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Exactly, there we go, see.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 So he put that forward in about 1909, I think, and he was arguing for trying to get more daylight into the time.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So everyone was like, "Well, this is a nice idea in principle, but it sounds very complicated, we're not going to do it."

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And then in 1915 he died, and everyone was sort of mocking him, and the idea was going nowhere.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And then Germany picked up with the idea and said, "This is a brilliant idea, we will do this."

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 They did it during the war, didn't they?

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 They did it during the war.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And it was like, "It saved them energy."

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Yeah, because that extra hour of daylight meant you didn't have to burn loads and loads of gas and oil, and that could then go to the war effort.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 When he died, did everyone miss his funeral by an hour?

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 So as soon as Germany adopted it, Britain very sheepishly went, "Yeah, maybe we should do that as well."

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And it became known as Willett Time, which is like Hammer Time, but looking with the stash, I think.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And anyway, it then spread around the world, and America adopted it, and the problem with America is it's a much bigger nation than Britain.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And so America has loads of time zones, and it's too big, and so the government says, "All right, come on, let's be sensible here.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 We're a federal nation, so each state can decide if they're going to opt in or opt out."

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Yeah.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And then the problem is that each of the states then said to the towns and cities, "Okay, you guys can also decide if you're going to opt in or opt out."

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And so 28 of the states opted in to DST, and then the various cities were then decided, "Oh, we can do what we're not going to do it."

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And so what happened is you ended up with this incredibly chaotic system. It's the point that, in Idaho, shops that were next door to each other might be on different times.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So in the same building, like you could literally go that next door to the corner shops.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 This is amazing.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 This was in 1950s and 1960s.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Until 1966, this was happening.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I just want to say, how did it work with the two shops that were next to each other?

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 It reminds me of a place I went to called Bal Hurtog on the border of the Netherlands and Belgium.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Oh, yeah, the exclave place.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Yeah, so there's loads of exclaves and the border between the two countries is really, really complicated.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And they have the lines you can see on the pavements you can see where the lines are.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 So you can like work from Belgium to Netherlands and back into Belgium and then back into Netherlands again.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And it's something like the Netherlands rules on selling pornography are supposed to be so much better than Belgium.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 So all the pornographic shops are in Netherlands and all the firework shops are in Belgium.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Even though they're in the same town, they're all put in different buildings.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I mean, I think that's a mad idea, isn't it? But I think that certainly kids in Michigan go to Canada to go drinking.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Other than this, I think it's 18, it's legal age in America at 21.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 This is, in fact, there was a golf club set up on the border of the US in Canada during prohibition as a way for Americans to be able to drink.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So the drinking club within the golf club was on the Canadian side of the border.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So you could enter the golf club in America and then you kind of wander over to the side which had a pub.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Go drinking.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 That's a brilliant idea.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 But I think William Willetts, one of the reasons people thought he was crazy because his system was quite complicated.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 So he was suggesting going forward by 20 minutes of daylight a day, right?

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Yeah, he suggested.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Which is very complicated.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I think he suggested, I can't remember exact details, but he suggested changing the clock something like six or seven times a year.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Which is just a bit too much faffing.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And also people had only just got uniform time because until the sort of coming of the railways, every town in Britain had its own time.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 I think Barth and Bristol, I think about seven or eight minutes behind London.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And so when the trains arrived, that became chaotic because people missed their trains obviously.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And then William Willetts, I know, when, hey guys, what if we all changed the clock?

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Loads enough to times.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 You know, I've really annoying dates.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And we'd all get an hour back.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 It was the railways which actually made the first time zone.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It's called railway time.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Railway time.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 It's so cool.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And all the really interesting legal implications over what could happen.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 So if babies were born at the same time, but in different places,

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 that you know, a whole inheritance could be changed because technically, you know,

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 the chart had been born earlier, therefore it's got the will of inheritance or whatever.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 So all of this happened only because of fast speed communication.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 So trains, telegraphs, that kind of thing.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 The amazing thing is, I mean, so I've going back to my original fact, this 35 mile route.

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 You had to change your watch, I think, every eight minutes.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I mean, did people actually do that?

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 No, I don't think so.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I mean, I think, you know, maybe if you were really into timekeeping.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Yeah, I bet there was a really nerdy school boy.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 But it's just sort of an amazing idea that you'd get on a bus.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And it was only 35 miles.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 It's between a Moundsville, West Virginia and Stubmanville, Ohio.

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And during that time, you would pass in and out of time zones back and forth back and forth back and forth back and forth.

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 That's cool.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 What you guys were saying about different towns having their own times.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 That was in America as well.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And in the 1870s, North America had 144 official times in all the different towns and stuff.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 144.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Yeah, and if you went from Washington to San Francisco and you wanted to be this nerdy school boy who changes watch all the time,

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 you'd have to change it over 200 times.

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 No way.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But in fairness, it's a long journey and you need to do something to take up the time.

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Of course, to not be an advantage.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 No, to be less than two in traffic.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 No, to do so, yeah, it's just watches.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 But I mean, the problem of timekeeping is a really ancient one.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And this is something I sort of tried to cover in the book of it.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Is that, you know, the ancient Egyptians, you know, trying to work out what time it was by the stars and by solar clocks.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 But back then, there was no standard 60 minute hours.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Is it true that in the middle ages, they used to, they would have, say, 12 hours in a day.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 And that would be from sunrise to sunset.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And so if it was a longer day in the summer, then the hours would just be longer.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Yeah, so that'd be right.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Yeah, they basically, I mean, there were scholars who kind of went, hey, guys, I think we should have actual equal hours.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 But it didn't really work.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 It didn't really work. It doesn't point being smug if you're stumbling around the dark.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 That's so interesting.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So when it seemed like in the summer term, the hours were going really slowly,

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 because you're waiting for the holidays. It's because they were.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Yeah.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Because until the invention of gas lights and stuff, when people actually could have artificial lighting,

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 people just went to bed when they got dark.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 How do people know how long it was? Like, how did they know in advance?

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Sand timers and water timers.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 The ancient Chinese, although medieval Chinese, had clocks that you could smell.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 So each hour was a different incense.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 So it burned down and so you'd be like, oh, it must be lunchtime because I can smell ginger.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Oh, it's a fan of times.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 What's a lunch?

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Ginger.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 So yeah, the history of timekeeping is really, really confusing.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 It wasn't until I think the 14th century that it was a Muslim scholar.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I think it's Syria.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It came up with the first equal hours clock.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Before that, it would have played out with things like women's hour.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Yes.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Welcome to women's 72 minutes.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 It still is really complicated time zones and timekeeping and everything, isn't it?

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Like, some countries have the most eccentric systems.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 When I live in Australia, they have various bits of Australia that have it in half hour increments,

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 rather than in our increments.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And some places have it in quarter of an hour increments.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 I think there's a town of 200 people in Australia, which is decided to be GMT+8 and 3/4.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Brilliant.

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So the town of Bloody Awkwoodsville, Australia.

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I'm trying to work out.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 So how many times zones do we think there are in the world?

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So if you just count an hour, they divide it along 15 degrees across the world.

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Since the 1880s, I think it is.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 So there should only be 24?

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 I think so, yeah.

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Except there are 26, because there's a little group of islands, which decided to put themselves,

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 because they did more trading with America.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 A really?

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 decided to join America's time.

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 So if you look down the international date line, it's got a really weird kink in it.

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 It's not aligned at all, because it scoops these islands in.

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Is that Samoa or American Samoa or Tonga?

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 No, it was different.

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Samoa is the one that went in 2011.

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 It decided to go back a day, didn't it?

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 So it missed out the 30th of December 2011.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Sorry, I went forward a day, but I did get an extra day on the 4th of July 1882.

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Or 1892.

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Use it wisely.

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Yeah.

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 So I reckon what would happen is everyone would celebrate the day before, because it's like a big event.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Everyone would be hungover to hell on that day.

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And no one would do anything on that day at all.

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And then the next day they go, "What do you do on your extra day?"

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 "Oh, I just stayed in bed."

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 I just love there to be like a doctor who episode that's set in the last days.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Some sort of weird quasi-universe wear.

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 That's great.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Yeah, I don't actually watch Doctor Who's, I don't know how it works, but it would be...

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 It's like that.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Like that, basically, yeah.

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 If I had that made a lot more sense than a lot of the doctors.

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Anyone else?

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Some things on buses?

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Oh, yeah, buses.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 As soon as we were talking about the start.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 So there is a bus driver in Moscow called Alexey Volkov, who is known as the Punisher,

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 because he deliberately rams people who cut him up.

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Really?

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Oh, wow.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 When you say cut him up, do you mean people who slap him with a knife?

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 I'm going to cut him up.

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I'm afraid not.

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 If you're driven in Moscow, it's like that.

200
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Yeah, it's everyone's cutting you up all the time.

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 That is a weirdly visceral metaphor, isn't it?

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Yeah.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 For just someone driving in front of you a bit close.

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Yeah.

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Going to cut you up.

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 I wonder if there's ever been a confusion in a police station on that.

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 If anyone's ever got a really long prison sentence unnecessarily,

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 for just slipping in front of somebody.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 All I do is cut him up, gaff, gaff, gaff.

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 All right, now it's time for fact number two.

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 And that is Andy.

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 My fact is that if a predator gets too close to a limpet,

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 the limpet will lift up its shell and then stamp on the predator's foot.

214
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 So cool is that.

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 So how fast does it do that?

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Because I think a limpet is being quite slow moving.

217
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 They are slow.

218
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 They generally get about a meter away from their home before going back.

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Brilliant.

220
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 That's the gousing.

221
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Yeah, it's a long weekend.

222
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And they have to get back before the tide comes in.

223
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 So, you know, why do they leave their home then?

224
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 If they're only going on meter, what are they looking for?

225
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 They are looking for food.

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 They are hungry for algae.

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 They love an algae.

228
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 The other thing is they'll stamp on your foot if you go to near them.

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 But they only have one foot, don't they?

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 They're just a foot.

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 That's all a limpet.

232
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 They are the foot.

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 But they've got the shell all around them.

234
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 So that's the painful bit.

235
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 So the muscle, the foot muscle is in the middle.

236
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And then obviously the shell, you know,

237
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 crunching down between the predator and the rock.

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Things like starfish like to eat them.

239
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Yeah, I don't think they can do it very fast.

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 But it's called mushrooming.

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Why is it called mushrooming?

242
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Mushrooms don't stamp on you.

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I suppose when they go up on their foot and the shell is around them,

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 they look like a mushroom if you're from the side.

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 But that's just a theory.

246
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 I don't know, that's true.

247
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Yeah.

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 And so, yeah, anyway, they move across.

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 They go commuting basically for algae.

250
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And they move across very, very slowly.

251
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And they have this tongue called a radula.

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Which they scrape over the rock.

253
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And it's got 1,920 teeth on it.

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Yeah, with hardened with iron compounds.

255
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Basically, if these things ever decide to grow bigger, we are stuffed.

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 The compound is called girthite, I think.

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Is it?

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Named after girthite, the author.

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Right.

260
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Well, it's quite a long story.

261
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So it was named by a guy called George Lentz,

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 who was a friend of girthite.

263
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And if you read any books, it says that it was named in his honour.

264
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Yeah.

265
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 But actually, these two guys fell out quite early.

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 He introduced Lentz to his sister.

267
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And we don't know, his sister was married.

268
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And we don't know what happened.

269
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 But then a little bit later, Lentz was kicked out of the court of Vimer.

270
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And then later on, Lentz then named this mineral after girthite.

271
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 But it says it's in his honour, but these two didn't get on.

272
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And so I think that it was named against him because he didn't like him.

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And it's this thing which is found in the tongue of Olympia.

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 But it's also found in mud.

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And I think he was like literally making his name mud.

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Nice.

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Good theory.

278
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 It's a limpit then.

279
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Limpits.

280
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 They're commutes.

281
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Sounds thrilling.

282
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Yeah, it is.

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 But doesn't algae come to them?

284
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 No.

285
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Right.

286
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Well, in a way, yes.

287
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 I think they filter water through their gills.

288
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 But they do also definitely go across the rocks in search of food.

289
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Very, very slowly.

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 They also migrate.

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Limpits.

292
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 How far?

293
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Not very far.

294
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 A few metres.

295
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 About a metre, yeah.

296
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 But in the winter.

297
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Do they go south?

298
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Do they go south for winter?

299
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Three metres.

300
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 They move up the shore.

301
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 So it depends which direction the shore is.

302
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 If you ever see a flock of limpits in a V shape, that's my greatest.

303
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 It's for better aerodynamics than it is.

304
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 So when they go, they leave a trail of mucus behind them.

305
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Right.

306
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And then they go across scraping the rock with their tongue and getting all the algae up off the rock.

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 But then the mucus they leave behind them actually encourages more algae to grow on it.

308
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 But that's basically farming.

309
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 They are encouraging more food to grow in the path they have been in.

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Oh, yeah.

311
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Yeah.

312
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 So not only is it quite advanced farming.

313
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 If they were to eat it, are they in close?

314
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Well, it's just in close.

315
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Come on, man.

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 This does, is it?

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 So they do get subsidies from the EU.

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Do they have a butter mountain?

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 An algae mountain.

320
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Right.

321
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Here's a question.

322
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And you may know the answer to it.

323
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 I'm going off topic here.

324
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 But how many bacteria would you have to have?

325
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Before you could see them in a lump.

326
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 What would a mountain of bacteria look like?

327
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 It would look like a lot of pus, basically.

328
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Really?

329
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 But how do you know that?

330
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Just before we get onto that.

331
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 How do you know that?

332
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Do you have anything that would look like a mountain of pus?

333
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I think I might have read that in one of XKCD's things.

334
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Everyone in the book or on their website.

335
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I would surely it would depend on the kind of bacteria.

336
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Some of it.

337
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Yeah, and some things.

338
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 All of the same.

339
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 No, it would look like a big shimmery silvery greenish bluish.

340
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 So let the blob come from like classic fighting the movies in the 60s or whatever.

341
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 But I mean James, I think I've actually done some research on this.

342
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 I think I've said this before.

343
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 The blob is based on a real police report.

344
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 I might have said this before, actually.

345
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Really?

346
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Yeah.

347
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 It was based on a police report in America in the 1950s about a mysterious blob.

348
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Would you turn out to be a giant cluster of bacteria?

349
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 If you haven't seen the blob, it's such a good film.

350
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 It's got Steve McQueen in it.

351
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Yeah.

352
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 A really, really young Steve McQueen.

353
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And the blob eats everyone.

354
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Oh.

355
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Spoiler alert.

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Spoiler alert.

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 So just swallowed things up and digested them.

358
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Yeah.

359
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 There's a great bit where a farmer gets hungry with it and fires a gun into it.

360
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I bet it doesn't work.

361
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Doesn't work.

362
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Doesn't work.

363
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 It just eats the bullets and gets a fraction bigger.

364
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Again, guys, spoiler alert.

365
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Sorry.

366
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Come on.

367
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 We were talking about bacteria.

368
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Yeah, there's a bacteria that you can see, I think.

369
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 The biggest bacterium, I think, might be nicknamed Conan the bacterium by the most papers.

370
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And I think it's bigger.

371
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Is it visible to the naked eye?

372
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 I think it is.

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Just one of them.

374
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 I believe so.

375
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 We've mentioned in one of our books that bacteria can get viruses.

376
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Viruses can get viruses.

377
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 And the viruses can get viruses.

378
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Big viruses can get some more ones.

379
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 They found a big virus.

380
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 It was in a cooling tower somewhere in the UK, I think.

381
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And it was a massive, massive virus.

382
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And then they found another one.

383
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And it was orbiting the original virus.

384
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And it's called Sputnik.

385
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 They called it.

386
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Really?

387
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Wow.

388
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 They get it might be a newspaper nickname.

389
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 I don't know.

390
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Especially like a satellite virus.

391
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Yeah.

392
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Just going round and round it.

393
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 If you dropped a load of bacteria out of a plate.

394
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Yeah.

395
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 How much a blobsworth?

396
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Yeah, a blobsworth, say.

397
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Would they fall?

398
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Or would the air currents be enough to just keep them up there forever?

399
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Oh, interesting.

400
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 That's what a cloud is, Andy.

401
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Just a load of bacteria.

402
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Yeah.

403
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Well, a cloud needs something for the water droplets to nucleate around.

404
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And sometimes that would be bacteria, originally.

405
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Yeah.

406
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 I imagine.

407
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 It would usually be like dust or sand.

408
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 But I bet it could work with bacteria.

409
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 They've just done a trial of cloud seeding.

410
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Or they've done a study of studies of cloud seeding.

411
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Which is where you drop a little divide in crystals from a plane.

412
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And then those are the tiny, tiny crystals which the water droplets form around

413
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 and then you get rain.

414
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 No.

415
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And they found that it does have a small positive effect.

416
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 They don't think that it's currently good enough to deliberately do anything to weather.

417
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Yeah.

418
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Like you could probably make a difference, but it's not reliable enough.

419
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Yeah, you can't just wake up.

420
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 It's a sunny day.

421
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 That was me.

422
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 That was my cloud seeding.

423
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 We did cloud seeding just before some of this year.

424
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And we were very proud to report it to be that barbecue summer.

425
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Can you tell we haven't done any limpit research?

426
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 I've got lots of limpit research.

427
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Let's hear this one.

428
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 I'm keen to talk about limpits.

429
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Limpits are all, there's basically no such thing as a limpit.

430
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 It was just good.

431
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Yeah.

432
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 So limpits don't really exist.

433
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I think they do.

434
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 I think they don't.

435
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Because it's just a name for aquatic snails with basically conical shells.

436
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 That's all it is.

437
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 It's a very informal term.

438
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Lots of different things that we call limpits come from different filers.

439
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 There was a thing called a common limpit, isn't it?

440
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 I think.

441
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Yes, there is.

442
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And that'll be a specific speech.

443
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And that's very informal.

444
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 That's a way of jeans.

445
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Yeah.

446
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 It doesn't take issues off when it comes in.

447
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 The Wikipedia describes limpit.

448
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 It's exactly how I've just described it.

449
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 It's exactly how I've described it.

450
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Because this is where I got it.

451
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 You missed off the bit that it adds.

452
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 So a limpit is a commonly implied aquatic snails with shells broadly conical in shape,

453
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 rather like the conical Asian hat.

454
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Which I've never seen Wikipedia open with a similarly.

455
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Nora slightly racist similarly.

456
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 What's the conical Asian hat?

457
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 You know if you took a slightly racist picture of someone from Asia from the 1950s.

458
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Yeah.

459
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And they'd be like a rice farmer with their hat.

460
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Oh, really?

461
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 A conical.

462
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 It brought lots of shade.

463
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Yeah.

464
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Because if you're working outdoors as a rice farmer, then that keeps the sound of your head.

465
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Yeah.

466
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 So your so starfish eat limpits, didn't they?

467
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Or try to.

468
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 They do.

469
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Sometimes eat things.

470
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 They sort of make their stomach go to them, I think, rather than them going to their stomach.

471
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 So I think starfish expel their stomachs out of themselves and then swallow them up into their stomach.

472
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 So I guess like a limpit when it's trying to defend itself might stamp on a starfish stomach.

473
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Is that what it does?

474
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 I think it might do.

475
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Yeah.

476
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 I assume there are starfish stopped by the stomach somewhere by a limpit.

477
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Have you heard of starfish wasting disease?

478
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 No.

479
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Yeah, it's very sad.

480
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 It's a disease which is kind of getting a bit bigger at the moment and it basically gets starfish to waste themselves by ripping their own arms off.

481
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 What?

482
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Yeah.

483
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 They rip their own arms off.

484
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Yeah.

485
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 How do they rip off the last arm?

486
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 The arms continue to crawl around for a while after they rip them off.

487
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 It's pretty creepy.

488
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Maybe they all gang up and rip the last one off as well.

489
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Did I hear on my podcast?

490
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Or maybe an episode of Kiwai about a plant that's so painful when you touch it, a guy shot himself.

491
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Oh yeah.

492
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Oh, it's a metal.

493
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 It's so painful, you just can't even tolerate living anymore.

494
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Yeah.

495
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Maybe that's how it works.

496
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 But didn't he use it accidentally as a loop paper?

497
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 He did.

498
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 He's in Australia.

499
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 This is a reporting Australian geographic.

500
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And yeah, it stings so much it's like being electrocuted.

501
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 He electrocuted on the bump.

502
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Yeah.

503
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 It's horrible.

504
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 He picked it up, wiped himself and in so much pain he shot himself.

505
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Wow.

506
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Well, speaking of people who've electrocuted their bombs, that's reminded me of one of my favourite ever stories in history.

507
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 And it was a famous guy actually.

508
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 So this is Alexander von Humboldt.

509
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Oh yeah.

510
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Oh yeah.

511
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 He might have heard him.

512
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 He was mega famous.

513
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 He was like a proper famous.

514
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 He was a polymurf and exactly.

515
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Yeah.

516
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Enlightenment scholar.

517
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Proper Prussian chap.

518
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 He has, does he have more things named after species named after than anyone else?

519
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Really.

520
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 I think he's got a lot.

521
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I think he's got a lot.

522
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I wouldn't sound like it would be more, but I'm not sure.

523
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 He did loads of research in South America.

524
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And in his 20s, he got really obsessed with electricity because it was kind of galvanic.

525
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 He had just been electrocuting stuff and everyone was going, "Electricity is the new thing."

526
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And so one day, he and his assistant were sort of wondering, "I wonder what electricity does to dead things?"

527
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 And they found, I think, a dead bird and he reanimated it.

528
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And with electricity, it came back to life for 10 minutes and he went, "Oh, amazing, brilliant.

529
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 That's electricity.

530
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 He can revive the dead."

531
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 It probably died of heart disease or something and it restarted the heart and the heart was bleeding.

532
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Oh, maybe it was a sleep.

533
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 [laughter]

534
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Just woke it up.

535
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 But having electrocuted the bird, he then thought, "Well, electricity is clearly amazing.

536
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I wonder what else I can electrocute.

537
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 I know myself."

538
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And so he put one electrode in his mouth and then he inserted the other one into his anus.

539
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And then electrocuted himself.

540
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And one of my favourite ever quotes in history is his description of the outcome.

541
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 He put about four inches into his rectum and he described it as this.

542
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 The introduction of a charge into the armatures produced nauseating cramps and discomforting stomach contractions.

543
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Then abdominal pain, the severe magnitude, followed by involuntary evacuation of the bladder.

544
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 What struck me more is that by inserting the silver more deeply into the rectum.

545
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 [laughter]

546
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Having evacuated my health, I thought, "I'd just do that further in."

547
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 More deeply into the rectum, a bright light appears behind both eyes.

548
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 So he basically went, "Wow, this is really painful and I've pissed myself.

549
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 But what if I keep going?"

550
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And then he just basically had to sort of blind this behind his eyes.

551
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 That is a scientist.

552
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And then what about when he went deeper?

553
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 [laughter]

554
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 I see what you mean.

555
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 It's like he saw a bright light.

556
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Yeah.

557
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I was kind of picturing lasers coming out of his eyes.

558
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 [laughter]

559
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 But I think what he's describing is basically just like a flash of electricity.

560
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 You can find it like, you know, like a pure blinding.

561
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And the lovely thing is that that input him off electricity at all.

562
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 He then went to South America and did various research where he came across, I think, an electric eel.

563
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 And the first thing he did shove it up his ass.

564
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Thankfully he didn't do that, but he did pick it up and go, "Zah!"

565
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 All right, you try.

566
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Gave it to his assistant, he went, "Zah!"

567
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And gave it back to him, and they'd electrocute themselves all day long.

568
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 We were just testing how paper and watch to be an electric eel.

569
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 They used to put eels up horses, bumps, didn't they?

570
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 So you would go to the market and you would want to sell your horse,

571
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 but you want people to think it was better than it was.

572
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 You put either some ginger or an eel up their buns and it would make them all lively.

573
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 You should never look a gift horse in the mouth, but you should look in the anus.

574
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Just in case.

575
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 I think the Romans also used electric eels as a cure for headaches.

576
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 I think the memory says, "I think..."

577
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Was that why I work?

578
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 I think because they definitely had eels, and they were really interested in eels.

579
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 They used to have man-eating eels in their ponds and slaves used to be thrown into them.

580
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Man-eating eels, that really, really aggressive.

581
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Well, really aggressive eels that would just eat any flesh.

582
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 And if a Roman aristocrat didn't like a slave or a slave had broken a nice cup or something,

583
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 they'd throw into the eels and eat them.

584
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Did they have cups? I suppose they must have done that.

585
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 I think of them as an empire.

586
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 I think you're not bothered about the man-eating eels, but...

587
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Where do cups, you say?

588
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 No.

589
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Are they out of aqueducts?

590
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Yeah.

591
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 We've got all this water all the way here from the mountains.

592
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Right, everyone, get your hands together at the time of the tea.

593
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 What I mean was...

594
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Oh, God.

595
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 I don't think of them having cups with handles.

596
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I think of them having little handle as goblets, things like that.

597
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 But actually, I mean, there was one very famous Roman aristocrat who was so in love with his eels.

598
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 His pet eels, actually, that he put earrings on them and painted their faces like a lady.

599
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 So, apparently, when the eel died, he cried bitterly, you know, more so than when his own sort of slaves or family died.

600
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 But when the eels snuffed it, he was really...

601
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 All the cute Roman buzzfeed pictures were not of dogs and jumpers.

602
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 They were of eels with makeup on.

603
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Yeah, eels.

604
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 That's creepy as hell.

605
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Animal defense mechanisms.

606
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 We ever talked about the pygmy sperm whale.

607
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 No.

608
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I think I'd remember.

609
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 We had talked about all those three things separately.

610
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 But I don't think we've talked about the combo.

611
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 This is okay.

612
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 So, it's really quite sweet.

613
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 It's tiny.

614
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And B is a defense mechanism.

615
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 It's another animal that shoots, like, syrupy stuff out of its anus.

616
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Which things are trying to chase it, kind of get stuck in and disoriented by.

617
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 It's a deep-colored syrup into the water and spreads it around with its tail.

618
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 So, it mixes it around with paint.

619
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 It's a syrup species, though, isn't it, right?

620
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Simply.

621
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Is it feces?

622
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Well, if it's dark and syrupy and coming out of its anus.

623
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 I always say if it looks like feces, tastes like feces, it's probably feces.

624
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 I prefer to call mine syrup.

625
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And, yes, wishes it around in the water, like a painter mixing his paints.

626
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 That's a really weird painter.

627
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Like Paci M&E mixing their paints.

628
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 So, time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

629
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 And my fact is that, after landing on the moon,

630
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Buzz Aldrin worked in a car dealership way he failed to sell a single car.

631
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 I'm not surprised if he's selling them on the moon.

632
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Yeah, exactly.

633
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 To be fair, they would have had a massive mileage on the clock as well.

634
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 And the only so one type, which is a rover.

635
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 He came home first, right?

636
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Sorry, after returning from the moon,

637
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Buzz Aldrin worked in a car dealership and failed to sell a car.

638
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Yeah, so this is, so it was in Beverly Hills.

639
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And he worked there for six months.

640
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 I think it was a Cadillac dealership.

641
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 But I was reading this is a really interesting article about how

642
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 after Buzz Aldrin and Armstrong landed on the moon,

643
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 a year later, almost no Americans knew who they were.

644
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 They completely slipped out of the public eye.

645
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 The nationwide survey is done, New York Times ran a lot of them.

646
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And yeah, one in 12 or one in 10 people would be able to name Buzz Aldrin on Neil Armstrong.

647
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 That's unbelievable.

648
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 It's weird, isn't it?

649
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Yeah.

650
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 That's so weird.

651
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Yeah. And they think it's at the time.

652
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 So one series at the time, because it was like a race between the Soviets and America

653
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 to get to the moon.

654
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Once they'd got there, it was like, well, we've done that now.

655
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 We've won that race.

656
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Tickbox moving on.

657
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And another theory put forward is that neither Buzz Aldrin or Neil Armstrong

658
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 are particularly good orators.

659
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And so this guy thinks that because they weren't able to like maximize their experiences

660
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 and they just kept on saying, yeah, it's really great.

661
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 How could Norritor do you need to be to say, I've been to the moon?

662
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 But it's not an arresting opening line.

663
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Yeah.

664
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Friends, Romans, countrymen, I've been to the moon.

665
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 So he didn't sell a single car.

666
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Surely, like, even crap salesmen sell like one car a year.

667
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 He must have been really bad.

668
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Yeah, you're right.

669
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 People presumably came in wanting to buy a car.

670
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Yeah.

671
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 They go to a Cadillac dealership.

672
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 That's what you're in the market for.

673
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Yeah.

674
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Well, they just talked about the moon the whole time.

675
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Yeah.

676
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And then they left forgotten what they got him for.

677
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Damn it.

678
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 What did I mean to get from that Cadillac dealership?

679
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 I think it was an anecdote about the moon.

680
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Yeah.

681
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Yes, it was.

682
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 But no, I think he was quite depressed after he landed on the moon for a while.

683
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Wasn't him and Neil Armstrong were both very disappointed for a while at the fact that they'd been forgotten.

684
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 If you Google Buzz Aldrin car, the first thing that comes up is Buzz Aldrin car board cut out.

685
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And there are some great reviews of it online.

686
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 I want to tell you about a couple of them.

687
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Great product.

688
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 I accidentally scared the wife as I set it up in the living room and was adjusting the support when she walked in.

689
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 She actually thought it was a real person for a few seconds.

690
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Is this why people didn't think he was good orator?

691
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Yeah.

692
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Fusing them.

693
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Yeah.

694
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Neil Armstrong.

695
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Did you know that his hairdresser sold a lock of his hair and Neil Armstrong sued him for $3,000?

696
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Really?

697
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 He went back to his barber and found out his barber had just been selling locks.

698
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I would definitely sue him.

699
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Yeah, I think I was a little bit weird.

700
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 I think Harry Styles from One Direction vomited out the side of a car.

701
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And the vomit went on eBay for thousands of pounds.

702
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Oh my god.

703
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 You're not allowed to sell biological stuff on eBay.

704
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Cost me a fortune and delivery.

705
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 But we've long since venerated.

706
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 You know, the saints bones, you know, the finger of some people or whatever.

707
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 People have always wanted little bits of body from it.

708
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 So it's a holy vomit.

709
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 It's a secular relic.

710
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 It really is true and gum has gone on eBay in the past.

711
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And Elvis's cup of water.

712
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Yeah.

713
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 The guy sold the water but not the cup.

714
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Genius.

715
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 So he was keeping all these things.

716
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 He was from ancient Rome.

717
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 He said there's not many of these in the house.

718
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Who owns the hair when you go to the hairdresser and then they cast it off.

719
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And then you leave the shop.

720
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Where does it...

721
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 I think if someone cuts your hair without your permission that is technically assault, I believe.

722
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Really?

723
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Yeah, I think so.

724
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 I think so.

725
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 But if it's your hairdresser, then that's not so.

726
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Well, if your hairdresser is cutting your hair without your permission, then you need to have a good odd look at your life.

727
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 How is it at the back of your life?

728
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 I did not give you permission from that.

729
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 They used to sell hair from hairdressers to wig makers.

730
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 I still do.

731
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 You can sell your own hair.

732
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 There are nuns who sell their hair.

733
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 So that implies that it belongs to the hairdresser?

734
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Yeah.

735
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 I mean, in ancient Rome, blond slaves were very fashionable. You get German and British blond slaves.

736
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 They would be bought almost exclusively to have their hair, which you would then cut off and turn into a wig for fashionable Roman ladies who were maybe round head.

737
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Wow.

738
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 That's so strange.

739
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Yeah.

740
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Okay, so some people who have gone on to do different things.

741
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Yeah.

742
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 You know the TV show Gladiators.

743
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Yes.

744
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 So I went on to...

745
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 I found a website of where are they now?

746
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Of the Gladiators.

747
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And there's a few people.

748
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 One of them was Shadow and he had a bit of a bad time afterwards.

749
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 His lowest point was he was arrested for attempting to use an elderly person's bus pass despite being 43 years old.

750
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 That was his lowest moment.

751
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Yeah, he sadly had like a drug addiction, but he's got through it now and he's a rehabilitation counselor.

752
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Good.

753
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 There was three members of the Gladiators team in the 2000 movie Gladiator.

754
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Really?

755
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Really?

756
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 But isn't that just amazing?

757
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Did they misunderstand the job up?

758
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 They're getting the gang back together.

759
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Turning out with a huge pewdial stick.

760
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 So that pillows would either end.

761
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 That's amazing.

762
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Yeah.

763
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Guys, stop demanding.

764
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I'd travel later.

765
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 There's nothing existing in ancient Rome.

766
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Yeah.

767
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Rockets, Rio and Rebel.

768
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 I don't even remember that thing.

769
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Rockets.

770
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 I remember Rebel.

771
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I don't remember Rocket.

772
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 It was Rocket.

773
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Isn't he a salad?

774
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 What?

775
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 It's some stuff about salesmen because that's what Buzz became.

776
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 There was a survey done in America.

777
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 They took a load of unpleasant things and they asked people whether you preferred this unpleasant thing or Congress.

778
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And you mean American Congress, not sexual Congress?

779
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Yes.

780
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Okay, cool.

781
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I couldn't do the same thing in some cases, I suppose.

782
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 No, I suppose so.

783
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 But then you would probably be fired for impropriety at work.

784
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Yeah, quite.

785
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And if you're Bill Clinton.

786
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 So they were given use car salesmen or people in Congress.

787
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And 32% of people preferred Congress and 57% of people preferred use car salesmen.

788
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Wow.

789
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 But that's a bit of a strange thing to ask because it's do you prefer them in the abstracts?

790
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Yeah, it is.

791
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Would you rather, you know, have one to supper?

792
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Exactly.

793
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 I'll give you a list of some of the other things that they gave.

794
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Will you prefer it?

795
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 People preferred all of these things to Congress.

796
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Okay.

797
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Root canal surgery, head lice, the rock band nickel back.

798
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Wow.

799
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 That was quite close.

800
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 That is extreme.

801
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 That is a real colonoscopies, traffic jams, cockroaches, Donald Trump, France, Genghis Khan,

802
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 and Brussels sprouts.

803
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Genghis Khan is my favourite.

804
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 That's amazing.

805
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 What do you prefer?

806
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Congress or a 13th century warlord from Hong Kong?

807
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Yeah.

808
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 People are really hating Genghis Khan these days, really.

809
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Exactly.

810
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 You know what?

811
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 I think we should let it lie now with Genghis Khan.

812
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Do they do any combos?

813
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 So do they say would you rather have Congress or a colonoscopy from Genghis Khan?

814
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Use car salesmen.

815
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Yeah, I don't know anything about them.

816
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 No, except the generally unpopular.

817
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Yeah, yeah.

818
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 That's just the trope, isn't it?

819
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Because Matilda's dad is one, isn't he?

820
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Yeah.

821
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 Yeah.

822
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 It was a use car salesman.

823
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Or they knew cars.

824
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 It was a Buzz Aldrin.

825
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I said Buzz Lightyear.

826
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 You did.

827
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 That's a fantastically weird.

828
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I actually kept on moving Buzz Lightyear.

829
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Yeah.

830
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Yeah.

831
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 And he was a bit annoyed about that.

832
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Was he?

833
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Yeah.

834
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Buzz Lightyear was furious.

835
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Yeah.

836
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Not being associated with Buzz Aldrin.

837
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Yeah.

838
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Buzz Lightyear has been to infinity and beyond.

839
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 And Buzz Aldrin's just gone as far as the moon.

840
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 I can totally understand.

841
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 All right, moving on to our final facts, which is from you, James.

842
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Okay.

843
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 My fact this week is also from Greg's book.

844
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Right.

845
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Excellent book.

846
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 And it is about the Catholic sect called the Cathars.

847
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 And the Cathars get their name from the fact that they are thought to be pure, like Catharsis.

848
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 But during the Middle Ages, some people thought that they got their name Cathars from the fact that they like to kiss a cat's ass.

849
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 If they did like to do that is understandable that people assumed that was where the name came from.

850
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 I don't think they did like to do it.

851
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 So just making that clear.

852
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 It was said that they did, but of course.

853
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Was that just rumour mongering by a rival sex?

854
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 It was rumour mongering amongst the whole of the Catholic church, really, because everyone hated them.

855
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Why did everyone hate them?

856
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 They were very popular in the South of France at the time.

857
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 But they had different views to the rest of the Catholic church.

858
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 One of the main ones being that there were two gods, one good one and one evil one, like a satan and a normal god.

859
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Right.

860
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 And that was something that was completely thought to be a terrible thing by the Vatican.

861
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And so they tried to put them down in any way they could.

862
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 And it wasn't just by killing them, it was also by saying that they like to kiss Catharsis.

863
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Would you rather be killed or would you rather I told you you like to kiss Catharsis?

864
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Which would prefer Congress or Congress with a Catharsis?

865
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 They were.

866
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 So it was also spread, I think, that they were sodomites, wasn't it?

867
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Which was really unfair.

868
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 That was like the most common accusation that was leveled at them.

869
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Because they didn't like, I think sex from the front was how I read and scribed somewhere.

870
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Because they thought all sex to procreate was sinful.

871
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Because I think they thought that bringing anything into a world that was so full of sin was not a good thing.

872
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 So people just went, well, if you're not having sex from the front, you must be doing it from the back.

873
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 And we're against that.

874
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 So.

875
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 In fact, I was wondering, because I came across this researching your fact where the word "boga" comes from.

876
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 To Bulgaria.

877
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Yes, I think it was either Catharsis or there was another sex that was similar in Bulgaria.

878
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 The Boga Mills was it?

879
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Yeah.

880
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 And they were the same.

881
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 They were like, we're so pure, we don't believe in having sex to procreate.

882
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And so everyone went, well, that must mean that you're having anal sex.

883
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And that's where we get Boga.

884
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Wow.

885
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Yeah.

886
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 I did not know this.

887
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 It's an interesting time as well.

888
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Because they're sort of around the 1200s, 1300s and so forth.

889
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 And so they are kind of, they're this hot new sex that's gaining momentum.

890
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Hot sex.

891
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Hot sex.

892
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 They seem to be quite an ancient sex as well.

893
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 They suddenly they gain momentum.

894
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Yeah.

895
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 And I think they end up being a bit of a threat to the Catholic.

896
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Yeah.

897
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 And so the Catholic church use both violence, horribly murdering all of them.

898
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 And then also propaganda.

899
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Got the best way.

900
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Yeah, the best way to, you know, destroy someone's credibility is to basically just...

901
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 And honestly, really did just read an advert that said hot new sex.

902
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And then it was next to an advertising hot new sex.

903
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 And they got confused between the two.

904
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 And one was an anal sex ad.

905
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 One was a...

906
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 What kind of magazines do you read?

907
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 I read and I...

908
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 So I don't know if this is true of the Cathars.

909
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 There was one blog that said it was true of the Cathars.

910
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 And it was definitely true of the Maniqueians, which were quite similar, also dualistic sex.

911
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 They believe that there were good heavenly particles that were trapped in plants and trees.

912
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And they thought that the way we could get the good heavenly particles to go back up to heaven,

913
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 it was our human juicy to eat plants and trees.

914
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And then expel their heavenly air by farting and burping.

915
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And by every time you farted or you burped, then that was sending the good particles back up to heaven where they belonged.

916
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 So you were doing your godly duty.

917
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Would you fart in the direction of heaven?

918
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Maybe you had to, yes, stick your bum in the air.

919
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Maybe that's where the other rumours came around.

920
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Our farter who art in heaven.

921
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 It would be that name.

922
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 Wow.

923
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 It's like an interesting bunch. Yeah. They had quite good gender roles, didn't they?

924
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 They thought that you would be reincarnated all the time.

925
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 But they thought the men could be reincarnated into women and women could be reincarnated into men.

926
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 So they didn't really see any difference between the two sexes.

927
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Yeah, because this is a period in history where women get a bum deal.

928
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 I think it was a cat that were getting a bum deal.

929
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Exactly.

930
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 It's Eve who is responsible for the fall.

931
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Adam was just like a slightly clumsy human who will, you know, a bit taken in, but Eve is the one who gets punished.

932
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 So she has a menstrual cycle given to her and pain and during childbirth.

933
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Yeah.

934
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 It's a kind of a slightly misogynistic theology.

935
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 We took all the flak.

936
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 But the ultimate villain in the Bible story.

937
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 So yeah, Adam was okay. He was kind of evil.

938
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 But obviously the real bad guy in Genesis was a snake.

939
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 According to most people, but there was a question set called the offites.

940
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 They were snake worshipers and they actually believed that the snake was a good guy because God was trying to withhold from Adam and Eve the truth and wisdom about the world.

941
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 And the snake was there and like offered the apple and said look and revealed wisdom and truth to them.

942
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 The equivalent of the Eucharist was they'd arranged bread on a table and then they'd have to charm a snake and lure it to the table.

943
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 And then they'd kiss the snake and then they'd eat the bread.

944
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 So that could be what we were doing in church.

945
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 The first thing the snake doesn't say, well, first of all, it sounds like a euphemism. It doesn't sound like a very good thing to be doing.

946
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Maybe that's why the snake died out and did make it as well.

947
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 Just take to this lovely eel wearing mascara instead.

948
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 But in America at the moment that there are sort of, I think there are kind of cults or maybe cults, but sort of like extreme Christian sex.

949
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 What they do to snake charming and snake worship I think in the deep self.

950
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 For the same reason.

951
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 I think that's where that comes from.

952
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 There's definitely a similar place in Greece.

953
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 If I can find it.

954
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 Yeah, it's just south of Macedonia.

955
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 Hey!

956
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Again, sounds like a euphemism.

957
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Yeah, exactly.

958
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 There's this thing they do on a Greek on the Greek island of Kefalonia.

959
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 And it's to celebrate the falling asleep of the Virgin Mary which is the death of the Virgin Mary.

960
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 And there's this village where every year a whole bunch of snakes enter the church and slither up to the Virgin Mary who statues at the front and then slither on to her hand and the snakes.

961
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 And then slither away.

962
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 And apparently it's bad luck if they don't do this every year.

963
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 So before World War II broke out, the snakes didn't do it.

964
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 And I've tried to find like a journalist who's been war.

965
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Because that is a massive turn up for the history books.

966
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 Everyone thought it was the Poland thing, but no.

967
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 It was snakes and things you learn on this podcast.

968
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 In a Kefalonian church.

969
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 But if anyone's been there and seen the snakes do this thing, every year of slithering into the church, then I want to know about it.

970
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 When is it? I want to go.

971
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 15th of August. I want to go too.

972
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 It's not time. Cool.

973
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 Another sec that I like is the Carpo Creations.

974
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 A second century religious sec, so I just like because they thought that you'd be reborn constantly.

975
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 They believed that man had to experience everything that was possible to experience on earth.

976
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 So had to pass through every condition of earthly life before we could go up to heaven and didn't have to reincarnate anymore.

977
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 So they decided that they had to just do as much as they could.

978
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 Commit as many sins as they could in their lives, sleep with many people as they could.

979
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 They're always going to be good stuff, actually.

980
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 So they just lived this incredibly hedonistic life, saying the only way I'm going to heaven.

981
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Sounds good to me that one.

982
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Is if I tick off, it's fun, isn't it?

983
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 Well, there are a lot of things that can be done in a human life.

984
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 And not all of them are fun.

985
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 You know, taxes turn, that's quite boring.

986
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 So I think they might just sort of sidestep that over the argument.

987
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 I think it's just drinking insects, actually.

988
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Well, the other thing is you have a list of everything that there is possible to do.

989
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 And of course you put the sex and the drinking of the talc and the tax return at the end.

990
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 It's the people who lived till 120 years old who are going, oh shit.

991
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 Well, tax returns now.

992
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 That's an amazing bucket list, though, isn't it?

993
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 Everything they could ever happen ever.

994
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 It's a more bucket list.

995
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 Okay, kissing Katz Anises.

996
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 Yeah.

997
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 One group of things that do kiss Katz Anises are other cats.

998
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Because when you have a newborn kitten, it must be stimulated to urinate and defecate.

999
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 So it's mother will lick its anise to stimulate that.

1000
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 Really?

1001
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 Yeah.

1002
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 That's good, isn't it?

1003
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 I've forgotten that.

1004
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 That's really...

1005
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 So they would know to urinate.

1006
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 If a mother forgot to lick its kitten's anise, the kitten would just explode with way of life.

1007
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 Like Tyko Brahi.

1008
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Oh, yeah.

1009
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 That is a niche referendum.

1010
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 That's very good.

1011
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 There will be people listed to this who got that reference.

1012
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 You can talk about him.

1013
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 I'm not talking about him.

1014
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 He's a Danish astronomer.

1015
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 And with a silver nose.

1016
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 With a silver nose, he lost the tip of his nose in a duel.

1017
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 And Patelk, die falling downstairs drunk.

1018
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 Yeah.

1019
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Which is amazing.

1020
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 And then one other thing about kissing the anus of a cat.

1021
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Yeah.

1022
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 Kiss the anus of a black cat is the name of a band from Gent.

1023
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 From Gent.

1024
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 Yeah, they sound good, don't they?

1025
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Wow.

1026
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 But that's a good name for a band kiss the anus of a black cat.

1027
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 Yeah.

1028
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Yeah.

1029
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 I mean, it's not signing up to your label.

1030
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 Maybe do you think that was a nod to the cathars.

1031
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 It's a nod to witches, I think.

1032
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Yeah, I was going to say his demonology and heresy at the time.

1033
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 It was believed that Satan would take the form of a black cat.

1034
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 That's right.

1035
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Which is why it was believed that the kissing of the bum hole that the cathars were alleged to have done

1036
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 was believed to be worshipping a Satan.

1037
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 I think you know that you're worshipping the wrong guy when he makes you kiss his anus.

1038
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 There's like this other sect at a drinker and having sex all the time.

1039
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Why am I kissing a black cat's anus?

1040
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 I'm kissing your bum.

1041
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 Well, that is an obscene fact.

1042
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Speaking of anuses, oh good, I don't have a link because I want to talk about like etymology

1043
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 that we've got wrong and that we should start spelling things like sovereign differently.

1044
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 So we've added the G into sovereign wrongly because that comes from the Latin super anus,

1045
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 which means highest one and there's no G anywhere in that.

1046
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 And we've just assumed at some point that it's related to reigning and so we've called it sovereign.

1047
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 We should be calling the queen the super anus of the country.

1048
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 The super anus?

1049
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 Yeah, she's the super anus.

1050
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 That we cannot broadcast.

1051
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 I am in favour of free speech.

1052
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 Can I just say as well that sounds like the best superhero ever.

1053
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 That's all this is the anus.

1054
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 I don't know what he does.

1055
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 He fires lasers out of his eyes.

1056
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Okay, that's all our facts, thanks very much for listening.

 And Greg, what was your book again, which is out this week?

1066
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 It's called a million years in a day.

1067
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 Curious history of everyday life from stone age to phone age.

1068
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 So it's like a history of all the stuff you do in a day and where it comes from.

1069
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 And it's great.

1070
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 That's all right.
